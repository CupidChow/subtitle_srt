[Episode 22]

3
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,940
Well...

4
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,300
how long have we been walking

5
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,780
in the woods?

6
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,039
Will we ever

7
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,180
make it out of here?

8
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,660
No idea.

9
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,490
Will we ever get to eat
the braised shark fin

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,740
at my sister's palace again?

11
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,860
Du Tianzhao, stop talking about food.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,660
It's making me even hungrier.

13
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,100
Look, there's a piece of fruit.

14
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,310
You eat it, Ling'er.

15
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,740
I'm not hungry.

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,780
-You eat it.
-You eat it.

17
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,259
You eat it.

18
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,740
It's sour.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,579
Let's look around and see
if there are any more.

20
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,980
[Datong Inn]

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,380
Ling'er!

22
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,500
Ling'er!

23
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,260
We made it to Datong.

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,620
We're out of the woods.

25
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,650
What's wrong, Ling'er?

26
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,060
Perhaps

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,970
it's all those bugs I've eaten
over the past few days

28
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,900
-churning in my stomach.
-What?

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,380
Can you still hold on?

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,060
Right now,

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,700
finding my brother is
the most important thing.

32
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
I can't afford to collapse here.

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,380
Help me up.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,980
Ling'er.

35
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,030
Have some hot water.

36
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,399
I'll go see if there's anything to eat.

37
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,860
I'll get you abalone, sea cucumber,
shark fin, fish maw—the whole spread!

38
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,980
You can actually get

39
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,780
those delicacies in this place?

40
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,800
You're just bragging, aren't you?

41
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,950
Then I'll go right away.

42
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,900
Here comes something better than

43
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,560
abalone, sea cucumber,
shark fin, and fish maw!

44
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,659
-What is it?
-Guess?

45
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,380
I'm already like this,

46
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,040
and you still want me to guess?

47
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,830
I don't have the energy.

48
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,260
Steamed pork buns, still hot.

49
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,710
Why are you crying?

50
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,100
I miss home.

51
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,340
You don't know.

52
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,140
Back in those days,

53
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,540
Uncle Liu used to make us delicious buns

54
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,340
in the kitchen

55
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,140
while my brother and I

56
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,540
played in the courtyard.

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,900
Later...

58
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,659
Yunqing came to our house.

59
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
You know what?

60
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,140
She also loved eating

61
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,920
the buns that Uncle Liu made.

62
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,880
I once thought

63
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,460
we'd all live... happily

64
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,060
and peacefully

65
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,140
ever after,

66
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,180
just like that.

67
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,620
Why?

68
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,860
Why has everyone changed?

70
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,260

71
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,460
I miss my brother.

72
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,220

73
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,790
I miss them all.

74
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,780
Well...

75
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,160
your... your home is still there, right?

76
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Uncle Liu is still there too.

77
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,060
He can still make

78
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,420
many more buns for you later.

79
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,140
But I don't want to eat alone.

80
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,860
I want everyone...

81
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,700
I want everyone to eat together.

82
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,500
Come in.

86
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,440
and deliver to the young miss.

87
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,420
A female guest?

88
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,060
Where is she?

89
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,050
She left some money and then left.

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,620
You two can stay here for a few more days.

91
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,820
She also asked me to tell you

92
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,040
that you're near the city now.

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,630
You can find a carriage to go back
on your own.

94
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,980
It's Yunqing.

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,700
She...

96
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,320
she still cares about me.

97
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,420
Shall I arrange a carriage for you?

98
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,180
No need.

99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,100
Ling'er,

100
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,460
eat more.

101
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,980
You eat too.

102
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,990
I'll get the medicine for you.

103
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,320
Drink it while it's hot.

104
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,950
Are you still going to look for her?

105
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,900
Yes, I must find her.

106

[Datong Inn]

107
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
You may all go.

108
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,380
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

109
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,540
Wait.

110
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,830
One of you, stay.

111
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,100
You, stay.

112
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,830
Come and massage my shoulders.

113
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,059
Where did they find a girl like you?

114
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,590
You have no strength at all.

115
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,860
Do it properly.

116
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,580
It's been a long time.

117
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,950
How have you been lately,
Prime Minister Yue?

118
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,420
[Three days ago]

119
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,980
Tensions are high at the border.

120
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,540
The treasury is running dry.

121
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,020
Do those officials really think

122
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,020
that by eliminating your Yue family

123
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,320
and disbanding the Qilin Army,

124
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,100
Ning will be at peace forever?

125
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,820
The Ministry of War calls for troops,

126
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,260
but the Ministry of Revenue has no money.

127
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,390
Yet, Li's army is advancing fiercely.

128
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,280
What does Your Majesty think?

129
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,270
If we face them head-on,

130
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,420
it'd likely cost many lives and resources

131
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,750
and might leave us vulnerable elsewhere.

132
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Checkmate.

133
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,500
That Crown Prince of Li State

134
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,670
thinks he's outmaneuvered me,

135
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,000
but he's actually miscalculated one thing.

136
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,980
What?

137
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,190
The once-renowned Northwest Army

138
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,620
is hidden on Mount Fengming at the border.

139
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,150
The people of Li State think

140
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,510
that by changing course to attack
Mount Fengming,

141
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,720
they can sweep through unimpeded

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,980
and drive straight in.

143
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,220
But if my grandfather

144
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,150
agrees to emerge from retirement,

145
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,820
he'll definitely give them
a crushing defeat.

146
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,280
There's something I've never understood.

147
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,980
General Du has such a renowned reputation.

148
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,780
Why has he not attended court
in all these years?

149
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,060
Grandfather,

150
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,180
this weighs heavily on your heart.

151
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,840
Are you sure you want to enter?

152
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,930
Grandfather,

153
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,280
I must take this step.

154
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,960
We led the troops in rebellion

155
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,060
[General Du]

156
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,860
to protect

157
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,380
this land and its people.

158
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,470
And now you want to enter the palace
as Emperor.

159
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,670
How can this still be called rebellion?

160
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,080
This is treason!

161
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,900
How is this any different

162
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,560
from power-hungry traitors?

163
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,500
If I can ensure peace in this region,

164
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,780
I'd rather be condemned

165
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,020
in the annals of history.

166
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,620
Later, due to our clash of ideals,
Grandfather

167
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,540
-chose to retire
-Let's go!

168
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,060
and return to the countryside.

169
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,460
-And I chose to become the emperor.
-Enter the city!

170
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,580
It's been years since we parted.

171
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,540
And we haven't had any contact since.

172
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,800
I only know he lives on Mount Fengming,

173
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,210
but I have never seen any trace of him.

174
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,500
That old man is really stubborn.

175
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,100
Of course.

176
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,020
So, how do you plan to persuade him
to send troops?

177
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,420
I'll try to persuade him.

178
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,060
If that doesn't work,

179
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,780
I'll scare him by pretending to
slit my throat.

180
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,460
The Northwest Army excels in
mountain warfare.

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,500
[Fengming Town]

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,580
This gorge is the ideal place

183
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,220
to ambush the Li Army.

184
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,260
But they're currently stationed

185
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,540
along the mountain paths,

186
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,490
with open terrain all around.

187
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,290
It's hard for us to pass through.

188
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,380
We need to make contact
with my grandfather first.

189
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,900
How can we quietly

190
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,660
get past the Li Army camp?

191
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,780
Since the Crown Prince of Li State

192
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,540
has admired you for so long,

193
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,940
Yue Chi,

194
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,900
isn't it time for you to give him
a response?

195
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,660
Me?

196
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,090
Now that your Qilin Army has resurfaced,

197
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,540
the court officials won't let it
go easily.

198
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,140
Yue Chi has maintained his
own army privately.

199
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,470
It's a crime of treason.

200
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,700
These men must be dealt with.

201
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,700
We'll use this opportunity

202
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,700
to split up first.

203
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,710
Kill every Qilin soldier

204
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,140
here!

205
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,020
Go!

206
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,500
Dugu Xing!

207
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,210
First, it can appease the anger
of the court officials

208
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,420
and stabilize the political situation.

209
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,950
Aren't you leaving yet?

210
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,320
All of you, stand up.

211
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,980
Second,

212
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,400
I can naturally

213
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,580
seek refuge with Yi Qingyun,

214
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,700
infiltrate the Li Army's encampment,

215
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,340
gather intelligence on the enemy,

216
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,270
and help you get to Mount Fengming.

217
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,500
Yue Chi.

218
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,440
I've been waiting for you.

219
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,460
When the time comes,

220
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
you, I, and General Du

221
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,540
will coordinate from inside and outside,

222
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,600
catching them completely off guard.

223
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,820
Your Majesty is wise.

224
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,500
Just so-so.

225
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,660
Li State's wine

226
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,540
can't compare to Ning's.

227
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,740
The weather is just perfect.

228
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,760
Your Majesty can

229
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,820
take advantage of the chaos to leave.

230
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,400
The southwestern direction

231
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,290
has weak defenses

232
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,420
and plenty of cover.

233
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I'll protect you.

234
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,730
It's late, and the wind is strong.

235
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,420
Yet, Prime Minister Yue,

236
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,220
you're out under the moonlight.

237
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,260
Where are you planning to go?

238
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
It's been a long time,

239
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,930
Yunqing.

240
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,150
Perhaps

241
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,160
I should call you Xue Jingguan now.

242
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,100
Yes,

243
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,940
I am Xue Jingguan.

244
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,900
The Xue Jingguan, who stands
irreconcilably

245
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,830
opposed to Ning.

246
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,220
What about you?

247
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,460
Huo Jingheng and I have become enemies.

248
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm now the Prince Regent of the Li State.

249
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,180
Back then at Xidu Bridge,

250
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,330
I deliberately spared your life,

251
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,990
but you ruined my plans.

252
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,070
Believe me, I've regretted it ever since.

253
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,140
I shouldn't have rescued Huo Jingheng
at that time.

254
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,060
Really?

255
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,180
Absolutely.

256
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,460
It's late and cold.

257
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,270
You should return to your tent,

258
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,980
Prince Regent.

259
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,770
You actually granted Yue Chi
the title of prince

260
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,970
and brought him into the military camp?

261
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,540
What?

262
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,230
Do I need to ask for your permission,
Princess?

263
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,300
Your Highness,

264
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,400
you don't really think

265
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,340
Yue Chi will defect to your side, do you?

266
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,190
If he weren't truly defecting,

267
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,860
why would he have gone

268
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,090
to such great lengths in the first place

269
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,860
to incite the Qilin Army's rebellion?

270
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,060
That was just the first step of our plan.

271
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,880
You don't understand Yue Chi.

272
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,000
He won't easily betray Ning.

273
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,420
It's you who doesn't understand men.

274
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,660
To be stabbed in the chest

275
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,440
by the very person you regarded
as an elder brother,

276
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,240
how devastating must that feel?

277
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,020
Don't judge others

278
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
by your own past.

279
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,660
Yue Chi and Huo Jingheng are different.

280
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,820
Xue Jingguan,

281
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,260
are you mocking me?

282
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,800
Do you really

283
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,300
completely trust Yue Chi in your heart,

284
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,130
without even a hint of doubt?

285
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,830
Since we're all acquainted,

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,930
introductions aren't necessary.

287
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,990
From now on, I

288
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,380
will rely on both of your assistance.

289
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,860
For all that happened in the past,

290
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,520
it was my lack of discernment.

291
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,280
Your Highness, I hope you can forgive me.

292
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,820
You're too kind.

293
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,140
I only hope that from now on, we

294
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,540
can work together sincerely
with the same heart.

295
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,420
Very well.

296
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,859
On behalf of the people of Li, I

297
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,470
raise this cup to you, Prince Regent.

298
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,720
Thank you, Crown Prince.

299
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,020
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

300
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,570
You Li people,

301
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,540
get out of Ning's land!

302
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,540
You dare to come back!

303
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,030
Prime Minister, save me! Prime Minister!

304
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,620
I'm not your Prime Minister.

305
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,590
You traitor, kill him!

306
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,420
Now you see.

307
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,900
I didn't expect her to

308
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,500
come back at this critical moment.

309
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,760
The current situation

310
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,390
is very unfavorable for us.

311
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,030
If you were Yi Qingyun,

312
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,380
what would you do?

313
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,780
Set a trap.

314
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,620
And test.

315
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,420
Several mysterious tents suddenly

316
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,220
appeared in the southwestern direction
of the camp.

317
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,710
They must be planning something.

318
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,920
Be on your guard.

319
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

320
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,100
If you don't want to feel pain,

321
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,870
why don't you try my
exclusive secret medicine?

322
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,740
What?

323
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,420
Did you hit your head?

324
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Lost your memory?

325
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,100
You brat.

326
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,660
You're still alive?

327
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,740
Cheers.

328
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,900
I never thought that after everything,

329
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,620
we would reunite here.

330
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,140
Indeed.

331
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,860
After everything,

332
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,640
you've returned to the Jiang family.

333
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,330
All these years,

334
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,240
have you been by the Princess's side?

335
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,140
Yes.

336
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,740
After the country fell, the Princess

337
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,800
found us one by one.

338
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,920
I've been working for Her Highness

339
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,720
and the Crown Prince ever since.

340
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,920
I just arrived at the camp this morning.

341
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,020
When I heard you were here,

342
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,420
I came over immediately.

343
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,580
What about you?

344
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,940
How have you been all these years?

345
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,380
As you can see...

346
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,150
I've become like this.

347
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,340
Back then, we together

348
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,670
served the Former Ning.

349
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,510
The Jiang family treated us well.

350
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,990
The imperial grace to us was vast.

351
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,140
Later, we heard that you

352
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,220
chose Huo Jingheng

353
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,740
and chose to continue

354
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,670
serving as a subject in Later Ning,

355
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,810
loyal to the new emperor...

356
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,180
and serving the new country.

357
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Some cursed you.

358
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,360
Our brothers also cursed me.

359
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,420
Actually, I would also

360
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,350
defend you a bit.

361
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,100
But when I learned

362
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,620
that you, as the Prime Minister,

363
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,100
were doing so well,

364
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,550
I stopped speaking on your behalf.

365
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,380
Perhaps for you, it doesn't matter

366
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,620
who takes the throne—

367
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,020
only your position matters.

368
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,870
But I can't ever understand...

369
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,740
how you became

370
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
like this now.

371
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,540
I just don't want to see

372
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
countless people

373
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,380
be displaced and ruined by endless war.

374
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,730
Choosing Huo Jingheng

375
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,690
didn't betray

376
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,980
the principles I believe in.

377
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,020
So, serving Huo Jingheng

378
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,370
is your idea of loyalty and righteousness?

379
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,220
He deceived you

380
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,460
with sweet words

381
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
and then discarded you like refuse,

382
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,900
turning you from Prime Minister Yue

383
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,140
into a prisoner.

384
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Is that what a wise ruler looks like?

385
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,580
You and I grew up together.

386
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,180
I know deeply that you're not

387
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
someone who craves wealth or power.

388
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,310
You must have been deceived

389
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,380
by that Huo fellow.

390
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,160
But it doesn't matter.

391
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,380
As long as you're willing to turn back,

392
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,540
we're always there.

393
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,100
We can still be like we used to be,

394
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,470
continuing to serve the Jiang family.

395
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,700
Yue Chi.

396
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,380
I believe you

397
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,980
won't go down the wrong path.

398
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,740
Sir,

399
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,700
General Pei requests an audience.

400
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,500
What's the matter?

401
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,300
He says the wagon transporting
arrow supplies had been robbed.

402
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,260
He requests your presence in the west

403
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,920
to discuss countermeasures.

404
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,140
Your Excellency,

405
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,800
the Crown Prince asks you to
come to him quickly.

406
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,280
It was you who wanted to see me.

407
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,900
You should have known it was I.

408
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,100
Why are you so guarded around me?

409
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,260
Didn't you always hope

410
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,790
that I would leave the court

411
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,020
and Huo Jingheng?

412
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,900
I did hope for that.

413
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,680
Then isn't all this...

414
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,740
what you wanted?

415
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,500
But I don't believe

416
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,650
that it'd be this easy to happen.

417
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,620
I don't believe that you and Huo Jingheng

418
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,400
would turn against each other so easily.

419
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Even less do I believe he would harm you.

420
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,220
It all went too smoothly,

421
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,420
as if...

422
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,080
it had been orchestrated by someone.

423
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,830
If you have suspicions,

424
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,820
no amount of explanation

425
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,380
will make a difference.

426
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,660
In the forest,

427
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,940
I overheard you having
a secret conversation

428
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,020
with someone.

429
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,570
Although I couldn't catch him,

430
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,620
you don't need to

431
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,220
keep up this act in front of me anymore.

432
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,180
Yue Chi,

433
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,140
for the sake of loyalty and righteousness,

434
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,330
for the Jiang royal lineage,

435
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,170
and for the promising future

436
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,580
of your Yue family's descendants,

437
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,640
will you sincerely help me this once?

438
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,020
Loyalty and righteousness...

439
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,040
are more important than right and wrong?

440
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,780
What is right and what is wrong?

441
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,530
Justice has its own judgment.

442
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,010
Right and wrong

443
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,580
lie only in people's hearts.

444
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,660
People's hearts?

445
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,140
You once held one of the three
highest positions in the court

446
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,180
and were appointed as the Grand General
of the Imperial Army.

447
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,020
If you hadn't gone to battle,

448
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,950
who should have?

449
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,660
The Huo family privately opened
the military granary

450
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,690
and robbed military grain.

451
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,380
Just because

452
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,730
that grain was distributed to the people,

453
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,730
they were innocent?

454
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,300
Yes,

455
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,460
there were officials who embezzled
in the past.

456
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,500
But under any dynasty,

457
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,780
which emperor hasn't had
corrupt officials?

458
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,500
Even if we say my father's governance
was lax,

459
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,160
he never engaged in

460
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,170
excessive construction or crazy
wealth accumulation.

461
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,540
He was never cruel, tyrannical,
or debauched.

462
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,740
You tell me what is right

463
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
and what is wrong?

464
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,500
Moreover,

465
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,890
Shuo is a thousand times better than him.

466
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,350
He's diligent, studious,

467
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,180
benevolent, and loves the people.

468
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,440
If he becomes emperor,

469
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,060
he will certainly not be any worse
than Huo Jingheng.

470
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,940
This is not a contest

471
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
about who is more talented

472
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,400
or who is more benevolent.

473
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,580
The realm has been in turmoil
for far too long.

474
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,180
There shouldn't be another change
of emperor.

475
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,700
Jiang Yunqing.

476
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,940
Xue Jingguan.

477
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,780
No matter who you really are,

478
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,090
you once knelt

479
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,320
beneath the golden Buddha
at Cheng'en Temple,

480
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,340
reciting countless sutras

481
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,200
and offering countless incense.

482
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,940
The Empress has heard

483
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,670
all your years of endurance...

484
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,290
and everything you've done

485
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,370
for the Jiang family and for Yunshuo.

486
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,340
It's enough.

487
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,240
It's already enough.

488
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,580
Back then,

489
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,340
two months after the Empress gave birth
to the Crown Prince,

490
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,060
she took the seven-year-old princess

491
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,660
to reside in Cheng'en Temple

492
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,260
due to palace intrigues.

493
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,990
But Heaven showed no mercy.

494
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,900
The very next year,

495
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
she encountered an assassination.

496
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Soldiers kept staying behind to
cover their retreat.

497
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,420
But in the end, they were outnumbered

498
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,980
and all died in battle.

499
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
The Empress fled through the woods

500
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,690
with two children.

501
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,300
Even with a large group of pursuers
on her heels...

502
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,420
she never let go of
the other child's hand.

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,220
Until...

504
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,960
I entrust the Princess to you.

505
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,000
Take her and run.

506
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,370
Run as far as you can.

507
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,060
That little girl took the princess's hand.

508
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,970
And so,

509
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,760
the two of them ran desperately
through the forest.

510
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,820
They ran... and ran.

511
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,020
But they could never shake off
the pursuers behind them.

512
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,200
Your Highness,

513
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,760
I'll go and draw them away.

514
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Sister,

515
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,320
take my Impenetrable Soft Armor.

516
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,820
It can protect you.

517
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,600
At that moment, she was scared.

518
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,220
She made a decision that she'd regret
for the rest of her life.

519
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,430
In the end, that girl survived because of
that soft armor

520
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,180
and found the imperial jade tablet

521
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,710
that the Empress had secretly
slipped to her.

522
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,610
She spent three whole years

523
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,480
trying to forget that nightmare.

524
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:10,840
[Infinite Merits]

525
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,620
But she couldn't.

526
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,050
[Jiang]

527
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,020
She decided to change everything.

528
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,150
Four years later, she entered the palace,

529
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,600
concealing her age of sixteen,

530
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,410
and presented the royal jade tablet
and Impenetrable Soft Armor.

531
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,260
[Fengyuan Hall]

532
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,190
From that moment on,

533
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,560
she was no longer that farm girl,

534
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,390
but Princess Jiang Yunqing
of the Ning Dynasty.

535
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,680
She swore

536
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,730
that she would definitely,
for the Empress,

537
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,940
for the Princess,

538
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,460
for the dead Xue Jingguan...

539
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,180
take back everything
that belonged to them.

540
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,180
I don't understand.

541
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,700
Why won't you give

542
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,540
yourself an exit from this life?

543
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,360
Why must you shoulder

544
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,890
glory that was never yours,

545
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,080
the responsibilities that were
never yours,

546
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
and the hatred that was never yours?

547
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,940
Yue Chi.

548
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,620
My life has no exit.

549
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,500
My exit

550
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,800
was built on the princess's life.

551
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,400
My only retreat is paved with

552
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
the Empress's bones.

553
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,700
She let me take

554
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,630
her daughter's Impenetrable Soft Armor
to survive.

555
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,660
She let me steal

556
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,720
her daughter's life

557
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,820
to live a life of luxury

558
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,620
with everyone bowing before me!

559
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,540
I can only

560
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,220
climb up step by step

561
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,100
to stand in

562
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,110
the position that belongs to her.

563
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,920
But do you know

564
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,840
what kind of life

565
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,440
the former Xue Jingguan had?

566
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,710
Have you ever eaten snow in winter

567
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,550
and sucked on your own frostbite,

568
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,630
just to taste your own flesh?

569
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,180
Until I met the Empress.

570
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,180
Her hands

571
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,520
were so soft...

572
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,940
and so warm.

573
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,420
She would hold me

574
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,620
and apply a cool, soothing ointment

575
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,940
to my frostbite.

576
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,640
She said

577
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,520
that all the bad things were over.

578
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,380
From now on,

579
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,020
I would be with her

580
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,620
and the Princess...

581
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,980
together forever.

582
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,880
Until the Li State attacked them.

583
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,990
Everything was destroyed.

584
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,980
I was too young then,

585
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,620
too weak.

586
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,850
I committed

587
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,140
a sin that I can never

588
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,200
forgive myself for in this lifetime.

589
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,680
So, do you understand now?

590
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,670
Yi Qingyun's poison

591
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,770
can't frighten me,

592
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,060
his torture instruments

593
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,620
can't intimidate me,

594
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,160
and your love, affection,

595
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,780
and promised wedding can't win me
over either.

596
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,360
Your kindness to me

597
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,210
is a beam of light, true,

598
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,790
but for someone like me who bears
too much,

599
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,730
I can't run towards the light.

600
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,060
I can only carry

601
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,520
the Empress's will with me

602
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,660
and move step by step

603
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,060
toward my goal.

604
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,060
I can't bring

605
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,490
the Empress back to life.

606
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,940
I also can't

607
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,270
make the little Princess look at me again.

608
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,740
But I can

609
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,820
protect Shuo well

610
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,820
and help him reclaim the throne.

611
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,480
I'll make everyone involved

612
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,760
in that assassination

613
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,630
pay with their lives for the Empress.

614
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,970
You've become obsessed.

615
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,670
Is this what the Empress would
want to see?

616
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,940
To see war spreading everywhere,

617
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,900
women dying violently,

618
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,160
and children being exchanged and eaten?

619
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,990
Do you know how much it will cost

620
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,630
to get everything back?

621
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,340
I don't care.

622
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,740
Even if it means washing the world
in blood,

623
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,600
with corpses strewn everywhere,

624
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,940
I will do it.

625
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,700
I'll ask you one last time:

626
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,660
Are you willing to help me?

627
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,460
I'm not willing,

628
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,930
and I won't help you.

629
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,260
The various powerful families fight
each other for power,

630
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,300
but no one bothers

631
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,340
to look down even once
at the common people,

632
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,420
who are like ants!

633
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,790
But Huo Jingheng is different.

634
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,100
When danger comes,

635
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,340
only he

636
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,020
dares to abolish the old
and establish the new,

637
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,220
dares to stake everything on one throw,

638
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,380
and dares to sacrifice himself

639
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,710
to protect the people!

640
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,860
So long as he stands

641
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,590
before the people of the realm,

642
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,900
I'm willing to be the shield before him,

643
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,620
the sword in his hand,

644
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,100
and the last supporting plank

645
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,820
on the boat that sways

646
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,260
precariously like a leaf

647
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,600
in this chaotic world of hunger and cold!

648
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,260
Today

649
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,500
is our final parting!

650
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,940
Stop!

651
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,810
He's a traitor.

652
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,740
Where's your proof?

653
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,020
I will find it.

654
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,580
Shadow.

655
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,860
Take the Prince Regent to treat
his wounds.

656
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,270
You want to kill him that badly?

657
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,670
Those who betray me,

658
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,530
what's the point of keeping them alive?

659
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,420
Xue Jingguan.

660
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,300
You have the least right to talk to me

661
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
about betrayal.

662
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,380
Let's not forget—it was you

663
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,780
who committed the last betrayal.

664
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,900
Your Excellency,

665
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,600
your herbal medicine is ready.

666
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,730
Just leave it there.

667
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,460
Not serious.

668
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,949
Not going to die.

669
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,980
Heartbroken?

670
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,340
Sad?

671
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,760
Feel sorry for her.

672
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,340
I understand.

673
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,739
But there's nothing I can do about it.

674
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,139
I anticipated

675
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,980
that she'd have such reactions.

676
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,020
However,

677
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,860
I didn't expect Yi Qingyun

678
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,300
would do this.

679
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,610
It seems my acting

680
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:43,920
is quite

681
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,060
convincing.

682
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,020
Any new developments on your end?

683
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,350
Surrounded by enemies.

684
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,870
Can't drag this out any longer.

685
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,230
I've already scouted the terrain.

686
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,600
I have a plan that harms neither of us.

687
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,940
Prince Regent?

688
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
What's the hurry?

689
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Your Highness...

690
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
I need to use the restroom urgently.

691
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,940
In the past couple of days,

692
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,140
many soldiers have shown

693
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,800
signs of nausea and vomiting.

694
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,830
Have you investigated?

695
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,220
We've thoroughly investigated everything.

696
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,600
All food and water

697
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,220
show no traces of poisoning.

698
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,240
Go check on the Prince Regent.

699
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,030
Yes, Your Highness.

700
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,420
You're unwell.

701
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,520
Don't be so formal.

702
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

703
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,250
Your Highness,

704
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,530
this place is infested with insects,

705
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,790
and the water is murky.

706
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,960
Everyone is suffering from
the poor conditions.

707
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,920
We really shouldn't stay here for long.

708
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,620
I suggest

709
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,200
that we move eastward.

710
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,210
There, the terrain opens up,

711
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,000
and it's upstream of the river

712
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,620
where the water is clean.

713
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,260
But moving east is inconvenient.

714
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,460
If we stay here,

715
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,140
everyone will be half-dead.

716
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,830
How would we fight then?

717
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,940
I will consider it.

718
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,500
You should rest well first.

719
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,210
Early tomorrow morning,

720
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,030
we'll mobilize the troops and head east.

721
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,160
Yes, Your Highness.

722
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,090
This is white sugar.

723
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,740
Let's use the simplest method

724
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,880
to achieve the most direct effect.

725
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,560
If you were to put poison

726
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,310
in the large pots in the kitchen,

727
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,040
it would be easily discovered.

728
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,940
It's better

729
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,460
to sprinkle emetic powder

730
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,740
in the bowls of a few people.

731
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,940
Then use white sugar

732
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,420
to attract a large number of insects
from the forest.

733
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,930
Seeing soldiers vomiting
and having diarrhea,

734
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,020
and insects crawling everywhere...

735
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,780
everyone will feel

736
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,440
uncomfortable and nauseous.

737
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,610
Why are you, an emperor,

738
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,140
so devious?

739
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,900
Before I became emperor,

740
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,260
I used to roam the martial arts world

741
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,300
and sell medicinal plasters.

742
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,020
You think selling plasters

743
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,860
was that easy?

744
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,580
Alright.

745
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,180
We people of the martial arts world
speak plainly and act straight.

746
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,780
Tell me,

747
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,340
what's your plan since you have to

748
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,030
go to such lengths to make them move east?

749
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,900
The Li Army

750
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,680
will have to pass through Red Gorge

751
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,590
if they want to move east toward
open terrain.

752
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,410
By then, I'll lead the Northwest Army

753
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,860
down the mountain and trap them

754
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,900
in the gorge,

755
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,700
leaving them with nowhere to go.

756
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:24,800
[Li]

757
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,540
You few,

758
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,290
split up and scout the path ahead.

759
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,290
Be quick about it.

760
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,580
Yes, sir.

761
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,480
[Li]

762
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,060
General.

763
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,220
His Majesty is already

764
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,220
on his way up the mountain.

765
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,020
He tripped over thorns twice.

766
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,250
Then he fought with a venomous snake
for quite a while.

767
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,220
Was he injured?

768
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,220
No, he wasn't.

769
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,980
He's so clumsy.

770
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,980
Have all the people been arranged
as planned?

771
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,100
As per your instructions,

772
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,340
we've already sent advance units

773
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,670
to scout near Li's army.

774
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,860
Good.

775
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,060
By the time that little brat arrives,

776
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,990
the Li Army will get to the capital.

777
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,980
You lot, be more nimble.

778
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,680
You're fumbling around like chickens.
