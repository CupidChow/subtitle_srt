[Episode 4]

3
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,590
Why don't you go take a rest first?

4
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,100
When Miss Ling'er comes out,

5
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,630
I'll tell you immediately.

6
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,840
I'll just take a look.

7
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,920
This woman is too fierce.

8
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,430
Don't let her escape.

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,890
Commander ordered us
to keep an eye on her.

10
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,410
She can't go anywhere.

11
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,120
But you...

12
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,080
can leave now.

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,930
Attitude!

14
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,500
You pulled me just now.

15
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,720
Don't you remember who provides you

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,940
with food and shelter?

17
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,789
If you don't provide me
with food or shelter,

18
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,070
in this mansion,

19
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,680
who else can stand up to that one inside?

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
Yunqing,

21
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,110
Think about it.

22
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,050
If my brother

23
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,930
can live a good life in the palace,

24
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,850
it'd be a good thing for me.

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,890
Alright.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
It's almost time for dinner.

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,270
The dishes here are amazing.

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,760
Let's have something delicious first.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
Pick the expensive ones.

30
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,790
Five Delicacies?

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,060
Hundred Birds Court the Phoenix?

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,070
Ling'er must be hiding something from me.

33
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,020
Could it be...

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,880
[Memorial]

35
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,630
A servant of the Minister of Rites

36
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,150
hit a stableman
of the Vice Minister of Revenue?

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,150
A leaking roof
at the Imperial College needs repairs?

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,200
The memorials from civil officials
are so boring.

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,710
Vassal kings?

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,470
How come quite a few memorials

41
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,130
have mentioned vassal kings?

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,800
The vassal kings expanded armies

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,490
and hiked taxes without permission.

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,190
[Report]

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,579
Looks like someone has arranged

46
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,290
court officials to submit these memorials.

47
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,210
Could it be Huo Jingheng?

48
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,720
Could it be...

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,630
he's trying to remove their titles?

50
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,090
Interesting.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,380
I need to go take a look.

52
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,560
Yue,

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm going to take a nap.

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,040
Don't let anyone come in and disturb me.

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,120
This is outrageous!

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,240
How dare vassal kings
hike taxes without permission,

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,970
exploiting the common people!

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,950
He's so angry.

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Huo Jingheng usually

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,740
doesn't show his emotions so easily.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,910
I believe the welfare of the people
should be our priority now.

62
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,520
We must urge the vassal kings
to reduce their military forces,

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,680
return land to the people,

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,240
and restore peace to their lives.

65
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,600
Minister Du has a point.

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,110
I second this proposal.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,280
I disagree.

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,760
Your Majesty,

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,240
if we insist on
reducing the military forces,

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,030
how can the vassal kings

71
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,750
defend their own territories?

72
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,450
Lord Ouyang, what do you mean

73
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,340
by "their own territories"?

74
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,270
There's only Ning, and Ning alone.

75
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,620
Ning's territories

76
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,020
should be protected by Ning's armies.

77
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,050
Prime Minister, are you suggesting

78
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,210
vassal kings' armies

79
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,660
don't belong to Ning?

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,190
Prime Minister, don't forget

81
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,780
Ning was established

82
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,340
by His Majesty

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,480
and the vassal kings together.

84
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,510
Are you accusing His Majesty

85
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,090
of forgetting the brotherhood

86
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,149
and attempting to weaken the vassal kings?

87
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
If the vassal kings heard it,

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,750
it would surely hurt the feelings of them

90
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,360
and cause unrest.

91
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,920
Currently, we face

92
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,190
both internal and external problems.

93
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,990
We can't curtail their power easily.

94
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,680
Enough!

95
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,210
We will discuss the matter

96
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,110
of the vassal kings later.

97
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,790
Looks like Huo Jingheng wants
to curtail the vassal kings' power.

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,070
So he deliberately
put on act with Du Tianzhao

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,190
to test the court officials' attitude.

100
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,730
Huo Jingheng

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,860
actually has some grasp of statecraft.

102
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,190
Why didn't you just propose

103
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,550
removing the vassal kings' titles?

104
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,370
Now look what happened.

105
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,890
Ouyang Wen gained the upper hand.

106
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,350
The court's opinion has completely tilted.

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,470
It's not proper
to bring up the matter again.

108
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,900
I just wanted to test

109
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,720
the court officials' attitude.

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
The vassal kings
are growing more arrogant,

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,980
but you seem quite composed.

112
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,190
Do you know

113
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,940
how many soldiers the vassal kings have?

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,280
Merely over 500,000 soldiers, right?

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,010
Man King alone
has over 400,000 elite soldiers.

116
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,310
Over 400,000?

117
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,450
Ning's court only has 600,000 soldiers.

118
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,190
If we push the vassal kings too hard,

119
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,530
and they all rebel against us,

120
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,150
with those soldiers we have,

121
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,160
I'm afraid we won't hold out for long.

122
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,000
Given the current situation,

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,010
it's best to take no action.

124
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,510
Then why did you discuss it

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,710
with the court officials?

126
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,590
The vassal kings have

127
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,340
their own spies in the court,

128
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,830
all bribed.

129
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,870
I just wanted to warn the vassal kings

130
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,740
through them.

131
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,580
As for

132
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,480
how to resolve this,

133
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,510
I still don't have a proper solution.

134
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,900
But Uncle,

135
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,010
I saw the memorials
you submitted a few days ago.

136
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,080
Everything was handled properly.

137
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,480
And there were lots of good ideas.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But on this matter

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,360
of removing the vassal kings' titles,

140
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,260
why are you so hesitant?

141
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,600
You're giving me a warning now.

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,000
So you've caught on to it?

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,680
I heard

144
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,820
you recently took in a distant relative.

145
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,270
There must be many things to handle.

146
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,440
I guess that is
what has been distracting you.

147
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,060
How about this?

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,230
I'll allow you to return home

149
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,159
to take care of your family affairs.

150
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,360
And rest for a few days.

151
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,070
Don't.

152
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,920
My dear nephew,

153
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,740
I don't need to rest.

154
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,720
I can handle it.

155
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,290
Then I'll dock your salary.

156
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,470
Rest as long as you like.

157
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,800
For each day off, you lose pay.

158
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,790
Fair and just.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,800
No, no, no.

160
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,430
Don't dock my salary.

161
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,950
If you dock my salary,

162
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,159
how am I supposed to live?

163
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,390
I have a large family to support!

164
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,240
Then how to solve the vassal kings' issue?

165
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,920
Give me

166
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,070
a solution right now.

167
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,630
I...

168
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,070
Wei Zhang,

169
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,720
go.

170
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
Ask for a leave on behalf of him.

171
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,490
Yes.

172
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,240
No!

173
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,500
I beg your forgiveness, Your Majesty!

174
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,270
Those memorials...

175
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,600
were not reviewed by me.

176
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,820
Really?

177
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,270
By whom then?

178
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,950
By...

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,320
Just keep your mouth shut.

180
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,110
By Consort Yue.

181
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,990
Consort Yue?

182
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,690
Uncle,

183
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,870
even if you don't have a solution
for the vassal kings' issue,

184
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,540
I won't blame you.

185
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,380
Why did you come up with

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,980
such a ridiculous excuse to deceive me?

187
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,710
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

188
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,690
Well, since

189
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,940
you're so certain,

190
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,570
let's

191
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,530
go to the Fengluan Palace

192
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,780
and confront Consort Yue face to face.

193
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,100
Welcome, Your Majesty.

194
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,480
Yue, serve tea.

195
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,190
No need.

196
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,450
She is kneeling at the door.

197
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,730
Consort Yue,

198
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,600
I heard although you're in the harem,

199
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,470
you care about court affairs.

200
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,140
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,190
I just heard Lord Du

202
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,880
complaining about trivial court affairs,

203
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,520
so I spoke out of turn.

204
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,760
I shouldn't have discussed state affairs.

205
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,490
Your Majesty, please punish me.

206
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,790
So,

207
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
Minister Du

208
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,850
met privately with my Consort Yue?

209
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,690
I swear to God!

210
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,549
Your Majesty,

211
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,590
there's nothing
between Consort Yue and me.

212
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,230
A few days ago,

213
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,830
when I passed the Shoukang Palace,

214
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,120
I ran into Consort Yue.

215
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm an old acquaintance of the Yue family,

216
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,460
so we exchanged a few words.

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,820
You exchanged a few words,

218
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,010
and she helped you review memorials?

219
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,670
Lord Du,

220
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,290
let's be honest with His Majesty.

221
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,810
Tell him the truth.

222
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,750
Your Majesty,

223
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,470
a few days ago,

224
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,220
Lord Du came to me,

225
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,660
asking me
to secretly review memorials for him.

226
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,320
I certainly didn't have the guts.

227
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
But I didn't expect Lord Du...

228
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,120
to threaten me.

229
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,920
Consort Yue, watch your mouth.

230
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,880
Think about the entire Yue family.

231
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,850
Your Majesty, look.

232
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,550
That is exactly how he threatened me.

233
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,160
So,

234
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,820
it's Minister Du's fault?

235
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,010
Minister Du,

236
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,450
how should we handle this matter?

237
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm afraid

238
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,180
a mere salary cut
can't silence the rumors.

239
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,400
What rumors?

240
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,510
I admit my guilt.

241
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,260
I've known Consort Yue and Yue Chi
since childhood.

242
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,240
I'm well aware that Consort Yue

243
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,390
has been influenced by Yue Chi's insights.

244
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,520
She's resourceful.

245
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,060
I was truly overwhelmed

246
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
by the court affairs.

247
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,860
So I asked for Consort Yue's help.

248
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,290
I didn't know

249
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,330
Consort Yue has such great talent.

250
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,910
How can I let such a pearl remain hidden?

251
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm not narrow-minded.

252
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,800
I want to remove the vassal kings' titles.

253
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,860
Consort Yue,

254
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,320
are you willing to help me?

255
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,220
I am just a woman.

256
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
I know nothing of such matters.

257
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,750
Minister Du, you said something

258
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,550
about the Yue family just now?

259
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,710
The Yue family...

260
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,910
Consort Yue, don't be afraid.

261
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,500
I won't make you do that.

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,670
If you truly are unwilling,

263
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,290
I won't force you.

264
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,350
I am willing.

265
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,410
Truly, without the slightest reluctance.

266
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
[Yongqian Palace]

267
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,440
Wait.

268
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,030
From the moment I returned to the capital,

269
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,690
was all this

270
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,270
a trap you set for me?

271
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,640
When did you become so clever?

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
Nephew, are you playing me?

273
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,440
You're not happy?

274
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,390
You live a life of luxury every day.

275
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,510
It's only right

276
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,600
to do something for Ning.

277
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,080
Otherwise, I might send you

278
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,510
to serve the empress dowager someday.

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,150
You're right.

280
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,720
I'll keep it in mind.

281
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,330
It's my pleasure.

282
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,730
I really can't afford

283
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,780
to offend either of them.

284
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,260
Wait a minute.

285
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,670
He went to such lengths

286
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,200
for Consort Yue.

287
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,960
Could it be that he knows

288
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,320
that guy is Yue Chi?

289
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,090
When did you start planning that?

290
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,860
Was...

291
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,010
Consort Yue's entry to the palace
also part of your plan?

292
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,270
Yes.

293
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,900
From the day I summoned her to the palace,

294
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,590
every move was part of my plan.

295
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,180
Why do you value Consort Yue so much?

296
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,260
First,

297
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,040
Consort Yue was always by Yue Chi's side.

298
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,900
Second, after Yue Chi's death,

299
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,790
the Qilin Army fell into disarray.

300
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,840
Peace has been restored on the surface,

301
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,240
but Ning is still plagued
by internal and external threats.

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,500
If I could gain the Qilin Army's loyalty,

303
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,240
the world could gain more peace.

304
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,870
That's it?

305
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,150
That's it.

306
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,790
It seems he

307
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,200
doesn't know his favored consort is a man.

308
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,650
His eyesight is truly terrible.

309
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,550
But that's a good thing too.

310
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,080
As long as Yue Chi and he

311
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,260
can get along well

312
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,200
and be good partners,

313
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,240
Ling'er won't have to be his consort.

314
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,600
Very good.

315
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,750
I'll do my best to help you.

316
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,200
Thank you, Uncle.

317
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,670
Tianzhao?

318
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Did something happen to my brother?

319
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,800
Your brother reviewed memorials for me.

320
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,190
His Majesty found out.

321
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,940
But don't worry.

322
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,740
Instead of blaming him,

323
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,150
His Majesty praised him.

324
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,750
He asked for his advice
on tough state affairs.

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
That's great.

326
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,550
It's all thanks to you.

327
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,630
Otherwise,

328
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,870
who knows how long we'd have had to wait?

329
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,440
But...

330
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,910
you're this happy about it?

331
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
Of course I'm happy.

332
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,440
That means

333
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,000
Consort Yue is in favor.

334
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,520
It's a good thing for me.

335
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,440
Right,

336
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,570
Yunqing

337
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,260
hasn't had much of an appetite lately.

338
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
She really should try this.

339
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,580
Thanks.

340
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,520
Ling'er!

341
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,500
Commander ordered me to protect her.

342
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,870
Outsiders can't get close to her.

343
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm not an outsider.

344
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,150
Commander said

345
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,880
I should be especially wary of you.

346
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,220
Your room is over there.

347
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,690
Please go back.

348
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,640
Sir.

349
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,200
I received news from the palace.

350
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,620
Consort Yue has come up with an idea.

351
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,160
They want you to discuss it
in the palace tomorrow.

352
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,040
So fast?

353
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,740
That's great!

354
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,780
Selecting heirs of vassal kings?

355
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,390
Yes.

356
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,930
To divide the vassal kings' power,

357
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,530
there's no need to strip their titles.

358
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,080
Vassal kings inherit by blood,

359
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,690
usually passing the title
to the legitimate eldest son.

360
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,550
You only need to issue an edict,

361
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,610
allowing all sons, legitimate or not,

362
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,680
to compete

363
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,630
for the title.

364
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,870
You want to create internal strife
among the vassal kings' sons?

365
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,340
Internal strife is just one aspect.

366
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,840
To weaken the vassal kings' power
with this alone

367
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,970
might be difficult.

368
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,470
The key is to divide it.

369
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,800
The more people

370
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,180
share a cake,

371
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,840
the smaller each share becomes.

372
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
Consort Yue, you mean...

373
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,200
we can divide the inheritance

374
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,670
among multiple heirs?

375
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,480
Correct.

376
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,270
And how do we select them?

377
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,980
Establish an academy in the capital

378
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,610
to educate the sons of the vassal kings.

379
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,610
Then we select heirs among them.

380
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,080
In this way,

381
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,280
to compete for territories, their sons

382
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,480
will not resist the selection.

383
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,080
Instead, they will support it

384
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,150
and volunteer
to enter the capital as hostages.

385
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,240
Then

386
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,360
how should we treat their sons?

387
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
We should treat them well.

388
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,840
Provide them with
as much luxury and comfort as possible.

389
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,320
The courses in the academy

390
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,070
should focus mainly on
leisure and recreation,

391
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,550
coupled with cockfighting and gambling.

392
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,410
Keep them entertained
so that they won't miss their homes.

393
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,210
I see.

394
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,910
Ling'er, you're really cunning.

395
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,310
How would you know
if my skin is smooth or not?

396
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
Your Majesty, what do you think?

397
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
It's inappropriate.

398
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,160
Why?

399
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,320
Although the vassal kings are arrogant,

400
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,800
if we sow discord within their families

401
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,560
and spark rivalry among their sons,

402
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,580
who knows

403
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,630
how many people

404
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,510
would be dragged into this storm?

405
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,390
It's not appropriate.

406
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,790
At a time like this,

407
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,370
you still prioritize virtue and morality.

408
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,880
Have you never used a dirty trick?

409
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,800
But I don't harm people.

410
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
Your Majesty,

411
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,920
will this plan

412
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,730
cost the hostages their lives?

413
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,440
No.

414
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,930
One more question.

415
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,440
Do we threaten the hostages with weapons

416
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,610
to force them to obey?

417
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,270
No.

418
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,450
Then we're not harming anyone.

419
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,310
Your Majesty,

420
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,260
Consort Yue has a point.

421
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,010
But...

422
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,370
Since I can't solve your problem,

423
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,870
I beg your forgiveness.

424
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,340
I'll go back to reflect on myself.

425
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,120
Well... let's do
as Consort Yue said for now.

426
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,170
Consort Yue, you shall handle the things

427
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,750
including establishing the academy.

428
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,780
Me?

429
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,670
That's right.

430
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,440
The harem is not allowed
to meddle in state affairs.

431
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,600
That doesn't count.

432
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,270
You already reviewed memorials

433
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,500
and gave me advice.

434
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,790
This is simply another important task.

435
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,940
I can't do it.

436
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,369
Modesty is a virtue.

437
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,220
You already have

438
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,069
countless virtues.

439
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,540
You don't need another.

440
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,150
That's true.

441
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,400
When it comes to practical matters,

442
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,109
Imperial Uncle has more experience.

443
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,550
It's better that he handles this matter.

444
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,630
Consort Yue, you're far-sighted.

445
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,010
Then... I'll ask Minister Du to help you.

446
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,579
I...

447
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,470
How about this?

448
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,760
I will grant you a token of passage.

449
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,960
This way,

450
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,830
you can enter

451
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,110
and exit the Fengluan Palace openly,

452
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,260
and take orders directly from Consort Yue.

453
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,990
Your Majesty,

454
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,680
I think if I frequently
enter the Fengluan Palace

455
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,400
to meet Consort Yue,

456
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
it would be improper.

457
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,720
To prevent gossip...

458
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,550
What?

459
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,900
You want me to grant Consort Yue a token

460
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,630
so that she can openly

461
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,520
enter and exit your mansion, is that it?

462
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,380
-That's completely unnecessary.
-That's completely unnecessary.

463
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,940
Rest assured, both of you.

464
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,880
I absolutely believe that there's nothing

465
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
between you two.

466
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,350
Here.

467
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,700
It's settled.

468
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,530
Take it.

469
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,370
[Token]

470
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,350
Sit.

471
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,360
Your Majesty, thank you for your trust.

472
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,490
Du Tianzhao,

473
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,680
you betrayed me!

474
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,590
Yue Chi hit me.

475
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,740
Think about it.

476
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,610
It's not really a bad thing.

477
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,560
You're getting along so well
with His Majesty.

478
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,890
Other consorts can only watch enviously.

479
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,340
If you have statecraft,

480
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,100
why not put it to use?

481
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,920
When I entered the palace,

482
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,550
I only wanted to help Ling'er gain favor

483
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,030
so that her life could be easier.

484
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,140
But now?

485
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,950
I'm even involved in state affairs.

486
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,460
If Ling'er and I
switch our identities back one day,

487
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,070
how should she handle it?

488
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,590
What?

489
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,720
Switch back?

490
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,290
No.

491
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,330
That would make Ling'er a consort.

492
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,800
Ling'er is already a consort.

493
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,240
She wouldn't get used to it
if you switch back.

494
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,870
She's living comfortably in my mansion.

495
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,770
You should think for your younger sister.

496
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,220
I need to find a chance
to talk to Ling'er.

497
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,950
If she truly likes Du Tianzhao,

498
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,420
I won't force her to marry Huo Jingheng.

499
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:28,990
But...

500
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,850
I'd be trapped in the harem forever.

501
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,750
I can't be Consort Yue forever.

502
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,610
Your Highness.

503
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,330
Your Highness.

504
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,300
His Majesty came again.

505
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,190
No need for formalities.

506
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,590
Let's just get down to business.

507
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,070
Come.

508
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,060
I've picked

509
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,530
a site in the capital

510
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,520
for the academy.

511
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,400
I'd like to ask for your advice.

512
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,310
Since you've already decided,

513
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,030
we'll proceed accordingly.

514
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,060
If someone else had said that,

515
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,150
I wouldn't ask further.

516
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,970
But the idea to curb the vassal kings

517
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,970
came from you.

518
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,420
So your opinion matters more.

519
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,370
Okay.

520
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,110
Okay.

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,220
I'll take a look now.

522
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Keep up.

523
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,310
I think

524
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,390
the site you chose is good,

525
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,940
but it's too secluded.

526
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,180
We

527
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,120
must handle the establishment
of the academy for selecting heirs

528
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,510
of the vassal kings grandly.

529
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,660
The more open and grand it is,

530
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,250
the harder it'll be for the vassal kings
to find excuses to refuse.

531
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,840
The location should be in a bustling area.

532
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,750
Then establish it in a bustling area.

533
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,660
What name do you suggest?

534
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,840
So-called talent is mere pageantry
without tangible results.

535
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,730
Let's call it Rongying Academy.

536
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,510
Consort Yue, your tongue

537
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,540
is still as sharp as ever.

538
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,760
Consort Yue, when will you

539
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,980
remove this veil?

540
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,720
When I fully recover,

541
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,480
I will remove this veil.

542
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,070
When?

543
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,850
When the world is at peace.

544
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,880
Just kidding.

545
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,920
Soon.

546
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,650
It won't be long.

547
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,550
Okay.

548
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
I'll wait for you.

549
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,790
Wait.

550
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,150
Why am I actually doing this?

551
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,160
If this continues,

552
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,750
I'll never be able to leave the palace.

553
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,270
No.

554
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,310
I need to find a way

555
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,210
to discourage Huo Jingheng.

556
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,860
[Rongying Academy]

557
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,760
Consort Yue, are you here to report

558
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,490
on the progress of the academy?

559
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,350
I just have a few suggestions.

560
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,280
Let's hear them.

561
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,630
In my opinion,

562
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,480
since the academy is established by you,

563
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
it's bound to gain fame.

564
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,200
Why don't we introduce
some merchants into the academy

565
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
to provide convenience
for the heirs of the vassal kings?

566
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,960
That's a good point.

567
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,710
Introducing merchants
is indeed a good idea.

568
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,960
I happen to know

569
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,720
some reputable private shops.

570
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,920
Over the past few days, I made a list,

571
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,570
including restaurants,
taverns, and freight companies.

572
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,490
I've personally investigated each of them.

573
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,820
They are very reliable.

574
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,890
Just by reading this list,

575
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,960
even the dumbest emperor

576
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,310
would see that this consort

577
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,660
is not suitable for important tasks.

You're doing this on purpose?

582
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,740
To make me believe you're selfish?

583
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,440
Good.

584
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
Very good.

585
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,120
Good?

586
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,400
I understand what you mean.

587
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,730
What do you understand?

588
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,060
You're concerned
in the early years of the dynasty,

589
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,780
the treasury is still weak.

590
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,920
So,

591
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,970
you want to introduce
more private businesses.

greater discounts for the court.

Dog Huo,

598
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
who said anything about discounts?

599
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,560
Since these merchants

600
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,830
are so enthusiastic

601
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,340
about supporting the court's policy,

602
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,680
I certainly can't be stingy.

603
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,210
How about this?

604
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,850
I'll bestow upon them

605
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,480
my own calligraphy

606
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,110

But it doesn't matter.

It's truly imperial in style.

619

I spent much of my childhood
practicing martial arts.

620
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,820
My calligraphy is rather poor.

But...

622
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,590
it's better than nothing.

fair trade for any discounts.

Once everything is settled,

This is your first time in the capital.

the system of hereditary peerage
has been abolished,

640
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,240

customs vary widely across Ning.

658
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,880
The curriculums have been designed to...

659
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,620
It appears to be honor,

660
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,430
but it's actually a gilded trap.

661
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,720
Literary courses include zither, chess,
calligraphy, and painting.

662
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
There must be someone capable behind this.

663
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,050
The study of storybooks

664
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
and appreciation of antiques.

665
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,050
Martial courses include archery, polo,

666
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,880
dance appreciation, beast dueling,
and games.

667
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,030
So comprehensive.

668
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,110
Your Highness.

669
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,640
His Majesty came again.

670
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,480
Again?

671
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,640
Welcome, Your Majesty.

672
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,930
You may leave.

673
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

674
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,200
Great.

675
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,240
It's been so long

676
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,640
since I felt this relaxed.

677
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
The success of Rongying Academy—

678
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,790
I owe it to you.

679

Sit.

680
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,830
I can't remember

681
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,600
the last time

682
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,720
I drank freely like this.

683
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,790
The dragon robe and crown

684
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,400
feel like

685
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,920
a skin that doesn't belong to me,

686
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,720
wrapped so tightly around my body.

687
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Tonight, in front of you,

688
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,920
I can shed it for a moment.

689
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,680
Come on.

690
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,490
Let's drink
to our first victory in this battle.

691
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,110
I never thought

692
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,720
that one day,

693
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,310
I would be drinking with you like this.

694
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,680
Neither did I.

695
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Who would've thought the red thread

696
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,590
of the God of Matchmaking
would tie you and Ling'er together?

697
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,880
And now I have to work hard

698
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
to handle court affairs for you.

699
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,480
Tell me,

700
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,350
if two years ago,

701
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,340
I hadn't ascended the throne,

702
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,910
what would it be like now?

703
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,190
You speak as if you never wanted it.

704
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
Actually, I didn't.

705
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,480
Back then, all I wanted
was to roam the world with a sword.

706
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,420
That sounds like you're showing off.

707
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,800
If you didn't want to be the emperor,

708
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,860
where did this dragon robe come from?

709
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,520
At that time,

710
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,440
the capital had already fallen.

711
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,810
The Volunteer Army

712
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,500
turned against each other over who

713
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,140
should ascend the throne.

714
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,240
No one could reach a consensus.

715
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,510
In the end,

716
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,310
they pushed me,
someone from the martial arts world,

717
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,790
onto the throne.

718
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,330
If you really didn't want it,

719
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,130
you could have just walked away.

720
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,170
But you didn't.

721
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,120
So deep down,

722
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,350
you did want it.

723
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,570
I fought my way here

724
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,350
only because I wanted

725
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,240
the war to end.

726
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,680
On my way to the capital,

727
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,520
I saw too many faces that looked the same—

728
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,880
faces without light

729
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,790
or hope.

730
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,050
They lived precariously.

731
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,820
One moment they might find
half a loaf of bread,

732
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,780
but the next—a blade through the belly.

733
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,800
But life shouldn't be like that.

734
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,680
Don't hit me.

735
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,750
Please.

736
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,240
Don't be afraid.

737
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,310
Where is your family?

738
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,270
They're gone.

739
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,030
I'll take you home.

740
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,830
You're not here to kill me?

741
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,680
Don't worry.

742
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,710
I will keep you safe.

743
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,500
I wish children could
get the chance to grow up,

744
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,830
and the elderly could
spend their final days at home.

745
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,930
Isn't that how life should be—
simple and ordinary?

746
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,740
If I left,

747
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,530
the Volunteer Army would split again,

748
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,520
and countless lives would be lost.

749
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,110
In this capital,

750
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,630
there are many hidden monsters.

751
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,290
Did you know what you'd

752
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,240
have to give up for the throne?

753
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,040
I did.

754
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,880
My freedom,

755
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,450
my happiness,

756
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,740
and the most genuine

757
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,140
and important part of myself.

758
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,550
I'd be trapped here

759
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,920
for the rest of my life.

760
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,170
I'd battle with

761
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,570
countless schemes and intrigues forever.

762
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,720
But someone once told me—

763
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,690
for the sake of a beautiful world,

764
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,600
for the peace of the people,

765
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,790
bear

766
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,350
the burden of the court,

767
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,880
and face every problem without regret.

768
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,620
Is it worth it?

769
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,440
Yes.

770
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,880
Is there any wine left?

771
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,090
Are you alright?

772
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,130
Has it triggered your old injury?

773
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,980
How does he know
about my old injury on my chest?

774
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,090
Does he know who I am?

775
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,750
Here.

776
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,070
Be careful.

777
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,590
What old injury? You must be mistaken.

778
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,150
Yue Chi.

779
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,200
Consort Yue.

780
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,070
I remember now.

781
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,440
Yue Chi is already dead.

782
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,000
I shot

783
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,620
that arrow myself.

784
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,750
At Dayan Pass.

785
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,920
But I missed.

786
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,260
Sit.

787
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,630
Your archery skills

788
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,770
aren't that impressive after all.

789
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,120
I did it on purpose.

790
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,430
Why?

791
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,800
I valued his talent.

792
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,390
I couldn't bear to see him die.

793
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,720
I didn't expect

794
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,940
that he was so frail.

795
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,400
I deliberately aimed
away from his vital parts

796
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,740
and used only 30% of my strength,

797
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,310
yet he still died.

798
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,640
Too fragile.

799
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
I'm not...

800
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,430
Not what?

801
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,030
You're drunk.

802
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,810
You must have misheard.

803
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,890
Who do you think you're looking down on?

804
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,780
So...

805
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,080
that's what happened.

806
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,970
Back then on the battlefield,

807
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,730
I tricked him quite a few times.

808
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,370
But in the end, he was the one
who let me live.

809
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,000
I do owe him a favor.

810
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,160
Consort Yue,

811
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,010
actually,

812
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,340
I did it for you too.

813
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,790
God, not now. Say whatever you want

814
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,590
after Ling'er and I switch back.

815
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,020
For your sake,

816
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,429
I can accept

817
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,580
everything around you,

818
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,199
including your brother.

819
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,040
If you know where he is,

820
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,960
tell him to show up openly.

821
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,500
I promise

822
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,770
I will keep him safe.

823
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,710
My previous promise remains unchanged.

824
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,060
He can still
be the prime minister of Ning,

825
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,610
fulfilling his ambitions.

826
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,420
When I reorganize Ning,

827
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,929
I'll still appoint you
as the prime minister!

828
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,480
That's just drunk talk.

829
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,260
I'm the former prime minister
from the last dynasty.

830
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,900
If I serve you in your dynasty,

831
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,429
I'd be a walking target.

832
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,600
I have no interest in seeking death.

833
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
What did you say?

834
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,969
I...

835
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,630
am deeply moved.

836
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,860
I thank you on behalf of my brother.

837
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,750
Tonight's wine is far too strong.

838
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,890
I'll ask someone here to serve you.

839
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,510
I can't stay here with him

840
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,710
like this any longer.

841
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,070
Ling'er and I must switch back
as soon as possible.

842
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,840
But...

843
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,160
I should ask Ling'er first.
