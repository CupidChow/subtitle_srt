[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,930
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,289
Your Highness,

4
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,900
you fell into the water and got hurt.

5
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,920
Why didn't you say it when
the imperial physician came yesterday?

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,430
Let's not make a fuss about it.

7
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,070
Actually,

8
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,340
I'm not afraid of people talking.

9
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,350
I just don't want Brother to worry.

10
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,470
And I don't want His Majesty or my brother to think

11
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,039
I'm someone who

12
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,200
always needs protecting and still

13
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,840
ends up getting hurt.

14
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,840
But you are already hurt.

15
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,840
You're badly injured.

16
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,370
If something really happened to you,

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,690
how would I explain it to your brother?

18
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,130
Let me take a look.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,199
Does it hurt?

20
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,510
Why are you here?

21
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,540
Consort Yue had a miscarriage.

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,840
As Emperor,

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
of course I had to come show concern.

24
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,230
Mother asked me to bring you many tonics.

25
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,250
I've given them all to Yue.

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,690
Let me apply the medicine for you.

27
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,090
Bear with it for a moment.

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,170
How does it feel?

29
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,610
Much better.

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,170
But what did you use?

31
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,220
It works so well.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
This is

33
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,460
a wound medicine I made myself

34
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,670
when was traveling the world.

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,360
It's much more effective than the medicines in the palace.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,120
It heals quickly

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
and doesn't leave any scars.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,040
Keep it and use it for now.

39
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,450
Thanks.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,890
I should have been of help to you this time, right?

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
You did very well.

42
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,640
You've helped me a lot.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,560
That's good.

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,340
But don't act on your own like that again.

45
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:27,930
I see.

46
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,630
Got it.

47
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,660
By the way,

48
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,000
you just mentioned

49
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,100
about traveling the world before?

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,530
Your brother never told you?

51
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,700
I came from a commoner background.

52
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,210
Then you must have seen

53
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,450
a lot of fun things out there, right?

54
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,930
Many years ago,

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,800
I

56
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,470
came across a wild mountain rarely visited by people.

57
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,180
There was a huge waterfall,

58
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,750
and

59
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,540
monkeys all over the place.

60
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,950
One monkey in particular was very mischievous.

61
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,090
Eventually, I trained it

62
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,150
to be my companion.

63
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,850
Your Majesty,

64
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,610
you've been considering this for quite a while now.

65
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,360
The tea has been changed several times.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
If this continues,

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,930
I'm afraid we'll run out of

68
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,130
this year's good tea.

69
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,550
Tell me, how can we improve

70
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,090
the relationship between a man and a woman?

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,490
Asking me?

72
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,200
About relationships?

73
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,360
I must have lost my mind.

74
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,350
Why would I ask you?

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Your Majesty,

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,240
if you put it that way…

77
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,560
Before I entered the palace,

78
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,000
I was the village's most eligible bachelor.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,170
Plenty of girls were hoping I'd show up at their door.

80
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,050
I even had the luxury of choosing.

81
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,030
Is that so?

82
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,120
And then you became a eunuch.

83
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,610
Your Majesty...

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,250
What...

85
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,340
Sister.

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,380
Here comes the expert.

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,850
Why did Your Grace suddenly summon me?

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,530
What kind of question is that?

89
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,320
I missed my younger brother.

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Can't I summon you for that?

91
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,400
Eunuch Wang,

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,090
go

93
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,380
bring out this year's new tea for

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,410
Minister Du to have a taste.

95
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,220
Only the best.

96
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,440
Something's going on.

97
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,850
Sister, just tell me straight.

98
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,530
What do you need me for?

99
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,590
Straightforward.

100
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,530
Indeed, my brother is just as

101
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,050
straightforward as me.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,330
To matchmake those two?

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,030
Me?

104
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,970
That's right.

105
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm not the right person.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,320
You are.

107
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,000
You pursued that Meili quite intensely.

108
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,260
Why can't you help your nephew?

109
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,400
Besides,

110
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,670
you've got this "Guide to Winning Her Heart" book.

111
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,950
[Guide to Winning Her Heart]

112
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,730
Teach him.

113
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,690
Just follow what the book says.

114
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,360
Sister.

115
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,650
Fine.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,760
Even if it means

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,760
defying the imperial edict?

118
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,590
Sister.

119
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,170
[Guide to Winning Her Heart]

120
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,360
I am the Emperor.

121
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,880
Is this necessary?

122
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,560
Fair.

123
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,950
But no harm in listening.

124
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,770
Let's hear it.

125
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,680
Do you already have someone in mind?

126
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
How dare you!

127
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,000
The private life of the current Emperor

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,200
is not something you can inquire about.

129
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,909
You're not falling for Ling'er, are you?

130
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,290
How could that be possible?

131
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,560
Don't talk nonsense.

132
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,290
You wrote this book?

133
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,440
Impressive.

134
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,320
[Guide to Winning Her Heart]

135
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,650
The three keys to winning her heart:

136
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,650
swallow your pride, be thoughtful,

137
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,100
and master romance.

138
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,250
Isn't that like saying nothing at all?

139
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,290
Of course not.

140
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,200
These are all profound truths.

141
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,050
Maybe you haven't

142
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,530
chased someone, but you've

143
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,730
read those romance books, haven't you?

144
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,850
For example?

145
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,240
For example, "swallowing your pride"

146
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,290
means not being afraid of difficulties and setbacks.

147
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,490
Even if you're rejected, don't lose heart.

148
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,440
You must keep trying,

149
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,500
fail and try again.

150
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,610
Being "thoughtful"

151
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,200
means understanding

152
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,440
what she likes and dislikes.

153
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,090
If she shows any emotion,

154
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,850
you should comfort her in time.

155
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,850
And of course, the most important part is

156
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,909
"master romance."

157
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,960
Master romance?

158
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,800
Speaking of romance,

159
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,320
your father was really a master at it.

160
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,050
The ways he used to court my sister

161
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,530
are still breathtaking when I talk about it.

162
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,970
Signal fires to make the lady smile.

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,140
Fetching lychees from hundreds of miles away to win her heart.

164
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,750
And...

165
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,390
I must be crazy.

166
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,030
I can't believe I'm actually
teaching him this.

167
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,920
And then?

168
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,730
I'm just saying.

169
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,600
Surprisingly,

170
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,720
although you're so clueless about politics,

171
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,090
when it comes to these tricks,

172
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,520
you're better than anyone else.

173
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,530
I just made it up.

174
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,880
It's useless.

175
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
Give it back to me.

176
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,150
Your Majesty.

177
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,220
Your Majesty.

178
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,620
Can you use your brain?

179
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,520
Be serious. Stop talking like that.

180
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,740
It doesn't work on me.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,600
Go away.

182
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,820
Your Highness.

183
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,490
Has the letter been sent?

184
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,850
Yes, it has.

185
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,670
Then,

186
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,670
has there been a reply?

187
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Not yet.

188
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,070
When the birds have flown,

189
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,710
the bow is hidden.

190
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,980
When the cunning rabbit is dead,

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
the dog is cooked.

192
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,270
Wang.

193
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,840
[Auspice and Blessing]

194
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
Your Majesty.

195
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,530
Coming.

196
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,320
Coming.

197
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
What's the matter?

198
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
Did you have a nightmare?

199
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,460
No.

200
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,250
I suddenly remembered it.

201
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,140
How are things going?

202
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,360
Consort Yue.

203
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Please, this way.

204
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,050
Where are we going?

205
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,100
You've just had a miscarriage,

206
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,190
and your body is weak.

207
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,350
Her Majesty is concerned about you,

208
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,820
and has specially granted you permission

209
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,700
to bathe in the hot spring pool at Shoukang Palace.

210
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,050
Hot spring pool at Shoukang Palace?

211
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,060
Consort Yue,

212
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,720
you entered the palace late,

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,580
so there are many things

214
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,680
you don't know about.

215
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,280
Her Majesty has always liked making medicine,

216
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,290
so she set up a medicinal pool in the back garden

217
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,680
of Shoukang Palace.

218
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,110
That place is a restricted area.

219
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,450
No one knows about it,

220
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,410
and no one disturbs it.

221
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,510
Well, even so,

222
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,340
it's still Her Majesty's place.

223
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,020
Since it's getting late,

224
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,680
I won't disturb her.

225
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm feeling a bit tired anyway.

226
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,990
I'll go back and rest first.

227
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,440
Consort Yue,

228
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,080
Her Majesty's intentions are kind.

229
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,840
You must go to the hot spring pool today,

230
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,170
whether you'd like to or not.

231
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,120
Consort Yue,

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,530
you'd better accept it.

233
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Your Majesty,

234
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,810
rest assured.

235
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,740
Everything has been arranged.

236
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,540
Your Majesty,

237
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,350
what do you think is going on here?

238
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,020
Why are you here?

239
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,470
Mother

240
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,340
sent me here

241
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,480
to test her new medicine.

242
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,560
What...

243
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,420
What about you?

244
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Eunuch Wang said Her Majesty wanted me to soak in it

245
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,210
for recuperation.

246
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,770
This is indeed where Mother

247
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,800
practices her skills and makes medicine.

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,290
The pool is full of medicinal liquids.

249
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,630
It's really good stuff.

250
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,080
Do you...

251
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,830
want to take a soak

252
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,100
or do you want to leave?

253
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,670
I'd better leave.

254
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,440
Didn't I just have a miscarriage?

255
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,240
I can't handle any stimulation.

256
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,170
Well,

257
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,980
let's go then.

258
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,350
Are you alright?

259
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,410
What was that just now?

260
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,930
Night-blooming cereus.

261
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
That's the night-blooming cereus?

262
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,530
You know?

263
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
When I was little, I would fall asleep waiting

264
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,590
just to see it bloom.

265
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
It's very beautiful.

266
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,120
It's just a pity that it lasts for such a short time.

267
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,170
The first glimpse of its beauty

268
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
may last only a moment,

269
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,600
but the memory

270
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,130
of its beauty stays forever.

271
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,900
I...

272
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,480
I'm worried that Mother might have set up

273
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,700
some traps here,

274
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,520
and you don't know martial arts,

275
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,310
so

276
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,810
I want to hold your hand

277
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,900
to prevent you from getting hurt.

278
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,800
Is that okay?

279
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,140
Let's go.

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Your Majesty,

281
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,860
given their situation,

282
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,960
have we already succeeded?

283
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,130
Yingying,

284
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,250
remember,

285
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,200
your father and brothers were all killed by the Yue family.

286
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
But you must promise me,

287
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,250
do not seek revenge.

288
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,600
I only want you to live a good life,

289
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,600
marry an ordinary person,

290
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
have a couple of children

291
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,560
who are neither too smart nor too dull,

292
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,560
and grow old together.

293
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,770
Will you promise me?

294
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,010
Qu Yingying,

295
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,370
your aunt sent you to our Cao family

296
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,080
to serve us.

297
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,930
Within just a few days, she has made you waver.

298
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,930
Marry an ordinary person...

299
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,440
Since you've eaten the food of our Cao family,

300
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,569
you must enter the palace

301
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,700
and fight for the Cao family's future.

302
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,569
No!

303
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,840
Mother.

304
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,510
I'm coming to find you.

305
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,430
Do you know what you're saying?

306
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,010
Please, Your Majesty, be lenient with Consort Hui.

307
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,140
Ling'er,

308
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,030
she was the one who colluded with traitors first.

309
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,510
You want me to pardon her?

310
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,590
Where would that leave the face of Ning and the royal family?

311
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,620
But Your Majesty, you know well

312
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,310
she's not the main culprit.

313
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,640
Her aunt, who adopted her,

314
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
was used by Cao Mang.

315
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,990
She,

316
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,070
on the other hand, is being used by Cao Mang

317
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,070
while also being manipulated by us.

318
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,490
She is not a pawn in court struggles.

319
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,940
She is a living, breathing person.

320
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,130
But she tried to kill your brother

321
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,660
and even tried to harm you.

322
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,220
It would be strange if she didn't seek revenge against the Yue family.

323
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,140
Her father and brothers

324
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,430
died in the battle at Dayan Pass.

325
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,980
It was a life-or-death battlefield.

326
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,870
Yes,

327
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,600
the battlefield is merciless,

328
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,820
but people have feelings.

329
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,610
In that battle at Dayan Pass,

330
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,380
how many civilians were displaced,

331
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,510
families torn apart,

332
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,880
and some never saw another sunrise?

333
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,770
Although our Yue family wasn't the mastermind,

334
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,410
we bear the main responsibility.

335
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,070
Ling'er,

336
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,390
someone as unclear-headed as Consort Hui

337
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,830
should not remain in the palace.

338
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,950
I disagree.

339
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,590
Yingying.

340
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,790
Qu.

341
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,510
Hurry up and hold her.

342
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,420
Yingying.

343
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,440
Yingying.

344
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,700
Yingying, are you alright?

345
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,270
Who told you to come here?

346
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,460
Who told you to come here?

347
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,180
Go!

348
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,030
Yingying, what are you doing?

349
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,550
A child is no big deal.

350
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,110
Consort Yue can have it,

351
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,590
and so can we.

352
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,140
They won't go so far as to kill you.

353
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,930
Who wants to have children with that damn emperor?

354
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,110
He's messing up things,

355
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,660
entrusting important positions to traitors from the previous dynasty.

356
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,940
He doesn't deserve to be emperor at all!

357
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,700
Yingying, shut up quickly.

358
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,510
I won't!

359
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm going to speak.

360
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm going to say it loudly!

361
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,960
The worst that can happen is death.

362
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,650
Let me tell you the truth,

363
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,960
I've long lost the will to live.

364
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,170
Do you know

365
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,620
what it feels like to watch the people

366
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,930
who killed your parents

367
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,420
and destroyed your family

368
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,220
before you?

369
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,270
Yingying.

370
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,130
You don't know!

371
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,590
You don't know anything!

372
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,420
Yingying.

373
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,270
All you care about is

374
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,660
whether the Emperor's been to Fengluan Palace,

375
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
listening to music with Consort Yue,

376
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,900
or to Yong'an Palace,

377
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,350
eating Consort Zhou's pastries

378
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,900
and praising her cooking skills.

379
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,980
You worry about losing your positions as consorts

380
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,310
and losing your

381
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,420
status and power.

382
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,940
But have you ever thought about me?

383
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,310
Me.

384
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,580
How difficult it is for me?

385
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,550
I have no family influence to support me,

386
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,110
no parents to back me up.

387
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,550
All I have

388
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,420
is being used over and over again.

389
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,750
You...

390
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,350
What right do you have to criticize me?

391
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,550
Why? Why?

392
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,510
It's not like that.

393
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,620
Don't come near me!

394
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,140
I used to have parents who loved me

395
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,000
and a brother who protected me,

396
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,510
but all of that

397
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,260
was destroyed by Yue Chi.

398
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,150
It was Yue Chi who destroyed them!

399
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,830
Do you think I don't know how good Ling'er is?

400
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,830
Do you think

401
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,310
I want to be that heartless person?

402
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,870
I have no choice.

403
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,270
I really have no choice.

404
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,420
I have nothing now.

405
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,350
What do you want?

406
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,390
I told you not to come closer!

407
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,660
Shuang'er.

408
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,980
You...

409
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,110
Stay back!

410
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,350
Stay back! Stay back!

411
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,790
Stay back!

412
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,590
Yunshuang!

413
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,020
Are you calm now?

414
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,210
Can we speak properly now?

415
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,710
If so,

416
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,000
throw the scissors away!

417
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,530
If not,

418
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,790
then give me one more stab.

419
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,110
I'll die with you.

420
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,950
Just like you said,

421
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,340
there's no hope in this harem anyway.

422
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,310
Might as well die

423
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,370
and be done with it.

424
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,030
Let's go together on the road to the underworld

425
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,290
so you won't be lonely.

426
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,800
What are you doing?

427
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,090
I thought even if you don't consider the harem as your home,

428
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,510
at least I'm your family.

429
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,110
Qu Yingying,

430
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,310
do you know why your meals are still lavish

431
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,110
even though you plotted against the royal heir?

432
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,350
It's because Lady Lan paid

433
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,380
the Imperial Kitchen for two and a half years,

434
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,660
to make them continue

435
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,790
serving meals according to your previous preferences.

436
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,270
Do you know how we got in after His Majesty

437
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,830
locked the palace gates?

438
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,830
It was Yingwan

439
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,110
who knelt all night at Shoukang Palace

440
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,590
before the Empress Dowager finally relented

441
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,110
and allowed us to enter.

442
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,030
Now every step Yingwan takes

443
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,890
is agonizing pain.

444
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,270
Do you know how scared I was

445
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,460
when I saw you like that just now?

446
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,700
I was afraid I had come too late.

447
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,590
Qu Yingying,

448
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,540
you're always immersed in your own suffering.

449
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,070
Can you think about us?

450
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,460
Can you think about the ones

451
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,860
who've been by your side for over two years?

452
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

454
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,140
Don't apologize.

455
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,180
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Don't apologize.

457
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,170
We'll always be good sisters.

458
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,710
In these two years of living in the palace,

459
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,510
we've already become family.

460
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,110
I'm sorry.

461
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,180
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,310
Does it hurt?

463
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,350
It hurts.

464
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,770
Ling'er.

465
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,790
What are you doing?

466
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,930
I'm begging you.

467
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,180
Alright.

468
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,590
Stop teasing her.

469
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,560
We had already planned to forgive Qu Yingying.

470
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,500
She's just a woman,

471
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,940
and hasn't committed any serious offense.

472
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,240
Why would I kill her?

473
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,110
Is that so?

474
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,320
You scared me to death.

475
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,360
You two teamed up to deceive me.

476
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,550
Brother, you were involved too.

477
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,190
You should be punished more.

478
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,940
I'll hit you arder.

479
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,150
Your Majesty,

480
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,620
news has come from Yanning Palace.

481
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
Consort Hui has attempted suicide.

482
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,700
Let's go.

483
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,440
You scared me to death.

484
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,460
I'm sorry.

485
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,220
Consort Hui, you...

486
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,350
Greetings, Your Majesty.

487
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,900
You two have a good talk.

488
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,360
I'll wait for you outside.

489
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,170
You don't trust your brother?

490
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,320
Actually, I understand Consort Hui's feelings.

491
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,030
Don't you resent her?

492
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,790
If only the world were at peace.

493
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,860
About this incident,

494
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,420
His Majesty has decided to dock your salary for two months

495
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,020
as an apology to Consort Yue.

496
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,200
I appreciate His Majesty's grace.

497
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,350
I'm sorry about the incident at Dayan Pass.

498
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,900
But now that

499
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,140
you and Consort Yue have entered the palace as sisters,

500
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,660
we're all family now.

501
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,900
Thank you, Prime Minister,

502
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,300
and Consort Yue, for speaking on my behalf.

503
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,600
Perhaps one day

504
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,550
I will let go of everything,

505
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,700
but no matter what,

506
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,420
at no time and in no place

507
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,660
will Prime Minister

508
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,730
and I ever be family.

509
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,200
How did it go?

510
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,700
Go.

511
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,900
They need you inside.

512
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,860
Looks like the conversation went well.

513
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,940
Not bad.

514
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,960
Let's go.

515
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,940
If you three weren't short a player today,

516
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,330
I wouldn't have come.

517
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,900
You never learn your lesson, do you?

518
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,030
You still dare to come.

519
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,660
That's right.

520
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,790
I came here today

521
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,180
to clean out your little

522
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,290
treasure troves.

523
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,790
Well, you'll have to work hard for that.

524
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,070
Qu's little treasure trove

525
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,330
isn't something you can just win easily.

526
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,030
What you said

527
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,070
makes it sound like our Qu will lose.

528
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,830
Besides,

529
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,360
aren't the three of us ganging up on her today?

530
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,510
That sounds like isolation.

531
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,270
Sister,

532
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,740
they want to...

533
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,200
Peeking at my cards?

534
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,220
Not a chance.

535
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
You caught me.

536
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,660
You've been on guard against me all along.

537
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,420
Consort Hui,

538
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,740
let me tell you,

539
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,790
I won't go easy on you today.

540
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,940
You must have read too many storybooks.

541
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,180
Hurry up and play your card.

542
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,840
I think it does look like that.

543
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,800
Those storybooks are harmful.

544
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,510
[Yongqian Palace]

545
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,790
I told Consort Hui

546
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,420
you fined her two months' salary.

547
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,070
Mmm.

548
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,680
And gave it to Ling'er.

549
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,100
Yue Chi.

550
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,640
You two really are siblings, aren't you?

551
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,860
One is responsible for fleecing,

552
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,830
the other for guarding the wealth.

553
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,930
Does Your Majesty really want to

554
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,900
quibble over such trivial matters?

555
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,070
Alright.

556
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,050
Let's get to the point.

557
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,270
Qu Yingying not only confessed that

558
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,400
the mastermind behind it was Cao Mang,

559
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,900
but also revealed many of his evil deeds.

560
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,550
Don't make me hold back anymore.

561
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,080
Go and capture him quickly.

562
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,180
Don't worry,

563
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,700
I've always had people keeping a close watch on him.

564
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
He was captured early this morning.

565
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,070
Your Majesty,

566
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,550
Cao Mang has people helping him,

567
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,140
and he has now escaped from the tight surveillance,

568
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,180
heading towards the outskirts of the city to flee.

569
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,270
Who's helping him?

570
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,070
We don't know.

571
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,070
The guards are tracking him.

572
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,940
Don't be angry.

573
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
I'll go after him.

574
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,980
Hyah!

575
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,060
Hyah!

576
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,100
Judging by the placement of these bamboo poles,

577
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,820
they seem to be using the Eight Trigrams Formation.

578
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,160
Wanna trap me with the Eight Trigrams Formation?

579
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,000
Such a trivial trick.

580
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,370
Heaven by three continuous lines; Earth by six broken lines.
Thunder like an upturned bowl.

581
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,480
Mountain like an overturned bowl. Fire has a hollow center.

582
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,400
On the left is the leading position, associated with Fire.

583
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,270
On the right is the position of safeguarding, associated with Heaven.

584
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,820
Remaining position below to be kept in the center.

585
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,680
I've found the formation's core.

586
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,950
Hyah!

587
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,430
Who are you?

588
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,140
Why did you save me?

589
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,990
You aim to shake the stability of Later Ning

590
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,250
and kill Huo Jingheng,

591
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,040
which aligns with my goal.

592
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,440
Why don't we join forces?

593
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,160
What benefits can you offer me?

594
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,130
I am the Crown Prince of Li State.

595
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,600
If you're willing to form an alliance,

596
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,770
I promise

597
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,660
that after Huo Jingheng's death,

598
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,360
Ning State will become a vassal state of Li State,

599
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,860
and I'll crown you as the King of Ning State.

600
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,240
I know

601
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,600
your ambition is not for power and wealth,

602
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,360
but your beloved

603
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,080
will surely appreciate your good intentions

604
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,010
and truly fall in love with you.

605
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,920
But if we are to be allies,

606
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,020
why don't you dare to show your true face?

607
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,450
Well, I've been inconsiderate.

608
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,260
[Yi Qingyun, Crown Prince of Li State]
