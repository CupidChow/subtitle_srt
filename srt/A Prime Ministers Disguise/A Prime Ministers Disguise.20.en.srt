00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,930
[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,780
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,930
Lady Wen, daughter of the former Prince of Northern Commandery.

4
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,990
Pay your respects.

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,080
The imperial decree is missing.

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,080
When did it go missing?

7
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,240
I don't know.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,400
Losing the imperial decree

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,850
is a grave offense.

10
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,120
Your Majesty,

11
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,210
as the Princess holds a noble status,

12
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,010
it would be inappropriate for me

13
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,400
to read the decree.

14
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,320
Then,

15
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,200
Imperial Uncle, please.

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I can't do it.

17
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
I can't read.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Are you defying the imperial order?

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,640
Bring forth the imperial decree at once.

20
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
You must be joking.

21
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,480
Didn't Eunuch Gui

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
already present the imperial decree

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,520
to you just now?

24
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,079
Princess Wen,

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,650
born noble and graceful,

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,440
gentle and virtuous,

27
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,070
respectful to superiors, dignified and prudent,

28
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,070
kind and generous to subordinates,

29
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,630
with virtue unmatched in the world,

30
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,350
praiseworthy in internal affairs,

31
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,480
a model for all the imperial consorts.

32
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,680
Today, she is hereby conferred

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,890
the title of Noble Consort.

34
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,640
Noble Consort?

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,090
There must be a mistake.

36
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,080
His Majesty said

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
this is called "tough outside and soft inside;

38
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,240
different inside and out."

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Ling'er.

40
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,470
Wasn't it supposed to be Consort?

41
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,270
How did it become Noble Consort?

42
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,500
If it were just a consort title, there'd be no need
to summon everyone to Yanfu Palace.

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,920
Seems His Majesty has truly changed.

44
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,760
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,210
please continue.

46
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,480
I accept the decree.

47
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,480
Wait.

48
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,190
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,160
By order of the Empress Dowager,

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,080
I have come to read a decree.

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,920
Everyone, kneel.

52
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,030
Decree from the Empress Dowager:

53
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,160
[Decree]

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,600
Lady Wen is of virtuous character

55
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,760
and has been deeply blessed by imperial favor.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,840
However, the Northern Commandery has been plagued by misfortunes.

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,300
Lady Wen is the daughter of the former ruler,

58
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,760
[Decree]

59
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,120
and too much glory

60
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,450
may cause unrest in the former dynasty.

61
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,340
Therefore, she is hereby granted the title of Consort Wen,

62
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,720
to preserve stability.

63
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,280
Congratulations.

64
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,040
Consort Wen,

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,200
please receive the imperial edict.

66
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,920
I thank Your Grace.

67
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,280
The phoenix hairpin you're wearing now

68
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,020
is part of the Noble Consort's attire.

69
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,420
It's not in line with the proper etiquette.

70
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,550
The Empress Dowager has specifically instructed.

71
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,200
Your Highness,

72
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,560
please remove it

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
and replace it

74
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,030
with a plain hairpin.

75
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,240
Henceforth,

76
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,520
you should also

77
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,320
act with added caution.

78
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
Your Majesty,

79
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,480
I shall take my leave now.

80
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,930
Rise, everyone.

81
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,260
[Qunyu Pavilion]

82
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,720
Your Majesty,

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,380
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

84
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,260
Sitting here alone,

85
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,440
what are you thinking about?

86
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Your Majesty, I was thinking of you.

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Just now

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,200
while drinking,

89
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,440
I suddenly

90
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,640
realized one thing.

91
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,909
Instead of both sides

92
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,950
drinking to the point of sickness,

93
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,040
better to cut losses early,

94
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,810
preserve dignity and decorum,

95
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
and live well.

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,800
The matters at the drinking table

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,640
are beyond my understanding.

98
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,630
Perhaps Your Majesty

99
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,840
should rest early.

100
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,110
Resting at this hour

101
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,000
seems a bit too early, doesn't it?

102
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,990
I wonder if Your Majesty

103
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,520
has anything else in mind?

104
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,960
You'll agree to

105
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,360
whatever I want to do, will you?

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,240
I wonder if Your Majesty and I

107
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,120
have the same thing in mind.

108
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,039
Your Majesty and Your Highness

109
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,000
sure know how to play.

110
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,039
Be serious. Let's talk business.

111
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,650
Since we're talking business,

112
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,960
then let's sit down

113
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,220
and talk as equals.

114
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,480
Don't even think about running away.

115
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,340
300 secret guards

116
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,470
are hidden around the Qunyu Pavilion.

117
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,300
The former Prince of Northern Commandery

118
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,320
was a master strategist,

119
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,450
bold and brilliant,

120
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,280
far more capable

121
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
than the one we see now.

122
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,700
Prime Minister Yue, what exactly

123
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
are you trying to say?

124
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,160
You're well-educated and mannered.

125
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,040
The Prince of Northern Commandery

126
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,560
must have loved you dearly.

127
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,820
If he were still alive,

128
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,220
he wouldn't bear to see you degrade yourself.

129
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,600
Why did he die?

130
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,050
Don't you know?

131
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,600
The way you looked at me just now,

132
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,720
full of hatred.

133
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,990
You wish you could

134
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,520
kill me right away.

135
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,680
Let me ask you this,

136
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,810
in this world, there are

137
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,080
countless people

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
coming for profit

139
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
and dying for profit.

140
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,720
If he couldn't be Emperor,

141
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,040
then no one else could either?

142
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,330
So, Your Majesty wants me to betray my father?

143
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,320
Even if you

144
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,580
can't forget the past,

145
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,350
you shouldn't be entangled

146
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,810
with people like Cao Mang.

147
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,300
I'll make this clear today:

148
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
As long as I, Yue Chi, live,

149
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,570
what you're plotting

150
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,530
will never succeed.

151
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,160
Then you shall die.

152
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,680
If he dies,

153
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,670
there's still me.

154
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,480
If I can't live either,

155
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,280
there are still

156
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,160
thousands of good men in Ning.

157
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,860
In the past,

158
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,230
when I was on the battlefield,

159
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,020
I saw too many sacrifices.

160
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,550
Now that I'm on the throne,

161
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,030
I just want the people to be safe.

162
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,720
Whoever tries to disrupt this peace now

163
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,190
is an enemy of Ning.

164
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,890
His Majesty only hopes for peace in the world.

165
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,620
If Cao Mang is willing,

166
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,760
you two can also return to Northern Commandery

167
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
and live peacefully.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,730
Whether we live peacefully or not

169
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,360
depends on your word?

170
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,580
Heaven and Earth as my witness,

171
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,470
I shall never go back on my word.

172
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,800
If you don't believe me,

173
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,970
I'll add another clause

174
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,100
to the peace edict.

175
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,330
How about that?

176
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,610
You have a way to contact Cao Mang,

177
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,840
don't you?

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,760
Cao,

179
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,950
all is settled.

180
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Officials agreed to wait.

181
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,760
Meet outside

182
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,360
the capital at dawn.

183
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,200
[Cao, all is settled. Officials agreed to wait.
Meet outside the capital at dawn.]

184
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Alright.

185
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,700
I'll go muster the troops now.

186
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,920
Prime Minister Yue,

187
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,400
you've already died once.

188
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,240
Ever seen the depths of hell?

189
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Where there is war and chaos,

190
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,640
there lies hell itself.

191
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,990
[Cao, all is settled. Officials agreed to wait.
Meet outside the capital at dawn.]

192
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,280
It's done?

193
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,560
It's done so easily?

194
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,490
[The plan failed. It's a trap.]

195
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,640
What's going on?

196
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,860
[Cao, all is settled. Officials agreed to wait.
Meet outside the capital at dawn.]

197
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
This isn't right.

198
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,000
She could be in danger.

199
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,410
You still have time to worry about her?

200
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,360
Think about yourself first.

201
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,000
Mr. Yi,

202
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,080
is there any way

203
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,880
to save her?

204
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,430
You and Cao Mang

205
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,520
will both be safe.

206
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,720
Can I trust you?

207
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,800
You have no choice

208
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,400
but to trust me.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,800
I don't know why,

210
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,330
but something feels wrong.

211
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,480
Wen Rou asked

212
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,080
to meet near the capital,

213
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
but Cao Mang changed it

214
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,970
to the distant Xidu Bridge.

215
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,580
Either way,

216
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,040
we must go.

217
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,240
Only by going

218
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,780
can we show our sincerity.

219
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,000
If we don't,

220
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,350
it'll only lead to war and bloodshed.

221
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,760
Be cautious.

222
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
I've made all the arrangements.

223
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,660
If anything happens,

224
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,200
the Qilin Army will come to your aid

225
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
and protect you well.

226
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,640
So you forced her

227
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,960
to write the letter.

228
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,680
Let her go.

229
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,680
She's my consort.

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,720
I said, let her go!

231
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,760
Your Highness, your emotions are so

232
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
unrestrained.

233
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,980
Be careful not to be manipulated.

234
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,560
We came here

235
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
to negotiate peace with you.

236
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,000
In your dreams!

237
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,760
What do you mean?

238
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,630
This area is surrounded by my soldiers.

239
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,050
You want to negotiate?

240
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,480
You better check if your heads

241
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,610
are still attached!

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,860
Your Highness,

243
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,080
you can't kill us.

244
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,600
You'd better surrender quietly.

245
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Then I'll kill you first!

246
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,040
You're already

247
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
meat on the chopping block.

248
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,800
Still so stubborn?

249
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,160
You still don't know

250
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
who holds the knife

251
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
and who's the fish, do you?

252
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
Bring them in!

253
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,050
Move! Hurry up!

254
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,560
Behave!

255
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,250
Your Majesty,

256
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,540
all hidden soldiers have been captured.

257
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,020
I surrender.

258
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,890
Do you surrender to fate, or admit defeat?

259
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,520
Both.

260
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,800
Just let Wen Rou go.

261
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,320
If someone must die, let it be me!

262
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,160
I...

263
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
hate to part

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
lovers.

265
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,380
Here are the tiger tally and the vassal king's command seal.

266
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,570
Let Wen Rou go,

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,720
and they're yours.

268
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,260
What are you doing?

269
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,400
Huo Jingheng killed my father.

270
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,400
Even if I die,

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
I'll take him with me.

272
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,400
I have never harmed

273
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,160
anyone from the Wen family.

274
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,160
You hate His Majesty so much.

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,600
It must be His Highness who instigated this.

276
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,760
Please explain

277
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,800
the reasons behind this.

278
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,920
No.

279
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,680
It wasn't him.

280
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,960
Two years ago...

281
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,440
Hyah!

282
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,599
The late Duke

283
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,430
rushed ahead to the capital

284
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,880
to seize the throne,

285
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,160
and set a trap to block

286
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,190
Huo Jingheng with boulders.

287
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,839
Your Majesty,

288
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,960
there's a landslide ahead.

289
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,760
Boulders are blocking the road.

290
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,250
I was also caught in his trap.

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Form ranks!

292
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,590
There's no way to retreat.

293
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,120
We had to fight to the death.

294
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,000
Kill!

295
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,510
Kill!

296
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,190
The late Duke reached

297
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,720
the capital first.

298
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,640
The throne was within his grasp—

299
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,320
but

300
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,390
the old regime had already fallen.

301
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,200
Only the last defense

302
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,320
remained.

303
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,410
A final battle behind the gates.

304
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,810
Not one of the late Duke's

305
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,080
30,000 men survived.

306
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,390
They were surrounded

307
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
and slaughtered outside the gates.

308
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,370
[Battle Report: Prince of Northern Commandery killed. 30,000 troops lost.]

309
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,120
When the news came,

310
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,490
you were so devastated

311
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,910
by your father's death.

312
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,780
You probably

313
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,520
wished

314
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,560
to die with him.

315
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,120
But I couldn't let go.

316
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
I wanted you to live.

317
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,280
I wanted to live with you.

318
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,490
Back then, the army blamed

319
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,480
Huo Jingheng for the old Duke's death.

320
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,660
I thought

321
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,200
if you believed it too,

322
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,600
maybe that belief could

323
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,200
give you the will

324
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,920
to live on and seek vengeance.

325
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,890
So...

326
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
So,

327
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,640
you allowed those rumors

328
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,880
to spread.

329
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,690
You didn't try to stop them.

330
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,420
Even when I asked you for the truth,

331
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
you never gave me a straight answer.

332
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
All these years,

333
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,000
all these schemes,

334
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,830
all this resentment—

335
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,090
all turned into a joke.

336
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,730
Rou, don't!

337
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,000
What are you doing?

338
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,200
His Majesty has never said

339
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
that he wanted your life.

340
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,090
Then His Majesty means

341
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,540
my life isn't mine to decide?

342
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,510
You still have attachments in this world.

343
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,490
If you were to die like this,

344
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,620
I'd say it's not worth it.

345
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
I have no parents,

346
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,560
not even hate to hold on to.

347
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,160
What's left to care for?

348
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,120
His Highness used to go to great lengths,

349
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,930
and now he's offering his life for yours,

350
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,970
just to give you

351
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,640
a chance of survival.

352
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,120
Even if his mind is a bit slow,

353
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,500
His Highness must have figured out

354
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,440
that you have

355
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,780
always been using him.

356
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,140
And yet he still

357
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,020
cares for you,

358
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,450
devoting himself to you.

359
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,360
Why do you think that is?

360
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,600
Rou,

361
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,930
you're in my heart.

362
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,880
I care about you.

363
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,400
Even if I have to die for you,

364
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,030
I'm willing to do so.

365
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,470
No.

366
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,280
Don't.

367
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,820
You haven't grasped the situation yet.

368
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,560
Whose hands are

369
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,090
your lover's life in now?

370
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,500
What do you want to do?

371
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
Stop making a fuss.

372
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,760
Wen Rou,

373
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,400
you once distrusted me

374
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,240
because of a misunderstanding.

375
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,960
But I am the Emperor—

376
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
my word stands.

377
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,920
If you

378
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
sign the peace

379
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,960
decree today,

380
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
no one has to die.

381
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,480
When two tigers compete

382
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,420
and fight,

383
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,960
the strong is wounded,

384
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,890
the weak killed.

385
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,350
If someone strikes while both are down,

386
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,480
they can take down both tigers at once.

387
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,990
Think carefully, Your Highness.

388
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,120
is someone waiting

389
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,840
to benefit from this fight?

390
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,980
Yes.

391
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,240
If both Northern Commandery and Ning

392
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
fall into others' hands,

393
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,640
what kind of situation will we face then?

394
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,750
War will break out everywhere,

395
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,410
and the world will be in chaos.

396
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,200
Even if you win the beauty,

397
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,360
will you still have the face

398
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,720
to sit high and collect

399
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
the people's tribute?

400
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,000
Even if

401
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,880
you care nothing for the common folk,

402
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,680
once Ning is gone,

403
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,080
will that throne still exist?

404
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,000
Fine.

405
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,320
We'll sign.

406
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,210
Okay.

407
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,170
Then please,

408
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,440
bring the Princess

409
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,480
and come with us into

410
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
the command tent.

411
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,240
Prepare the vassal king's jade seal.

412
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
After signing the peace treaty,

413
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,700
you may return to your
vassal state as soon as possible.

414
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
Are you letting me go so easily?

415
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,050
Of course, it's not that simple.

416
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,180
Go east along the riverbank for two miles.

417
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,360
There's a carriage

418
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,040
prepared for you.

419
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,110
When rulers lose their way,

420
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,640
the people suffer.

421
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,160
You and I must remember that.

422
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,250
[Man King's merits offset his faults.
May return home and keep Prince's title.]

423
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:53,960
Your Highness,

424
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,480
please review it carefully.

425
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,600
If there's anything amiss,

426
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,060
we can discuss it further.

427
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,640
I trust you.

428
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,920
Alright.

429
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,440
I will not let you down.

430
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
Enemy attack!

431
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Fire!

432
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,250
Let's go.

433
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,520
Protect His Majesty!

434
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,940
Rou, let's go.

435
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,040
Go.

436
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,960
No.

437
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,520
Let's go together.

438
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
-Let's go together.
-Go now.

439
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,940
Go quickly!

440
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,850
Yue Chi, take Rou and go!

441
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,720
Your Highness.

442
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,660
I beg you, please save him.

443
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Save him.

444
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,640
Go!

445
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,950
Save him.

446
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,460
Let's go.

447
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,320
I beg you!

448
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm begging you!

449
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,050
I want you to live!

450
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,430
Live well!

451
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,490
Your Highness,

452
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,840
His Highness wants you safe.

453
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,130
A chance of survival.

454
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,660
Now is the time.

455
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,360
Your Highness.

456
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,970
From birth,

457
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,640
I had everything.

458
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,650
Fine clothes, high status.

459
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,840
People treated me like royalty.

460
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,800
Then disaster struck.

461
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,000
I saw the world's cruelty.

462
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,000
And hatred grew in me.

463
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,160
It was he

464
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,600
who walked through death itself

465
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,320
to hold my hand again,

466
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,200
at any cost.

467
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,560
Don't!

468
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,640
Don't!

469
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,440
Rou!

470
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
He longed for me,

471
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,840
followed me,

472
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,040
protected me.

473
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
Go!

474
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,680
But I ignored him,

475
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,240
scorned him,

476
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,920
used him.

477
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,550
And I was proud of it,

478
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,760
♪ Rivers and mountains slip into

479
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,600

Even if I have to die for you,

508
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm willing to do so.

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,820
No.

510
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,970
Don't.

511
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,660
This is...

512
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,040
The Jiang's royal banner.

513
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,120
People of the former dynasty
have returned to kill.

514
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,980
Yue! Yue!

515
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,380
You must leave quickly.

516
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,580
Don't worry about me.

517
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,980
Yue! Yue!

518
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,060
Your Majesty and Prime Minister Yue

519
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,100
are both here.

520
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,020
I pay my respects.

521
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,100
Your Highness, your men set fire

522
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,820
to Ning's military tent.

523
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,500
Is this a declaration of war?

524
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,460
I wouldn't dare.

525
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,070
The current situation is caused by

526
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,000
the Jiang family's orphans from the former dynasty.

527
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,380
I'm afraid the Jiang siblings

528
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,740
have been coerced.

529
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,300
Your Majesty must be joking.

530
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,260
These black-armored soldiers now

531
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,040
are the elite forces of the Kingdom Restoration League.

532
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
They only take orders from the Crown Prince and the Princess.

533
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,380
Even I

534
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,980
cannot command them.

535
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,060
Princess,

536
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,780
the show is about to begin.

537
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,190
Kill!

538
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,020
Kill!

539
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,340
Stop it, all of you!

540
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Your Highness!

541
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Let them go.

542
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,580
Aren't you afraid?

543
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,500
Kill!

544
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,380
Yue Chi,

545
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,990
why?

546
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,180
Why even you

547
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,780
have to choose Huo Jingheng?

548
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,060
Let's...

549
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,210
Shoot!

550
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,050
Are you alright?

551
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,580
Let's go.

552
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,060
Oh no.

553
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,780
Yue Chi has summoned the Qilin Army.

554
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,420
Retreat!

555
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,700
Your Highness,

556
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,960
you'd best stay still.

557
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,110
You won't be able to escape from here.

558
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,340
How is it?

559
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,820
Let me see.

560
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,100
It's nothing.

561
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,700
I don't feel a thing.

562
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
Still acting tough, huh?

563
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,100
Bear with it.

564
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,180
This arrow has barbs.

565
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,700
I'll help you pull it out.

566
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,770
Wait.

567
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,380
Hang in there.

568
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,490
Alright.

569
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,200
The arrow is specially made.

570
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,100
What's on the tip isn't barbs,

571
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,740
but fine, curved hooks.

572
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,020
Your Highness,

573
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,580
do you have any good ideas,

574
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,180
or did you just say that

575
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,300
to let me vent my anger on you?

576
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,090
Hemostatic medicine.

577
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,410
You can use this.

578
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,860
Thank you for your kindness.

579
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,270
I'll look for hemostatic herbs

580
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,210
for Prime Minister Yue nearby.

581
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,520
Whether to use this medicine or not

582
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,620
is up to you.

583
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,860
I just think Yue Chi

584
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,540
is a useful talent.

585
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,690
It would be a waste to let him die here.

586
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,040
He's not that kind-hearted.

587
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,870
This sickly man took it and didn't die.

588
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,330
It's probably not poison.

589
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,820
Bear with it.

590
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,860
The bleeding has stopped.

591
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,850
Thank you, Your Highness.

592
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,540
Your Majesty!

593
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,300
Yi Qingyun.

594
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,200
So, you were planning an ambush!

595
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,220
I see you don't want to...

596
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,580
Watch out!

597
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,850
Yue Chi, don't move.

598
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,380
Tell me where he is.

599
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,750
He

600
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,580
is...

601
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,900
Do you remember our

602
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,020
chess tactics?

603
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,510
General to file five—advance two.

604
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,790
General to file five—retreat two.

605
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,990
General to file five—advance one.

606
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,540
What happened?

607
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,660
I was bitten by a snake when I fell.

608
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,540
Don't worry. The snake's gone.

609
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,950
Come and give me a hand.

610
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,550
Move forward a bit more.

611
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,720
What are you doing?

612
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,380
This sickly guy

613
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,460
probably carries ointments.

614
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,260
Let me see if there's anything for your eyes.

615
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,060
Quite the medicine pouch he has.

616
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,580
That's quite a lot of medicine.

617
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,110
Want to play a guessing game

618
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,620
and pick one?

619
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,340
How is he now?

620
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,720
Looks like he's not going to make it.

621
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,140
That can't be.

622
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,620
I didn't even hit him

623
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,740
with full force.

624
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,790
Even if he's weak,

625
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,150
he shouldn't be this badly injured.

626
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,440
There's dark blood at the corner of his lips.

627
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,060
Could it have been a venomous snake?

628
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,260
Even if it was,

629
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,660
the venom wouldn't act so quickly

630
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,880
to let him die in just a moment.

631
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,420
Could it be that

632
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,860
my palm strike just now

633
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,980
triggered

634
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,640
the latent poison in his body?

635
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,980
No wonder.

636
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,800
He looked

637
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,500
half-dead before.

638
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,780
Let's go.

639
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,900
Let's go.

640
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,510
Stay close to me.

641
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,140
Follow me. Slow down.
