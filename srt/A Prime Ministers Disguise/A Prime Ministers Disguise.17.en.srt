00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,840
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm so happy that I don't even know

4
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,480
what to say.

5
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,720
Hahaha!

6
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,120
Loser pays

7
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,960
for treats today, alright?

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,760
Alright.

9
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,160
I'll definitely have you guys

10
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,000
losing round after round.

11
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,000
You're talking

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,039
as if you could actually beat me.

13
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,680
Exactly.

14
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,520
You bet I can!

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Bring it on.

16
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,960
I'm going to

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
win all your savings

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,080
from you today.

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,039
Thank you all for keeping me
company today.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,160
You're welcome.

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,759
That's what sisters are for.

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,970
You're really hard to beat.

23
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,530
Next time,

24
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,330
I'll definitely win it all back.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,560
Of course.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,240
You want to win my savings?

27
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,120
Dream on.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,160
Hahaha.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,450
It's getting late.

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,729
We should go back now.

31
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,890
Get some rest early.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,800
Okay.

33
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,690
We're off then.

34
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,120
Hurry up.

35
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,450
Go back quickly. No need to see us off.

36
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,870
Your Highness,

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,920
are you waiting for His Majesty?

38
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,870
Your Majesty.

39
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,430
Aren't you going to see Consort Yue?

40
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,870
I will.

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,520
I'll go after I finish this stroke.

42
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,010
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,210
Jiang Yunqing has been captured.

44
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,940
When did this happen?

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,950
It's reported that the day
before yesterday,

46
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,740
when the Empress Dowager learned

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,150
that Consort Yue had been taken hostage,
she was furious

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,750
and sent out the imperial guards
to search the entire city.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,410
This morning,

50
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,880
she was caught at the ferry dock.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,910
Where is she now?

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,760
In prison.

53
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,670
Can we release her?

54
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,930
You go there yourself.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,150
It'll still be difficult.

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
The Empress Dowager has assigned

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,390
soldiers to watch her there.

58
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,830
Go.

59
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,190
Summon Yue Chi secretly to the palace.

60
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,350
Someone new has been imprisoned
in the imperial jail?

62
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,910
Yes.

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,990
It's Jiang Yunqing.

64
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,430
We can't release her.

65
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,200
There are guards watching.

66
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,750
I beg Your Majesty to sentence me to death

67
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,010
to appease the people.

68
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,030
Yue Chi,

69
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,150
don't let me hear

70
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,070
you say that again.

71
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,870
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,710
You may leave.

73
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,150
Go.

74
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,350
Follow Yue Chi,

75
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,580
and keep an eye on him.

76
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,750
♪ Bones were decaying in the sandstorm ♪

77
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,070
♪ The Dayan Pass witnessed numerous wars ♪

78
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,470

82
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,990
They say the Princess Changping
isn't dead.

83
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,709
Isn't "Changping"

84
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,390
the title of a princess
from the previous dynasty?

85
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,589
Not only is she alive,

86
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,470
but she has been living

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,990
in Prince Anle's mansion all along.

88
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,790
Isn't that the current

89
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,870
Right Prime Minister's residence?

90
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,390
How could she be living there?

91
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,110
Yue Chi is engaged to
the former dynasty's princess.

92
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,370
He is a prince consort.

93
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,190
He must have

94
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,110
harbored treasonous intentions long ago.

95
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,990
Indeed.

96
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,750
Such a perfect chance—

97
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,280
I should take it and get rid of
Yue Chi for good.

98
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,270
How was it?

99
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,360
Very smooth.

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,390
Though this tea is not fancy,

101
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,750
it does quench thirst.

102
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,310
Right.

103
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,630
I've known that for a long time.

104
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,430
Well said.

105
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,270
Officials!

106
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,990
We once

107
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,310
advised His Majesty

108
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,990
that Yue Chi harbors treasonous intentions

109
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,250
and cannot be trusted,

110
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,970
yet His Majesty simply wouldn't listen.

111
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,550
I've sent people to investigate secretly

112
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,350
in the streets

113
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,909
and found that someone has already
reported to the government office

114
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,110
that Jiang Yunqing

115
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,470
did, in fact, stay at
Prince Anle's mansion.

116
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,500
Surely now, His Majesty

117
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,990
will believe our earnest advice.

118
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,960
Your foresight is truly remarkable,
my lord.

119
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,030
Yue Chi flatters His Majesty
of the new dynasty

120
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,690
while secretly colluding with
the remnants of the former court.

121
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,110
He's utterly shameless.

122
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,470
When dealing with
such a treacherous villain,

123
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,310
if we don't completely eliminate him,

124
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,990
even a sliver of opportunity could
allow him to rise again.

125
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,870
This time,

126
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,870
even if we have to sacrifice our lives,

127
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,510
we must eliminate

128
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,510
this treacherous scoundrel

129
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,590
for His Majesty and for Ning!

130
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,270
-That's right.
-Yes.

131
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,890
Lord Ouyang's righteousness is admirable.

132
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,010
Eunuch Gui is here.

133
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,230
Lord Ouyang,

134
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,850
is there something wrong?

135
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,430
Where is His Majesty?

136
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,990
We have matters to report.

137
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,430
His Majesty

138
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,840
is feeling unwell today

139
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,110
and won't be attending the morning court.

140
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,110
Please go back for now.

141
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,430
Is His Majesty truly ill,

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,070
or is he unwilling to punish Yue Chi?

143
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,330
Your Majesty!

144
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,350
Yue Chi has secretly harbored

145
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,630
the princess from the previous dynasty,

146
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,670
showing treasonous intentions!

147
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,990
Such betrayal

148
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,030
must be investigated!

149
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,550
Lord Ouyang,

150
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,150
-Lord Ouyang.
-Lord Ouyang!

151
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,550
Eunuch Gui,

152
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,880
has His Majesty given any instructions
concerning Yue Chi?

153
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,040
His Majesty said

154
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,470
to discuss it later.

155
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,030
Well... well...

156
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,290
To be discussed later?

157
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,640
Go request an audience
with the Empress Dowager!

158
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,670
Take a look.

159
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,870
No need to look.

160
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,710
I already know

161
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,870
what they wrote.

162
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,970
Nothing more than saying,

163
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,230
I'm incompetent,

164
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,800
Yue Chi is incompetent,

165
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,060
kill Jiang Yunqing,

166
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,240
and punish Prime Minister Yue.

167
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,470
Your Majesty,

168
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,270
how do you plan to handle this?

169
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,580
Let things cool off.

170
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,360
They've already forced your hand.

171
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,870
If you remain silent,

172
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,670
the country will decide for you.

173
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,230
I actually

174
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,390
didn't want to interfere
with political affairs.

175
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,190
But this time, I must advise you—

176
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,450
executing Jiang Yunqing

177
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,430
and temporarily removing
Yue Chi from office

178
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,280
would be the best choice.

179
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,390
I understand.

180
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,070
One.

181
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,630
Two.

182
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,910
Three!

183
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,590
You're here.

184
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,880
Come somewhere with me.

185
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,630
Where?

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,150
What are you going to do?

187
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,210
You know the answer. Don't play dumb.

188
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,990
No.

189
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,210
This is the second time you've defied me.

190
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,430
It's not the same.

191
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,710
This matter

192
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,760
absolutely cannot be done.

193
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,550
There's nothing that can't be done.

194
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,880
When I say it can be done,

195
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,150
it can be done.

196
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,070
Greetings, Your Majesty.

197
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,530
And Right Prime Minister.

198
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,270
Open the door.

199
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,110
Open the door?

200
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,630
But the Empress Dowager
has already ordered...

201
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,670
I said, open the door.

202
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,070
Are you defying my order?

203
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,670
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

204
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,600
I wouldn't dare.

205
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,990
Open the door.

206
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,470
Yunqing.

207
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,930
I'll take you away.

208
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,470
You go first.

209
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,390
You know what to say

210
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,910
and what not to say,

211
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,510
right?

212
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,600
Understood.

213
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,230
Hurry.

214
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,470
Report this to Her Majesty at once.

215
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,990
Yes.

216
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,590
Inside are money and medicine for wounds.

217
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,370
You can't stay in the capital anymore.

218
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,130
Leave as soon as possible.

219
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,310
Hyah!

220
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,370
About the matter with General Zhennan
back then...

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,460
I wasn't on your side.

222
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,430
Yes.

223
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,430
But this time,

224
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,430
you're on my side.

225
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,490
Back then, you didn't support me

226
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,270
because you were protecting

227
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,730
my country and its people.

228
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,290
Now I've chosen your side...

229
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,240
to protect your pure-hearted ideals.

230
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,710
In the end...

231
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,570
you were just acting out of selfishness.

232
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,710
It's not out of selfishness.

233
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,670
It's human nature.

234
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,010
For me?

235
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,600
And also for myself.

236
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,030
You are the Emperor!

237
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,220
You are the current sovereign!

238
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,990
There were so many other ways.

239
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,470
You've really gone mad.

240
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,150
Fake death, disguise,

241
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,320
jailbreak—you didn't use any of them!

242
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,670
What do you plan to do next?

243
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,050
Make myself an example

244
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,990
to silence them.

245
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,470
His Majesty has arrived!

246
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,100
[Benevolence and People First]

247
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,900
[Benevolence and People First]

248
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,070
Jiang Yunqing has escaped from prison.

249
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,510
It was entirely my fault.

250
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,750
If I hadn't been so impatient

251
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,910
and had interrogated her alone,

252
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,870
she wouldn't have been able

253
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,230
to escape so easily.

254
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,430
It is I who have failed

255
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,270
this country and its people.

256
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,590
Your Majesty, you're being too hard
on yourself!

257
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,300
Please rise, Your Majesty!

258
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,400
[Benevolence and People First]

259
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,390
I...

260
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,790
also have failed

261
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,160
all of you who have placed your trust
in me.

262
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,090
I must apologize to you.

263
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,710
-Your Majesty, don't!
-Your Majesty, don't!

264
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,790
-We wouldn't dare accept, Your Majesty!
-We wouldn't dare accept, Your Majesty!

265
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,230
We wouldn't dare to accept
Your Majesty's apology.

266
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,030
Your Majesty!

267
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,590
So you won't accept my apology?

268
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,590
We wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

269
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,870
We wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

270
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,830
I understand.

271
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,110
I should atone with my life.

272
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,530
Father.

273
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,920
Your son has come to join you.

274
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,710
Your Majesty!

275
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,790
You must not do this!

276
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,470
Your Majesty!

277
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,390
Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

278
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,190
Your Majesty.

279
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,150
Then you don't want me

280
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,750
to atone with my life either.

281
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,390
So you'll just forgive me like that?

282
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,710
Your Majesty,

283
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,880
now...

284
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,130
the criminal has escaped.

285
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,870
Your Majesty

286
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,390
has been wholeheartedly
managing the realm.

287
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,770
What fault does Your Majesty have?

288
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,230
I think...

289
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,810
the most important thing right now is

290
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,300
to capture the criminal.

291
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,470
Indeed.

292
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,550
That makes sense.

293
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,130
What about the rest of you?

294
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,670
Your Majesty!

295
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,950
Is this what you all think?

296
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,880
-We concur, Your Majesty.
-We concur, Your Majesty.

297
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,290
Since you all...

298
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,950
think this way...

299
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,160
quickly issue the arrest warrant.

300
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,330
-Your Majesty is wise.
-Your Majesty is wise.

301
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,830
I am tired.

302
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,710
You may withdraw.

303
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,670
Court dismissed!

304
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,560
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.

305
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,630
I have a headache.

306
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,250
I can't attend the morning court.

307
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,290
My tooth hurts.

308
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:18,740
[Qian Duoduo; Wei Zi'ang;
Zhang Xuwen; Wang Shiling]

309
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,890
Now I've chosen your side

310
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,600
to protect your pure-hearted ideals.

311
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,640
My throat hurts.

312
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,460
[Visionary Insight]

313
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,150
Uncle Liu,

314
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,830
don't come here anymore.

315
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm dead.

316
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,120
I can't attend the morning court anymore.

317
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,110
Dead?

318
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,790
That's what the Yue family's servant said.

319
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,910
They're really something.

320
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,510
Your Majesty!

321
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,230
Where are you going?

322
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,160
To pay respects!

323
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,310
Pay respects?

324
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,210
Please offer one on my behalf
as well, Your Majesty.

325
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,720
-What's wrong?
-Young Master.

326
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,960
His Majesty's here.

327
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,110
Why is he here?

328
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,110
Didn't you tell them that I was sick?

329
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,110
I did.

330
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,030
He said you should rest well,

331
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,630
and there's no need to
announce his arrival.

332
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,510
He said he wanted to look around himself.

333
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,640
How long has he been here?

334
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,440
Quite a while.

335
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

336
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,570
He's the Emperor.

337
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,040
He wouldn't let me.

338
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,760
Found the right sick voice.

339
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,470
You're standing a bit too close.

340
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,310
Pull it back a bit farther.

341
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,590
Raise your arms higher.

342
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,470
The stone will drop as it flies,

343
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,550
so you need to aim

344
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,310
a bit higher

345
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,150
than the pear.

346
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,670
Shoot.

347
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,830
See?

348
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,030
Am I right?

349
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,990
I hit it!

350
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,670
Yue, look! I hit the pear!

351
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,120
That's impressive.

352
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,580
Shuo.

353
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,510
Why don't you go inside first?

354
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,170
We have something to discuss.

355
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,230
Go.

356
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,320
He's very smart.

357
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,870
And mature beyond his years.

358
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,830
What brings you here?

359
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,670
Not busy today?

360
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,370
Come to check on my supposedly sick
Right Prime Minister...

361
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,360
who's still able to drink.

362
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,990
Your Majesty, that's too much.

363
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,750
I finally

364
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,030
found a chance to rest,

365
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,770
and here you come all this way
to scold me.

366
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,830
Yue Chi.

367
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,770
Running away solves nothing.

368
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,240
What's done is done,

369
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,730
and the outcome is set.

370
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,520
Avoiding it

371
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,670
won't change that.

372
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,590
I'm not avoiding anything.

373
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,120
Then why didn't you attend
the morning court?

374
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,430
I'm sick.

375
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,400
Yue Chi!

376
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,750
Alright.

377
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,310
I just...

378
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,670
feel a bit guilty.

379
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,310
Since you feel guilty,

380
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,230
then work with me to

381
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,330
protect the realm.

382
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,590
I'm not a good Prime Minister.

383
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,450
And I'm not a good Emperor either.

384
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,830
So, let's join hands

385
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,970
and try to be a good pair
of ruler and minister.

386
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,960
And what if we fail?

387
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,940
Then let's bring chaos
to the court together.

388
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,840
Court dismissed!

389
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,400
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.
-Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off.

390
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,310
Right Prime Minister.

391
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,710
You finally decided to come to court?

392
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,840
I have important matters to attend to.

393
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,350
[Fengyuan Hall]

394
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,240
Greetings to Your Majesty.

395
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,190
What's with you today?

396
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,510
Your etiquette is so proper.

397
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,950
I was worried about you,

398
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,080
so I came to check on you specifically.

399
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,390
During the court session,

400
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,920
you seemed absent-minded.

401
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,310
When the ministers were speaking,

402
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,570
you kept drifting off.

403
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,110
I had a dream last night.

404
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,920
Dreamed all night long.

405
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,270
All about Ling'er.

406
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,160
Dreamed about Ling'er?

407
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,920
What were you doing in your dream?

408
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,830
Shame on you!

409
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,850
Could you not be so dirty-minded?

410
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,450
I dreamed that Ling'er...

411
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,550
was in a thick fog.

412
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,950
I couldn't see her.

413
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,590
But I just felt

414
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,310
that she was in danger.

415
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,950
Dreams often mean the opposite of reality.

416
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,750
You're the Emperor—you really
believe in such things?

417
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,230
No.

418
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,590
This dream

419
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,040
is precisely a warning to me.

420
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,830
Think about it.

421
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,790
If Yi Qingyun,

422
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,050
the Crown Prince of Li,

423
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,190
not only bought off Cao Mang

424
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,470
but also turned Jiang Yunqing

425
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,870
into his pawn,

426
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,110
then imagine how big

427
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,440
the web he's weaving is.

428
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,210
Are there his people in the court?

429
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,700
In the harem?

430
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,300
There must be.

431
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,030
So,

432
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,790
our top priority is to get

433
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,250
Ling'er out of the palace.

434
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,680
You mean...

435
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,510
to let the consort leave the palace
temporarily to worship Buddha?

436
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,270
No.

437
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,320
Once and for all.

438
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,500
Of course, it's fake.

439
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,230
The fact that you disguised yourself

440
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,840
as Concubine Yue to enter the harem

441
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,490
is no longer a secret.

442
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,270
At least,

443
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,930
Jiang Yunqing knows about it.

444
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,080
So,

445
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,070
we might as well kill two birds
with one stone.

446
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,070
We can make Consort Yue

447
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,190
disappear for good

448
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,990
and have Ling'er leave the palace safely.

449
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,310
You don't have to worry about those things

450
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,370
you did before being exposed either.

451
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,590
How wise.

452
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,710
Therefore,

453
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,500
I'll give you three days

454
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,020
to come up with a reasonable plan

455
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,420
for Consort Yue's death.

456
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,360
Me?

457
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,290
Three days?

458
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,690
I should have kept pretending to be sick

459
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,490
and not attended morning court!

460
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,310
Three days.

461
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,310
Two plans.

462
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,130
There's one more thing that's a pain.

463
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,830
You think

464
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,090
Ling'er will agree

465
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,000
to leave the palace?

466
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm not leaving the palace.

467
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,310
I just said you were sensible.

468
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,430
I don't want to leave the palace.

469
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,900
But you are the Emperor.

470
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,430
I have no choice but to obey.

471
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,520
The way you say it

472
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,230
makes it sound like I'm forcing you.

473
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,950
Actually, what I meant to say is,

474
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,010
I don't need to hide

475
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,470
behind all of you forever.

476
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,230
At least while I'm in the palace,

477
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,890
I can still watch over you all.

478
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,320
Ling'er.

479
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,760
You can watch over us...

480
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,360
while you're in the palace,

481
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,670
but everyone else

482
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,680
is also watching you.

483
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,110
They're even trying to use you

484
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,960
to find dirt on your brother.

485
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,510
If the fact that your brother

486
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,310
impersonated you

487
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,910
becomes widely known,

488
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,590
they could then charge him with

489
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,230
the crime of defiling the harem

490
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,410
and accuse me of being licentious.

491
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,750
At that time,

492
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,490
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

493
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,170
Alright, I'll leave the palace.

494
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,230
But Your Majesty, you must promise me

495
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,140
that no matter what happens,

496
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,830
you will always keep me informed.

497
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,590
Please don't make me worry.

498
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,820
Alright.

499
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,150
I know.

500
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,380
Your Majesty.

501
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,310
Your Majesty...

502
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,630
An urgent report from the Magistrate

503
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,230
of Miyang County,
under Qi City jurisdiction.

504
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,990
[This morning, this subject, County Magistrate of Miyang in Qi City, discovered the whereabouts
of Princess Wen Rou of the Northern Commandery from the former dynasty]

505
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,990
[The princess is safe and well and wishes to come to the capital to pay respects to
Your Majesty and the Empress Dowager. Respectfully requesting permission]

506
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,790
What is it?

507
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,710
Princess Wen Rou, daughter of

508
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,440
the Prince of Northern Commandery,

509
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,830
missing for years,

510
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,290
has suddenly reappeared.

511
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,520
Princess Wen Rou...

512
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,470
That name sounds quite pleasant.

513
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,350
Our Huo family

514
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,280
and the Prince of Northern Commandery

515
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,990
have been family friends for generations.

516
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,780
The Prince of Northern Commandery

517
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,470
was also a founding hero

518
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,980
who died in battle.

519
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,430
It's just that his fate was unfortunate.

520
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,550
His whole family is either dead
or scattered,

521
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,470
and only one descendant remains.

522
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,440
She should be brought

523
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,660
to the capital to enjoy a peaceful life.

524
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,780
But after all these years,

525
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,630
there's been no news of her.

526
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,540
How did she suddenly

527
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,990
appear in Qi City?

528
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,450
The County Magistrate of Miyang said

529
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,150
she had just been rescued
from the mountains.

530
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,570
However, Princess Wen Rou

531
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,030
is quite eager to come here

532
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,470
to pay her respects to Your Majesty.

533
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,750
Then let

534
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,480
the County Magistrate of Miyang
escort her here.

535
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,830
This girl

536
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,630
must have also

537
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,030
suffered a lot.

538
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

539
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,550
Wen Rou pays her respects to Your Majesty

540
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,680
and Your Majesty the Empress Dowager.

541
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,450
Quick, get up, get up. Have a seat.

542
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,270
Princess,

543
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,150
it's been so long since we last met.

544
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,390
Why did you end up in Qi City?

545
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,470
I apologize for not coming sooner

546
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,520
to pay my respects.

547
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,170
Please forgive me.

548
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,470
I...

549
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,900
I...

550
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,110
Speak freely.

551
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,730
What exactly have you been through
all these years?

552
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,990
The Empress Dowager and I

553
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,650
will certainly see that justice
is done for you.

554
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

555
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,080
Two and a half years ago,

556
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,750
[War Report: Prince of Northern Commandery died in battle,
and all 30,000 soldiers of the Northern Commandery perished]

557
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,350
when news of Father's death
in battle arrived,

558
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,400
my mother passed away in grief.

559
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,390
Then our mansion was broken into
by a gang of bandits.

560
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,060
I escaped in the chaos

561
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,910
but fell into the clutches
of human traffickers.

562
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,530
They even broke my leg.

563
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,030
Fortunately, an old lady took pity on me

564
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,730
and secretly set me free.

565
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,470
I went with her into the mountains

566
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,420
and hid there the whole time.

567
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,380
Only recently,

568
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,210
after my health improved,

569
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,620
did I finally gather the courage
to come out and inquire.

570
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,830
Only then did I learn

571
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,070
that Jingheng had already
achieved victory,

572
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,810
ushering Ning into a new era.

573
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,000
I hurried to the nearest county office.

574
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,290
Only then did I find out

575
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,910
that I had been in

576
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,070
Miyang County under Qicheng's Qi City
for the past two years.

577
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,000
All these years,

578
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,250
you've suffered greatly.

579
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,870
I will arrange

580
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,270
everything properly for you

581
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,790
to comfort the spirits of your parents
in heaven.

582
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,440
That's right. Jingheng,

583
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,630
how about

584
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,440
letting her stay in the capital?

585
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,040
It'll be convenient for us
to take care of her.

586
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,710
Your Majesty,
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager,

587
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,870
I hope to stay in the palace

588
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,840
to serve you.

589
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,180
Serve...

590
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,040
Your Majesty?

591
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,390
Silly girl,

592
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,310
what's so good about life in the palace?

593
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,980
It's much freer outside the palace.

594
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,220
Princess,

595
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,300
I have a younger brother

596
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,550
who is still unmarried.

597
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,870
If you don't mind,

598
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,190
you could consider meeting him.

599
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,260
He is handsome and intelligent.

600
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,040
Please forgive me, but I must decline.

601
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,850
I'm still fearful and uneasy.

602
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
The only ones I trust

603
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,830
are Your Majesty and His Majesty.

604
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,030
I beg for your mercy and allow me to stay.

605
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,670
Princess Wen Rou has had a long
and tiring journey.

606
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,070
Please go and rest first.

607
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,310
I will

608
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,600
discuss it

609
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,190
thoroughly with Mother.

610
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,190
Yes, indeed.

611
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,460
Please rise, please rise quickly.

612
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,670
Then...

613
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,540
I shall take my leave now.

614
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,270
Mother, what are you doing?

615
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,470
Here I was, worrying

616
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,310
you might be too shy around women.

617
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,470
It seems I was overly concerned.

618
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,430
Behind the scenes,

619
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,070
you're quite the seducer.

620
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,850
What are you talking about,

621
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,350
Mother?

622
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,430
Am I wrong?

623
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,870
If you hadn't been leading her on,

624
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,190
why would a perfectly good girl

625
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,250
want to enter the palace to serve you?

626
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,280
Because you're good-looking?

627
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,460
How would I know?

628
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,870
Have you all heard?

629
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,950
That orphaned daughter of the Prince of
Northern Commandery—Wen Rou—

630
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,960
has been arranged to stay at
Qunyu Pavilion.

631
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,810
Really?

632
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,160
That garden is quite large.

633
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,720
It's just a bit far from Yongqian Palace.

634
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,030
Far or not,

635
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,150
His Majesty doesn't visit the harem
much anyway.

636
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,730
If he does come, it will be to
Fengluan Palace.

637
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,550
Why are you all looking at me?

638
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,950
If you want to come over,

639
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,910
you can all move

640
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,370
into Fengluan Palace too.

641
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,020
Come on, smell this new incense I made.

642
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,250
How's it going?

643
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,630
Have you thought of the plans

644
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,490
I asked you for?

645
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,470
The preliminary plan

646
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,400
is that she dies of illness.

647
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,560
Elaborate on it.

648
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,850
Still working on the details.

649
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,580
I need to get out more.

650
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,190
See?

651
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,930
Inspiration has just struck.

652
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,230
I heard

653
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,510
there's a new arrival in the harem,

654
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,070
the daughter of the
Prince of Northern Commandery.

655
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,490
Supposedly your childhood sweetheart,

656
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,420
and you two were betrothed
before you were even born?

657
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,000
Nonsense.

658
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,870
So, are you going to marry her or not?

659
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,670
I've heard quite a few

660
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,670
rumors about her.

661
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,719
There's even a rumor...

662
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,590
that she'll become the future Empress.

663
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,480
Empress?

664
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,920
That she will never be.

665
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,750
However...

666
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,270
this world-renowned
Prince of Northern Commandery

667
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,730
died in battle.

668
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,150
He was a founding meritorious general.

669
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,989
Naturally...

670
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,560
I must treat his daughter with
the respect she deserves.

671
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,630
What's with that look?

672
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,449
You didn't get along with him in the past?

673
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,199
He's already no longer with us.

674
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,600
Why bring up such trivial matters?

675
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,230
The Prince of Northern Commandery
died on the battlefield.

676
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,710
He was a meritorious official.

677
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,880
It's only right

678
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,909
that I posthumously honor him

679
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,870
and treat his daughter well.

680
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,270
Then...

681
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,429
the position of Empress...

682
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,130
Shut up.

683
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,940
I never intended to

684
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,190
keep Wen Rou

685
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,190
in the harem.

686
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,150
If you really don't like her,

687
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,880
then just keep her in the harem.

688
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,110
After all, your harem

689
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,160
is full of concubines.

690
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,020
One more won't make a difference.

691
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,350
Every family is trying to send
their daughters to the harem.

692
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,790
They all want your favor.

693
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,690
All those concubines in the harem

694
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,310
were sent by their parents

695
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,640
to the palace

696
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,580
as pawns to gain my favor.

697
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,240
They're pitiful, in their own way.

698
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,130
Wouldn't keeping Wen Rou in the harem

699
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,950
just be wasting her life?

700
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,630
I'm just stating the facts.

701
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,750
Alright,

702
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,950
it's getting late.

703
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,750
Let's go back.

704
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,320
Do I have to go back with you?

705
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,270
Let's go, Prime Minister Yue!

706
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,400
There's a pile of memorials to review!

707
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,270
Is this plan feasible?

708
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,490
It's feasible.

709
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,000
I have everything prepared.

710
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:07,150
[Yongqian Palace]

711
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,950
Your Majesty.

712
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,870
I have prepared some

713
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,270
local delicacies from
the Northern Commandery.

714
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,000
Please try them, Your Majesty.

715
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,310
You shouldn't have troubled yourself
with this trip.

716
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,070
You could have just had someone
deliver them.

717
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,870
Your Majesty granted me residence at
Qunyu Pavilion,

718
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,430
but hasn't come to visit yet.

719
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,560
I also wanted to come see Your Majesty.

720
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,950
Your Majesty,

721
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,510
I shall take my leave now.

722
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,790
Well, well, Yue Chi,

723
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,490
running off and leaving me
to deal with this.

724
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,310
Prime Minister Yue has matters to report?

725
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,480
I will announce your arrival.

726
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,790
No need.

727
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,700
I'd like to see

728
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,830
if you will

729
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,990
betray my sister.

730
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,120
Let me attend to Your Majesty.

731
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,900
No need.

732
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,140
I've long heard that Your Majesty

733
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,070
enjoys collecting various weapons.

734
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,790
Now that I see

735
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,050
this little piece,

736
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,090
I'm quite fond of it too.

737
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,560
I wonder if Your Majesty

738
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,470
would be willing to part with it.

739
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,990
This dagger...

740
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,870
is indeed exquisitely crafted.

741
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,740
No wonder you like it.

742
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,120
But I'm... reluctant to part with it.

743
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,070
Stingy,

744
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,150
it's a tea knife. Just give it to her.

745
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,210
Is it worth talking about for so long?

746
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,600
Your Majesty...

747
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,720
truly won't reconsider?

748
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,680
I won't.

749
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,510
Princess,

750
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,130
go to Shoukang Palace.

751
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,850
Go to the Empress Dowager.

752
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,320
I'm too stingy.

753
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,070
