[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,730
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,470
Do you think he doesn't like me?

4
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,370
Are there really men

5
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,870
who don't like me?

6
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,670
Impossible.

7
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,530
Your Highness, you're stunning.

8
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,430
But...

9
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
he doesn't even look at me.

10
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,280
Maybe he's just nervous.

11
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,300
Your Highness, you're stunning.

12
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,100
Can't you say something useful?

13
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,930
Didn't you just go inquire about it?

14
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,030
Your Highness,

15
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,190
I did.

16
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,229
His Majesty rarely visits the harem.

17
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,350
It seems

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,420
he's not into women.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,570
But the consorts

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,590
don't seem to mind at all.

21
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,190
They all get along just fine.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,710
It's really strange.

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,430
If they're not fighting for favor,

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,509
what do they even do usually?

25
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,060
We're

26
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,729
short by 128 taels of silver here.

27
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,690
I kept quiet

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,920
to save your dignity.

29
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,070
But you're getting

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,470
bolder and bolder.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,380
Remember to open the windows.

32
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,770
No slacking off.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,750
Keep up with me.

34
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,990
Let's do it again.

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,000
Ready,

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,190
go!

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,350
No matter what,

38
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,790
I will definitely avenge my father.

39
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,740
Your Highness,

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,630
the Emperor used to be

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,850
a man of the martial world.

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,860
His martial arts skills are superb.

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,329
We...

44
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,079
Even if it costs me everything,

45
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,510
I'll kill him.

46
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,270
Back then,

47
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,390
my father led troops to support him.

48
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,670
But at the critical moment,

49
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,690
he abandoned my father

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,820
and refused to send troops to save him.

51
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,230
What a scoundrel.

52
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,520
If he had even a shred of humanity,

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,360
my father wouldn't have died.

54
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,960
A man like that

55
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,360
doesn't deserve to live.

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,310
Your Highness, don't worry.

57
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,070
There might be

58
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,190
a chance you can

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,510
use to your advantage.

60
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,990
What is it?

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,870
His Majesty favors only

62
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,410
Consort Yue in Fengluan Palace.

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,190
Consort Yue?

64
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,300
He favors only her?

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,270
Yes.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
His Majesty is not easy to approach.

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,570
Getting close to this favored consort

68
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,070
might be our best indirect strategy.

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,840
[Fengluan Palace]

70
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,130
Die of illness?

71
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,190
Why don't you two

72
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,630
just poison me directly?

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,590
It's your brother's idea.

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,950
He really is my brother.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,230
Alright,

76
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,880
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,540
Stop putting food on my plate.

78
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,550
I don't dare to eat it.

79
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,430
I actually think

80
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,149
this is a good idea.

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,670
The question is

82
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,930
how to make it happen in a reasonable way.

83
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,790
You should eat more.

84
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,910
You're about to die from illness.

85
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,030
Quick,

86
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,030
knock on wood!

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,120
Alright.

88
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,830
I really fell for your trick

89
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,150
and believed your nonsense.

90
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,950
You two...

91
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,630
You two must

92
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,990
keep me safe.

93
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,510
One is your brother,

94
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,030
and the other is your…

95
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,070
You don't trust us?

96
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,190
One is my brother...

97
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,310
And what is the other one to me?

98
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,070
Tell me.

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,190
Just eat.

100
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,310
I heard

101
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,280
Wen Rou moved into Qunyu Pavilion.

102
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,550
Your Majesty,

103
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,610
when do you plan to make her a consort?

104
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,750
I also heard that Wen Rou,

105
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,870
a girl as beautiful

106
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,110
as a flower,

107
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,670
is extremely attentive

108
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,430
and eager

109
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,550
to serve Your Majesty.

110
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,110
That's true.

111
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,310
Wen Rou isn't like you.

112
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,310
What's wrong with me?

113
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,430
What's wrong with me?

114
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,430
You're gentle too.

115
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,590
You're gentle too.

116
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,430
I've been staying up late

117
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,070
reviewing memorials,

118
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,180
and my shoulders are a bit sore.

119
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,890
Dear, would you please give me a massage?

120
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,880
These past few days,

121
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,750
I've been practicing embroidery,

122
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,900
and my shoulders and neck are really sore.

123
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,230
Your Majesty, how about you

124
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,560
give me a massage first?

125
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,150
Your Highness, let me help you.

126
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,210
Yue,

127
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,110
let me do it.

128
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,310
I have strong hands.

129
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,070
Where does it hurt?

130
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,570
Everywhere hurts.

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,910
How about here?

132
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,710
Can you press harder?

133
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,910
Harder?

134
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,010
How's that, Dear?

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,950
Very good.

136
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,190
Yue.

137
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,650
Your Highness.

138
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,560
Coming.

139
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,520
Has His Majesty left?

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,470
He has been at court for a while now.

141
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,800
What time is it already?

142
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,550
Let me tell you,

143
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,950
I read another

144
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,010
super interesting novel last night.

145
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,680
I just stayed up a bit late reading it.

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,290
Your Highness,

147
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,750
let's have breakfast.

148
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,370
His Majesty specially ordered

149
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,770
it to be kept warm for you.

150
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,950
Ling'er, are you here?

151
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,530
I'm Wen Rou.

152
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,110
Greetings, Ling'er.

153
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,910
I apologize for my rudeness.

154
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,870
I haven't visited you

155
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,510
since I came to the palace.

156
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,870
So you're Wen Rou.

157
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,310
You really are very gentle.

158
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,670
Actually,

159
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,790
you're a bit older than me.

160
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,780
You can just call me Ling'er.

161
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,190
You live up to your name too.

162
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,960
I liked you the moment I saw you.

163
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,680
I came to visit you today

164
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,460
but I don't have anything presentable.

165
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,460
So I just made some

166
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,930
homemade local dishes
from the Northern Commandery.

167
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,510
Please don't laugh
if they're not well made.

168
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,550
I won't.

169
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,990
Did you...

170
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,830
make all these yourself?

171
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,990
Oh my goodness.

172
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,520
You haven't eaten breakfast yet, right?

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,980
How about we eat together?

174
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,950
Alright.

175
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,900
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

176
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,540
This is delicious too.

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,270
Oh, I lost.

178
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,630
Your chess skills are amazing.

179
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,270
It was just luck.

180
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,090
I can't believe someone said
I'm good at chess.

181
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,390
The Empress Dowager is here!

182
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,910
The small kitchen

183
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,540
made some braised dishes.

184
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,390
I specially had them

185
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,310
sent over.

186
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,910
Your Majesty, you are so kind to me,

187
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,790
even kinder

188
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,840
than my own brother.

189
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,750
Of course I am.

190
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,910
Eunuch Wang.

191
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,900
Yue,

192
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
go pour some tea for Her Majesty.

193
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,160
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,230
I've been wondering.

195
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,790
Ever since Wen Rou got here,

196
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,180
Consort Yue hasn't come
to visit me anymore.

197
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,370
Everyone says

198
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,520
there's a young girl

199
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,340
in Fengluan Palace who keeps Consort Yue

200
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,990
company every day.

201
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,870
So that's you, Wen Rou.

202
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,670
Haha.

203
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,800
Ling'er and I hit it off right away.

204
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,150
And with

205
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,340
the care from you and His Majesty,

206
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,310
it really feels like home now.

207
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,470
That's good.

208
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,070
I'm glad to hear that.

209
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,460
Mother, please don't be angry.

210
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,070
It's all my fault.

211
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,670
Where is your consort?

212
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,510
Her Highness is playing chess

213
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,770
with Princess Wen Rou.

214
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,660
The Empress Dowager is here too.

215
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,070
Wen Rou again?

216
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,710
Didn't they just go flower viewing

217
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,950
together yesterday?

218
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,990
Princess Wen Rou comes every day,

219
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,430
almost as often as you do.

220
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,350
I'll brew some

221
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,030
new plum wine

222
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,970
and send it to you.

223
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,270
It goes perfectly with the braised dishes.

224
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,510
Let me serve you some now.

225
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,430
Wait.

226
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,770
I'm abstaining from alcohol and meat now.

227
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,790
Because tomorrow,

228
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,450
I'm going to Cheng'en Temple
to worship Buddha.

229
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,110
I didn't expect you

230
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,790
to be so devout.

231
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,420
Then why did you bring so much

232
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,430
pig's head meat and pork knuckles?

233
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,370
I heard you ate

234
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,570
a lot of them too.

235
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,270
Shut up.

236
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm only starting it tomorrow.

237
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,510
Besides, wine and meat
pass through the intestines,

238
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,190
but Buddha stays in my heart forever.

239
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,910
Pour me some wine.

240
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,830
Sir,

241
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,180
we're about to close.

242
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,910
You've been rushing us all along.

243
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,390
What's the rush?

244
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,180
Do I look like I don't have money,

245
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,400
or like I haven't given you money?

246
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,910
Do you even know

247
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,560
who I am?

248
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,860
Please, keep drinking.

249
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,830
Please enjoy.

250
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,030
Your Highness,

251
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
we should keep a low profile.

252
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,660
Although the situation recently

253
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,320
isn't as tense as it was before,

254
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
after all,

255
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,600
this isn't our territory.

256
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,660
What am I afraid of?

257
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,150
Am I afraid of Huo Jingheng?

258
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,770
Or...

259
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,840
Yue Chi?

260
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
Keep your voice down,

261
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,780
Your Highness.

262
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,870
I've arranged everything.

263
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,670
We'll

264
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,570
depart for

265
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,340
Man Tribe tomorrow

266
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,270
as planned.

267
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,510
I'm not afraid of anyone.

268
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,060
I'm afraid...

269
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,870
I'm afraid of Rou.

270
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,830
How's...

271
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,110
How's Wen Rou doing?

272
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,990
Rou.

273
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,010
It's such a long journey.

274
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,760
Why are you here?

275
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,540
You must be exhausted.

276
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,470
Have some water.

277
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,390
Have you done

278
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,590
what you promised me?

279
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,900
For General Zhennan,

280
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,100
we took a huge risk.

281
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,070
Was it worth it?

282
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,900
Huo Jingheng

283
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,570
is still sitting securely on his throne.

284
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,230
Has his reign been shaken in
the slightest?

285
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,060
Rou.

286
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,110
Are you here to blame me?

287
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,190
I won't think of anything else

288
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,670
until I've avenged my father.

289
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,730
I should've stopped you back then!

290
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,310
I never thought

291
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,990
you'd actually

292
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,910
settle in the palace.

293
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,420
My Lord, My Lord.

294
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,670
Stop drinking.

295
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,920
We're setting off early tomorrow.

296
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,740
Right.

297
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,550
Right.

298
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,690
I can't stay in Qi City any longer.

299
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,990
We'll leave tomorrow.

300
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,520
We're heading to the capital!

301
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,670
The capital?

302
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,600
No, you can't. It's too dangerous.

303
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm going to find my Rou.

304
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,270
How is it?

305
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,730
This protective gear is incredible.

306
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,310
Not only can you

307
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,590
jump down from a pony,

308
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,940
but even jumping off a high platform

309
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,140
won't hurt you at all.

310
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,750
That's good.

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,950
We must ensure

312
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,010
Ling'er's safety.

313
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,110
Exactly, exactly.

314
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,240
Why are you everywhere?

315
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,830
Get lost.

316
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,870
It's about Ling'er's safety.

317
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,390
And you want to keep me in the dark?

318
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,260
We'll start implementing the
plan tomorrow.

319
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,320
We have to get everything settled

320
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,380
while my mother

321
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,310
is at Cheng'en Temple

322
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,670
worshipping Buddha,

323
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,940
so we won't have to

324
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
explain it to her later.

325
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't worry.

326
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,950
I've already spoken with

327
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,750
the stable.

328
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,850
The horse is gentle and small.

329
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,640
Ling'er just needs to

330
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,240
jump on it.

331
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,030
By then,

332
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,500
everyone around will say that

333
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,030
Consort Yue was thrown off
her horse during a ride

334
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,560
and was seriously injured.

335
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,820
Then I'll go along too.

336
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,130
I'll pretend to go riding,

337
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,260
so I'll be a witness.

338
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,240
That's good too.

339
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,350
But speaking of which,

340
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,050
why has

341
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,900
Ling'er been so close

342
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,700
to that Princess Wen Rou lately?

343
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,810
Wen Rou is everywhere Ling'er goes.

344
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm puzzled too.

345
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,390
Wen Rou is always around,

346
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,060
and Ling'er

347
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,440
keeps talking about her in front of me,

348
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,410
saying

349
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,280
how kind she is to everyone.

350
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,270
My sister

351
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,230
has no sense of competition at all.

352
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,730
Does Ling'er even need to compete?

353
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,120
I completely understand how you feel.

354
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,990
Save that

355
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,080
for the person you should be telling.

356
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm wearing so many layers
that I look like a ball.

357
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,590
It's obvious

358
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,090
to everyone.

359
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,030
Consort Yue?

360
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,060
What a coincidence.

361
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,040
Imperial Uncle.

362
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,540
What a coincidence.
You're here to ride too?

363
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,070
Yes.

364
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,410
Who are you putting on this act for?

365
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,850
Ling'er,

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,840
you can jump when it feels right.

367
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,430
Will it hurt?

368
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,950
It shouldn't.

369
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Be careful!

370
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,310
Wen Rou?

371
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,850
Why are you here?

372
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,970
I heard you came riding,

373
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,750
so I came to check in.

374
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,740
I'm quite good at riding.

375
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,670
Let me teach you.

376
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,200
Really?

377
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,310
Amazing!

378
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,910
Watch and learn!

379
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,930
You purposely went to the stable

380
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,750
and ended up twisting your ankle?

381
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,150
How is this my fault?

382
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,109
Who would have thought

383
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,589
an accident would suddenly occur?

384
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,869
I also didn't expect

385
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,690
Wen Rou to show up all of a sudden.

386
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,670
You two have been

387
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,470
unusually close lately.

388
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,030
Although she

389
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,490
ruined our plan this time,

390
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,859
I guess...

391
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,359
it showed the strength of our friendship.

392
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,540
You should be more careful.

393
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,230
Who else in this world

394
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,910
would treat you well

395
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,110
for no reason besides your brother?

396
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,840
-Me, of course.
-Me, of course.

397
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,350
Well, now

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,590
we need to prepare

399
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,340
a backup plan.

400
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,650
I told you to have one ready
from the start.

401
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,810
Easy for you to say.

402
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,910
I've already prepared one.

403
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,870
I knew I couldn't count on you.

404
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,940
Hurry up and tell me—

405
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,210
this time,

406
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,990
how am I supposed to die?

407
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,260
[Fengyuan Hall]

408
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,790
If there's something to report, speak.

409
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,520
If not, you may leave the court.

410
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,090
Your Majesty!

411
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,270
I

412
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
have an important matter to report.

413
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,040
What important matter does
the Astronomical Bureau have?

414
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,160
Last night, I observed the stars

415
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,850
and witnessed

416
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,990
a strange phenomenon that has

417
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,030
never happened since entering the palace.

418
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,710
It may threaten

419
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,870
the fate of the nation, Your Majesty!

420
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,190
Silence.

421
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,710
If that is so,

422
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,270
is there a way to resolve it?

423
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,890
There is one solution.

424
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,630
However…

425
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,360
It concerns the destiny of Ning.

426
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,320
Speak freely.

427
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,950
According to astrology records,

428
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,170
to dispel this strange phenomenon,

429
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,090
a concubine

430
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,150
born at noon

431
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,810
in the harem

432
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,460
must offer three bowls of blood

433
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,330
to Heaven every day

434
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,050
for 10 consecutive days.

435
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,990
A concubine

436
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,670
in my harem

437
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,470
born at noon?

438
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,450
I

439
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,590
have checked the birth times

440
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,850
of all the concubines.

441
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,830
Only Consort Yue

442
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,400
was born at noon.

443
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,000
Consort Yue?

444
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,100
She really has bad luck.

445
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,660
Your Majesty,

446
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,550
I believe

447
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,070
that this matter cannot be confirmed

448
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,710
based on the word of one person alone.

449
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,110
The saying about auspicious signs
in the stars

450
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,250
has existed since ancient times.

451
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,910
However...

452
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,110
Lord Wei,

453
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,600
you are being too cautious.

454
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,970
Your Majesty,

455
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,020
I believe

456
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,250
that throughout history,

457
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,520
every imperial family

458
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,060
has believed in astrology.

459
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,040
Your Majesty,

460
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,000
it's just asking Consort Yue

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,320
to make a small sacrifice

462
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,040
for the sake of Ning's stability.

463
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
She should understand

464
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,000
which is more important.

465
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,310
A small sacrifice?

466
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,790
Why don't you sacrifice yourself?

467
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,030
Now, a dignified imperial consort

468
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,390
is going to offer blood daily
just because of

469
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,760
one word from the Astronomical Bureau.

470
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,310
If her life is endangered,

471
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,410
will you take responsibility?

472
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,940
Right Prime Minister, are you saying

473
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,540
the Astronomical Bureau is talking nonsense?

474
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,820
Mr. Zhang, is your hearing

475
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,030
still not fully recovered?

476
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,360
When did I ever say that?

477
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,410
Silence.

478
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,160
[Qunyu Pavilion]

479
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,890
Although...

480
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,190
Consort Yue is my beloved,

481
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,710
this matter concerns the fate of the nation.

482
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,040
So, it relates

483
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,410
to the people of the realm.

484
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,820
As

485
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,460
the ruler of this country,

486
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,650
I must make sacrifices

487
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,620
and have Consort Yue
offer blood for a few days.

488
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,740
Your Majesty, please reconsider it!

489
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,140
Prime Minister, shut up!

490
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Court dismissed.

491
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,250
I have something to say!

492
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,630
Wen Rou?

493
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,420
Why are you here?

494
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,180
Why is it her again?

495
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,650
Why is it her again?

496
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,480
I heard that the court is discussing

497
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,350
having a woman born at noon

498
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,980
in the harem

499
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,510
offer three bowls of blood.

500
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,890
Consort Yue Ling'er

501
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,750
isn't the only one born at noon.

502
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,320
So am I.

503
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,500
Consort Yue treats me like a sister,

504
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,710
and I know

505
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,580
she is the one Your Majesty loves.

506
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,910
Please grant me

507
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,700
the title of consort now.

508
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,910
I'm willing to offer my blood

509
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,310
to Heaven.

510
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,770
Is she crazy?

511
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,630
What are you doing?

512
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,770
Your Highness,

513
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,490
spilling blood in the great hall

514
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,570
is a serious crime.

515
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,860
Then please, Your Majesty,

516
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,480
execute me.

517
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,460
Then offer my entire body's blood

518
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,660
to Heaven.

519
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,140
What Your Majesty likes

520
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,630
is what I like.

521
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,840
I'm willing to give my life

Go.

527
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,630
Raise your head.

-Go.
-Go.

Go.

533
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,200
Mr. Yi, you really

534
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,560
show up and disappear like a mystery.

535
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,410
Your Highness, aren't you the same?

536
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,290
Instead of returning to your land
while things were calm,

537
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,140
you came to the capital to die.

538
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,360
People die for wealth,

539
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,760
and birds die for food.

540
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,970
But you're a romantic,

541
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,770
with nothing but Princess Wen Rou

542
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,570
in your heart.

543
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,980
That's my personal affair.

544
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,190
I have no time for personal matters.

545
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,510
But the Princess is too naive.

546
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,780
Do you think Huo Jingheng

547
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,420
is that easy to assassinate?

548
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,110
I couldn't talk her out of it.

549
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,690
Her determination for revenge

550
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,090
is truly moving.

551
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,570
Even I was touched.

552
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,730
So today,

553
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,810
I'm here specifically to give you
some information.

554
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,940
If the Princess can prove

555
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,180
it to be true,

556
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,050
she can not only remove

557
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,810
Huo Jingheng's right-hand man

558
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,060
but also shake his hold on the throne.

559
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,970
What information?

560
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,130
Your Highness,
do you know about Consort Yue?

561
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,030
One, two, three, four,

563
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,160
Two, two, three, four...

564
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,380
How am I supposed to faint later?

565
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,950
Just fall down

566
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,080
somewhere crowded.

567
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,880
I'll have someone summon
the imperial physician.

568
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,730
Remember,

569
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,900
don't laugh.

570
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,450
Four, two, three, four.

571
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,830
You don't trust me?

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,590
We were just dancing together.

577
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,380
Come and join us.

578
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,140
Alright.

579
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,270
Ling'er!

580
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,730
-Yue!
-Ling'er!

581
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,310
Yue!

582
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,600
What's wrong with her?

583
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,920
It's probably lingering issues from her

584
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,110
miscarriage that weren't properly treated.

585
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,310
Hurry and call the imperial physician!

586
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,770
Go!

587
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,670
Hurry up!

588
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,350
Yue?

589
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,990
Yue?

590
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,590
Ling'er?

591
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,400
This time, it should work.

592
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,190
Rumor has it in the palace that

593
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,410
Consort Yue's miscarriage left her
so frail

594
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,540
that she might not have much time left.

595
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,590
Indeed.

596
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,950
Everything outside the palace is arranged.

597
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,910
In a few more days,

598
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,100
the time will be just right.

599
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,940
We must

600
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,560
get Ling'er out of the palace

601
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,250
before

602
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,930
the Empress Dowager returns.

603
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,630
It was supposed to be simple—

604
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,520
if it weren't for that Wen Rou.

605
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,610
Do you think...

606
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,380
she's really that close

607
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
to Ling'er?

608
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,870
Or does she...

609
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,650
only like Ling'er because she likes you?

610
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,690
Your Majesty!

611
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,820
Your Majesty!

612
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,410
Your Majesty.

613
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,650
Wen Rou

614
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,630
is practicing

615
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,880
the Eightfold Vajra Technique

616
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,550
with Consort Yue.

617
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,090
Straighten up.

618
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,450
Bring it back.

619
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,270
His Majesty is here!

620
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
My dear Ling'er.

621
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,460
Your body is in such a state.

622
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,690
How can you be out of bed and moving around?

623
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,960
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

624
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,980
I've already given Ling'er

625
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,750
many miraculous medicines

626
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,800
from the Northern Commandery,

627
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,810
specially to treat

628
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,270
weakness after miscarriage.

629
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,740
After several doses,

630
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,550
look how rosy

631
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,950
her complexion is now.

632
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,560
I have invited

633
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,080
several imperial physicians,

634
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,340
and they all say her health is excellent.

635
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,190
Consort Yue,

636
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,500
are you...

637
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,160
really feeling better?

638
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,680
I...

639
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,990
truly am.

640
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,800
Well then,

641
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
thank you.

642
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,480
I will surely take good care

643
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,080
of your beloved.

644
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,050
My sincerity

645
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,010
can be witnessed by the sun and moon—

646
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,000
I only hope

647
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,370
you can see it too.

648
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,170
Rou,

649
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,330
there's one more thing.

650
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,260
Well,

651
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,850
the one

652
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,200
who used to impersonate Consort Yue

653
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,340
was Yue Chi.

654
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,720
It seems Ling'er's repeated encounters
with danger

655
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,650
were all secretly plotted by them,

656
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,980
but I unexpectedly foiled
their plans each time.

657
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,260
I can't let Ling'er—

658
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,310
Consort Yue—

659
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,440
just die so lightly.

660
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,120
Something's not right.

661
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,140
There's something wrong with this Wen Rou.

662
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,260
I think so too.

663
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,430
I've already arranged for someone

664
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,360
to investigate.

665
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,030
Now,

666
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,000
it's too soon to draw conclusions.

667
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,880
It seems the trick

668
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,150
of making her die of illness

669
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,150
inside the palace won't work anymore.

670
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,980
My mother

671
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,290
will return from worshipping

672
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,330
at Cheng'en Temple in three days.

673
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,870
I have an idea,

674
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,200
but it's a bit risky.

675
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,140
Tell me.

676
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,740
Dying from illness takes time

677
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,070
and can easily lead to complications.

678
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,740
Why not make it a sudden death instead?

679
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,690
A sudden death?

680
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,670
It should not happen inside the palace.

681
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,450
That way,

682
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,110
the problem of Consort Yue's body

683
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,370
can be easily handled.

684
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,860
I will just arrange for the guards

685
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,520
to say

686
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,570
the body is missing.

687
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,800
I just

688
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,070
haven't figured out

689
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,430
what reason to use

690
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,960
to get Ling'er out of the palace yet.

691
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,290
It's best if there are many people around.

692
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,150
You just said

693
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,170
the Empress Dowager will return from

694
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,870
Cheng'en Temple three days later, right?

695
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,870
That's after the Lantern Festival?

696
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,120
Yes.

697
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,710
By tradition,

698
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,750
my mother prays for the country

699
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,060
at Cheng'en Temple

700
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,550
every Lantern Festival.

701
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,270
Isn't this

702
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,270
a perfect and natural opportunity?

703
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,930
Rou.

704
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,280
Rou, come.

705
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,720
Sit down.

706
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,690
Rou.

707
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,920
You've lost weight.

708
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,790
I'll get straight to the point.

709
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,210
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

710
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,360
The Emperor will take the harem

711
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,790
to Cheng'en Temple
to meet the Empress Dowager.

712
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,590
At night, they will

713
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,190
release Kongming lanterns
on Lingshou Mountain

714
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,820
outside the temple

715
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,150
to pray for the country.

716
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,790
That's quite a big event.

717
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,390
The reason sounds legitimate.

718
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
It sounds like Huo Jingheng's idea.

719
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,930
But the idea is quite twisted.

720
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,080
I guess Yue Chi suggested it.

721
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,350
They probably want to cause an accident

722
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,350
to have Consort Yue suddenly die.

723
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,590
I'll stay alert.

724
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,500
No.

725
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,150
This is

726
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,040
a rare golden opportunity for us.

727
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,050
We need to turn defense into offense

728
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,840
and make a scene

729
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,610
to liven up the atmosphere.

730
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,230
Prime Minister Yue,

731
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,130
Cheng'en Temple is,
after all, a Buddhist temple.

732
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,640
[Cheng'en Temple]

733
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,840
Painting it like this

734
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,070
feels a bit disrespectful, doesn't it?

735
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,530
These are people?

736
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,490
[Cheng'en Temple]

737
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,350
The position for

738
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,530
releasing the Kongming lanterns
seems a bit off, doesn't it?

739
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,310
trees, trees.

740
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,030
trees, trees.

741
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,960
These are trees.

742
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,950
Just make do with it.

743
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,340
Trees?

744
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,650
At five tomorrow morning,

745
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,400
Your Majesty will lead the concubines

746
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,600
out of the palace

747
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,430
to Cheng'en Temple.

748
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,850
I'll follow shortly after,

749
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,610
take a shortcut,

750
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,260
and go to the temple alone.

751
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,300
At 11 a.m., Your Majesty

752
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,510
[Wetuo Hall]

753
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,030
will arrive at Cheng'en Temple
with the concubines

754
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,590
to meet the Empress Dowager.

755
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,320
By then, I'll already be there,

756
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,130
disguised as a temple servant,

757
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,990
waiting in the firewood room.

758
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,120
At 5 p.m.,

759
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,620
while everyone is resting,

760
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,900
Ling'er will sneak into the firewood room

761
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,430
and switch clothes with me.

762
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,320
At 7 p.m.,

763
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,960
Your Majesty will lead the concubines

764
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,870
to release Kongming lanterns

765
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,640
on Lingshou Mountain next to the temple.

766
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,090
By that time, it'll be dark.

767
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,840
I just need to keep my head down
and walk through the crowd.

768
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,920
If anyone asks,

769
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I'll say my face
is having an allergic reaction again.

770
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,220
Then I'll pretend to slip

771
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,510
and fall off the cliff.

772
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,670
Consort Yue!

773
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,600
Consort Yue!

774
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,540
Consort Yue!

775
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,040
Consort Yue will appear to die on the spot.

776
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,470
But in reality, I'll use my lightness skill

777
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,270
to glide to a lower ledge

778
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,510
beneath the cliff.

779
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,560
Lingshou Mountain is thick with trees,

780
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,020
so I'll hide beneath them.

781
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,020
By then, Ling'er will

782
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,770
already have been taken down the mountain

783
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,650
by Wei Zhang.

784
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,820
Have you

785
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,300
asked Ling'er about this?

786
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,140
Did she agree?

787
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,020
She didn't.

788
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,670
I asked her once too,

789
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,180
but it didn't help.

790
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,290
Then...

791
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,450
we'll just have to make her unhappy for now.

792
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,140
You mean…

793
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,030
Knock her out.

794
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,180
Knock her out?

795
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,230
Who's going to do it?

796
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,070
In past years,

797
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,590
I always prayed for the country
and the people

798
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,060
by myself on this day.

799
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,610
Today,

800
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,260
the Emperor had the concubines

801
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,590
pray with me.

802
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,090
If the gods knew,

803
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,910
[Peaceful Land, Prosperous People]

804
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,110
it must be because

805
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,780
our sincerity moved them.

806
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,550
Your Grace, you're merciful.

807
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,350
Your Majesty, you're merciful.

808
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,850
Don't come any closer.

809
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,290
What is this troublemaker up to now?

810
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,730
Everyone

811
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,300
stay where you are.

812
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,350
Don't move around.

813
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,450
Everyone's position

814
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,080
was calculated in advance

815
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
based on their birth charts.

816
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,240
Moving around randomly

817
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,750
will disrupt the praying.

818
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,210
I've been on to you, you little rascal.

819
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,320
Snake!

820
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,420
Snake!

821
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,120
-No! No!
-I'm so scared!

822
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,670
Ling'er!

823
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,200
-I'm scared too!
-Ling'er!

824
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,610
Where are you putting your hands?

825
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,990
Ling'er,

826
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,900
how did you…

827
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,110
Prime Minister Yue?

828
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,730
How is it you?

829
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,910
Why did Prime Minister Yue
impersonate Consort Yue?

830
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,750
Could it be...

831
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,950
Consort Yue who's been
in the palace all along

832
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,030
is actually Prime Minister Yue?

833
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,080
What a farce.

834
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
How festive indeed.

835
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,460
Is it too late

836
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,929
to jump off the cliff?

837
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,000
How could this happen?

838
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,550
Be quiet.

839
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,210
You're making me dizzy.

840
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm not in the mood

841
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,920
to draw

842
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,810
those useless charms like you do.

843
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,630
Rou.

844
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,460
Rou.

845
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,429
Are you alright?

846
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,790
Did you get hurt?

847
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,110
If she were hurt,

848
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,880
would she show up tonight?

849
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,630
I'm just

850
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,230
worried about Rou's safety.

851
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,590
With the Crown Prince and your plan

852
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,070
being so meticulous,

853
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,860
what is there to worry about?

854
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,750
I suppose the Emperor

855
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,100
hasn't made any decision yet.

856
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,360
But it doesn't matter.

857
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,530
I have already spread the news

858
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,150
that Consort Yue

859
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,950
is actually Yue Chi in disguise.

860
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,940
He was exposed

861
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,170
in front of everyone.

862
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,170
By tomorrow, the taverns and teahouses

863
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,540
will be buzzing.

864
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,620
From now on, Prime Minister Yue

865
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,170
will have to keep a low profile.

866
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,630
As for the Empress Dowager
and Huo Jingheng,

867
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,990
they're about to have a big fight.

868
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,150
[Diligent from Dawn to Dusk]

869
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,150
Your Grace! Your Grace!

870
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,810
Your Grace!

871
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,910
His Majesty has arrived.

872
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,510
He's just outside the gates.

873
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,520
Hurry!

874
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,150
Who brought

875
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,450
these trashy things to me?

876
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,260
Trying to make me die of anger?

877
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,230
Mother,

878
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,990
who dared upset you this time?

879
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,180
I'll punish them for it.

880
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,870
Kneel!

881
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,960
Mother,

882
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,940
I was wrong.

883
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,880
This time,

884
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,860
it was just

885
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,050
a temporary measure

886
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,850
to keep Prime Minister Yue around.

887
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,670
A temporary measure?

888
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,850
Your "temporary measure"

889
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,080
was to put a man

890
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,800
in the harem?

891
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,410
Do you know

892
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,630
what they're all saying about

893
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,230
you behaving improperly?

894
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,040
Why do they only talk about me?

895
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,690
Doesn't anyone mention Prime Minister Yue?

896
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,890
You dare to talk back?

897
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,630
I only act with a clear conscience.

898
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,180
Rumors never reach my ears.

899
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
What a "clear conscience" indeed.

900
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,020
Emperor, now you

901
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,210
even keep things from me.

902
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,630
I'm old

903
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,190
and my eyesight isn't good.

904
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,520
But can't I even tell

905
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,150
whether it's a man or a woman?

906
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,150
You're not old at all.

907
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,050
You're stunning,

908
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,730
the mother of the nation.

909
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,510
Besides,

910
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,630
I didn't keep it from you.

911
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,020
I just thought that

912
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,690
with the understanding between us,

913
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,470
there was no need to say much.

914
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
Right?

915
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,370
Mother, since you're smiling,

916
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,490
I will...

917
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,860
Kneel!

918
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,250
Alright.

919
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,140
I'll keep kneeling.

920
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,960
Stop being angry.

921
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,510
Your Majesty.

922
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,360
Did the Empress Dowager scold you?

923
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
Of course not.

924
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,970
The Empress Dowager
cares about you the most.

925
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,700
Enough. Stop it.

926
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,540
It's good enough that we managed
to get through this.

927
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,350
But this time,

928
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,460
Mother really let it go easily.

929
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,870
I thought

930
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,280
she'd beat me up again.

931
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,860
Why did you bring me here?

932
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,850
To watch a play.

933
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,360
You always

934
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,950
talk in riddles.

935
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,630
Don't you ever get tired?

936
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,070
The whole city

937
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,110
is talking about

938
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,110
Yue Chi impersonating Consort Yue.

939
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,510
Even the court officials

940
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,870
are full of complaints.

941
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,430
We just need one last push.

942
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,210
One last push?

943
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,850
How are we going to do it?

944
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,240
Do you know Wei Zi'ang,

945
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,320
the Glorious Grand Master?

946
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,210
Many court officials

947
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,700
are his students.

948
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,350
And many people respect him

949
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,630
for his integrity and honesty.

950
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,870
Your table is ready. Please come inside.

951
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,410
If he's willing to submit a memorial to impeach Yue Chi,

952
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,590
it will surely cause a big stir.

953
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,150
Will he listen to you?

954
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,240
For the sake of the people
and the country,

955
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,980
of course he will.

956
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,300
Do you think our current emperor

957
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,840
really likes men?

958
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,300
I doubt that.

959
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,090
I heard

960
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,970
he has many concubines

961
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,240
in his harem.

962
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,070
Have you ever heard of him

963
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,730
favoring anyone in particular?

964
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,030
How is it such a coincidence

965
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,990
that he particularly favors Consort Yue?

966
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,860
Could the trend of male favorites

967
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,790
from the previous dynasty be returning?
