00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,910
[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,800
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,430
Tell me, could our

4
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,840
current emperor really be a gay?

5
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,070
A man

6
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,410
in the harem?

7
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,810
That's absurd.

8
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,530
Could the trend of male consorts

9
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,130
from the previous dynasty make a comeback?

10
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,610
I can't take this.

11
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,210
Have some water to calm down.

12
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,330
Please enjoy, gentlemen.

13
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,289
You must be mistaken.

14
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,890
We didn't order these.

15
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,130
This gentleman here

16
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,330
ordered them for you.

17
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,900
What you two were talking about

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,450
concerns the dignity of the royal family.

19
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,050
You'd better not speak carelessly.

20
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,450
Those who don't know the truth

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,050
might think
the prime minister is your father.

22
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,810
What business is it of yours?

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,420
Lord Wei?

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,970
Your Highness,

25
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,690
would you care to have a drink with me?

26
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,200
I rarely show up in the inner court.

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,130
How did you know me?

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,640
You've been in the city for days.

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,450
If I couldn't even recognize you,

30
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,210
I wouldn't

31
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,610
have been qualified to assist His Majesty.

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,370
Your dedication to the state and people

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,770
is truly admirable.

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,880
We came at the right time today.

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,010
The next play,

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,770
The Prince's Marriage Alliance,

37
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,930
has just begun.

38
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,230
The Prince's Marriage Alliance?

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,140
Don't you know about it?

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,360
The play is about

41
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,590
the prince of Zijing, the former dynasty,

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,570
who married off in his sister's place.

43
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,329
He prepared to die,

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,810
but unexpectedly,

45
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,010
the King of Rouran was a gay.

46
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,560
By a twist of fate, what should've been
a tragedy became a love story.

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,890
That's disgraceful

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,450
and immoral.

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,730
Nowadays, no one would

50
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,770
make a big deal out of it.

51
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,330
The emperor
is meant to be a model for all.

52
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,790
If he behaves improperly,

53
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,990
it would be a disaster for the people.

54
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,090
One is the current emperor,

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,040
and the other is a pillar of the state.

56
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,130
It concerns the fate of the state.

57
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,390
It indeed should be everyone's concern.

58
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,010
But you're just a censor.

59
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,329
How can you withstand

60
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,730
the wrath of the emperor?

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,990
Even if it costs me my life,

62
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,530
I must say what needs to be said!

63
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,329
What a pity.

64
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,970
Last time, Lord Ouyang accused

65
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,350
Prime Minister Yue

66
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,570
of hiding the former dynasty's princess.

67
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,230
In the end, nothing came of it.

68
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,850
Ouyang Wen is not a good person either.

69
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,250
He had personal grudges against Yue Chi.

70
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,250
That was more like seeking revenge.

71
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,530
But in this matter,

72
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,579
it's clearly Yue Chi's fault.

73
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,579
Yet His Majesty is still on his side.

74
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,010
It's truly improper.

75
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,970
Be careful with your words.

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,570
Warriors die in battle,
and scholars die for their words.

77
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,250
You are from another state.

78
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,490
Even you

79
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,490
defended the royal family's dignity

80
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,410
at tea time.

81
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,990
But His Majesty...

82
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,330
He...

83
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,010
Perhaps he has

84
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,970
his reasons.

85
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,750
What reason could there possibly be?

86
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,070
It must be that Prime Minister Yue

87
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,970
wants to meddle
in both the court and the harem.

88
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,420
How shameful!

89
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,770
Shameful to even speak of it!

90
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,850
I like today's play

91
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,490
very much.

92
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,930
You're too kind.

93
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,970
If you like it, come again.

94
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,770
We have performances every day.

95
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,570
That old man really is angry?

96
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,090
Isn't that good?

97
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,330
That clever tongue of yours—

98
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,730
it's practically magic.

99
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,090
Tomorrow, there will surely be

100
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,330
a strong storm.

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,890
Now I need you

102
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,970
to go find someone.

103
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,050
Who?

104
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,250
Consort Hui.

105
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,730
Your Majesty,

106
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,090
I have something to report.

107
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,620
Go ahead.

108
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,370
I want to impeach Prime Minister Yue

109
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,490
for moral corruption

110
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,170
and undermining the court discipline.

111
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,130
How so?

112
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,010
Prime Minister Yue disguised himself

113
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,130
as a woman.

114
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,970
First, he deceived you.

115
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,730
Second, he entered the harem
without permission,

116
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,860
violating the rule.

117
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,490
Third...

118
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,770
These two crimes alone

119
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,420
are enough to have him executed 100 times.

120
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,650
Minister Wei, do you still

121
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,690
want to continue?

122
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,810
Yes.

123
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,330
Third,

124
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,010
as a prime minister,

125
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,890
he did such an immoral thing.

126
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,610
If others follow his example

127
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,650
out of flattery,

128
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,170
it would lead to the state's downfall.

129
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,810
Your Majesty, please be clear.

130
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,540
He should be severely punished

131
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,670
to restore order to the court.

132
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,830
Your Majesty,

133
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,570
this is a serious matter.

134
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,420
Lord Wei has already delivered the witness

135
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,210
and evidence

136
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,610
to the Censorate.

137
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,850
Your Majesty,

138
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,850
since there's a witness and evidence,

139
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,850
please examine the evidence first,

140
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,490
and then hear
Prime Minister Yue's explanation.

141
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,290
How many people

142
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,670
have I offended?

143
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,810
It seems they've agreed

144
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,610
to condemn me once and for all.

145
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,540
Prime Minister Yue,

146
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,010
do you dare to let me

147
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,290
present the evidence?

148
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,820
Interesting question.

149
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,710
If I say no,

150
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,660
will you not present it?

151
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,650
It concerns the fate of our state.

152
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,050
I won't give up
even if it'll cost me my life.

153
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,920
Prime Minister Yue,

154
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,330
what are these?

155
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,450
Ritual offerings.

156
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,570
You didn't

157
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,370
treat them as such.

158
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,060
You wore it upon your chest,

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,690
disguising as a woman.

160
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,360
Yes or no?

161
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,050
Lord Wei, how did you know

162
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,170
they have such use?

163
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,970
Did you use them?

164
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,050
Prime Minister Yue, stop quibbling!

165
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,010
They were used by Consort Yue.

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
The shoe's size

167
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,890
should match Prime Minister Yue's.

168
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,160
Everyone

169
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,130
is different.

170
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,040
Consort Yue has practiced martial arts
since childhood.

171
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,330
It's nothing unusual that her shoe size

172
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,090
is a bit larger

173
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,210
than most women's.

174
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,940
If this shoe's size matches mine,

175
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,460
it might match others' too.

176
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,670
Everyone, why don't you all

177
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,770
try it on?

178
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,410
It might fit some of you.

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,530
That's sophistry!

180
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,340
I forgot to ask you just now.

181
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,290
Lord Wei,

182
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,300
are you sure these belong to Consort Yue?

183
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,050
Yes.

184
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,770
Then where did you get

185
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,730
these items of a consort?

186
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,330
Who is truly the one

187
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,409
violating the rule?

188
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:39,810
You...

189
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,530
Enough!

190
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,250
Prime Minister Yue

191
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,090
has a point.

192
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,840
Perhaps someone

193
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,610
used this embroidered shoe

194
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,370
to mislead Minister Wei.

195
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,450
But it's true that Prime Minister Yue
disguised himself

196
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,650
as a woman and pretended to be a consort!

197
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,610
You were there?

198
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,490
I...

199
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,650
If you didn't see it with your own eyes,

200
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,970
that is just

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,450
a baseless rumor.

202
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,210
Your Majesty.

203
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,140
Prime Minister Yue!

204
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,940
I only have one question for you.

205
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,410
Did you really

206
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,090
disguise yourself as a woman

207
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,640
and pretend to be a consort?

208
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,520
I have never done such a thing.

209
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,290
Your Majesty,

210
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,210
I have a witness!

211
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,290
I also have witnesses!

212
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,550
Your Majesty, please

213
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,520
summon the consorts here

214
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,810
to clear my name.

215
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,530
Okay.

216
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,700
Summon them.

217
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,370
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,250
Take a good look, all of you.

219
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,110
Has Prime Minister Yue

220
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,410
ever disguised himself as Consort Yue?

221
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,690
Your Majesty,

222
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,080
that's impossible.

223
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,680
The consorts in the harem
see each other every day.

225
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,170
We can tell men from women.

226
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,420
Minister Wei,

227
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,730
do you have anything else to say?

228
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,310
Where is your witness?

229
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,570
Bring her here.

230
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,450
I

231
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,490
am Lord Wei's witness.

232
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,650
But no matter what,

233
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,300
at no time and in no place

234
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,130
will Prime Minister Yue

235
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,770
and I ever be family.

236
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,410
Oh no.

237
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,830
I apologize for being late,

238
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,940
Your Majesty.

239
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,930
You've always been at odds
with the Yue family.

240
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,450
Why should we believe you?

241
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,970
That's precisely why

242
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,680
I'd pay closer attention

243
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,250
to his faults

244
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,810
than anyone else.

245
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,650
Consort Hui.

246
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,010
Be careful with your words.

247
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,410
I'll only say what I have seen.

248
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,490
Prime Minister Yue...

249
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,630
Prime Minister Yue

250
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,130
and I can never be family.

251
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,800
He's never disguised himself
as Consort Yue.

252
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,450
Minister Wei.

253
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Prime Minister Yue, what do you say?

254
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,530
In my opinion,

255
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,130
Lord Wei has always devoted himself
to the state and the people.

256
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,460
He's loyal and upright.

257
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,660
I guess he's acting recklessly

258
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,210
because he's been misled
by someone ill-intentioned.

259
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,340
Your Majesty, please don't blame him.

260
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,370
Minister Wei?

261
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,220
Since Minister Wei

262
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,350
has nothing more to say,

263
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,610
I

264
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,470
will not pursue this matter further.

265
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,610
[Fengyuan Hall]

266
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,250
Stop. Stop.

267
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,370
Your Majesty, you want to go in?

268
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,770
I'll go knock on the door.

269
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,650
I already told Ling'er

270
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,730
knocking her out

271
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,610
was your idea.

272
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,650
I won't take the blame for you.

273
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,930
No.

274
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,530
Ling'er must be furious now.

275
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,450
Eunuch Gui.

276
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,490
Yes.

277
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,410
Pass my order.

278
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,290
Minister Du shall be fined half a year...

279
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,050
No.

280
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,200
He shall be fined a year's salary.

281
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,620
Also,

282
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,630
they're gathering winter clothes

283
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,910
for the soldiers at the frontline, right?

284
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,890
Send the Imperial Uncle
to the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau

285
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,290
to operate the sewing machines.

286
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,810
What?

287
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,930
Yes.

288
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:37,820
Let's go.

289
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:38,850
Go.

290
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,050
The snow peony is a rare breed.

291
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,770
Your Majesty, please go easy on it.

292
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,530
Don't ruin my flower.

293
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,970
As I passed Fengluan Palace today,

294
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,610
I felt resentment.

295
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,210
Your Majesty, what's wrong

296
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,970
today?

297
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,290
You've never liked Prime Minister Yue.

298
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,630
Why did you help him today?

299
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,690
Why do you think?

300
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,750
Don't tell me you did it for me.

301
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,170
If I say it wasn't for you,

302
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,010
that wouldn't be very accurate.

303
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,090
But I prefer to say

304
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,210
it was for Ling'er.

305
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,670
I didn't expect you

306
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,010
to be so thoughtful.

307
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,950
In the past,

308
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,610
I was always hot-headed.

309
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,240
I didn't know
how to care about those around me.

310
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,090
Now,

311
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,770
I don't have much left.

312
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,340
So I've learned to cherish what I have.

313
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Your Majesty,

314
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,650
if you leave some people and things

315
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,290
unattended for too long,

316
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,950
it would hurt their feelings.

317
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,410
Cherish them before

318
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,870
you lose them.

319
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,090
It takes time

320
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,170
to warm a heart.

321
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,220
I'm just...

322
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,970
worried I might say the wrong thing.

323
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,170
And what of it?

324
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,960
If you say something wrong, explain.

325
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,730
If they won't listen,

326
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,010
explain again.

327
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,650
If you do something wrong,

328
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,980
apologize face to face.

329
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,790
You've got a mouth.

330
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,250
What misunderstanding

331
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,380
can't be cleared up?

332
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,690
Your Majesty, go now.

333
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,450
His Majesty has arrived.

334
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,890
Your Majesty, watch out!

335
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,250
How tall are you compared to me?

336
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,650
Don't you know?

337
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,850
Greetings, Your Majesty.

338
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,210
Rise.

339
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,090
Your Majesty,

340
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,250
Use this.

341
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,460
Your Majesty,

342
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,130
I accidentally injured you today.

343
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,990
It was my fault.

344
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,970
But Your Majesty,

345
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,630
you sent someone to knock me out

346
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,630
and tie me up.

347
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,950
That seems even worse.

348
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,370
So let's just

349
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,930
call it even.

350
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,210
Back then, I

351
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,610
had no choice.

352
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,610
You're so stubborn.

353
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,570
Your Majesty,

354
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,830
please speak frankly.

355
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,170
Are you here

356
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,970
to tell me to pack up and leave?

357
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,410
What are you talking about, Ling'er?

358
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,730
Your brother and I

359
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,650
were truly worried about your safety.

360
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,810
And the result?

361
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,410
Did you and my brother

362
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,210
handle the matter well?

363
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,970
Your Majesty,

364
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,090
you always believe

365
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,010
that men are naturally capable

366
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,450
of solving more problems

367
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,370
and men should

368
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,890
handle more problems.

369
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,490
But this time,

370
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,210
how was it solved?

371
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,220
Have you ever thought about it?

372
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,170
Eunuch, no need to panic.

373
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,510
Even if I offend His Majesty today,

374
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,370
His Majesty

375
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,250
won't punish you.

376
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,410
Your Majesty,

377
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,290
I'm guilty.

378
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,810
Everyone, you may leave.

379
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,450
Yes.

380
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:17,890
This time,

381
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,690
the problem was solved smoothly

382
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,950
thanks to the women in the palace,

383
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,310
and your kindness and good heart too.

384
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,770
Thank you.

385
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,370
But I prefer to say

386
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,490
it was for Ling'er.

387
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,050
She sent a letter

388
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,690
and a large box.

389
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,380
A generous gift?

390
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,210
A memorandum.

391
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,530
Inside were the things Prime Minister Yue

392
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,210
wants to do but can't,

393
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,930
or didn't get the chance to do.

394
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,410
And the things you want to do.

395
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,450
But he was worried you'd forget,

396
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,050
so he wrote them down.

397
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,550
Prime Minister Yue
has a whole box full of them.

398
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,690
In there, there are

399
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,370
proposals on how to improve

400
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,770
conditions for frontline soldiers,

401
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,810
proposals to separate medicines
into three seasonal types

402
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,970
instead of two,

403
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,290
and recommendations for private supplies
of female workers in the army

404
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,180
to be handled by both the Medical Bureau
and the Imperial Medical Office.

405
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,930
He even noted

406
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,150
the rising monopoly

407
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,810
of merchant lords in the capital,

408
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,410
and how to curb their greed.

409
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,490
And he made a contingency plan

410
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,290
for military grain supplies
in case of natural disasters.

411
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,490
There's so much more.

412
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,490
I couldn't finish reading them all.

413
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,650
So,

414
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,560
you thought he was a good official

415
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,500
and changed your mind about him?

416
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,650
Yes.

417
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,980
But the most important thing is

418
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,570
Ling'er is my friend.

419
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,410
What I just said...

420
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,170
is offensive.

421
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,970
Please punish me.

422
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,530
Rise.

423
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,100
As long as what you said is reasonable,

424
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,780
I won't mind your attitude.

425
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,220
I can even tolerate Wei Zi'ang.

426
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,050
Why would I punish you?

427
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,810
Someone just told me

428
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,490
since we have a mouth,

429
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,270
we should explain the unhappy things

430
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,810
clearly.

431
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,090
So I came here today

432
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,730
to explain to you

433
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,770
and apologize.

434
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,110
I underestimated you before.

435
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,010
I focused too much

436
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,130
on protecting you

437
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,650
and overlooked

438
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,930
that you also want to care about

439
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,060
and protect others.

440
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,450
I...

441
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,930
also want to say

442
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,130
I adore you.

443
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,090
I like you.

444
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,790
I want you

445
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,380
to stay, not just today.

446
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,970
Every day from now on,

447
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,090
I hope

448
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,530
you can stay by my side,

449
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,410
help me,

450
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,690
and accompany me,

451
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,210
not just the emperor,

452
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,530
but also the man

453
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,770
standing before you.

454
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,770
Ling'er,

455
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,530
are you willing?

456
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,610
Your Majesty.

457
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,490
Your Majesty.

458
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,210
What...

459
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,970
I'm going to do might be offensive.

460
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,740
♪ Rivers and mountains slip into
deep autumn ♪

461
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,490
♪ Desolation fills my eyes since the day
you left ♪

462
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,510
♪ A lonely goose lingers, mournfully
crying, then flies away ♪

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,930
♪ What's missed is lost forever ♪

♪ In our old town, your once-bright face
has now faded ♪

♪ If only I hadn't let go of your hand

472
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,110
Greetings, Your Majesty.

473
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,970
No need for formalities.

474
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,650
Sit.

475
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,570
Tell His Majesty

476
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,850
what you've found.

477
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,650
Yes.

478
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,610
I investigated

479
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,530
according to the address

480
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,530
provided by Princess Wen Rou.

481
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,460
But I found no trace of that family.

482
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,930
Instead, I discovered that two years ago,

483
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,130
a scout reported

484
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,530
seeing Princess Wen Rou

485
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,290
entering and leaving Man King's mansion.

486
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,210
So that means

487
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,650
she was involved with Man King long ago.

488
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,130
Without concrete evidence,

489
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,060
we can't draw that conclusion yet.

490
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,250
But her intention

491
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,330
to deal with me and Ling'er

492
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,690
is certain.

493
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,180
When I ascended the throne,

494
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,570
I had four swords forged

495
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,810
for the four vassal kings.

496
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,420
Each hilt was inlaid with a different gem—

497
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,790
turquoise,

498
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,850
lapis lazuli,

499
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,690
tiger's eye, and tourmaline.

500
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,210
This one belongs to Cao Mang?

501
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,050
You may leave.

502
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,290
If that's the case,

503
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,900
they might be in love with each other.

504
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,140
Then could it be that Wen Rou

505
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,490
entered the palace

506
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,610
to assassinate you

507
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,650
and help Cao Mang

508
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,890
usurp the throne?

509
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,930
As long as Wen Rou is here,

510
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,670
we'll catch Cao Mang sooner or later.

511
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,950
Your Majesty, you mean...

512
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,690
I will

513
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,130
put on a show for Cao Mang.

514
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,850
I'm afraid if we take one step further,

515
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,410
war may soon be upon us.

516
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,690
I only want
to negotiate peace with Cao Mang.

517
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,130
It's a bit dangerous.

518
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,010
Aren't you worried he'll turn against you?

519
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,210
I ascended the throne

520
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,010
to ensure

521
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,210
the people could have a way out.

522
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,410
If I can end the war,

523
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,810
and the people can return home

524
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,940
and till their land,

525
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,370
no matter

526
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,570
what effort it takes,

527
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,850
I am willing.

528
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,770
If you think so,

529
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,620
it is a blessing for all the people.

530
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,810
I've been wandering around all morning.

531
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,540
Where is she?

532
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,570
Did you send out

533
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,890
the message or not?

534
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,130
I already disclosed your whereabouts

535
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,240
to Qunyu Pavilion early this morning.

536
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,370
Could it be...

537
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,510
Princess has no interest in you?

538
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,450
Impossible.

539
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,690
You are adored

540
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,530
by everyone.

541
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,010
As long as she isn't blind,

542
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,610
she must surely admire you.

543
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,940
Shut up.

544
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,330
The Drunk Consort in the palace

545
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,790
is blooming beautifully.

546
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,450
Look at these flowers—

547
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,090
slightly drooping,

548
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,170
as if they were drunk.

549
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,450
You like them?

550
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,550
Your Majesty, I didn't know you were here.

551
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,210
Forgive me for the intrusion.

552
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,650
No need for formalities.

553
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,240
I intruded

554
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,440
on your mood of enjoying the flowers.

555
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,520
With your arrival,

556
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,050
the Drunk Consort

557
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,850
is blooming more beautifully.

558
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,020
The flowers are lovely.

559
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,850
So are you.

560
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,330
Everyone, come inside.

561
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,090
Come inside.

562
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,890
Be careful.

563
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,610
Princess.

564
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,290
Eunuch Gui.

565
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,930
What's going on?

566
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,450
Princess,

567
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,690
[Qunyu Pavilion]

568
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,250
these are gifts from His Majesty.

569
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:12,770
Look.

570
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,490
They are all

571
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,490
top-quality.

572
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,610
These famous varieties
are scattered across different regions.

573
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,690
Why did His Majesty go to such lengths

574
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,930
to collect all these?

575
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,810
His Majesty did

576
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,410
far more than that.

577
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,980
He even issued an imperial decree,

578
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,160
[Qunyu Pavilion]

579
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,530
ordering them to deliver these

580
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,050
at top speed.

581
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,170
Take a look.

582
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,810
Then everyone would know

583
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,290
what His Majesty did for me.

584
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,210
Yes.

585
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,650
All the other consorts

586
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,050
are saying you're so blessed.

587
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,880
Take a look.

588
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,910
[Qunyu Pavilion]

589
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,690
[Qunyu Pavilion]

590
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,810
His Majesty's favor came so quickly.

591
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,050
I can hardly believe this.

592
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,210
Indeed.

593
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:07,890
Who knows

594
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,530
what whim he's acting on now?

595
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,890
Your Majesty,

596
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,810
what brings you here?

597
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,890
I don't know
what whim I'm acting on either.

598
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,510
I just wanted to come and take a look.

599
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,090
So flashy.

600
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,650
They're no match

601
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,930
for the Drunk Consort

602
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,260
in the Imperial Garden.

603
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,500
Everything you give is great.

604
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,010
I like them all.

605
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,410
But why are you

606
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,730
so nice to me suddenly?

607
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,470
Since you entered the palace,

608
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,610
you have saved

609
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,740
Ling'er many times.

610
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,250
I remember it all.

611
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,850
I treat Consort Yue well

612
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,690
only because she is

613
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,010
the one you love.

614
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,160
I only wish to share your burdens.

615
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,850
But...

616
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,930
it seems Prime Minister Yue
has misunderstood me.

617
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,010
As long as I understand you,
that's enough.

618
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,740
[Qunyu Pavilion]

619
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,730
This is...

620
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,850
I specially ordered craftsmen

621
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,690
to make this pair
of gold phoenix-tail hairpins

622
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,130
based on the ceremonial standards

623
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,190
for the previous dynasty's empress.

624
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,770
Do you like them?

625
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,730
Such items are for the empress.

626
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,690
If I accept them,

627
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,950
it wouldn't be proper.

628
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,350
Your Majesty, please take them back.

629
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,330
I will give you a title

630
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
that makes it proper to accept them.

631
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,530
You usually

632
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,890
dress too plainly.

633
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,690
These hairpins suit you well.

634
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,780
[Yongqian Palace]

635
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,690
What are you thinking about?

636
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,820
You look so serious.

637
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,290
Don't play dumb with me.

638
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,350
What a coincidence.

639
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,660
When I visited a temple before,

640
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,570
a monk gave me this.

641
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,010
He said it's very effective.

642
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,810
Since there's something troubling you,

643
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,970
I'll be generous

644
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,770
and let you have it.

645
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,610
God bless me.

646
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,540
I hope Ling'er won't get angry.

647
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,210
I'm willing to trade Prime Minister Yue's

648
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,330
marriage for it.

649
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,200
What does it have to do with me?

650
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,410
I didn't tell

651
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,850
Ling'er in advance this time.

652
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,930
If she finds out,

653
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,530
she'll definitely be mad at me.

654
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,730
Think of a solution for me.

655
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,730
Why should I be the one to think of it?

656
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,890
I am the emperor.

657
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,930
I don't care. I'll do nothing

658
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,130
and just be an on-looker.

659
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,490
That's an order.

660
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,730
Then I'll go bring Ling'er here
to figure it out together.

661
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,570
Yue Chi,

662
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,650
where is your conscience?

663
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,930
Brother-in-law,

664
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,580
you have to pay a price

665
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,310
for being fickle.

666
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,540
His Majesty favors
Princess Wen Rou so much.

667
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm afraid
Consort Yue will fall out of favor.

668
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,580
No flower stays in bloom forever.

669
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,450
Go away.

670
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,690
What is your purpose?

671
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,290
What's wrong?

672
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,570
Your Highness,

673
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,690
do you really not feel even a bit worried?

674
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,220
Princess Wen Rou is about
to become a consort.

675
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,050
What?

679
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,010
it must be grand—

680
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,410
let the whole world know.

681
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,850
Your Highness,

682
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,460
what are you doing?

683
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,970
A man who can't restrain himself

684
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,100
should have a turtle shell on his head.

685
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,570
Greetings, Consort Yue.

686
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,410
Eunuch Gui, what brings you here?

687
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,250
His Majesty

688
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,730
asked me to deliver something to you.

689
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,490
Where is he?

690
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,830
He...

He's...

692
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,930
He's at Qunyu Pavilion.

693
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,970
He thinks he can buy me off

694
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,370
with a box of pastries?

695
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,540
I'm not eating them.

696
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,690
Feed them to the dog.

697
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,350
Please don't, Your Highness.

698
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,290
His Majesty specially asked me

699
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,020
to tell you to take a close look.

700
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,890
Take a close look.

701
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,210
-This is...
-His Majesty said

702
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,870
it's hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.

703

[Prince Anle's Mansion]

705
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,420
What exactly do you want to say?

706
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,650
Can't you let me in before I tell you?

707
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,170
No. Let's just talk here.

708
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,370
I still need to go to the palace
to preside over the ceremony.

709
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,970
The ceremony
of conferring the consort title?

710
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,490
Yue Chi, are you

711
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,050
Yue Ling'er's biological brother?

712
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,130
You're going to preside
over her rival's ceremony?

713
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,650
It's His Majesty's decree.

714
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,770
Am I supposed to defy the imperial order?

715
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,450
You could've refused.

716
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,130
You could've pretended to be sick.

717
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,810
Aren't you always full of tricks?

718
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,250
You're full of tricks.

Everyone in the palace is saying
Ling'er has fallen out of favor.

720
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,500
Aren't you worried?

721
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,940
I'm not worried.

722
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,050
As long as I don't fall out of favor,

723
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,250

You're leaving just like that?

726

If I don't leave,
should I stay and drink with you?

If you really have grievances,

728
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,010
go talk to His Majesty.

729
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,890
If talking to him worked,

730
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,890
I wouldn't have been here talking to you!

As long as I'm here today,

can she assassinate Huo Jingheng.

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,600
If you try to stop her,

761
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
she will hate you.

762
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,280
She must leave the palace tonight!

763
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,580
Let go of me!

764
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,110
What do you want?

765
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,340
No one has ever stopped Wen Rou
from leaving the palace.

766
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,880
The path she walks now—

767
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,510
she chose it herself.

768
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,460
She can't do this!

769
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,080
Then who drove her to this?

770
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,800
I'm not the one who deceived her.
