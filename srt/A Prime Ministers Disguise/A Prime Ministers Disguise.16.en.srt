[A Prime Minister's Disguise]

2
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,680
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,760
Your Highness.

4
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,850
Please spare me.

5
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,060
His Majesty is really not here.

6
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,420
Then where is he?

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,950
He's in...

8
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,430
Today, he turned over

9
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,630
Consort Hui's nameplate.

10
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,590
He must be in Yanning Palace.

11
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,289
Yanning?

12
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,630
Don't talk nonsense.

13
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,860
His Majesty isn't in my Yanning Palace.

14
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,090
Then... Then...

15
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,750
Then he must have gone to
see Jr. Concubine Zhao.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,060
He's in Jr. Concubine Zhao's palace.

17
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,770
Why have you all come here?

18
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,770
Why are they all here?

19
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,720
Let's just arrest them all.

20
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,830
Hush.

21
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,570
Your Majesty!

22
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,860
I know you're in there.

23
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,160
If you have the guts,

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,710
just hide from me
for the rest of your life

25
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,310
and never see me again
for the rest of your life.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,310
Yue.

27
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,160
Let's go.

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,880
H-He's really not here.

29
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,740
He's not here.

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,680
How come this doesn't look like

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,540
she has lost His Majesty's favor?

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,610
It's more like His Majesty has
done something wrong

33
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,210
and is too ashamed to show up.

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,100
All men

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,570
are bad.

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,800
Let's go.

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,560
Have they left?

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
[Yongqian Palace]

39
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,140
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,329
next time,

41
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,329
I really can't do such work anymore.

42
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,270
Thanks for your hard work, Eunuch Gui.

43
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,600
Your salary will be increased this month.

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,050
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,770
Consort Yue is leaving the palace.

46
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,830
Should we stop her?

47
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,080
Let her go.

48
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,140
Wei Zhang.

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,380
Follow her.

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't let her discover you.

51
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,550
What a nuisance.

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,520
We might as well just arrest her.

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,480
Besides arresting and killing people,

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
what else is in your mind?

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,670
I feel very troubled right now.

56
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,310
Don't make me give you a beating.

57
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,150
Just go.

58
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,850
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,490
Today, you turned over

60
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,050
Yanning Palace's nameplate.

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,910
It would be inappropriate
if you don't go, right?

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,890
No need.

63
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,910
Tell them I'm not going.

64
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,970
It looks like

65
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,640
no one will discover me.

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Where are you going so late at night?

67
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,870
So you already know everything?

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,770
Why?

69
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
So,

70
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,770
taking revenge for me

71
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,770
was just your excuse for
assassinating Huo Jingheng?

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,930
Understanding me and supporting me

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,570
to beceome the Right Prime Minister
of Ning State was also an excuse.

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,010
Carelessly exposing your identity

75
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,070
was also an excuse.

76
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,280
What about Shuo?

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,540
Shuo wasn't an excuse.

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,940
When Shuo was kidnapped,

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,810
it was really just an accident.

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,830
So, all the other things

81
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,040
were really your excuses?

82
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,180
You said

83
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,330
he is a monarch who is

84
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,790
worthy of our allegiance.

85
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,730
I also want to see

86
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,930
whether that's true.

87
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,870
With the snowy white crab meat

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,100
and the golden translucent roe,

89
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,690
it's named Golden and Silver Crab.

90
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,720
My family used to

91
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,510
love this dish very much.

92
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,390
I thought you didn't know
how to play chess.

[Prince Anle's Mansion]

A stubborn ox

95
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,510
and a stubborn donkey.

96
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,750
One of you asked for sick leave,

97
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
and the other refused to see anyone.

98
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,310
I don't believe I can't
deal with you guys.

99
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,930
Chi!

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,790
Chi!

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,300
Come out! Let's have a chat.

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,400
Yunqing.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,220
Ling'er doesn't know anything.

104
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,010
Let go of her.

105
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,440
Your Highness!

106
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,960
Ling'er!

107
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,070
Ling'er!

108
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,230
I'll go find His Majesty.

109
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,170
Yunqing, what's wrong with you?

110
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,210
Why did my brother hurt you?

111
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,880
What happened

112
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,850
between you two?

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,900
You're holding me hostage to leave

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,230
Prince Anle's Mansion, right?

115
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,560
Are you trying to escape?

116
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,390
So your identity has been
exposed to the public?

117
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,390
That's not right.

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,370
If your identity had been

119
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,540
exposed to the public,

120
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,410
my brother would have

121
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,410
been on your side.

122
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,820
Could it be that you guys have

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,090
a certain secret plan?

124
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,590
Yunqing, just tell me.

125
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,540
I'm so anxious.

126
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,610
You're too noisy.

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,690
So,

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,740
everything I just guessed

129
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,810
was correct?

130
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,610
Not a single thing you guessed was right.

131
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,600
When I caught you,

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,460
I just wanted to threaten Yue Chi.

133
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,340
To threaten him?

134
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,890
I just didn't expect that

135
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,450
when I tried to run away,

136
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,330
you'd be there to be my hostage.

137
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,720
Things went so smoothly.

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,820
Why?

139
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,890
There is no why.

140
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,700
Yunqing, could you please

141
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,380
tell me?

142
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,340
I want to know the answer.

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,400
There is no answer.

144
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,010
It's the end of the month.

145
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,740
Alright.

146
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,080
If you want to escape,

147
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,530
I'll help you get out of the city.

148
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,809
Don't you think

149
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,740
you're being too cruel to Ling'er?

150
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,830
Her identity is special.

151
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,049
If you neglect her,

152
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,020
how can she establish herself
in the imperial harem?

153
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,500
Your Majesty.

154
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,130
Consort Hui said

155
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,320
she would organize the harem's accounts

156
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,690
with Consort Yue tonight.

157
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,690
Jr. Concubine Zhao said

158
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,870
she would make clothes for
the Empress Dowager with Consort Yue.

159
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,710
Lady Xia said

160
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,790
she would discuss

161
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,200
the festival dance arrangements
with Consort Yue.

162
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,190
As for the other concubines,

163
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,160
they've all reported that they are sick,

164
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,010
saying that they're overly
concerned about Consort Yue

165
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,130
and have caught a cold.

166
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:04,940
Today,

167
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,260
none of them will be here to serve you.

168
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
You may leave now.

169
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Did you hear that?

170
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,630
She's doing better than you.

171
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:15,970
That's still not a reason

172
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,230
for you to neglect her.

173
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,620
People all say, "Don't let parents'
mistakes implicate their children."

174
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,370
How could you

175
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,630
let her brother's matter implicate her?

176
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,810
Stop reading these useless documents.

177
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,010
You're always focused on
some unimportant things.

178
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,050
You either care about trivial matters

179
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,600
or try to impeach Yue Chi.

180
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,450
That's useless.

181
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,100
If you keep doing this,

182
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,530
I will think that

183
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,190
you're coveting Consort Yue.

184
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,970
Maybe it's true.

185
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,730
Maybe?

186
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,730
I know that

187
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,730
I shouldn't have

188
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,850
such thoughts about

189
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,250
Your Majesty's consort.

190
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,460
But aren't you two just pretending?

191
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,760
And I do have feelings.

192
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,240
What feelings?

193
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,450
I feel that

194
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,120
Ling'er has been quite fond of me

195
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,810
since she was a kid.

196
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,420
Your feelings must be wrong.

197
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,940
How is that possible?

198
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,700
I'm the only man

199
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,470
who has received

200
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,500
a pouch from Ling'er,

201
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,830
except for her brother.

202
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,330
Well, I've even received

203
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,290
a money bag from Ling'er.

204
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,450
Have I said anything about it?

205
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,380
That's not okay.

206
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,410
You...

207
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,910
You are the Imperial Uncle.

208
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,980
Ling'er is a palace consort.

209
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,450
You two just can't

210
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,770
be together.

211
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,910
Don't even think about it.

212
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,330
She is not a harem consort.

213
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,090
I can also give up
being the Imperial Uncle.

214
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,480
The two of us can explore
the world together.

215
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,560
That's happier than anything else.

216
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,090
As for the so-called Your Majesty's favor

217
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,420
and imperial power and wealth,

218
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,280
we don't care about those things.

219
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,900
Is that so?

220
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,160
Then do you still care about your head?

221
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,170
Your Majesty!

222
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,610
Your Majesty, bad news!

223
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,470
Her Highness has been
abducted outside the palace.

224
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,230
Jiang Yunqing is so annoying.

225
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,260
What the heck is she doing?

226
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,470
Which way did she go?

227
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,760
If I had known she was
this kind of person,

228
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,580
I would have left her at
the Court of Judicial Review.

229
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Then Ling'er wouldn't have been abducted.

230
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,070
The friendship between them
is so profound that

231
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,870
it's beyond our understanding.

232
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,230
She's holding her hostage.

233
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,310
You call that a profound friendship?

234
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,330
Yue Chi must have

235
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,590
confessed everything to Jiang Yunqing.

236
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,370
You're not worried?

237
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,670
I am worried.

238
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,300
But I believe that Ling'er

239
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,100
can certainly protect herself.

240
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,720
Alright.

241
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,080
Let's split up to search for them.

242
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,870
After finding them,

243
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,160
use fireworks as a signal.

244
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,930
Giddy-up!

245
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,100
Giddy-up!

246
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,550
The poisonous worms are restless now.

247
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,580
But Yi Qingyun hasn't
played the flute yet.

248
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,040
I think the one-month
deadline has arrived.

249
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,890
Yunqing.

250
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,640
What's wrong with you?

251
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm fine.

252
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,490
Are you feeling unwell?

253
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,830
I've noticed that you're sweating a lot.

254
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,390
Water.

255
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,210
Okay.

256
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,040
Yunqing!

257
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,110
Yunqing!

258
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,540
Open the door, Yunqing.

259
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,850
Open the door.

260
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Yunqing.

261
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,610
I'm worried about your health.

262
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,410
Shut up.

263
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,580
I'm not dying yet.

264
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,650
Yunqing.

265
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,900
Alright.

266
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,850
Take a rest first.

267
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,220
Giddy-up!

268
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,370
Tell me.

269
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,920
What exactly do you want to do?

270
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,250
Those who know the secret

271
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,070
must die.

272
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,370
I don't believe that you'll kill me.

273
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,490
My identity has been exposed.

274
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,340
Yue Chi was ordered to kill me.

275
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,160
You still think that I'll let you go?

276
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
How is that possible?

277
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,830
My brother would never

278
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,970
hurt you.

279
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,820
But I will.

280
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,050
I'm going to kill Huo Jingheng.

281
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,740
Now that Yue Chi has chosen him,

282
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,880
we're on opposing sides.

283
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,020
Actually...

284
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,670
Actually, you

285
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,210
don't want to kill Huo Jingheng,

286
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,150
right?

287
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,960
Otherwise, you would have done it already.

288
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,450
You think I don't want to?

289
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,200
I didn't have any chance

290
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,320
to get close to him.

291
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
If I had gotten the chance to pretend

292
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,470
to be a consort like your brother

293
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,690
and get close to him...

294
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,480
He disguised himself as a woman?

295
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,400
-He entered the palace as a concubine?
-Do you think he could live till now?

296
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,270
The Yue family

297
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,930
is really bold.

298
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,970
Yunqing.

299
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,400
I just

300
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,850
don't want my brother's

301
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,770
great talent to be buried.

302
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,170
I...

303
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,530
hope that my brother can return to

304
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,340
the position he should be in.

305
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,170
Yes.

306
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,910
Your brother cares about the people.

307
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,940
He's an unparalleled great hero.

308
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,010
I'm just an orphan from
the previous dynasty.

309
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,150
But Ling'er,

310
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,070
you know what?

311
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,240
The Yue family worked as
officials for two generations

312
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
and once received salaries
from the Jiang family.

313
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,490
The whole family was honored

314
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,060
with the highest position

315
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,670
and unparalleled glory.

316
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,400
When the ruler is worried,
the officials should be ashamed.

317
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,610
When the ruler is humiliated,
the officials should die loyally.

318
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,810
I think you understand this principle.

319
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,720
Yunqing.

320
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,950
Yunqing.

321
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Reply to me!

322
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,280
Reply to me!

323
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,750
Yunqing.

324
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,900
Yunqing.

325
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,730
Xue Jingguan.

326
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,250
My Lord.

327
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,010
The prince regent

328
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,010
has come here after we reminded him.

329
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,850
Let's go.

330
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,500
As for the rest of it,

331
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,230
let the princess persuade him.

332
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,770
Yue Chi.

333
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,270
Yue Chi.

334
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,150
Yue Chi.

335
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,290
Yue Chi.

336
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,010
Yue Chi.

337
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,720
Yue Chi.

338
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,890
Alright.

339
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,089
No one blames you.

340
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
My brother won't blame you, either.

341
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,210
Yunqing,

342
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,690
take some medicine.

343
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,320
You'll recover soon.

344
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,830
Yunqing.

345
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,060
No one blames you.

346
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,930
I will protect you.

347
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Yunqing.

348
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,420
Are you feeling better now?

349
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,520
I passed out.

350
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,610
Why didn't you leave?

351
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,670
I won't leave.

352
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
It's not up to you.

353
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,930
Even if I have to leave,

354
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,730
I'll first escort you out of

355
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,130
the city before leaving.

356
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,350
Then I'll leave.

357
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,190
Yunqing.

358
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,020
How is it?

359
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,070
Your Majesty,

360
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,410
I failed to protect Consort Yue properly.

361
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,490
Please punish me.

362
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,690
It's not your fault.

363
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,120
If you had really taken action,

364
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,680
Ling'er

365
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,240
would have been in danger.

366
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Where is she now?

367
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,160
She's just ahead and not far from here.

368
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,420
Set off fireworks to notify Minister Du.

369
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,910
Take me to find her.

370
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,140
I can't do it.

371
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,960
I can't persuade myself to do it.

372
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,930
What are you doing?

373
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,810
Yunqing.

374
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,420
Yunqing.

375
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,170
I've noticed that there's
a worm in your hand.

376
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,000
Now I'll help you

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,730
remove the worm from your body.

378
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,620
Ling'er!

379
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,870
Chi!

380
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,940
How could you try to hurt Ling'er?

381
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,060
If you have a problem, come at me.

382
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,300
Don't hurt Ling'er.

383
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,350
Yunqing has already let me go.

384
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,310
But I chose to stay.

385
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,450
Go back with me.

386
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,300
With me here,

387
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,060
no one can hurt you.

388
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,730
I'm not going back.

389
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,470
Ling'er,

390
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:02,770
don't cause trouble.

391
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,290
Yue Chi!

392
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,380
Chi.

393
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,570
What do you intend

394
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,730
to do to Yunqing?

395
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,290
Tell me about it first.

396
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,850
Shut up.

397
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,990
Yunqing.

398
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,770
What's wrong with you?

399
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,360
Prepare a horse for me.

400
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,140
Otherwise,

401
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,170
both you and Ling'er will be killed.

402
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
You want to go to Li State?

403
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,740
Yunqing.

404
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,450
No matter what Yi Qingyun

405
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,450
has promised you,

406
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,690
don't trust him.

407
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,150
This man is quite scheming.

408
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,830
He's best at manipulating human nature.

409
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,220
He will only use you.

410
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,060
I can't turn back now.

411
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,480
He will get you killed.

412
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,380
Yi Qingyun?

413
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,410
You can't leave with him.

414
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,410
Chi.

415
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,110
What exactly

416
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,690
happened between you two?

417
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,830
Ling'er.

418
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,460
This matter

419
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,150
is beyond your control.

420
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,440
That's right.

421
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,080
It's beyond my control.

422
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,050
Everything that happened

423
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,090
between you two

424
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,430
is concealed

425
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,790
from me so deeply.

426
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,720
Yunqing.

427
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,830
I want to protect you,

428
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,490
just like you protected me back then.

429
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,260
If I have to make a choice,

430
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,860
you can just stand by my side

431
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,310
and let me protect you.

432
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,040
Yunqing!

433
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,730
I'll go chase her.

434
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,240
Okay.

435
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,970
Ling'er.

436
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,620
Are you alright?

437
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,060
Yunqing!

438
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm fine.

439
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,940
Let's go.

440
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,850
There's a fugitive over there!

441
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,130
You can go first. Someone is
waiting outside to pick you up.

442
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,010
What about you?

443
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,150
I'll kill them first.

444
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,940
No. That's too dangerous.

445
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,460
I'm going to stay with you.

446
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,550
You can do nothing.

447
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,230
If you stay,

448
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,410
you'll only get me killed.

449
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,160
Well...

450
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,160
You'll come,

451
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,360
right?

452
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,710
Yes.

453
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,850
Go!

454
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,700
With you here,

455
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,500
I can't leave.

456
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,960
Yunqing.

457
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,890
Ling'er.

458
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,010
Goodbye.

459
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,310
♪ Rivers and mountains slip into
deep autumn ♪

460
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,060
♪ Desolation fills my eyes since the day
you left ♪

461
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,980
♪ A lonely goose lingers, mournfully
crying, then flies away ♪

462
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,740
Miss, are you the one?

463
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,340
Someone has hired me to pick you up here.

464
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,200
Why don't you get in the wagon now?

465
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,600
Could you please wait a little longer?

466
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,060
There's one more person.

467
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,400
There's one more person?

468
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,260
Wasn't it supposed to be just you?

469
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,090
Yunqing.

470
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,970
Whether it's Ling'er or anyone else,

471
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,680
as long as I'm still a princess,

472
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,500
no one can hurt them.

473
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,410
Yue Chi, I did it.

474
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,100
Yunqing.

475
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,660
You'll come,

476
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,370
right?

477
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,290
Step aside.

478
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,860
Go back.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,880
I can't go back.

480
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,790
Yunqing.

481
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,650
Trust me.

482
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,000
Yue Chi.

483
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,630
Prime Minister Yue.

484
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,210
I hope that in the future, you can

485
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,360
have rapid advancement in your career.

486
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,660
Our relationship

487
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,960
is over now.

488
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,330
No way.

489
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,830
You are my wife.

490
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm not.

491
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,850
I never am your wife.

492
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,090
I've long known

493
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,190
who you really are.

494
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,970
So,

495
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,610
don't set foot on

496
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,210
this path of escape anymore.

497
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,310
As long as you're willing to stop,

498
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,170
everything will be over.

499
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,790
You won't be coerced anymore.

500
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,210
You won't be anxious or scared anymore.

501
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,330
Don't continue

502
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,790
to walk towards the abyss.

503
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,580
Come home.

504
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,870
Chi.

505
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,330
She betrayed you guys,

506
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,890
didn't she?

507
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,080
Look at me.

508
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,700
Will you guys hurt her?

509
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,400
Chi.

510
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,690
I won't

511
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,090
let you guys hurt her.

512
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,020
When the capital fell that year,

513
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,720
many people died.

514
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,160
Even the ponds in the Imperial Garden

515
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,470
couldn't accommodate all the corpses.

516
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,130
She protected me

517
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,210
with her life.

518
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,840
What's more,

519
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,360
when Yunqing had a fever,

520
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,130
she kept saying

521
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,880
Yue Chi.

522
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,890
Yue Chi.

523
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,650
Yue Chi.

524
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Yue Chi.

525
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,130
Yue Chi.

526
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,060
She kept

527
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,760
saying your name.

528
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,820
Yue.

529
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,030
I'm a bit tired.

530
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,380
I want to have a rest now.

531
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,450
Escort His Majesty and my brother

532
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,530
back for me.

533
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,900
Yes, Your Highness.

534
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,320
Ling'er, look.

535
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,370
A little tiger is coming.

536
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,969
Ling'er, don't be upset.

537
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:17,929
It's useless.

538
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:21,230
As a princess of the previous dynasty,

539
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,130
Jiang Yunqing has her own

540
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,050
mission to accomplish

541
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,380
and her own path to take.

542
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,770
Between us all,

543
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,360
we can only walk together for a while,

544
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,719
not forever.

545
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,560
However,

546
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,850
even if later,

547
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,670
our goals may become different,

548
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,489
the feelings we once shared

549
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,820
can still be genuine.

550
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,420
What's wrong?

551
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,489
Do I have pockmarks on my face?

552
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,550
It's just that

553
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,580
this doesn't sound like
something you would say.

554
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,650
Well, I just can't

555
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,490
always be so carefree, huh?

556
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,820
Actually, in the past two days,

557
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,190
I've been thinking about the whole thing.

558
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,930
Since that day

559
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,800
when we locked His Majesty and my brother

560
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,850
in the same room,

561
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,800
why did they suddenly

562
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,480
have such a big conflict?

563
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,770
After that,

564
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,040
my green nameplate was also revoked.

565
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,440
But you and His Majesty rushed

566
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,080
to look for me and save me

567
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,450
in the middle of the night.

568
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,680
And then later,

569
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,210
when my brother met with His Majesty,

570
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,150
they seemed to be in perfect sync.

571
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,340
It means that they didn't fall out.

572
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,100
Maybe they were just

573
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,050
pretending to quarrel

574
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,920
in order to lure someone out.

575
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,770
And the person who needed
to escape from the capital

576
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,210
was Yunqing.

577
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,090
It means that...

578
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,230
It means that the one with a problem

579
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,450
was Yunqing.

580
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,340
Anyway, I've long known that

581
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,290
this princess

582
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,650
is not a good person.

583
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,560
Back then, Yue Chi

584
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,460
insisted that I should save her.

585
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,000
Regarding Jiang Yunqing's matter,

586
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,460
let me say something fair.

587
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,180
The unluckiest one is still Huo Jingheng.

588
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,900
He has been constantly
targeted for assassination.

589
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,940
The one who came to
assassinate him was actually

590
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,120
a princess from the previous dynasty.

591
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Even in that case,

592
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,460
for the sake of you and your brother,

593
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,530
he has been compromising

594
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,930
and making concessions.

595
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,860
So, was it wrong for me to do that?

596
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,230
Whether it was wrong or not,

597
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,250
leave it to others to judge.

598
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,430
Anyway, to me,

599
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,690
you're always right.

600
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,860
Thank you, Tianzhao.

601
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,470
Look at this.

602
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,400
I made it.

603
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,370
Has His Majesty ever come here today?

604
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,820
There have been many
trivial matters in court recently.

605
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,440
When His Majesty has time,

606
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
he will surely come here.

607
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,970
Can you win today?

608
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,550
Of course I'm going to win.

609
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,730
Why are you here?

610
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,460
Of course we're here to make money.

611
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,010
Last time, you went away after you won.

612
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,410
That was against the code of mahjong.

613
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,400
So, do you want to play a round together?

614
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,180
Yes, of course.

615
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,620
Today, I saw

616
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,470
Eunuch Gui bringing

617
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,960
quite a few treasures here.

618
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,760
Alright.

619
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm just afraid you can't win.

620
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,720
Let's go.

621
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,570
Consort Yue has been upset lately.

622
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,730
If you have time,

623
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,550
go accompany her to relax.

624
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,670
Your Majesty, why aren't you
going by yourself?

625
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,220
Is it inconvenient?

626
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,650
Consort Yue is not favored now.

627
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,040
How could it be convenient
for His Majesty to go?

628
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,940
Lady Xia knows me well indeed.

629
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,610
Well...

630
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,660
Thank you, ladies.

631
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
As for the matter I've entrusted to you,

632
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,150
please keep it confidential.
