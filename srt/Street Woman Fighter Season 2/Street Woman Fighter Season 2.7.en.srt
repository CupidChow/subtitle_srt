00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,919
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,890
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,198
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,230
(Street Baby Fighter 2)

5
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,699
Cera looks like a fierce cat on the outside,

6
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,740
but when she's with the crew,

7
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,269
she's like a friendly puppy.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,078
(Acting like a puppy)

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,780
Her accent is adorable when she's with us.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,048
She usually looks like this, but when she speaks...

11
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,450
A leg split in the air.

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,820
She's so cute. She's just a baby.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,990
Our baby.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,320
In a word, Cera, the youngest member of our crew,

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,719
is a golden baby.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,530
She's golden. No, she's a diamond.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,929
She's better than gold.

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,530
Harimu and I are 19 years apart.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,700
Nineteen years?

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,398
We're 19 years apart.

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,798
She could have given birth to a girl your age.

22
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,039
Call her your mom.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,069
Though she's the youngest, the way she thinks is mature.

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,908
Her confidence gives...

25
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,909
the crew members and me conviction.

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,449
She's the youngest, but she's good enough to be the sub-leader.

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,480
(Confident)

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,819
Walking vitamin C, Capri!

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,849
I think everyone loves Audrey.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,419
She's like a rainbow.

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,890
That's who Capri is. That's what I think about her.

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,358
Who better to watch?

33
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,829
She shines so well.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,170
I'm the youngest member of BEBE, 20-year-old Soweon.

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,640
The youngest member of our crew is very quiet.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,039
She never speaks.

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,109
The evaluation...

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,439
(Thinking about what to say)

39
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,608
(What was I going to say?)

40
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,879
Loading.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,378
Beep.

42
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,378
Soweon means a lot to me.

43
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,879
- Come here, Soweon. - She...

44
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,378
looks like me when I was 20.

45
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,988
She's introverted and extremely careful.

46
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,518
I wanted to keep teaching her...

47
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,359
so that she'd be better than me when I was 20.

48
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,459
Am I the youngest?

49
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,829
But I'm 29.

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,260
That's great.

51
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,598
Hello. I'm the youngest member of Wolf'Lo,

52
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,670
Haechi Wang.

53
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,800
She's so weird.

54
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,668
(How did Haechi Wang meet the members of Wolf'Lo?)

55
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,068
I first met her...

56
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,878
when she was 18 or 19 years old.

57
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,379
She was in my class.

58
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,679
That was the first time...

59
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,156
I was intimidated by a student of mine.

60
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,580
(Laughing)

61
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,119
When Haechi looked at me like this,

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,948
she was so charismatic.

63
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,360
She's looked down on people her whole life.

64
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,189
- She looks at me like this. - "Looked down on people."

65
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,029
Most people lose it when they're 29,

66
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,560
but she's still got her spark.

67
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,400
I don't think so.

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,098
(These are the youngest members of each team on the show.)

69
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,198
(Interim check of the new song)

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,599
(The interim check for Hwasa's new song)

71
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,309
We'd have to win.

72
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,770
This mission belongs to us.

73
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,378
(Here are the intense performances of the 6 crews.)

74
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,908
(I can't choose.)

75
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,179
(What's the last mission before the final round?)

76
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,180
(The championship crew's benefit)

77
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,219
(A 50,000-dollar prize)

78
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,830
(Diamond rings for the champions from amondz)

79
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,499
(Vote for the crew performance to determine the championship crew.)

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
(To be continued shortly)

81
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,529
(One day after the Mega Crew Mission)

82
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,968
Congratulations on winning the Mega Crew Mission.

83
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,098
- Right. - Oh, right.

84
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,110
Thank you.

85
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,939
(1MILLION won the Mega Crew Mission.)

86
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,216
(The fruit of their hard work, including tears and sweat)

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,509
(They proved themselves through this mission.)

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,479
(Where are they with a light heart?)

89
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,589
- It's a pool! - No way!

90
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,288
Look at that.

91
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,489
Winning the Mega Crew Mission was worth all the effort.

92
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,658
I'm at the top of Yeouido.

93
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,728
Jealous?

94
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,299
(The 1MILLION members are in love with the infinity pool.)

95
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,359
(Splash)

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,269
(A violent water fight with love)

97
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,729
(They still take a selfie.)

98
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,340
(Another photo of memories with a superb view)

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,369
(Dessert for 1MILLION that's tired from all the fun)

100
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,478
This is seriously good. It's hotel food.

101
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,779
It's so nice.

102
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,878
They have such great food here.

103
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,749
A five-star hotel is certainly different.

104
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,718
- The view is amazing as well. - A five-star hotel.

105
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,288
So far, the crews that won the Mega Crew Mission...

106
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,490
won the championship.

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,020
(The Mega Crew Mission winner and the champion...)

108
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,360
(of "Street Woman Fighter," HolyBang)

109
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,199
(The Mega Crew Mission winner and the champion...)

110
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,569
(of "Street Man Fighter," Just Jerk)

111
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,268
We're going to win the show.

112
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,568
- Right. - Sure.

113
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:25,869
For the championship!

114
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,869
- Cheers! - Cheers!

115
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,338
- Let's win! - Let's win!

116
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,438
(They enjoyed the prize.)

117
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,086
(The 6 crews start preparing for Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.)

118
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,849
We have to go and practice now.

119
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,979
Yes. We have to start creating.

120
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,278
- Where would we do it, though? - Should I book a studio?

121
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,219
- Go ahead. - Try it.

122
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,119
I hope it's close.

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,060
We can check the area beforehand.

124
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,759
But it's so last minute. Can we still find a studio?

125
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,159
I always book it on this app.

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,229
- Really? - Yes.

127
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,399
"All regions. Seoul."

128
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,470
(Seoul)

129
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,139
"Dongdaemun." Then...

130
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,539
- There are so many. - The categories...

131
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,739
Now we can pick where to go.

132
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,078
Let's choose a large one.

133
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,979
- This one? - They also have a sofa.

134
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,609
We can rest on it.

135
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,779
Check the lights too.

136
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,049
Now, it's done.

137
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,119
It's so easy to find a studio nearby.

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,518
- I booked it. - Let's go.

139
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,990
- Let's go and work! - Here we go!

140
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,359
Awesome.

141
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,659
Check this out!

142
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,929
Thanks to Harimu...

143
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,898
- Thank you, Harimu! - She did it.

144
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,028
- Let's start practicing. - Okay.

145
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,240
- Let's win another one! - Yes!

146
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,338
- Shall we listen to the song again? - Yes.

147
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,419
(They get familiar with the song before practicing.)

148
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,648
She says, "Chilli," more than ten times in the song.

149
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,079
The Chilli Challenge.

150
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,318
We're trying to make one for a challenge.

151
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,549
We'll put all our time into the highlight.

152
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,088
I believe that I've become the master...

153
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,259
of creating highlight moves.

154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,999
You want people to be able to copy the challenge dance,

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,930
so they have to like it in three second.

156
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,699
What does chilli mean?

157
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:03,969
Does it mean chilling?

158
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,838
Let's have fun, then.

159
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,568
As easy and memorable as possible.

160
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,909
"Tastes like chilli." But chilli's hot.

161
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,409
I think that's the point.

162
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,480
- "Tastes like chilli." - That's right.

163
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,009
- I like that one. - Chilli.

164
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,249
- You're stirring the sauce. - Okay.

165
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,688
I think they will say that it's new.

166
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:23,250
(Bouncy)

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,088
- Oh, you're good. - That's all.

168
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,729
It's direct. We were satisfied...

169
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,159
when we came up with it.

170
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,698
- Let's go! - Let's go!

171
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,759
(The 6 crews finish practicing.)

172
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,068
Aren't you excited?

173
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,899
I'm kind of nervous.

174
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,109
My soul mate and producer,

175
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,169
Park Woo Sang.

176
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,770
(The producer of "Chilli," Park Woo Sang)

177
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,109
With Hwasa, I produced many songs...

178
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,949
such as "TWIT" and "Maria."

179
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,479
And I'm a producer who's a huge fan of "SWF," Park Woo Sang.

180
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,018
(Welcome.)

181
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,948
He also likes to dance.

182
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,318
He doesn't stop dancing when he likes a song.

183
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,490
What...

184
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,360
He danced so much when he produced "Chilli."

185
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,600
(Dancing)

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,769
(The powerful rhythm makes you dance.)

187
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,099
You can't call it a dance song...

188
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,638
- unless it makes you dance. - That's true.

189
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,239
I personally respect the dancers very much.

190
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,568
- I can't wait to see it. - Same.

191
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,909
- Shall we take a look? - Yes.

192
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,039
MANNEQUEEN.

193
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,079
- I'm so excited. - Right.

194
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,910
MANNEQUEEN will go first.

195
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,279
I'm so nervous.

196
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,948
Hello, we're...

197
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,219
- MANNEQUEEN! - MANNEQUEEN!

198
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,749
Yes!

199
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,119
(Another queen here)

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,318
The queen of queens!

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,290
In our crew, Hwasa will be played by...

202
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,699
(Who will dance as Hwasa?)

203
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,028
This time, Hwasa will be played...

204
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,146
(Who's going to play Hwasa?)

205
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,199
(Drum rolls)

206
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,970
Redlic!

207
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,698
(She wins the part.)

208
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,068
The moment I saw Hwasa,

209
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,910
I couldn't get the image of heels out of my head.

210
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,438
You can't set Hwasa and heels apart.

211
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,350
I believe that heels give the dance a much stronger sensation.

212
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,680
And Redlic has often danced with heels on.

213
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,919
So, I thought that Redlic was the right one...

214
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,720
to portray her sensual and sexy image.

215
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,328
Plus, she's the most experienced one among us...

216
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,959
in creating such a choreography.

217
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,360
BoA's "Forgive Me,"

218
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,430
aespa's "Black Mamba,"

219
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,769
and "Dreams Come True."

220
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,869
And there's "28 Reasons..."

221
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,170
that was just for Seulgi.

222
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,508
The fastest and most efficient way would be...

223
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,138
creating the movements for one line each.

224
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,708
We'd come up with the moves for each part,

225
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,749
show each other,

226
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,378
and put them together to make it.

227
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,379
Okay.

228
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,019
(The MANNEQUEEN members present their moves.)

229
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,360
Something like this.

230
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,388
It goes something like this.

231
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,758
It's your style.

232
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,559
I love this move.

233
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,058
Will it be too difficult to do them at the same time?

234
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,369
It's the Preview Mission, right?

235
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,869
I hope she gives us her trust this once.

236
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,209
"Chilli."

237
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm eager to pull it off,

238
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,439
but it puts pressure on me as well.

239
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,179
Okay.

240
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,508
- Good luck. - Good luck!

241
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,548
(Go, MANNEQUEEN!)

242
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,549
- Let's go! - Be confident.

243
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,719
She's a choreographer, so I bet she'll do it well.

244
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,059
- Right. - I think it'll be impressive.

245
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,159
(What's MANNEQUEEN's choreography for "Chilli"?)

246
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,439
(Redlic slays.)

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
That's so cool.

248
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,009
(MANNEQUEEN's highlight)

249
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,019
That's good. I like that.

250
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,590
(Slipping)

251
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,629
(Glancing)

252
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,000
(Funky Y makes a mistake.)

253
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,199
Oh, no.

254
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
It looked...

255
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,169
messy, should I say?

256
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,379
They didn't have the best teamwork in this one.

257
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,779
It was a bit complicated.

258
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,080
(Thinking)

259
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,090
Good job.

260
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,690
(Regretful)

261
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,189
(Blaming herself)

262
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,029
I made a huge mistake. I felt sorry.

263
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,528
I got the feeling...

264
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,058
that MANNEQUEEN has lost a lot of its energy.

265
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,999
So, I'm...

266
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,840
almost worried.

267
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,169
I'm the most worried about MANNEQUEEN.

268
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,240
Like, "Even I wouldn't pick their challenge."

269
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,480
It makes me sad...

270
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,549
that no one is expecting our choreography to win.

271
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,019
That's so sad.

272
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,519
That was the most upsetting part.

273
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,990
We were in a bad mood.

274
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,658
In all the missions,

275
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,860
we didn't get that many compliments,

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,258
so we all seemed tired...

277
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,599
and lethargic.

278
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,939
I felt that we had too many points.

279
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,809
And there were details that seemed tough to dance in sync.

280
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,909
But I like our choreography.

281
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
So do I.

282
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,249
We can eliminate some parts...

283
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,808
and reduce the number of movements.

284
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,949
I think it's a good idea to change it...

285
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,048
to something that we can have fun with.

286
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,049
That's true.

287
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,590
We had to put everything into changing it.

288
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,058
We can start from the top.

289
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,929
It's gotten a whole lot easier.

290
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,189
We're standing in a line.

291
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,658
- What? - In a line.

292
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,058
- I see. - Yes, like that.

293
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,668
(MANNEQUEEN practices the changed movements.)

294
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,669
Good.

295
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,469
Redlic volunteered...

296
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,539
to create the choreography.

297
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,969
She kept trying...

298
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,408
to play her part, so I was thankful.

299
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,209
Our crew keeps revising it and revising it.

300
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,479
The Revision Queen.

301
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,449
- Let's go. - Let's go!

302
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,378
- Let's go! - Let's go!

303
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,250
We can do it!

304
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,919
Let's start. Standby.

305
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:00,559
(MANNEQUEEN filmed the revised version.)

306
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,269
(Redlic stops dancing in the middle of the performance.)

307
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,908
- It's all right. - Sorry.

308
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,168
It's okay.

309
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,539
I'm so sorry.

310
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,980
(She seems unstable during the whole rehearsal.)

311
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,979
She was playing Hwasa's part,

312
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,449
which had to stand out,

313
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,418
so we decided to mouth the words...

314
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,190
and get the facial expressions right.

315
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:31,859
I think Redlic should monitor it the most times.

316
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,558
If it doesn't show even after memorizing all the lyrics,

317
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,929
you have to keep practicing until you get it.

318
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,629
(Redlic memorizes the lyrics as Funky Y advises.)

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,099
(Memorizing)

320
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,429
(Glancing)

321
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,639
Hwasa is worried.

322
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,710
- It's all right. - It sounds okay.

323
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,508
I'm sure it'll be okay on the stage.

324
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:50,809
Just have confidence.

325
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,240
Confidence!

326
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,249
She was playing an important role,

327
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,979
and she had to be on every little detail.

328
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,849
She seems to be under a lot of pressure...

329
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,090
and carrying a huge burden on her shoulders.

330
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,989
I got so nervous onstage...

331
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,758
because I was under so much pressure.

332
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,089
Let's try it again quickly.

333
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,288
- One more time. - Okay.

334
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,690
(MANNEQUEEN resumes the shoot.)

335
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,859
(Redlic makes a mistake once again.)

336
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,969
I started to panic,

337
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,169
and I even forgot the moves.

338
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,870
Okay, cut.

339
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,570
Let's take a quick look.

340
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:27,549
(Redlic pays attention to the part in which she made a mistake.)

341
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,179
I'm sorry.

342
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,549
I'm doing what I like to do the most,

343
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,519
but the fact that I'm doing such a bad job...

344
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,730
is really upsetting.

345
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,529
(Redlic is beating herself up over her mistake.)

346
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,299
I started to doubt myself.

347
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,398
(Funky Y goes over to Redlic.)

348
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,538
- Are you worried? - Sorry?

349
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,038
- Are you worried? - Sorry?

350
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,669
- Are you worried? - A little.

351
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,778
Even if you forget the lyrics,

352
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,049
don't get flustered. Just keep going.

353
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,378
- I'm sorry. - No.

354
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,048
- Don't be. - You're doing well.

355
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,918
I could feel that...

356
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,190
Redlic was under so much pressure.

357
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,789
You can do this.

358
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,850
(They encourage Redlic.)

359
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,360
(Patting)

360
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,428
Let's go, Redlic!

361
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,128
- Go! - We're going to be great.

362
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,759
- Of course. - I love you all.

363
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,100
I love you too.

364
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,230
("Chilli" by Hwasa, Choreography by MANNEQUEEN)

365
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,700
Let's go.

366
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,299
I'm excited.

367
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,308
(MANNEQUEEN's theme: With a move that looks like...)

368
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,808
(they're tasting chilli sauce as their iconic move, )

369
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,409
(MANNEQUEEN showcases their hot energy.)

370
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,080
They look beautiful.

371
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,149
Gosh, PVC skirt?

372
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,620
They got really cute outfits.

373
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,308
This must be the highlight. "Chilli."

374
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,449
- The arm stretch. - It's very simple.

375
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,019
- They changed it. - They changed it completely.

376
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,268
That's nice.

377
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,209
- That was pretty. - Yes.

378
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,980
Redlic is the heroine.

379
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,099
(Nodding)

380
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,370
Their energy.

381
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,768
(You can listen to "Chilli" on various music streaming sites.)

382
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,278
That was hot.

383
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,778
Their outfits were so pretty.

384
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,109
That's the Redlic we know.

385
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,178
Redlic looked really good.

386
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:51,249
Hot.

387
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,719
Redlic did a good job playing Hwasa.

388
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,549
Their moves are addictive.

389
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,418
(The highlight is easy to learn.)

390
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:00,158
Their dance is now perfect for a social media challenge.

391
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,058
They made it a lot simpler than the initial dance.

392
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,829
- It's actually much better now. - You're right.

393
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:08,528
Their initial choreography had...

394
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,328
different vibes.

395
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,739
This is much better.

396
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,768
That was my first thought.

397
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:19,509
Well, I wasn't entirely satisfied though.

398
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,348
It was very steady,

399
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:25,549
and it's a perfect choreography to be performed on music shows.

400
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,249
But it looked a little stiff.

401
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,989
Their dance was perfectly controlled and in sync,

402
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,990
and it actually looked static.

403
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,558
I guess it lacked...

404
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,190
MANNEQUEEN's energy.

405
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,930
Which crew is up next?

406
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,429
- It's Wolf'Lo. - Wolf'Lo.

407
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,598
Wolf'Lo is known as a legitimate hip-hop dance crew...

408
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,969
in the world of street dance.

409
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm also a street musician.

410
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,709
I started my music career in the street.

411
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,479
Can you recall some popular dance challenges?

412
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,910
This one was really popular. "Next Level" by aespa.

413
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,210
The choreographer is one of our competitors.

414
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,118
"Gashina" was popular too.

415
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,149
The choreographer is also our competitor.

416
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,788
- In the next room. - I hate that.

417
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,758
I know. We're competing with so many famous choreographers.

418
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,358
We should never try to be like them.

419
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,528
We'll end up ruining everything.

420
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,758
But I don't think we can...

421
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,400
choreograph the song with hip-hop dance only.

422
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,298
I was quite worried.

423
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,739
We're a team of dancers that love classic hip-hop dance.

424
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,969
We don't really create...

425
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,239
dance challenges that go viral...

426
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,139
or try and get media exposure.

427
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,609
We hardly do that.

428
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,449
(Wolf'Lo listens to "Chilli" again.)

429
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,880
The song is really good though.

430
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,979
The beat is the only thing that matters to dancers,

431
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,249
but to them, there's also lyrics.

432
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,088
- They're singing the song. - Yes, exactly.

433
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,959
Lyrics must be the thing they pay attention to the most.

434
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,429
Personally,

435
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,528
I work with the beat of the music or the instrument sounds...

436
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,959
most of the time.

437
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,068
But this time, we are choreographing an artist's song.

438
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,068
I felt like we had to express...

439
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:53,339
the lyrics through our dance.

440
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,670
Gosh, "Excavator"?

441
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,608
"This is my way, Excavator."

442
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,039
What kind of way is that?

443
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,008
"Do you really want a romance?"

444
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,778
So this part has to be romantic?

445
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,779
(Serious)

446
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,518
There's "romance" in the lyrics here.

447
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,848
I hate it, but let's do a little blues dance.

448
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,489
A little blues dance.

449
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,490
(Laughing embarrassedly)

450
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,588
(Confused)

451
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,259
(Uncomfortable)

452
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,588
And there's "Excavator."

453
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,129
I don't know what to do with that.

454
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,528
(One of them is in the zone.)

455
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,929
We have Mini.

456
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,430
I thought we could count on her.

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,999
- She's the all-rounder in our crew. - I see.

458
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,808
When she practices, she dances...

459
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,109
to all kinds of genres.

460
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,538
When she teaches classes,

461
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,479
she does lyrical and sexy dances as well.

462
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,479
She dances to the trendy upbeat music and also K-pop.

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,619
She dances to all kinds of music.

464
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,920
That's Mini's strength. Expressiveness.

465
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,318
She uses her hands and facial expressions so well.

466
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,319
She comes up with such creative ideas.

467
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,328
(They all agreed that Mini should play Hwasa.)

468
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,028
(Mini Hwasa)

469
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,768
Imagine you have chilli sauce.

470
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,899
You're dipping your finger in the sauce.

471
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Chilli sauce.

472
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:02,409
We dip our fingers in the sauce and taste it.

473
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,739
The spicy taste. That's what I wanted to express.

474
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,239
Collarbone and then chest.

475
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,548
(Mini choreographed the hook which is the highlight.)

476
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:11,679
For our choreograph,

477
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,250
Mini will be playing Hwasa.

478
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,889
She will be playing Hwasa.

479
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,720
- One, two, three. Wolf! - Wolf!

480
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,119
Let's go!

481
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,858
Go, Wolf'Lo.

482
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:23,990
Hey!

483
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,700
(Excited)

484
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,599
(How did Wolf'Lo choreographed "Chilli"?)

485
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,900
(Paying attention)

486
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,939
(Among hip-hop dancers, )

487
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,508
(Mini makes an impactful entrance.)

488
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,769
(Impressed)

489
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,690
(Copying her expression)

490
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,160
(Paying attention)

491
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,529
(Let's make some noise!)

492
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,630
(Mini is on fire.)

493
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,568
(Dip your finger in the sauce...)

494
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:06,640
(and taste it.)

495
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,180
(That was hot.)

496
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,349
(She finishes it up nicely.)

497
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,578
Nice!

498
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,318
- Mini is right for the job. - Yes.

499
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,548
See? Mini is good.

500
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,518
- You're right. - I knew it since the Class Mission.

501
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,289
- Thank you. - Thank you.

502
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,389
(Bowing)

503
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,690
First of all, I loved it.

504
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,429
She lost herself. I saw it in her eyes.

505
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,660
(My strategy worked.)

506
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,499
(Mini was like Hwasa herself.)

507
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,499
That's all I needed to see.

508
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,568
Great job.

509
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,740
Thank you.

510
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,108
Mini did an amazing job.

511
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,210
I really loved their choreography.

512
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,149
It's the energy they exude.

513
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,008
Mini was really impressive as well.

514
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,149
I'm looking forward to seeing...

515
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,819
Wolf'Lo's final work.

516
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,018
Play the music, please.

517
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:58,288
Stand with your legs apart.

518
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,819
With your legs wide apart.

519
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,159
- Are you ready to rehearse? - Yes.

520
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,229
It's time.

521
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,299
Everyone hasn't completely memorized the moves.

522
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,119
(Practice session after interim check)

523
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,598
(Yeni Cho doesn't look happy.)

524
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,239
At some point, I realized...

525
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,169
we were disregarding Hwasa's role.

526
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,538
We were focused only on the choreography.

527
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,139
I don't know if this is okay.

528
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,239
We switch places too often among ourselves.

529
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,979
It feels like...

530
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,220
Hwasa would be just going back and forth.

531
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,149
Hwasa stays put...

532
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,788
from start to finish...

533
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,249
while the rest of us switch places.

534
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,859
That's unnecessary, isn't it?

535
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,018
Listen. I think...

536
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,729
we should have more dynamic formations like the other crews.

537
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,789
We're not doing that.

538
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,798
- We're just dancing. - You're right.

539
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,900
The formation should make the artist stand out.

540
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,269
If we do that, I think we can win.

541
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,569
Well, I...

542
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,179
I'll just...

543
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
What's wrong?

544
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,410
I'll just be completely honest with you.

545
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,719
You seem really upset.

546
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,449
(Upset)

547
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,220
Calm down and tell us.

548
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,190
If we keep this up, I'll be embarrassed.

549
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,598
Honestly, this isn't even the hip-hop dance we do best.

550
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,230
It's like Hwasa is just stuck in the middle of us.

551
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,670
So what exactly do you want to change and how?

552
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,669
Even if the dance becomes simpler,

553
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,508
I believe the formations should make her stand out.

554
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:27,910
If you and Haechi Wang could make that happen,

555
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,009
- it'd be great. - Absolutely.

556
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,019
I don't want us to finish last.

557
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,849
I hope we'll at least finish second to last.

558
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:41,559
I want us to give it our best and improve the things we can.

559
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,430
"Cash, I tore..."

560
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,200
How about we get down like this?

561
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,528
We changed everything.

562
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:51,098
We restructured our entire choreography...

563
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,338
around Hwasa's movement.

564
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,308
We needed someone to constantly remind us of what's important,

565
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,669
and the girls did exactly that.

566
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,278
- The artist is on her way. - Yes.

567
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,709
Make sure there aren't any obsessive fans. She's on her way.

568
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,950
Hit the lights.

569
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,579
It's Wolf'Lo.

570
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,578
Those cool girls.

571
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,650
I think it'll be well-structured.

572
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,490
And I liked that they didn't try too hard.

573
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,420
It wasn't too intense.

574
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,789
Here we go.

575
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,960
Let's go, Wolf'Lo.

576
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,899
(Wolf'Lo's theme: They express the hot taste of "Chilli"...)

577
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,399
(and its various rhythms...)

578
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,799
(through their groovy style.)

579
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,940
Hwasa wearing pink hair.

580
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,899
I like Mini's silver outfit.

581
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,240
Yes, it really pops.

582
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,508
And her pink hair?

583
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,538
- They work. - Yes.

584
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,480
- The princess and the wolves. - Gosh.

585
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,000
- New formations. - Yes, they added new formations.

586
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,299
- It's much cleaner than before. - It is.

587
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
That's sexy.

588
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,616
It's cool how they're dancing with straight faces.

589
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,548
- They look swaggy. - Right.

590
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,108
It's like they're protecting Mini.

591
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,049
- Bodyguards. - They're like bodyguards.

592
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,629
(MANNEQUEEN is captivated by Wolf'Lo.)

593
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,170
How could they dance like that to K-pop?

594
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,940
That was so cool.

595
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,740
Yes, that's what we wanted to see.

596
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,579
The artist stands out much more now.

597
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,799
Is she watering them?

598
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
"Water my garden."

599
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:49,379
(You can listen to "Chilli" on various music streaming sites.)

600
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,278
(You can listen to "Chilli" on various music streaming sites.)

601
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,720
That was sexy.

602
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,089
I love you, Chocol!

603
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,819
- They're so cool. - They did it in their own style.

604
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,818
It looks much rougher than before,

605
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,130
but they toned it down a lot in terms of intensity.

606
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,959
When it goes, "Burning taste,"

607
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,229
the rest of them turn around,

608
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,469
and Mini's facial expression catches your eye.

609
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,499
That was impressive.

610
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,298
They expressed the lyrics perfectly.

611
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,399
Did it burn?

612
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,569
It burned.

613
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,268
It was good, but I felt...

614
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,609
a clear distinction between...

615
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,379
the artist and the dancers.

616
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,150
- They weren't in harmony. - That's right.

617
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,508
They're cool doing their own thing,

618
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,849
but it didn't feel like it connected.

619
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
(You're right.)

620
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:29,791
Is this the right choreography for the artist?

621
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,548
I'm not sure.

622
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,818
I don't know if this will get picked.

623
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,558
I bet she's never been offered a choreography like this.

624
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,289
That's right. I'm sure of that.

625
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,966
(What do Hwasa and the songwriter think?)

626
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,429
It was definitely freer.

627
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,869
Actually, I thought their work was...

628
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,268
quite choreographic for a street dance crew.

629
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,015
They clearly tried to make it easier for you...

630
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,008
so you wouldn't sweat.

631
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,339
There were a lot of moments when you don't dance...

632
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,079
and focus on singing instead.

633
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,649
But performing this song, you've got to sweat.

634
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,450
You're right. I want to go crazy.

635
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,019
This choreography grows on you.

636
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,220
- Don't get attached. Next. - We've watched it many times.

637
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,789
And in this mission,

638
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,829
you can earn extra points for a dance challenge.

639
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,798
These days, when an artist releases a new song,

640
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,200
they've got to do a dance challenge on social media.

641
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,130
It's really important.

642
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,369
When it's aimed for a challenge, the agency gives you an order.

643
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,538
To make it simple and eye-catching.

644
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,739
(And that's exactly what she did.)

645
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,579
It should be original and unique.

646
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,349
They ask for something that can impress the public.

647
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,848
In a word, it has to be perfect.

648
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:36,118
But a dance challenge does make the song popular.

649
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,019
That's a really good effect of it.

650
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,789
The choreographer can take the credit,

651
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,190
and it promotes the artist at the same time.

652
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,899
For "Street Woman Fighter" and "Street Man Fighter,"

653
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,575
the challenges came from the Class Mission.

654
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,199
(The "Smoke" challenge was also popular this season.)

655
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,669
(Lee Min Woo, RAIN, Jungkook, and V of BTS)

656
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,139
(Yunho, Jay Park and Mike Song, Hoshi and DK, TAEYONG)

657
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,568
(Men and women of all ages joined the challenge.)

658
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,249
(It included even the popular characters.)

659
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,109
But this time, it's for the New Song Mission.

660
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,879
Everyone in my crew including myself...

661
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,479
takes dance challenges seriously.

662
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
This is good news for us.

663
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:08,349
Number seven.

664
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,048
"Chilli."

665
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,858
- Should we try this? - Yes.

666
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,189
Ready, go.

667
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,858
(They come up with a move using number seven.)

668
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,859
It should show the choreographer's style,

669
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,159
it should be easy for people to learn,

670
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,129
and it should suit the artist's taste.

671
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,528
I always try...

672
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,670
to create something that satisfies all these three conditions.

673
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,199
Chilli, and...

674
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
Bam, bam, bam.

675
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,369
Is this too hip-hop?

676
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,940
There should be moments where we make the artist stand out.

677
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:37,279
I wonder what kind of dance Hwasa wants to do.

678
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,200
The kind of dance she wants to learn.

679
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,618
(During the mission presentation)

680
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:43,419
All I want to say to you is...

681
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,420
that you just need to show me...

682
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,420
how you've made your way here and why you're here.

683
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,889
(Hwasa emphasized on expressing the crew's own style.)

684
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,299
I'm ready to do my best to learn.

685
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,538
She asked to see what kind of dance we do,

686
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,000
so let's make it our way while integrating Hwasa into it.

687
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,568
(BEBE studies Hwasa's performance videos.)

688
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,210
I've watched a lot of her videos.

689
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:07,139
It seemed like...

690
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,780
the chemistry and teamwork with the dancers were important to her.

691
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,649
Instead of performing alone,

692
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,150
if we do it together, it'll create good synergy.

693
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:17,889
How about this?

694
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,118
Hwasa walks away...

695
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,318
like this,

696
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,629
and we could maybe clap while she dances.

697
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,350
(They try to make Hwasa stand out as well.)

698
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,230
(Dancing)

699
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,699
We'll do our best.

700
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,868
Hwasa, are you watching this?

701
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,528
Hwasa, are you watching?

702
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,400
We're working very hard, so please look forward to it.

703
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,140
The song is great.

704
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,539
The dance is great too.

705
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,009
It's almost here.

706
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:41,740
- No way. - I'll go get it.

707
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,150
I'll come with you.

708
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,609
Okay, the two of us will go.

709
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,449
(During the K-pop Death match Mission)

710
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,679
Without Bada,

711
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,220
we were just lost.

712
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,319
Show me what you've got so far.

713
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,959
We've just been talking about it.

714
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
So you've got nothing.

715
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,960
At that time,

716
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:58,759
I was really mad at myself.

717
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm the sub-leader.

718
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,529
Should we try it by ourselves?

719
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,768
Now, we stop at the knees, okay?

720
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:07,839
- Okay. - Okay.

721
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,339
I want your moves to be clearer.

722
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:13,079
A lot of them are pretty vague.

723
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,679
(Members of BEBE are growing up together.)

724
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,410
Soweon, you were a little behind. Again.

725
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,649
(Under Lusher's supervision, their dance is getting better.)

726
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,290
One of the good things about our dance...

727
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:22,720
is cleanness.

728
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,450
We pay attention to details...

729
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,396
and try to dance as much in sync as possible.

730
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,789
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

731
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,230
What do you think?

732
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:31,609
There must be something better. Let's keep thinking.

733
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,099
We wanted to make it perfect,

734
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,400
so we kept on working until we were satisfied.

735
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,569
Someone's hand looks different.

736
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,440
We should keep trying.

737
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,069
(On the day of the interim check)

738
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,240
I'll give you a quick explanation of our theme.

739
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,009
(Going over the choreography until the last minute)

740
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,579
- They look busy, so I'll speak. - Okay.

741
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,049
It already looks so clean.

742
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,970
It looks perfect. Are they still worried about messing up?

743
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,618
Our theme is...

744
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,519
Street Woman Fighter.

745
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,389
Like you said,

746
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,629
it says "Street Woman Fighter" right in the song.

747
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,499
We really loved that and wanted to make...

748
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,829
the dance about it.

749
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,930
So we tried to depict the show with our dance.

750
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,039
(How did they choreograph Hwasa's new song?)

751
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,579
I'm curious about BEBE's dance.

752
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,849
(Street Woman Fighter)

753
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,719
(Depicting the 1-on-1 battle)

754
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,390
(Goodness)

755
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,630
K-pop is their strong suit indeed.

756
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,960
Let's go!

757
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,700
(The highlight of BEBE's choreography)

758
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,369
(I like this part.)

759
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,039
(Hwasa loves it.)

760
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,380
Look at Bada's hips.

761
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,410
(Screaming)

762
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:59,319
(Take a look at the second highlight.)

763
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,618
It's so clean.

764
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:03,950
They put so much in there.

765
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,660
(Looking relaxed)

766
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,689
(Pterodactyl sounds come from all sides of the room.)

767
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,999
That lingering move.

768
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I loved the highlight.

769
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,700
- They're so good. - They really are so good.

770
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,339
Slay.

771
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Gosh.

772
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,109
(Please.)

773
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,009
I have nothing to say to you.

774
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,009
I want to say as less as possible right now.

775
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,679
Your dance...

776
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,349
It was close to perfection.

777
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,690
- Thank you. - Good job.

778
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,259
BEBE made the most lasting impression.

779
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,660
First of all, their energy was overwhelming.

780
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:45,729
I believe the energy that takes over the stage is highly important.

781
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,400
I think BEBE did the best in that area.

782
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:51,730
- Good job. - Good job, everyone.

783
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,899
- Let's stay focused. - We have to stay more focused.

784
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,420
- Of course, we have to do better. - We have to do even better.

785
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,640
We don't know how the situation will change.

786
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,539
We can never let our guard down.

787
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,848
Let's have the back row move more.

788
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,518
- Okay. - We'll almost stay in place.

789
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,618
Try to be as precise and powerful as possible, and keep smiling.

790
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,619
- Okay. - Okay.

791
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,888
- That's our strength. - Okay.

792
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,629
We thought we should create the rest of the performance...

793
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,630
to fit Hwasa, so she could pull it off.

794
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,629
The song has many sexy parts,

795
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,768
so I think it would be good to go down on the floor.

796
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:28,439
We thought it would fit the song if we went down on the floor,

797
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,840
so we tried all kinds of things.

798
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,279
Bada came up with this idea,

799
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,579
and she is doing everything by hand right now.

800
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,780
(She prints "CHILLI BEBE" with care.)

801
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
(She puts in a lot of effort hoping for a collaboration with Hwasa.)

802
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:43,650
Look at the details.

803
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,618
I really hope Hwasa...

804
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:47,859
- chooses us. - Please.

805
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,459
Our dance is so fun.

806
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,360
- You'll know if you try dancing it. - We'll show you something hot.

807
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,069
- That's right. - We'll let you experience it.

808
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,529
All you have to do is shake your bottom.

809
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,570
(Laughing)

810
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,376
(The youngest dancers' quiet bottom provocation)

811
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,408
(They finish getting ready and enter the stage.)

812
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:06,079
It is time.

813
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,439
- During the interim check, - Yes?

814
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,379
BEBE was unrivalled in first place.

815
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,420
They had prepared everything in detail from the start.

816
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,420
- I was overwhelmed by BEBE. - I see.

817
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:18,788
I still remember their choreography during the interim check.

818
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:21,618
- They moved their hands diagonally. - Yes, like this.

819
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,658
- They also did this. - Right.

820
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:27,098
I'm curious if the level of completion they showed during...

821
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,428
- the interim check is still there. - I look forward to seeing it.

822
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,776
- Right. - Of course, we look forward to it.

823
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,829
I hope they don't live up to our expectations.

824
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,599
- It's BEBE. - It's BEBE.

825
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,808
Are they wearing racing suits?

826
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,239
Yes, I think so.

827
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,308
("Chilli" by Hwasa, Choreography by BEBE)

828
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:41,709
(A unique and highly addictive dance you want to follow once you see it, )

829
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,310
(it has the kitsch taste of BEBE with powerful spice added to it)

830
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,629
They move like they are one body.

831
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,529
It must be difficult to be in sync with that dance.

832
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,429
- How are they so in sync? - They're a team.

833
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,380
Yes, this was it.

834
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,129
Their hand movements are very detailed as well.

835
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,558
- Is that the number seven? - You're right.

836
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,030
They're very good at the highlights.

837
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,730
They're good.

838
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,119
(They all gasp at once.)

839
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,119
- What was that? - Unbelievable.

840
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,959
They go far crawling.

841
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,119
My goodness.

842
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,989
They did something very simple.

843
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,689
They make the song look so good.

844
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,558
That's a novel composition.

845
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,820
It's very Bada-like.

846
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,169
- What? - The bottom.

847
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,340
They were aiming for this.

848
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,509
- Bada. - Gosh.

849
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,279
I can't believe she did something like that.

850
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,440
- Yes. - Gosh.

851
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,848
They tried hard.

852
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,250
They tried to make it fit Hwasa.

853
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,598
- It lasts in your memory. - Right.

854
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,969
- It'd be good for a challenge. - It's delicious.

855
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,800
They're really good.

856
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:35,150
(Listen to Hwasa's new song "Chilli" on all streaming platforms.)

857
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,948
It's so clean.

858
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,359
- These two moves. - Right.

859
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,240
They were able to make the two moves stand out.

860
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,558
They are firm in sticking to BEBE's style.

861
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,558
- Yes, they are. - They definitely are.

862
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,459
It would look good if KAI danced it.

863
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,529
(In total agreement)

864
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,928
- Right? - It would be amazing.

865
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,868
It would look very trendy.

866
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,869
I think Hwasa could think of it...

867
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,238
as a challenge, and want to do it.

868
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,408
- You're right with this one. - Right?

869
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:01,709
It's different from Hwasa's usual style, and is novel.

870
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,610
- When I was watching it, - Yes?

871
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,719
I thought it didn't fit the music.

872
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,379
- I see. - I mean the flow of the dance.

873
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,289
- The latter part? - No, overall.

874
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,988
I don't think it goes well with Hwasa's voice.

875
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,420
She has a sexy voice.

876
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:15,488
This is how she sings,

877
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,558
but even in those parts,

878
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,988
(LADYBOUNCE doesn't think the dance was Hwasa's style.)

879
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,900
the dance is very powerful.

880
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,558
(What did Park Woo Sang, the songwriter, think?)

881
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,570
What do you think?

882
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,169
(Sighing)

883
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:28,368
- I honestly love that style, - Yes?

884
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:31,510
- but it doesn't fit the song. - I see.

885
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,239
I think it started with the outfits.

886
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,449
- Is that a flight suit? - Yes.

887
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,209
They were totally in sync,

888
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,956
- and the choreography was amazing. - Right?

889
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,249
The way they expressed the moves...

890
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,749
- was impressive. - Right.

891
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,618
But the vibe, which is essential, seems to lack something.

892
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,988
I had similar thoughts,

893
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,090
and it isn't spicy enough.

894
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:54,500
Do you know what I mean? It's a bit mild.

895
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,399
I like the moves and how casual they are.

896
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,169
Also, the dancers in the back are so good together.

897
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,868
- Yes, I see that. - Right?

898
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,340
- They are one body. - My attention doesn't get divided.

899
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,649
I feel like it's such a loss.

900
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,009
- Me too. - Is the next team...

901
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,049
- LADYBOUNCE? - Yes.

902
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,549
LADYBOUNCE has been well-known in street dancing...

903
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,889
- for a long time. - That's right.

904
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,119
Okay. Let's go, LADYBOUNCE.

905
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,630
I look forward to seeing them dance.

906
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,529
- Hi, we're LADYBOUNCE. - LADYBOUNCE.

907
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,658
(Nice energy.)

908
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:29,569
I will play the role of Hwasa.

909
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,229
- Okay. - We...

910
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,039
want to have fun with you.

911
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,738
I love it.

912
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,339
Let's see it.

913
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,670
I don't believe it.

914
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,178
(LADYBOUNCE looks more nervous than ever.)

915
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:43,309
I'm nervous.

916
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,209
We've never been this unprepared...

917
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,018
for a mission.

918
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,519
I was honestly nervous.

919
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:50,348
(LADYBOUNCE held a meeting after the mission was revealed.)

920
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,618
We just had to show them our style for the K-pop Mission.

921
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,089
- But this is a Preview Mission. - Right.

922
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,429
Hwasa has to do the dance.

923
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,058
- We used to dance with Hwasa. - That's right.

924
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:02,328
NOB and I performed as Hwasa's backup dancers...

925
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:04,130
for quite a long time.

926
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,968
I think she likes the synergy...

927
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,308
- created with the male dancers. - I see.

928
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:14,809
So she often uses a mix of male and female dancers.

929
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,309
It was for most of her performances.

930
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,009
That's something we can do.

931
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,888
- Hwasa seems to like challenges. - Right.

932
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:26,459
There were no performances where she just had fun on stage.

933
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,090
- You want it to be fun? - Yes.

934
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,129
She said she wanted to try something challenging with different dancers.

935
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,659
It should be novel.

936
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,070
(They start practicing.)

937
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,698
(The more they practice...)

938
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,070
This is so our style.

939
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:48,839
(It's like "Next Level.")

940
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,750
(They calm down and get back to practice.)

941
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,880
(This performance looks familiar.)

942
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,618
(Tilting their heads to the side)

943
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:57,750
Is this right?

944
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,090
Is it right?

945
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,760
- That's good. Bam-bam. - Bam-bam.

946
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,158
(Dazed)

947
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,058
This is too much like a LADYBOUNCE performance.

948
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,059
It isn't a preview for her song.

949
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,538
We weren't able to come up...

950
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:15,499
with a good way to show off our strengths...

951
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,139
and Hwasa's charm together.

952
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:19,409
Maybe we should just...

953
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,980
focus on the dance challenge part.

954
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,510
- That's important. - Yes, it is.

955
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,079
(They create the highlight first.)

956
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,690
Is this too difficult?

957
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,489
We can make it easy.

958
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,218
(Like this?)

959
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,690
It's the same, but just with hands.

960
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:40,499
We should mix Afro dance moves into it...

961
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,268
to create a fun and lively vibe.

962
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,598
(They monitor the choreography they came up with.)

963
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:47,468
We wanted to add Afro dance moves.

964
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,339
I don't think these moves...

965
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,009
have any advantages.

966
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,538
We just came up with a dance move...

967
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,739
we're good at rather than a highlight.

968
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,308
We were quite frazzled.

969
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:59,149
(What result will LADYBOUNCE's unexpected dilemma bring them?)

970
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,779
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

971
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,849
They must be nervous.

972
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,489
- Let's go. - Let's go.

973
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:08,919
That's so cute.

974
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,190
Cute.

975
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,559
It's LADYBOUNCE's style.

976
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,599
(They start with a fun LADYBOUNCE-like opening.)

977
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:40,689
- Okay. - Nice.

978
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,820
I love the beginning.

979
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,888
(Like this.)

980
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,328
That was really fun.

981
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:47,359
Just like NOB mentioned,

982
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,960
it looked like you were having fun.

983
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,769
However,

984
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,768
I felt myself lose focus...

985
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,340
and get distracted towards the end.

986
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,238
It did lack something.

987
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,440
It's boring.

988
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,848
Nothing was impressive.

989
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,078
During the hook...

990
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,349
I should've seen something that stood out,

991
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,349
but they weren't able to do that compared to the other teams.

992
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:13,018
I'd be grateful if you could build something cool up...

993
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,119
from this performance.

994
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,529
We won't get chosen if we keep this up.

995
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,860
We had to make modifications.

996
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,259
(After the interim check...)

997
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,859
The first thing I thought...

998
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,729
was that we have to satisfy Hwasa's needs.

999
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,169
This is what I thought about today's performance.

1000
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,138
We wanted to somewhat satisfy Hwasa's needs...

1001
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:33,039
while showing somewhat of our colour.

1002
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:34,709
Hwasa won't like this, right?

1003
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,979
(They were contemplating over the same thing from the start.)

1004
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,549
Hwasa like using her bottom.

1005
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,879
Should we slap her bottom?

1006
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,979
We need to do something that stands for Hwasa.

1007
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,019
Didn't we agree...

1008
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:44,590
to do something neutral?

1009
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,359
I think that's why we couldn't make more of an impact.

1010
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,129
There are points for the highlight.

1011
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,698
If we focus on that part,

1012
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:54,928
we might be able to get through to her.

1013
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:57,828
You move forward while we move backward.

1014
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:00,199
Look in the direction you're standing and turn your hands.

1015
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,738
Capri and I love challenges.

1016
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,408
Whenever there is a new K-pop song,

1017
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:07,239
we do the dance challenges.

1018
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,649
We decided to focus on the lyrics for the highlight.

1019
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,949
- Feel it. - Feel it.

1020
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,679
(Day of the shoot)

1021
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,189
(NOB is holding a microphone during the rehearsal.)

1022
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,559
Our secret weapon was a handheld microphone.

1023
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,759
Hwasa is good at live stages...

1024
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,359
and it's her strength.

1025
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,059
I noticed she always uses handheld microphones.

1026
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,359
We needed to show her...

1027
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,029
when to focus on dancing, and when to merely make gestures.

1028
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,328
We thought it was necessary...

1029
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,368
to move her heart.

1030
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,738
That's why we prepared the handheld microphone.

1031
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,509
- Wait. - What is it?

1032
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,509
The microphone is heavy.

1033
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,849
- Use something else. - It'll be heavy on stage too.

1034
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,348
You're like a singer.

1035
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:46,555
(NOB is immersed in her role as Hwasa.)

1036
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,348
I memorized the lyrics...

1037
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,089
to make it easier to deliver.

1038
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,090
It's so hard to sing while dancing.

1039
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:54,759
We tried very hard.

1040
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,589
I hope she sees our unique concept,

1041
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,959
how we're different from others,

1042
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,030
and gets attracted to the novelty of it.

1043
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,459
LADYBOUNCE is next.

1044
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,199
- LADYBOUNCE? - Clean LADYBOUNCE.

1045
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,868
Our strength is our clean dances.

1046
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,069
They're good together...

1047
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,209
and they have a strong energy...

1048
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,609
that comes from within.

1049
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,738
LADYBOUNCE must've depicted it in their own style.

1050
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,979
I think they'd come up with something Hwasa never tried...

1051
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,149
and suggest it to her.

1052
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,249
- Like a proposal? - Yes, that's what I expect.

1053
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,280
- Try this. - Right.

1054
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:29,828
("Chilli" by Hwasa, Choreography by LADYBOUNCE)

1055
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,159
- That's so cute. - So cute.

1056
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,069
- They're like a children's choir. - Wait.

1057
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,299
- She brought a microphone. - That's scary.

1058
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,669
- That's so cute. - So cute.

1059
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,768
They're using a microphone.

1060
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,038
She tried to look as close to Hwasa as possible.

1061
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:42,698
They took a different approach.

1062
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,339
What they're wearing is interesting. I like that fit,

1063
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,679
but it's crazy they're all wearing different outfits.

1064
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,649
(LADYBOUNCE's choreography concept)

1065
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,348
(A stage the artist and dancers can enjoy together...)

1066
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:53,789
(with a highlight that is addictive, but has a simple rhythm)

1067
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,118
She even switched the hands holding the microphone.

1068
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,919
They must've gotten a lot of practice.

1069
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,459
That's cute. It has a lot of character.

1070
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,460
- They're all so good I'm dazzled. - They're so pretty.

1071
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,289
- They made it look so fun, right? - Yes.

1072
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:07,018
- I like the feet. - That's cool.

1073
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,859
(Getting excited!)

1074
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,135
- Awesome. - This makes me feel excited.

1075
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,288
They suddenly show so much potential.

1076
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,460
She's a diva.

1077
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,050
They're dancing in pairs.

1078
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:38,589
She might want to do something like that.

1079
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,759
It's hip.

1080
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,359
It's very well-structured.

1081
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,630
They made sure to fill it in nicely like I expected.

1082
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,569
(Listen to Hwasa's new song "Chilli" on all streaming platforms.)

1083
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,170
It's like the ending of a singer's stage.

1084
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,609
How did she become so hot?

1085
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,609
This was a rediscovery of NOB.

1086
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,408
She used a handheld microphone.

1087
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:37,808
Yes, that was cool.

1088
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:41,018
They said they wanted to create a stage to have fun together.

1089
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,949
- I think they succeeded. - I agree.

1090
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,848
However, I don't think it draws you in.

1091
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:46,988
Right, I think it'll look normal.

1092
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:49,859
It'll look normal if Hwasa does the dance.

1093
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,899
NOB has more of a swaggy vibe than Hwasa.

1094
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,959
Hwasa is sexier in presence.

1095
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,800
I'm not sure if she would find that appealing.

1096
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,199
(After watching LADYBOUNCE's performance)

1097
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:03,768
What do you think?

1098
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:06,808
- It's brighter than I expected. - Yes, it is.

1099
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:09,078
They were the only ones that interpreted it in a different way.

1100
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,948
You could say it showed...

1101
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,448
- more of LADYBOUNCE's colour. - That's right.

1102
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:17,589
I like that in a way.

1103
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,618
They didn't lose their colour,

1104
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,058
but unravelled it well.

1105
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,759
They overall vibe is exciting.

1106
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,129
Yes, it's cute.

1107
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,659
That's right. It's cute.

1108
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,030
One downside is none of the moves made a lasting impression.

1109
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,129
- There are no highlights, right? - Yes.

1110
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,439
- Even for "taste like chilli," - Yes.

1111
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,198
There should've been a dance that stood out as interesting.

1112
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,238
(She is sad there weren't any moves that stood out.)

1113
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:38,968
Sadly, I didn't find any.

1114
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,609
Right, the parts I wasn't satisfied with...

1115
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,578
were when the lyrics "click," "flare up,"

1116
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:44,109
and "excavator" came up.

1117
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,678
There were certain moves to fit the lyrics,

1118
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,118
but they were too detailed...

1119
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,289
- that it was hard to feel it. - Okay.

1120
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,488
- They were moves like... - Yes?

1121
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:54,659
- "flare up," and "excavator." - "Excavator."

1122
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:58,130
- It didn't really show. - I see.

1123
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,799
Which crew do you think will do the best in this mission?

1124
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,959
1MILLION.

1125
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,229
- 1MILLION. - 1MILLION.

1126
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,928
They often work with Hwasa.

1127
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,738
("Maria," Hwasa's mega hit song)

1128
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:08,799
I choreographed it.

1129
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,238
I also choreographed "I'm a B."

1130
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,779
After that, I did "AYA" and "ILLELA."

1131
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,509
I can't remember all the songs...

1132
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,649
because I did so many with Hwasa and MAMAMOO.

1133
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,348
I clearly know what it is...

1134
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:22,449
that looks cool when Hwasa does it.

1135
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,519
Who wants to be Hwasa?

1136
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,919
(Deciding who will be Hwasa, the most important role of the mission)

1137
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,988
Me.

1138
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:29,859
Debby wants to do it.

1139
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,529
I knew I could do a good job,

1140
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,260
so I wanted the role of Hwasa.

1141
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,630
Does anyone else want the role?

1142
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,198
I want to do it because it's Hwasa.

1143
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,238
- Right? - Yes.

1144
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,439
I thought of the two of you.

1145
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,509
When I did the previews,

1146
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,038
you both played the role of Hwasa.

1147
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,049
In the preview video of "Maria,"

1148
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,309
I played the role of Hwasa.

1149
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,279
(Harimu played Hwasa while helping with the choreograph...)

1150
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,018
(for the preview video of "ILLELA" by MAMAMOO.)

1151
00:51:56,019 --> 00:51:58,589
Who do you think would be better for "Chilli?"

1152
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,158
The dance I have in my mind...

1153
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,589
fits Harimu...

1154
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,859
a bit better.

1155
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,259
When I heard the song,

1156
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,359
I thought of Harimu.

1157
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,268
What do you think, Debby?

1158
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,238
Since we don't have much time,

1159
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:16,198
I think it's better if we go with this decision.

1160
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,469
I'm sure Harimu can do a good job as well.

1161
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:22,509
Let's go with Harimu.

1162
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,808
We'll let Harimu do it.

1163
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,919
Of course, I wanted the role. I did, but we didn't have time.

1164
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,718
I also knew Harimu...

1165
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:31,649
would do a good job.

1166
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,459
I want to be better than the Hwasas of the other crews.

1167
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,689
I'd like to be 100 percent like Hwasa.

1168
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,529
I am Hwarimu, playing the role of Hwasa.

1169
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,629
The great Hwarimu.

1170
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,899
Hwarimu.

1171
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,569
You're even wearing red boots.

1172
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,800
She's wearing red boots.

1173
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,169
The small things like boots...

1174
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,939
really stand out to the person watching.

1175
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,279
That's part of your abilities.

1176
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,119
This time, I have to pull it off well.

1177
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,550
I should study Hwasa as well.

1178
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,558
That's why I prepared this secret weapon.

1179
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,589
The boots.

1180
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,118
(Thigh-high boots)

1181
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,690
I have a brown pair...

1182
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,829
and a leathered pair.

1183
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,999
(She wore practice heels.)

1184
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,199
(1MILLION starts creating the choreography.)

1185
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,799
It should be easy,

1186
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,969
trendy,

1187
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,468
something that you've never seen...

1188
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:25,510
but simple enough to copy.

1189
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,479
(A mental breakdown)

1190
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,408
(How about a floor move?)

1191
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,419
You can't make a challenge with sitting moves.

1192
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,590
But sitting suits Hwasa well.

1193
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,190
(Hwasa has shown various moves using the floor in many songs.)

1194
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,789
The challenge is a critical part,

1195
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,589
so you have to be able to do it anywhere.

1196
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,260
Also, the performance on stage is important.

1197
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,170
We should come up with something in that range.

1198
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,070
I can't think of anything.

1199
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,500
You've done many challenges.

1200
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,738
Ara and I made...

1201
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:00,340
a choreography for "Patbingsu" by Billlie.

1202
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,510
The move was "A cherry with a stalk on top."

1203
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,808
The cherry peace sign...

1204
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,349
was apparently sensational among idol group fans.

1205
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,889
I'm sure that I can make it catchy.

1206
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,118
Hwasa has great hand movements.

1207
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,360
She uses her hands very well.

1208
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:17,630
(They try and come up with some hand movements.)

1209
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:21,829
That's good.

1210
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,859
(Loving it)

1211
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,070
That's a good one.

1212
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:27,038
I hope there are more fun factors.

1213
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:28,670
"Change it, keep changing it."

1214
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,408
How about, "Tastes like chilli?"

1215
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:31,709
(Lia Kim adds to Redy's move.)

1216
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,079
People will be able to copy this one.

1217
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,940
I can't stop thinking about this one.

1218
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:38,178
Or something like this.

1219
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:39,679
(Contemplating)

1220
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,718
(Showing "Chilli" moves)

1221
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:46,718
(Satisfied)

1222
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:48,659
We've only been doing this.

1223
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,029
1MILLION's challenge...

1224
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,359
will be chosen.

1225
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,488
It's a conviction,

1226
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,530
not just confidence.

1227
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:55,199
- Hello. - Hello.

1228
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,669
- Here we go. - Okay.

1229
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,968
- Hello. - Hello.

1230
00:54:57,969 --> 00:54:59,598
- Hi! - Hi.

1231
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,738
(Hwasa came to 1MILLION's rehearsal.)

1232
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:03,038
How are you feeling today?

1233
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:04,139
Great?

1234
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:05,968
You seem more tanned.

1235
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,078
I got a tan!

1236
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,739
(I got a tan.)

1237
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:09,809
For this?

1238
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:10,980
Yes, for this.

1239
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:16,380
I wanted my skin tone to look like that of Hwasa,

1240
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,719
so I'm on my way to a tan shop.

1241
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,519
Practice took longer than expected,

1242
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,159
so I begged the owner...

1243
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,989
to open the door. I'm on my way there,

1244
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,190
so look forward to my tan!

1245
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:29,530
(Turning into Hwarimu)

1246
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,368
I was satisfied.

1247
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,428
I was baby Hwasa.

1248
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,669
(She transformed into Hwarimu.)

1249
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,999
That's love right there.

1250
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,138
(I love you.)

1251
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:39,968
I heard that this was my only chance to see it,

1252
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,380
so I came to support you.

1253
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,179
Show me what you've got.

1254
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,719
(1MILLION shows Hwasa its choreography.)

1255
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,850
If I'm being honest, I saw no one but Harimu.

1256
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:55,388
Her energy was exceptional.

1257
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,759
It seemed that she studied me pretty hard.

1258
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,730
It suited her so well that it was almost cathartic.

1259
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:03,360
I like it.

1260
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,899
(Cheering)

1261
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,268
(Hwarimu is also glad.)

1262
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:13,239
It's 1MILLION.

1263
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,750
It looks like Harimu is...

1264
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,409
taking over.

1265
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,820
You're attracting all the attention.

1266
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
But...

1267
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:25,319
I want the dancers...

1268
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,819
to also dance as explosively as her...

1269
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,590
to almost defeat her.

1270
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,929
I think that'll make your choreo more charming.

1271
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,659
I believe that it can be even more explosive than this.

1272
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,800
I was thankful.

1273
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:42,069
Because we're dancers...

1274
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,670
who dance behind the singers.

1275
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:46,980
They tell the dancers not to look into the camera...

1276
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,280
- and avoid standing out. - Right.

1277
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,279
Maybe that's the case when we dance with the singers,

1278
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,448
- but this is our show. - Right.

1279
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:55,219
Our preview show.

1280
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,349
We all acted like the star in the K-pop Death match Mission.

1281
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,388
Harimu is only playing the role of Hwasa,

1282
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:05,460
and we should consider ourselves the star of the show as we dance.

1283
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,428
I'm going to show people what I can do...

1284
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,805
without getting in the way of the singer.

1285
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:12,630
And we're going to dominate the cameras.

1286
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,868
To emphasize the spicy attribute,

1287
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:18,509
we put red stones on our lips...

1288
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,409
to look like they have cold sores from eating spicy food.

1289
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,150
To emphasize our highlight,

1290
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:27,420
we even painted our nails red.

1291
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,190
I'm going to do my best, determined to burn...

1292
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:31,349
to death.

1293
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,650
Do you know who Harimu is?

1294
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,488
She looks attractive.

1295
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:35,859
I went to their rehearsal,

1296
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,590
and she got a tan in the morning.

1297
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,129
To look more like me.

1298
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,599
She risked her own skin.

1299
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:44,169
And you know that the little efforts show, right?

1300
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,900
She's one of the most passionate dancers.

1301
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,038
(Impressed)

1302
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:50,670
Even her silhouette looks sexy.

1303
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:51,969
No way!

1304
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,408
- 1MILLION. - This is the part...

1305
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:57,178
They're so good at picking outfits that highlight the choreography.

1306
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:59,150
Their experience is not to be neglected.

1307
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,319
This looks luxurious.

1308
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,519
It's visually teasing.

1309
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,119
- She looks like Hwasa from behind. - She does!

1310
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:05,448
It's the same.

1311
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,319
It's their strategy to make her look similar.

1312
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,040
- I can't wait to see it. - Let's watch it!

1313
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,400
I thought that was Hwasa.

1314
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:17,828
She's so similar to Hwasa.

1315
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:19,029
- Totally. - Right.

1316
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,300
I keep seeing Hwasa in her.

1317
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,769
("Chilli" by Hwasa, Choreography by 1MILLION)

1318
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,709
(They put Hwasa's sexy and cool look into simple movements...)

1319
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,510
(and had Harimu play Hwasa's role.)

1320
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,150
Harimu is so good.

1321
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,919
- Her lip sync is flawless. - She's good.

1322
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,219
She's way too good.

1323
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,780
- Yes. - Yes.

1324
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:09,018
- She's hot. - So bold.

1325
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:11,420
It certainly shows with the red lips.

1326
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,760
It's Hwasa's type of dance.

1327
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,419
They might win the extra points for the challenge.

1328
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,420
Right.

1329
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,989
That's pretty.

1330
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,619
Beautiful.

1331
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:49,119
I like the composition.

1332
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,630
They add depth here.

1333
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,828
Indeed.

1334
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:55,559
- Indeed. - I like how she walks around.

1335
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:14,780
Look at that.

1336
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,049
I love that part.

1337
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,118
It's lovely.

1338
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,149
It catches our eyes.

1339
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,489
They controlled the strength well with the composition.

1340
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:23,019
They're doing so well with six members, though.

1341
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,360
Really good.

1342
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,738
(Listen to Hwasa's "Chilli" on all streaming platforms.)

1343
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,839
(Amazed)

1344
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,709
- They did so well. - Nice.

1345
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,780
They're going to win.

1346
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:16,709
- That was... - Excellent.

1347
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,209
Hwasa would want to try that out.

1348
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,649
That's a Korean taste.

1349
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,319
- Yes. - Exactly.

1350
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,989
What I felt when it ended was...

1351
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,449
that Harimu was incredibly good.

1352
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,218
She knew when to look at the camera.

1353
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:30,529
She had good expressions and good dance moves.

1354
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,389
I think she played Hwasa's role the best...

1355
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,099
- among all the teams so far. - I agree.

1356
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:37,929
Hwasa can watch this and copy it exactly.

1357
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,299
- It doesn't need anything else. - Right.

1358
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,439
There's nothing more to add.

1359
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,400
The group move in the second verse was gorgeous and new.

1360
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:46,908
Visually, so clean. Outfits, so clean.

1361
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:49,340
- The hook was nice. - The hook was memorable.

1362
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:52,110
- I loved it. - Yes. They were great.

1363
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,819
They understood the assignment.

1364
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,480
Do you reckon them the best out of the ones you watched?

1365
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:57,789
One hundred percent.

1366
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:01,589
I honestly think they're, for sure, sitting very high.

1367
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,130
They have the best moves in the chorus yet.

1368
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,288
- Right. - True.

1369
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,389
They had the best one.

1370
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,800
No wonder they worked with Hwasa many times before.

1371
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,399
(We're jealous.)

1372
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,428
I approve.

1373
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:12,968
(He also approves.)

1374
01:02:12,969 --> 01:02:14,239
You know what I mean, right?

1375
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
I'm crying.

1376
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
(Touched)

1377
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,840
My eyes are going moist.

1378
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:20,779
- Why am I crying so much today? - Stop crying.

1379
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,339
From the get-go,

1380
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,279
Harimu was 100 percent...

1381
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,750
- in sync with you. - That's true.

1382
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:27,848
I can sense her passion.

1383
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:28,849
(Amazed)

1384
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:31,019
It looked like Harimu took over.

1385
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,518
She pumps it up.

1386
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:35,090
She keeps...

1387
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,328
waving her body,

1388
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:40,360
and it hits home.

1389
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:44,368
I think that's one of 1MILLION's strengths.

1390
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:46,869
When I wish there's such an intense one,

1391
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:48,399
they give me that.

1392
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,198
And the moves are on point.

1393
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,209
I love it.

1394
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,210
I have no comments.

1395
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:53,739
I'm going to write three words.

1396
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:56,379
"They killed it." I already said it. "They killed it."

1397
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,650
(They killed it.)

1398
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,309
Which crew will go next?

1399
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,349
JAM REPUBLIC.

1400
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,448
Her major genre is afro?

1401
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:04,888
Isn't this song a bit afro?

1402
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,149
It is.

1403
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,460
I'm excited about this one.

1404
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:12,189
JAM REPUBLIC's style of dancing is kind of my type.

1405
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,859
So, you had high expectations.

1406
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,230
But in the interim check...

1407
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,829
It sounds like it wasn't good enough for you.

1408
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:21,570
(What happened to JAM REPUBLIC at the interim check?)

1409
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,300
Let's go, JAM REPUBLIC.

1410
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:24,908
(JAM REPUBLIC's interim check of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission)

1411
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:26,809
- I'm so curious. - I can't wait.

1412
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:29,280
- We are JAM REPUBLIC. - JAM REPUBLIC!

1413
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,848
I will be you.

1414
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:33,849
Okay.

1415
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:36,049
I'm curious about JAM REPUBLIC.

1416
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,289
I reckon they'll be good.

1417
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:40,590
(What's JAM REPUBLIC's choreography for Hwasa's new song?)

1418
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:48,530
Oh, no. Her hat came off.

1419
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,530
(Throwing)

1420
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,099
Hey!

1421
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:55,869
Yes!

1422
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,110
(You're so cool, Kirsten.)

1423
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,489
Let's go!

1424
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,829
(Jaw-dropping)

1425
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,199
I love it!

1426
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,309
- Hey! - That's insane.

1427
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:44,018
First,

1428
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:47,389
you're so good. That was amazing.

1429
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:49,389
But...

1430
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,789
the compositions could have been more fun.

1431
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,829
(They got feedback that it was boring.)

1432
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:58,699
Other crews added a bunch of factors,

1433
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:00,929
but they stood in a line and only did the choreo.

1434
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,909
It could have been better. That's all.

1435
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:07,169
(The evening after the interim check)

1436
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,678
(JAM REPUBLIC returned to the room after the check.)

1437
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:10,179
Okay, guys.

1438
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,050
Let's have a discussion and talk about her feedback.

1439
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,279
I think her feedback for us was...

1440
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,788
that the composition was a bit bland.

1441
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:21,359
Maybe we just do some research.

1442
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,518
Do you want to see a dance performance that she did?

1443
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,130
See what her dancing's like?

1444
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,829
(They analyze Hwasa's clips.)

1445
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:30,098
Like, it's all about presence.

1446
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:32,468
Right. It's not too in-your-face.

1447
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:33,499
No.

1448
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,368
- She sells it with her aura... - Right.

1449
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,939
Rather than moving too much.

1450
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,940
Right.

1451
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:41,178
So, I guess, instead of technical moves,

1452
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,649
it's more like, "Sexy in here."

1453
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:45,678
Yes.

1454
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:47,849
It seems like she likes a lot of groundwork.

1455
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,750
(They found out that Hwasa often used floorwork.)

1456
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:56,319
What if the chorus was just groundwork?

1457
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,789
Instead of standing up. Everyone's been standing up.

1458
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:05,599
(The other crews were standing up in the chorus.)

1459
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:08,638
She would slay... Like, do you know those crawls?

1460
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:11,070
- Yes, she would. - And then like a little...

1461
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:15,010
Our key point? We might change the hook, actually,

1462
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,549
to maybe being on the floor.

1463
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,179
Because she looks good when she does floor movements.

1464
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,578
I think now that we've had our discussion together...

1465
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,018
we did a little bit more research,

1466
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:27,920
and we got the feedback from her.

1467
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:31,329
Now, we're going to cater it to her.

1468
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,558
(On the day of filming the choreography)

1469
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:36,329
(JAM REPUBLIC rehearses.)

1470
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,369
Good morning.

1471
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,098
- Oh, my gosh. - Hey!

1472
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:42,268
- Hello. - Hi.

1473
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,139
Are you guys feeling okay?

1474
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,769
We're doing okay.

1475
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,178
I stopped by because I had to watch you rehearse.

1476
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:50,509
Can you show me?

1477
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:51,678
Yes, of course.

1478
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,019
We wanted to show you a variety of the two hooks.

1479
01:06:56,250 --> 01:07:00,119
(They put a lot of work into composing the hooks.)

1480
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,288
We had two versions of the hook.

1481
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:05,489
And we wanted to see which one maybe she liked.

1482
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:09,029
And we wanted to see maybe which one you'd like.

1483
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,969
And we can play around to what suits you.

1484
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:12,400
Nice.

1485
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:18,210
(They show Hwasa their choreography.)

1486
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,440
Hey.

1487
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,509
(They show her different moves for the hooks...)

1488
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,579
(in Verses 1 and 2.)

1489
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,380
(Screaming)

1490
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:31,920
(Automatically smiling)

1491
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,630
(Hwasa is satisfied.)

1492
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,429
JAM...

1493
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:43,860
Do you like it?

1494
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:46,300
(No words are needed.)

1495
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:48,769
This means death.

1496
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,969
She asked me to choose between the first and second one?

1497
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:55,679
I hope they keep both of them, though.

1498
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,078
The first one in the first verse,

1499
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:58,639
and the second one in the second verse.

1500
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:00,610
I liked both of them.

1501
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,619
Great. Okay. Cool.

1502
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,650
How should I put it?

1503
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,460
I have nothing to say. There's no feedback.

1504
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:10,019
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1505
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:11,630
Thank you so much.

1506
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,690
I loved it.

1507
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,858
It was very simple,

1508
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,770
yet I liked how its intensity caught my eye.

1509
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,100
Oh, my gosh. Is this real life?

1510
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,000
That was great.

1511
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:24,909
High-five.

1512
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,409
High-five. That was good.

1513
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,310
I feel like we achieved...

1514
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,948
what we were going for.

1515
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:35,448
We're bringing that international, different flavour...

1516
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:37,988
that maybe the K-pop scene hasn't seen.

1517
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,389
And I would love to work with her...

1518
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:44,090
to evolve that and see what else we can bring to life,

1519
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,630
bringing this new era for Hwasa.

1520
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,429
It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1521
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,759
I'm so curious.

1522
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,500
This ought to be fun.

1523
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:54,129
I wonder how an international crew...

1524
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,398
will portray it in a dance.

1525
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:58,238
But they certainly did great...

1526
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,739
with the "Boom" part.

1527
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:02,209
(JAM REPUBLIC got favourable reviews...)

1528
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,408
(for their choreography that was different from K-pop.)

1529
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:07,309
- That's why I'm more excited. - Right.

1530
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,849
They're master choreographers, so...

1531
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,520
I'm looking forward to it.

1532
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,549
("Chilli" by Hwasa, Choreography by JAM REPUBLIC)

1533
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,688
(Kirsten plays Hwasa to portray the sweet and spicy chilli flavour, )

1534
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,929
(and LaTrice, Ling, Audrey, and Emma are her entourage.)

1535
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,890
No way. Her outfit is gorgeous.

1536
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,329
Sexy.

1537
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:23,089
She's holding a concert out of nowhere!

1538
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,630
She's Kir-yoncé!

1539
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,500
I can't believe I'm seeing that in Korea.

1540
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:56,100
I got chills.

1541
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:07,609
(Impressed)

1542
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,449
They make it so well with simple moves.

1543
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:14,448
- It's extremely bold... - Yes.

1544
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:16,550
To choose to dance to the hook on the floor.

1545
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,920
(In awe)

1546
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:55,319
It looks like an awards ceremony.

1547
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:56,949
(Listen to "Chilli" by Hwasa on all streaming platforms.)

1548
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,789
(That's hot.)

1549
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:05,858
- I can feel the spiciness. - Until the end!

1550
01:12:05,859 --> 01:12:09,559
It's something that I've never seen in Korea.

1551
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,669
That's not Korean chilli.

1552
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,910
- It's so... - It's very spicy.

1553
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,398
That's the proper way to pull off adult sexiness.

1554
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:15,669
That's true.

1555
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:17,709
- They chose the perfect outfit too. - Right.

1556
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,509
Though she was wearing black,

1557
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,209
she reminded me of a rose when she appeared.

1558
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:23,278
A black rose.

1559
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,309
But Kirsten did it really well.

1560
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:28,118
- Yes. - She did it so well.

1561
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:30,679
You can tell that she studied Hwasa a lot, right?

1562
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,688
(Agreeing)

1563
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:33,549
It's completely different from the interim check.

1564
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,658
You're right. It's so different.

1565
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:37,260
The composition is insane.

1566
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:39,759
Their formations are gratifying to watch.

1567
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,959
They completely spread out and gather in a second.

1568
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,929
The compositions and formations...

1569
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,099
are fresh, which we wouldn't have thought of.

1570
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,898
That's what surprises me.

1571
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:50,269
I'd like to watch it again.

1572
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:52,840
- Yes, it was that good. - Right?

1573
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:54,310
Now, that's world class.

1574
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,750
Nice.

1575
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:05,619
(The songwriter is pleased.)

1576
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:06,619
Isn't it insane?

1577
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,659
Gosh, what should I do?

1578
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:12,889
Isn't this fun?

1579
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:15,728
The dancers have so much swag.

1580
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:16,729
You're right.

1581
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,599
Each and every move...

1582
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,669
isn't embellished that much,

1583
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:22,198
but it's the epitome of its kind.

1584
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:24,509
The part about walking down a road you can't see,

1585
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,769
they must've translated the lyrics to come up with that part,

1586
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:27,979
since her eyes were covered.

1587
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,839
Those large elements were good,

1588
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,750
- Right. - but the small moves were good too.

1589
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,179
It had impact,

1590
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,149
and it makes you feel catharsis.

1591
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:37,319
- It was so good. - Yes.

1592
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:38,850
I want to keep this video.

1593
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:43,319
But if I were to pick one thing I thought could be better,

1594
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,600
it's that this is not ideal for a challenge mission.

1595
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:48,528
It might be hard to do the moves depending on your environment.

1596
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:50,658
- For example, on asphalt... - That's true.

1597
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,698
It would be painful.

1598
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:53,629
You'd need knee pads.

1599
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,769
That's why I think it might be harder to copy,

1600
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,269
but as a performance, it's really impressive.

1601
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,270
I really want to do this.

01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,009
(If we're going to be totally objective about it, )

1605
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,478
(I don't think this one is meant to be copied.)

1606
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,119
(Hwasa can't decide easily.)

1607
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,349
(However, )

1608
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,489
(if I were to perform, I'd want to do this one.)

1609
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:18,629
(What is Hwasa's final decision?)

1610
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:22,299
(Which crew was chosen by Hwasa?)

1611
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,358
We've already seen them all.

1612
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,529
- We saw all of them. - Yes.

1613
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,169
Who are you picking? Tell me secretly.

1614
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,600
No, I...

1615
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:30,140
(Giggling)

1616
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:32,408
I really like this one.

1617
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:34,339
My heart says this one, but my head says that one.

1618
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:35,379
(My heart says this one, but my head says that one.)

1619
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,108
When I reflect on everything you and I discussed,

1620
01:14:38,109 --> 01:14:40,278
it's between 1MILLION and JAM REPUBLIC.

1621
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:41,479
- Right? - Yes.

1622
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:44,219
The one by 1MILLION...

1623
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,819
does bring things together better.

1624
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,420
But JAM REPUBLIC's energy is such a waste to let go of.

1625
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,090
If I were to perform, I'd want to do JAM REPUBLIC's.

1626
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:54,799
If you take various factors together,

1627
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,799
the one by 1MILLION is the best fit.

1628
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,868
You're right.

1629
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,238
We're stuck at this point and have to really think.

1630
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:02,669
(Why is this twice as hard?)

1631
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:03,738
Have an AI pick one.

1632
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:04,769
(Her final decision is to leave it to fate.)

1633
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,939
I can't choose.

1634
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:09,579
(The two are lost in thought with their decision before them.)

1635
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,750
Do I have to decide now?

1636
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,108
I'll keep this crew in my heart.

1637
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,180
Seriously.

1638
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,850
(Which crew did Hwasa choose?)

1639
01:15:18,989 --> 01:15:22,159
(Which crew will open the door to greet Hwasa?)

1640
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,390
(The moment Hwasa's choice is revealed)

1641
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:27,960
(Who will it be?)

1642
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,368
- Really? - We won?

1643
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:34,529
- Hello. - Hello.

1644
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:37,068
It is a challenge mission, so...

1645
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:39,068
If you think about the challenge, the chorus moves are good.

1646
01:15:39,069 --> 01:15:41,880
This part is good, and so is this, and so is this one.

1647
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,779
This is good too.

1648
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:47,849
What's fun about 1MILLION...

1649
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:49,819
is that if you practice the moves hard enough,

1650
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,419
you can express the mood of the dance they've moved.

1651
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:54,389
That's why it's fun to copy their dances.

1652
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,089
I think it would be great for a dance challenge.

1653
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,090
Even if you do this part once,

1654
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:59,188
you would recognize it as the "Chilli" dance.

1655
01:15:59,189 --> 01:16:01,028
If I were to be totally objective,

1656
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:03,300
- this one is hard to copy. - That's true.

1657
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,469
I don't have good wrists.

1658
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,539
I even have inflammation in my wrist joints.

1659
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:13,470
This was our decision.

1660
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:15,409
(Screaming)

1661
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:17,279
(Screaming)

1662
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:19,779
- What? - It says 1MILLION!

1663
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,079
We won the mission for our choreography!

1664
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:24,379
- We really won. - We did it!

1665
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,188
- We did it! - We won!

1666
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:27,988
(1MILLION can't hide how happy they are.)

1667
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:29,118
My goodness!

1668
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:30,358
Let's gather round and spin!

1669
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:31,929
(This is a great occasion.)

1670
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:35,060
I think I'm the happiest today.

1671
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:39,828
That's because I've choreographed many of Hwasa's songs before.

1672
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:42,299
I thought it would be embarrassing to lose this,

1673
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,639
and at the same time,

1674
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,368
I didn't want to disappoint Hwasa.

1675
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:47,908
I'm so happy,

1676
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:50,409
and grateful we were chosen.

1677
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:54,209
Two days from now, on "M Countdown..."

1678
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,249
- What? - Oh, my gosh, what?

1679
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,619
- you'll perform "Chilli." - What?

1680
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,449
On "M Countdown?"

1681
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,788
What does that mean?

1682
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:00,919
Does it mean Harimu's debuting?

1683
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,788
Thank you.

1684
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,288
Harimu's debuting!

1685
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:07,259
I love this. "M Countdown."

1686
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,398
It's not like I haven't stood on that stage.

1687
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:12,999
I've performed there many times as a dancer.

1688
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,368
But to be able to stand there as the star performer...

1689
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:18,669
is something we never imagined before now.

1690
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,038
(Preview filming day at "M Countdown")

1691
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,209
So this is "M Countdown."

1692
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:25,279
("M Countdown" 1MILLION)

1693
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:26,679
Guys,

1694
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,978
since you all worked so hard,

1695
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:30,919
- I prepared a present for you. - Gosh.

1696
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,319
You can each choose the colour you want.

1697
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,459
- When you brush your hair, - Yes?

1698
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,188
The brush goes straight down.

1699
01:17:38,189 --> 01:17:40,528
It never gets caught, not even once.

1700
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:42,099
I've never seen anything like this before.

1701
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,099
Your hair's so flowy now that you've brushed it.

1702
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,898
It feels great,

1703
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:47,269
and my hair is so flowy.

1704
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,339
Shake it for us.

1705
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,799
- My gosh. - Gosh.

1706
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,270
(Flowing hair)

1707
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,310
Gosh, it's really smooth.

1708
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,908
Do you like my present?

1709
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:56,709
Thanks to you, I can calm down now.

1710
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,179
(Time to revise their makeup)

1711
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,309
- Red lips are our trademark. - Right.

1712
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:01,478
Let's put some on.

1713
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:03,818
I love this colour.

1714
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:05,389
It's a colour Redy would love.

1715
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:09,059
I love how smoothly it goes on.

1716
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,889
And you know what's amazing?

1717
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,288
I put mine on a while ago,

1718
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:14,028
but it lasts forever. It still looks good, right?

1719
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:15,630
It's so perfect.

1720
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,170
Let's go, Lia Kim!

1721
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:20,569
- Let's go. - Yes.

1722
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,038
We have to do really well.

1723
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:23,599
We really have to tear it up.

1724
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,469
I wanted to show everything we had.

1725
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,469
Hello.

1726
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,038
We're the rookie singers, 1MILLION.

1727
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:30,339
- Are you really singers? - Are you really singers?

1728
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,449
We're rookie dancers.

1729
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,049
(Rehearsal for 1MILLION)

1730
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:35,720
(They put on the right faces, even for rehearsal.)

1731
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:37,519
I think we're good at marking.

1732
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,889
We're looking so good on screen.

1733
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,719
We'll start recording now.

1734
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,488
Let's go. Finally, my hot début.

1735
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:43,590
Stand by.

1736
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:47,989
(Watch "M Countdown" when it airs on October 12, 2023.)

1737
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,759
We're going to film the scene where we put on makeup first.

1738
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,769
First, let's all stand in formation.

1739
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,599
Please confirm your position.

1740
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,499
- I think that would be good. - Can you tell me where I am?

1741
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,778
Please check your diagonals and this carefully as you go.

1742
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,938
We'll make the formation like this and see how it goes.

1743
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,726
(Rehearsal goes under the direction of Lia Kim.)

1744
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,750
(In sync)

1745
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,118
That was good.

1746
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,519
We're five minutes out.

1747
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,720
- All right. - All right.

1748
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:12,889
(Saving their pretty moments in a photo)

1749
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:15,858
(Snapping)

1750
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:17,658
(We're just too pretty today.)

1751
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:21,188
(Mixed crews are also forming on occasion.)

1752
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,228
Okay.

1753
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:23,760
We're looking nice.

1754
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:25,328
I'm thankful to be here today.

1755
01:19:25,329 --> 01:19:26,999
Like this one. Really?

1756
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,639
- It's a cat heart. - Oh, a cat heart.

1757
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,669
(This is a cat heart.)

1758
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:31,739
It's cute.

1759
01:19:32,109 --> 01:19:34,009
- That's a new one. - A cat heart.

1760
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,109
In 3, 2, 1.

1761
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,639
(Finishing up perfectly with a biting heart)

1762
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,108
We'll show you heart lips.

1763
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:40,149
In 1, 2, 3.

1764
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,578
In 1, 2, 3.

1765
01:19:42,579 --> 01:19:44,478
(Harimu and Capri are comedy types.)

1766
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,788
How do you feel working together after competing all this time?

1767
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:50,059
I don't think you've had many performances together.

1768
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,788
Actually, we're still competing against one another.

1769
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:52,789
- We're still competing. - We're still going strong.

1770
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,389
She's trying to stand out.

1771
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,459
- Show us a pose. - Let's see.

1772
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,060
Look at this outfit. It stands out the most.

1773
01:19:58,699 --> 01:20:00,728
- Look. - She said she'd wear something...

1774
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,068
that doesn't stand out, but she stands out the most.

1775
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:04,568
This is so much fun and very meaningful.

1776
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:06,509
Working with an artist...

1777
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,278
makes everything feel so new.

1778
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:10,978
- A rare chance to dance with Hwasa. - That's true.

1779
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:13,549
Why aren't the sexy dances over?

1780
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:14,578
Sexy dances.

1781
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:15,618
(When will they be over?)

1782
01:20:15,619 --> 01:20:17,219
We're talking about sexy dances while wearing this.

1783
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,889
Why are we in these outfits?

1784
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:21,090
She's hot even after stripping down to that.

1785
01:20:21,489 --> 01:20:23,589
We're so contrary. Now we're dying of heat.

1786
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,288
- Seriously. - Now I feel bad.

1787
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:27,629
Just take it off sexily.

1788
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,630
Please zip that back up.

1789
01:20:28,631 --> 01:20:30,959
(Haechi on the right and Mini on the left keep Halo in check.)

1790
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,400
(Hwasa, the star of "Chilli," arrives at the music video set.)

1791
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:35,568
(Good to see you.)

1792
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:37,769
Thank you for picking our choreography.

1793
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,810
I loved it, that's why.

1794
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:41,538
We practiced a bit together,

1795
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:44,078
and I think she could be on the next season...

1796
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:46,679
- of Street Woman Fighter. - No, that's not true.

1797
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,419
Your outfit looks good too.

1798
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,520
Should we try some moves as a warmup?

1799
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,049
Shall we give it a go?

1800
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,688
Spray, spray again, then move, hands, look up.

1801
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:56,459
- Move, hands, look up. - Okay.

1802
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,559
- Let's try a take. - All right.

1803
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,429
(Hwasa, the singer of "Chilli," enters the set.)

1804
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:05,698
- Welcome. - Looking great!

1805
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,169
- You look pretty. - You look so pretty.

1806
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,538
(Hwasa and SWF2's music video filming begins.)

1807
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:11,639
(Energy to the Max)

1808
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,709
(JAM REPUBLIC's Audrey was unable to participate...)

1809
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,139
(due to health reasons.)

1810
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,709
(They keep the energy up until the last shoot!)

1811
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,648
(The Hwasa and SWF2 music video will now be revealed.)

1812
01:21:18,649 --> 01:21:20,180
- Thank you. - Great job.

1813
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:24,649
(Hwasa's new song "Chilli," MV directed by 1MILLION)

1814
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,319
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

1815
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,488
From the No Respect Battle where you chose the weakest dancers,

1816
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:47,929
to the New Song Preview Mission,

1817
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:50,658
all the dancers here have worked hard...

1818
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,819
to endure your journey through Street Woman Fighter 2.

1819
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,898
Thank you.

1820
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:55,999
You all worked hard.

1821
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,299
There's only one more obstacle in your way...

1822
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,510
before you head to the finals.

1823
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,356
- It's the last one? - Its' finally the last one.

1824
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,539
It's kind of scary.

1825
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:07,278
Only four crews who prove...

1826
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:09,219
their crews' value and worth to the very end...

1827
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:12,750
will be candidates to win and perform on the final stage.

1828
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:14,539
- So two crews will be eliminated. - Right.

1829
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:15,819
The next mission is...

1830
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,919
I couldn't predict at all...

1831
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,960
what kind of mission it would be.

1832
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,875
I don't think it'll be a mixed gender one again.

1833
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:23,100
The next mission is...

1834
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:25,500
(What will it be?)

1835
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:28,738
the Battle Performance Mission.

1836
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:30,100
Battle Performance?

1837
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,580
It's a battle but a performance?

1838
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:32,770
- Wait. - What?

1839
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:34,269
- Wait. - What did he say?

1840
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,180
- A battle? - We've done so many already.

1841
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,079
BEBE's expressions are no joke.

1842
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,510
They don't look happy.

1843
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:42,179
(Sighing)

1844
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,519
We don't have battle experience,

1845
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
so we were a little nervous.

1846
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:47,319
The Battle Performance Mission...

1847
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:50,619
will pit crews against one another in a group mission.

1848
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,529
All six crews will decide on the crew they will face.

1849
01:24:54,659 --> 01:24:58,260
They will have a performance battle targeting their opponent crew.

1850
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,938
Each battle between 2 crews will have 3 parts.

1851
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:05,469
In Part A, you can choose your song and participating members freely.

1852
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:08,408
Show us a performance that's under a minute.

1853
01:25:08,409 --> 01:25:10,078
- We can pick anyone we want? - Yes.

1854
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,309
In Part B, you'll have one-on-one individual battles,

1855
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:15,719
where each representative battler will dance to a random song...

1856
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:19,219
for 30 seconds, freestyle.

1857
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,318
Isn't 30 seconds too short?

1858
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,288
For 30 seconds you have to go step dash step bang clank and end.

1859
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:26,359
The last part, Part C, will be a performance of the crew song.

1860
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:29,599
Choose a minute that you believe is the highlight of your crew song,

1861
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,469
and perform it as a group.

1862
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:33,529
Crew song?

1863
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,299
(Each crew song was made with 100 percent participation by crews.)

1864
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,938
(The crews told the songwriters what they wanted in their songs.)

1865
01:25:39,939 --> 01:25:43,509
(They discussed the structure and every detail of the songs.)

1866
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,809
(Make the other crew songs light, )

1867
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:46,250
(and make ours weighty.)

1868
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,778
(The crew songs were created...)

1869
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:50,549
(with tons of feedback and many revisions.)

1870
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:53,389
(The Street Woman Fighter 2 crew songs were thus completed.)

1871
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:54,549
We're doing our crew songs?

1872
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,389
("Naked Gold" is 1MILLION"s crew song.)

1873
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,488
So we have to do that song?

1874
01:25:57,489 --> 01:26:00,590
I was really surprised about this mission.

1875
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:03,198
I'd completely forgotten about the crew performance.

1876
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,269
This is so complicated.

1877
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,929
This won't be an easy mission.

1878
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,938
Our crew song is great,

1879
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:12,868
so if we dance with confidence, I think we can win.

1880
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:16,179
But our crew song is a bit slow.

1881
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,810
What should we do about that?

1882
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,778
We had a lot of strong beats.

1883
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:22,649
We have to use the strongest part, obviously.

1884
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,949
This is such a headache.

1885
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:28,118
From Parts A to C, the music will not end,

1886
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:30,959
and we'll continue the battle.

1887
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,188
- So it's going back and forth. - We'll continue.

1888
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:33,688
They're just doing continuous elimination battles.

1889
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,859
So that's why this is a Battle Performance Mission.

1890
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,100
This is totally new.

1891
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,669
In the Battle Performance Mission,

1892
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,310
spectators will be joining us once again.

1893
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:45,068
(We love having an audience.)

1894
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:48,038
In season two of Street Woman Fighter,

1895
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:51,139
our battle performances are viewed by our many supporters.

1896
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,778
That's why we predict the scene of our Battle Performance Mission...

1897
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:55,648
will be even more fired up and competitive.

1898
01:26:55,649 --> 01:26:57,818
This is how the Battle Performance Mission will be scored.

1899
01:26:57,819 --> 01:27:00,788
Fight judge scores and scores from audience members...

1900
01:27:00,789 --> 01:27:03,818
will be combined to create your final score.

1901
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:08,089
Fight judges can give up to 30, and spectators up to 70 points...

1902
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,630
for a total of 100 points.

1903
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:11,259
(What?)

1904
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,500
Gosh, the spectators.

1905
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,005
The audience will be very important.

1906
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:16,139
Through a global public evaluation,

1907
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,368
each crew can score up to another 500 points,

1908
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:20,010
for a total point score our of 600.

1909
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,738
But that's not all.

1910
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:24,309
The scores for the previous mission, the New Song Preview Mission,

1911
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,309
have now been calculated.

1912
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:31,118
Your final score will be determined by your score from that mission,

1913
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:33,089
combined with the score from the Battle Performance Mission.

1914
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:36,158
This mission will determine who survives and who is eliminated.

1915
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,559
The most important thing will be to see who is fighting whom.

1916
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,130
The way we'll decide which crews face off...

1917
01:27:41,859 --> 01:27:47,099
is through the interim results of the online public evaluation...

1918
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,600
of the crew song performances.

1919
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:50,769
(Shocked)

1920
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:51,938
They're using the interim results to decide?

1921
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:53,809
I had forgotten all about that.

1922
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:59,909
A global public evaluation for the crew songs...

1923
01:27:59,979 --> 01:28:04,278
has been ongoing since August 22. The vote is open until midnight...

1924
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,520
on September 22. We will reveal the interim results now,

1925
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,219
and the top-ranking crews will get to choose...

1926
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:12,390
which crews they want to face.

1927
01:28:12,689 --> 01:28:14,289
We won't be able to pick then.

1928
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:16,159
- Who scored high for that? - Is it 1MILLION?

1929
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:17,659
I bet JAM REPUBLIC is first.

1930
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:19,028
I think it'll be BEBE.

1931
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:20,169
- BEBE, right? - Yes.

1932
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:23,198
Now we will reveal the interim results...

1933
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:26,340
of the global public evaluation of your crew song performances.

1934
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:29,438
The crew song performance interim results show...

1935
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:30,509
that in first place...

1936
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,839
- Who could it be? - I wonder who it is.

1937
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,310
Please.

1938
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,220
It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1939
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:41,019
(JAM REPUBLIC is in 1st place for their crew song performance.)

1940
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:43,060
- So it was JAM REPUBLIC. - It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1941
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:44,189
- Global. - Okay.

1942
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:46,489
Drawing room. What do you want to do?

1943
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:49,960
The very first crew that came into my head was 1MILLION.

1944
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,629
I was thinking that too.

1945
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,429
In terms of the freestyle situation,

1946
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:54,999
I think hitting them would be easy.

1947
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,139
Yes, exactly, that's why.

1948
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:59,068
I thought we'd go for Wolf'Lo.

1949
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:00,408
- What? - Yes.

1950
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:03,509
No, I think they're creative. They can create.

1951
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,938
- I didn't see that. - They can.

1952
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,486
- And they're battlers. - They have a vibe.

1953
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,879
(The number 1 foe to beat in battles.)

1954
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,350
I want to go out there and go chop, smack.

1955
01:29:10,449 --> 01:29:13,319
- Or there's MANNEQUEEN. - And LADYBOUNCE.

1956
01:29:13,689 --> 01:29:15,420
- We don't want MANNEQUEEN. - YES.

1957
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:16,809
What if we're up against Wolf'Lo?

1958
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,960
We're each getting telepathic.

1959
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,390
- Bluetooth. - Bluetooth...

1960
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,476
I think JAM REPUBLIC will choose us.

1961
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,299
I think JAM REPUBLIC will choose BEBE.

1962
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,829
- Please don't pick us. - Please don't.

1963
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,239
So is that a smart decision?

1964
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,438
- I think it is. - Is it smart?

1965
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:32,640
I think it is smart.

1966
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,970
Who will they go up against?

1967
01:29:34,109 --> 01:29:36,179
(JAM REPUBLIC has decided which crew they will face.)

1968
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,108
(Which crew did JAM REPUBLIC pick?)

1969
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:39,879
The Battle Performance Mission...

1970
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,049
is a face-off between two crews.

1971
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:44,278
Only one crew...

1972
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,788
can emerge victorious.

1973
01:29:45,789 --> 01:29:48,488
The other crew will lose and be up for elimination.

1974
01:29:48,489 --> 01:29:51,390
JAM REPUBLIC, which crew will you send to be eliminated?

1975
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:57,059
The crew that we have decided to go up against is...

1976
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,529
(Are they over there?)

1977
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,398
- It must be us. - It must be us.

1978
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:02,146
Let's keep our faces blank, since this is so scary.

1979
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:04,198
(Which crew did JAM REPUBLIC pick?)

1980
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:05,238
(The crew JAM REPUBLIC will face up against is...)

1981
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:07,770
LADYBOUNCE.

1982
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,739
(So it's us.)

1983
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:11,879
(Speechless)

1984
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,209
(Also speechless)

1985
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:14,450
I wasn't even thinking of that.

1986
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:15,850
That's new.

1987
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:17,520
- Is that right? - It's right.

1988
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,849
- Picking a very popular... - Yes.

1989
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,760
- Korean crew is stupid. - Yes, that is stupid.

1990
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:25,658
We don't want a very popular crew.

1991
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:27,728
- We have to go the freestyle route. - Yes, okay.

1992
01:30:27,729 --> 01:30:30,800
- So everyone wants LADYBOUNCE? - Yes.

1993
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,368
I think we'll bring something different.

1994
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:36,599
- Even 1-on-1, we can take them out. - Yes.

1995
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,810
Also, it's nice that it's 5 versus 5.

1996
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,738
It was a touch decision.

1997
01:30:41,739 --> 01:30:44,438
LADYBOUNCE, let's have some fun.

1998
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,578
(Glaring)

1999
01:30:45,579 --> 01:30:47,380
Dan Dan Dan

2000
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:48,818
(Fine, let's do this!)

2001
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:49,849
(Giggling)

2002
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:52,988
Until now, JAM REPUBLIC...

2003
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,648
has always chosen strong opponents.

2004
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,719
I think that's why they picked us this time,

2005
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,760
and I hope to have fun.

2006
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:00,959
I thought they would pick us.

2007
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,600
They're very strategic.

2008
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:05,669
They chose us because they know there's a global public evaluation.

2009
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,169
That's a motivating factor for us,

2010
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,199
so I think we'll work even harder to prepare.

2011
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:11,398
(Battle Performance Matchup JAM REPUBLIC versus LADYBOUNCE)

2012
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:16,310
The next crew up, who got 2nd place for their crew song performance...

2013
01:31:16,409 --> 01:31:18,009
It's either 1MILLION or BEBE.

2014
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:20,880
(Nervous)

2015
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:22,349
It's BEBE.

2016
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:24,419
(BEBE is in 2nd place for their crew song performance.)

2017
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,820
(They had 1,503,204 views 134,161 likes, and 248,479 votes.)

2018
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:28,618
(A little regretful)

2019
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:32,329
Which crew will BEBE send to elimination?

2020
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:34,929
- It must be us. - Don't look at us.

2021
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:37,559
- The crew BEBE chose is... - Yes?

2022
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,658
Is it MANNEQUEEN?

2023
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:39,699
Stop that.

2024
01:31:39,829 --> 01:31:41,599
(Which crew did BEBE choose?)

2025
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,739
It's Wolf'Lo.

2026
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:44,069
It's Wolf'Lo.

2027
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:45,198
(What did they say?)

2028
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,239
It's Wolf'Lo.

2029
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,238
It's cool versus cool.

2030
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,339
It's us?

2031
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,409
(Excited)

2032
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,050
I do want to go against Wolf'Lo sometime.

2033
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:57,449
We're better at choreography,

2034
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,550
so we just have to do well in the 1-on-1 Battle.

2035
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:03,619
- We can win easily then. - I see what you mean.

2036
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,960
Halo, from Wolf'Lo.

2037
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:08,959
During the Class Mission, I said I wouldn't do anything not cool.

2038
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,129
If we don't look cool, I'll be disappointed,

2039
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:13,600
so I want to create a good performance for this.

2040
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:18,368
We also won't do anything that doesn't look cool,

2041
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:20,470
so we will prepare hard as well.

2042
01:32:20,739 --> 01:32:22,310
(Good luck!)

2043
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:24,710
(Battle Performance Matchup BEBE versus Wolf'Lo)

2044
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,578
Now we have 1MILLION and MANNEQUEEN...

2045
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:30,579
facing off against each other automatically.

2046
01:32:30,649 --> 01:32:33,026
We're facing each other again, just like in the Mega Crew Mission.

2047
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:37,020
(During the Mega Crew Mission, both crews had a "structure" theme.)

2048
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,305
I think we should be pushing a structure into the arena now.

2049
01:32:39,329 --> 01:32:40,390
The structures battle.

2050
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:42,259
This matchup is also...

2051
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,799
- fierce. - It's fierce.

2052
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,898
These days, for every mission,

2053
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:48,198
you've showed such an awesome side of you,

2054
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:52,238
and you're winning first place so perfectly.

2055
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:55,169
That makes us think, we'll beat the perfect one,

2056
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:57,538
and take first place ourselves.

2057
01:32:57,539 --> 01:32:58,738
(A battle of wills)

2058
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,249
MANNEQUEEN is known...

2059
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:03,179
for their powerful performances.

2060
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:05,988
We've developed muscles from moving those structures around.

2061
01:33:05,989 --> 01:33:07,749
And you're not MANNEQUEEN.

2062
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,419
I'm Lia the Queen.

2063
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:15,828
I'm going to show you who is the queen.

2064
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:16,930
(What?)

2065
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,829
(A memory from the past flashes by.)

2066
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:21,269
(Lia Kim does a perfect impression.)

2067
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,170
(The originator is happy with that.)

2068
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:25,068
(Our leader is slightly embarrassed.)

2069
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:27,170
- I'm going to show you. - Who is the queen.

2070
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:28,639
She's actually Lia Queen.

2071
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,809
(Satisfied)

2072
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:30,810
That's great.

2073
01:33:30,811 --> 01:33:32,986
(Lia Kim looks lively after creating a memorable phrase.)

2074
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:35,125
(Battle Performance Matchup 1MILLION versus MANNEQUEEN)

2075
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:36,578
(The 6 crews leave the fight zone and return to their hideouts.)

2076
01:33:36,579 --> 01:33:39,089
- This mission is really new. - It's really different.

2077
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,749
Because it's not a mission that was there before.

2078
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,658
I think it will be a bit different...

2079
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:45,259
from the battles we've fought on the battle scene.

2080
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,759
- Because there's a performance. - The performance.

2081
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,328
You have to be good at both battles and performances.

2082
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:51,528
That's the only way to win this mission.

2083
01:33:51,529 --> 01:33:53,599
It's not about who wins Part B and Part C.

2084
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,328
That's not how it works.

2085
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:57,068
Right, it's overall.

2086
01:33:57,069 --> 01:33:58,898
- We're ready. - We're going to be ready.

2087
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:01,069
We're ready. We're going to explode.

2088
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,078
But JAM REPUBLIC will bring a lot of energy to the stage.

2089
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:05,209
They won't be as fun as us.

2090
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:06,349
(Giggling)

2091
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:09,049
JAM REPUBLIC seems like they're absorbed in themselves,

2092
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,380
and it's like they get energy from being self-absorbed.

2093
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,618
That's hilarious.

2094
01:34:12,619 --> 01:34:15,589
We're going up against BEBE.

2095
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:18,089
Strategy is most important here.

2096
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:19,859
We'll use crazy props.

2097
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:21,559
She's shuddering.

2098
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,658
We've used them three times already.

2099
01:34:22,659 --> 01:34:24,358
I'm sure they're out of ideas.

2100
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:26,599
They also lost the Group Battle.

2101
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,698
People do love when we use props.

2102
01:34:28,699 --> 01:34:29,769
- They like it? - They love it.

2103
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,769
- Because we use them well. - Let's go for it.

2104
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:33,368
The song is random for the 1-on-1 Battle, right?

2105
01:34:33,369 --> 01:34:35,568
Who's good on the spot on the 1MILLiON crew?

2106
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:37,778
We already beat MANNEQUEEN once,

2107
01:34:37,779 --> 01:34:39,549
and in terms of strategy...

2108
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,349
and judgement,

2109
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:43,318
I believe we're much superior.

2110
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:45,549
- I think Part C will be important. - Yes.

2111
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:47,949
Do we need to do the crew song performance by tomorrow?

2112
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,818
Here. There's an announcement.

2113
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:52,659
What is it?

2114
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,129
- Okay. - It's about the C section.

2115
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:55,689
It's definitely going to be bad.

2116
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,960
(The 6 crews see what the announcement is.)

2117
01:34:58,029 --> 01:34:59,398
(Throwing a fit)

2118
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:01,930
(Screaming)

2119
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:04,568
- What is it? - What is it?

2120
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:06,639
We have to get first place.

2121
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,009
What is it?

2122
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:09,809
If we do this, we'll lose.

2123
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:10,908
- Why? - We will 100 percent lose.

2124
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:13,979
(What did the announcement to the 6 crews say?)

2125
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:17,648
(Everyone is appalled.)

2126
01:35:17,649 --> 01:35:19,118
- Are they insane? - What is it?

2127
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,318
Do we have to perform together?

2128
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:22,789
We don't have to listen to "Crimson" anymore.

2129
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:25,220
What is that?

2130
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:28,129
For Part C, we won't be using our own crew song,

2131
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,199
- but 1MILLION's crew song. - No.

2132
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:32,699
(They need to outdo the existing crew song performance.)

2133
01:35:32,729 --> 01:35:33,999
(MANNEQUEEN is taken aback by the unexpected rule.)

2134
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,068
- This can't be. - This is terrible.

2135
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:36,538
(The Opposing Crew Change Rule)

2136
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:38,839
(For Part C, crews must use their opponent's crew songs.)

2137
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,969
We'll lose, 100 percent, with this.

2138
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:42,069
The crew song for 1MILLION is so loose.

2139
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:45,709
(The 1MILLION crew song has a slow BPM in contrast.)

2140
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:47,750
Why do we have to go through so much?

2141
01:35:47,979 --> 01:35:49,779
So 1MILLION has to perform with our song?

2142
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:52,279
("EZ" has a fast BPM that shows off technique.)

2143
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,520
Ours is great.

2144
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:56,249
I'm sure they're celebrating right now.

2145
01:35:56,489 --> 01:35:59,090
(They are celebrating.)

2146
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,528
If MANNEQUEEN does our song, "Naked Gold..."

2147
01:36:02,529 --> 01:36:04,500
It'll be hard for them.

2148
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,169
We didn't make this thinking it would be used in a battle.

2149
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:09,840
Did we get lucky?

2150
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:12,069
(Another crew is celebrating like 1MILLION.)

2151
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,710
She's got the feeling now.

2152
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:16,909
("Crimson" can bring slow, weighty hip-hop to life.)

2153
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,379
I love this though.

2154
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,379
Wolf'Lo's crew song is so strong,

2155
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:24,778
I thought our Part C would be overwhelmed by them.

2156
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,389
The song itself is overpowering.

2157
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:28,519
But on the other hand,

2158
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,920
think about Wolf'Lo doing "CHEMISTRY."

2159
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:34,729
("CHEMISTRY" highlights a classy, sophisticated vibe.)

2160
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,060
(What happens when you put "CHEMISTRY" on hip Wolf'Lo?)

2161
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:42,129
Do we have to dance sexy again?

2162
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:45,099
Is this a show to make me grow?

2163
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,509
It looks like I have to dance sexy for the third time.

2164
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:50,680
Don't be ridiculous. You've never been sexy.

2165
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:52,856
I'm sure whoever's watching will find it entertaining.

2166
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,978
(JAM REPUBLIC watches the crew song, "Baby Back Home.")

2167
01:36:54,979 --> 01:36:56,819
I like it. It's actually a really catchy song.

2168
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:58,148
Yes, I like it.

2169
01:36:58,149 --> 01:37:00,948
I think this is going to work in our favour...

2170
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:02,560
because our song is actually slow.

2171
01:37:02,819 --> 01:37:06,789
("CRAZY OUT THERE" has a slightly slower tempo.)

2172
01:37:08,029 --> 01:37:11,698
Yes, we can show a lot more energy and power.

2173
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:15,369
- Now we're going to slay, Mama. - Slay, Mama.

2174
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:18,169
(LADYBOUNCE is worried about facing JAM REPUBLIC.)

2175
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,269
(Giggling)

2176
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:22,169
JAM REPUBLIC will do their best to show off their abilities,

2177
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,679
so we need to make sure we're better than them.

2178
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,709
Let's be better.

2179
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,078
Our performance is going to be really sincere.

2180
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:28,679
We'll pour all our sincere desires to win into it,

2181
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:31,618
and we'll show them exactly what kind of energy we have.

2182
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:33,449
- Then we can win. - Yes, we can win.

2183
01:37:34,619 --> 01:37:36,835
(LADYBOUNCE sheds tears on the day of their performance.)

2184
01:37:36,859 --> 01:37:39,118
(What happened to LADYBOUNCE?)

2185
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,059
MNET"s Street Woman Fighter 2...

2186
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,488
will now start the voting...

2187
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,729
for the 6 crews' Battle Performance Mission.

2188
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:46,969
This is their last hurdle before heading to the finals.

2189
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,939
Please vote for the crew that showed the best Battle Performance.

2190
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,408
You can vote on the official sites for Street Woman Fighter 2,

2191
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,169
as well as on MNET Plus.

2192
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:57,078
Voting will end...

2193
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:59,350
at 12:00 midnight on Friday, October 13.

2194
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:02,949
Please vote for the Battle Performance Mission now.

2195
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:08,148

(The last performance before the final)

2223
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,249
(6 crews have a match of the Battle Performance Mission.)

2224
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:27,350
(They have a battle by performing one after another.)

2225
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:31,188
(The day of the interim check of the Battle Performance Mission)

2226
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:32,259
(Watching BEBE's video for the interim check)

2227
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,028
They catch your eye. They make you focus.

2228
01:51:34,029 --> 01:51:35,159
BEBE showed their own style.

2229
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:37,560
They did really well.

2230
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:40,270
(BEBE and MANNEQUEEN received good reviews during the check.)

2231
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:43,129
It's something we are used to, so we have confidence.

2232
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,640
(I am excited about this one.)

2233
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:45,770
LADYBOUNCE first.

2234
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,509
(What?)

2235
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:49,669
Their performances are always similar.

2236
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:51,039
The performance was very lacking.

2237
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:54,649
They will need to make many changes.

2238
01:51:54,779 --> 01:51:56,709
(LADYBOUNCE received other crews' reviews.)

2239
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,148
"They could have used the space better."

2240
01:51:58,149 --> 01:51:59,949
"They didn't understand the music very well."

2241
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:02,459
I am shocked that they think our dance doesn't suit the music.

2242
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:05,159
I didn't expect this.

2243
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,960
Receiving bad reviews by fellow dancers is...

2244
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,760
a bit upsetting.

2245
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,538
(Biggy bursts out in tears.)

2246
01:52:17,539 --> 01:52:19,899
(How will LADYBOUNCE do in the end?)

2247
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:23,270
We are the crew with excellent teamwork and energy.

2248
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:25,210
(Let's show them what we are good at!)

2249
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:29,609
I think we had more wow factors.

2250
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,420
BEBE's performance was more eye-catching.

2251
01:52:34,649 --> 01:52:36,319
That part was really nice.

2252
01:52:37,859 --> 01:52:42,090
(What will be the result of BEBE's performance?)

2253
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:45,198
(Special judges: Honey J of HolyBang and Trix of PRIME KINGZ)

2254
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,769
If you show a mediocre performance in an attempt to be witty,

2255
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:49,300
you won't get points from me.

2256
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:51,568
Trix, what did you think of the performance?

2257
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:52,969
I couldn't really focus.

2258
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:56,510
(Trix is a judge who gives sharp and straightforward reviews.)

2259
01:52:58,279 --> 01:52:59,640
To be honest, I don't understand.

2260
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,050
Is it okay to do...

2261
01:53:01,409 --> 01:53:04,250
(What?)

2262
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:09,220
(What kind of a shocking comment did he make?)
