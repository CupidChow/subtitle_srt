1
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,629
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,100
I've actually...

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,629
loved dancing since I was a little kid.

4
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,038
And I loved to show off.

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,240
(Capri)

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,170
I liked to move my body from when I was little.

7
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,149
I started by dancing freely.

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,079
My mom told me that I've been dancing ever since I could walk.

9
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:52,420
I've just always loved to dance ever since I was little.

10
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,799
Hi, my name is Emma. And I'm five years old.

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,700
I started dancing at the age of four back home in New Zealand.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,609
And it was with all 12 of my cousins.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,180
(Emma)

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,349
My parents were dancers.

15
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,549
My brother started dancing before me,

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,680
and I remember when I first saw him on stage.

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,750
I turned to my mom and I said, "Why am I not on stage?"

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,790
I had done ballet for eight straight years...

19
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,530
since I was a kid.

20
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,828
(Her phenomenal signature move...)

21
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:34,099
(came from her balance of ballet training.)

22
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,429
(These two kids started dancing at a school talent show.)

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,700
(Harimu and Gooseul)

24
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:41,010
My mom saw me at the talent show...

25
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,010
and thought that I was good and had potential.

26
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,680
I was a member of a team...

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,019
that demonstrated the choreography for talent shows.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,890
I started by dancing K-pop,

29
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,390
but it was in secret.

30
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,890
I have this image of a hip hop dancer,

31
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,628
so people get confused...

32
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,989
when they see it.

33
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:08,769
(Haechi Wang when she dreamed of becoming a K-pop singer)

34
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,270
(The best dancer)

35
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,340
(She had controlled movements in 6th grade.)

36
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,479
The blood of K-pop courses through Haechi Wang's body.

37
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,949
I started dancing by learning the Korean dance.

38
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,520
A Buddhist monk was thirsty, so my mom gave him water.

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,348
And he said, "Your younger daughter will be a big star..."

40
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,418
"in the entertainment world," and left.

41
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,889
I think I started dancing ever since.

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,129
I've loved dancing since my childhood.

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,699
It was the happiest moment of my life.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,569
Dancing has naturally become a part of my life.

45
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,909
In my life, dancing is just who I am.

46
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,969
It's who I am.

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,210
I was dance itself.

48
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,810
It's my everything that I can never change.

49
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,080
Thanks to dance, my life...

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,080
has become radiant.

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,388
(Minah, Amy, Locker Zee, Naro, Soweon, )

52
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,918
(Mina Myoung, Yeni Cho, Kirsten, )

53
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,589
(Yoonji, Dohee Kim, Funky Y, and Audrey)

54
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,400
(We root for the brilliant dancing lives of the dancers.)

55
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,599
(The 7 crews' videos of the Mega Crew Mission revealed)

56
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,500
(But it's not so easy practicing for the Mega Crew Mission.)

57
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,769
(I had never seen myself crumbling before.)

58
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,539
(What happened to BEBE?)

59
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,809
(The result of the Mega Crew Mission)

60
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,109
(The long-awaited result of the Mega Crew Mission...)

61
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,379
(that made everyone shed tears)

62
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,780
(Vote for the crew performance to determine the best crew.)

63
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,050
(The champion's prize)

64
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,020
(A 50,000-dollar prize)

65
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:41,860
(Diamond rings for the champions from amondz)

66
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,259
(The pool party of the 7 crews that survived)

67
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,099
It was a day prepared for us, the surviving crews.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,168
It was so much fun.

69
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,538
It was the first time that the different crews...

70
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,468
could laugh and hang out together.

71
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,309
No more competing!

72
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,280
It was truly a break.

73
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,328
(A therapeutic moment for the 7 surviving crews)

74
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:05,929
(Harimu underwater)

75
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,197
- One, two, three, four! - One, two, three, four!

76
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,328
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

77
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:12,898
(Looking amazing)

78
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,537
Redy, this is a close coverage.

79
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,238
- This is way too close. - How do you feel?

80
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,608
- I think this is too close. - It's supposed to be.

81
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,908
I need my makeup to stay on.

82
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,779
So I brought this!

83
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,577
- Awesome. - It won't come off.

84
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:27,778
- It'll stay until tomorrow. - Which one?

85
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,817
Try that one.

86
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,278
That's the perfect colour for you.

87
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,647
- Let's go! - Let's go!

88
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,248
Her lips!

89
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:35,359
It will never come off.

90
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:37,958
(It's time for a barbecue.)

91
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,528
(A barbecue party is a must at a pool party.)

92
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,698
- Enjoy your food. - Enjoy your food.

93
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,028
We had meat,

94
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,998
I was feeling good, and the weather was great.

95
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,229
(A clapping quokka)

96
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:48,568
It's delicious.

97
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,437
- Gosh. - Cheers!

98
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,169
(Great work, Wolf'Lo.)

99
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,738
Good work, everyone.

100
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:54,908
Open it up.

101
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,479
- Cheers! - Great work!

102
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:59,308
- Cheers. - Cheers.

103
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:01,078
- Cheers. - Enjoy the moment.

104
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,748
- I love this. - You guys did great.

105
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,718
Dohee, join us.

106
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:08,458
- Okay. - Be careful.

107
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,288
(Ready to have fun)

108
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,588
You open them so well.

109
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,859
(Excited Harimu)

110
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:15,997
- 1MILLION. - I love you!

111
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,197
- Whether we win or lose, - Whether we win or lose,

112
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:19,469
- let's go! - let's go!

113
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,169
- That's so refreshing. - It's a perfect beer.

114
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,708
- It's so good. - I love it.

115
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,007
(Exclaiming)

116
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:30,437
- All right! - All right!

117
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:31,878
That's so good.

118
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:37,719
(LaTrice's specialty)

119
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,388
(The members of JAM REPUBLIC also enjoy the party.)

120
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:42,288
- Yes! - Yes!

121
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,299
(Let's just enjoy the day.)

122
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:51,969
(They became one and enjoyed the party in midsummer.)

123
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:54,039
I had so much fun.

124
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,838
- This must be ours. - Let's dry our hair.

125
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,338
That's amazing.

126
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,208
- No way! - It's certainly better.

127
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:01,637
It dries my hair so fast.

128
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:04,207
(Nice and dry)

129
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,548
That took such a short time.

130
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:06,848
If I do this...

131
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,118
(Experiencing the wind)

132
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,578
- Right? - Yes.

133
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,988
I bet this will come in handy after a dip.

134
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,988
Yes. And it's small enough to bring on a trip.

135
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,758
Take this, and...

136
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:19,289
- From the top down. - Goodness.

137
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,897
That's so cool.

138
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:22,528
It makes the hair so neat.

139
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,627
- Right? - Yes.

140
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,968
(It's so neat.)

141
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,468
You look calmer.

142
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,298
Try this. It's so easy.

143
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:30,908
Turn it on, and put it close to your hair.

144
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,938
(Here we go.)

145
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:34,377
That looks easy.

146
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:35,938
- Now what? - Turn it off.

147
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,338
Let it go.

148
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,278
(That's gorgeous.)

149
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,779
You have to touch it once.

150
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,148
It works so well.

151
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,517
I've never been able to use hair straighteners.

152
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,158
Can I take this home?

153
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,219
Me too.

154
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,058
(After a pool party, )

155
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,158
(they hear a voice.)

156
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,627
Hello, I'm Rie Hata.

157
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:57,668
What?

158
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,599
- Rie Hata? - Rie Hata?

159
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,767
(There's no way.)

160
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:01,768
It's Rie Hata!

161
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:04,908
She's so famous.

162
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,908
She's the hottest dancer.

163
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,078
She's like a legendary teacher.

164
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:13,578
She's worked with so many famous artists.

165
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:17,588
I believe that she influenced a lot of Korean dancers as well.

166
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,348
(Chris Brown, NCT, j-hope of BTS, and ZICO)

167
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:21,618
(The world-class choreographer, Rie Hata)

168
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:22,988
That's awesome. I love Rie Hata.

169
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:27,458
I'm here to tell you all about an important mission.

170
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,497
(We knew it.)

171
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,268
It's the Mega Crew Mission!

172
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:35,369
(Make some noise!)

173
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,668
A mega crew means a large performance team...

174
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,609
with many crew members.

175
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,947
Now, let's start the Mega Crew Mission!

176
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:47,978
It has finally come.

177
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,817
Watching the Mega Crew Mission on "Street Woman Fighter 1,"

178
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,418
I was envious.

179
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,788
I was actually excited.

180
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,988
I'm very confident, and I can't wait to show...

181
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,488
everyone our mega crew.

182
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,029
Back to war!

183
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,688
(How will the Mega Crew Mission turn out?)

184
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,758
Pack your bags!

185
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,698
How was it?

186
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,697
It feels like I came from another world.

187
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,099
- I know, right? - Right?

188
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:09,599
(And it was quite hostile in the pool.)

189
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,137
Especially BEBE. It was so new.

190
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:13,738
- They know how to have fun. - Right.

191
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,739
(The BEBE members are recovering from the pool party.)

192
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:18,909
(Here comes an announcement.)

193
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,919
(Oh, my gosh!)

194
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:22,718
- Goodness. - Gosh.

195
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,078
Okay.

196
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,118
The seven crews who made it out...

197
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,087
of the K-pop Death match Mission...

198
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,817
with your survival on the line,

199
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,387
- great work. - That's so sudden.

200
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:32,928
- Thank you. - So sweet.

201
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,628
You see JAM REPUBLIC?

202
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,728
We made it.

203
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,898
On Street Woman Fighter 2,

204
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,697
TSUBA KILL has become the first crew to be eliminated...

205
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,938
and has left the fight club.

206
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,768
The competition will only become fiercer now.

207
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,538
I'm scared.

208
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,977
Your competition continues in the next mission.

209
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,947
The special judge, Rie Hata, has given you the Mega Crew Mission.

210
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,817
- Do you remember? - Yes!

211
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,748
Here are the rules for the Mega Crew Mission.

212
00:08:57,749 --> 00:08:59,847
Rule number one. A mega crew must consist...

213
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:02,058
of 30 or more dancers, including the crew members.

214
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,588
There is no limit to the maximum number of members.

215
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,788
- Gosh. - Gosh.

216
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:06,929
Can we have 500 people in the video?

217
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,697
Rule number two. A mega crew must have...

218
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,499
three part directors, including the leader.

219
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,597
The part directors of each crew will be evaluated...

220
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,269
by the fight judges later on.

221
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,379
- In our case... - Yes, they're all on the couch.

222
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,308
You can just get the order straight.

223
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,448
And the last rule. In this Mega Crew Mission,

224
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:31,048
there are three different themes.

225
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,348
(What are they?)

226
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,488
(Theme 1: Outdoor, Theme 2: Structure, )

227
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,519
(Theme 3: All-gender Group)

228
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,488
(Amazed)

229
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,957
Maybe we can choose one of the themes.

230
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,227
An outdoor theme as a mega crew, a structure theme as a mega crew,

231
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:42,899
- and an all-gender theme? - Yes.

232
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,097
They combined the all-gender mission...

233
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:45,597
- with this one. - Exactly.

234
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,998
The outdoor theme and the structure theme...

235
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,268
will be taken by two crews.

236
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,338
The all-gender theme will be taken by three crews.

237
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,908
Of the crews that chose the same theme,

238
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,607
the one crew that showed a better performance...

239
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:59,977
than the other crews by utilizing the theme well...

240
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:03,279
will be given 100 extra points.

241
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,117
That's interesting.

242
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:07,018
That's way too many. It's a huge benefit.

243
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,988
The theme for each crew will be decided...

244
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,529
by a discussion of seven crews.

245
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,158
(A discussion?)

246
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,529
(We're in for it.)

247
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,498
- Drama. - What?

248
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,468
Each crew will now begin...

249
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:26,269
discussing which theme to choose.

250
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,107
But we won the last mission. Where's our benefit?

251
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,278
- I know, right? - I'm upset.

252
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,577
Tell me about it! They could have told us...

253
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:33,649
(Ta-Da)

254
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,218
(Surprised)

255
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,518
- What? - We had a benefit!

256
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,648
The winner of the K-pop Death match Mission...

257
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,158
gets the right to decide the theme...

258
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,988
for the Mega Crew Mission first.

259
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,629
They get the right to decide!

260
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,357
We should have won the last one.

261
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,398
No!

262
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,798
It's fine. Don't mind them.

263
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,799
(Look at her face.)

264
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,468
There's always been a benefit for winners. Don't bother.

265
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,738
(Screaming)

266
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,809
But it's such a huge benefit!

267
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,077
So, they don't have to negotiate with other crews.

268
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,708
- That's a huge benefit. - Awesome.

269
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,009
Which one should we choose?

270
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,707
I think BEBE will take the all-gender theme.

271
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,908
- Right. - I agree.

272
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:08,678
- It suits them too. - Right.

273
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,248
It certainly looks more energetic...

274
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:13,848
when there are male dancers in the group.

275
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,087
We can take advantage of the theme by adding more techniques.

276
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:20,188
The all-gender theme widens the range, so I do want it.

277
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,258
- But... - The outdoor theme...

278
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,857
- That must be tough. - must be hard to film it.

279
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,567
It'll be hot and exhausting.

280
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,528
- But the video will look good. - Yes.

281
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,597
We've filmed a video in a cave,

282
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,207
and the location of the shoot clearly has an influence.

283
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,077
But if we think about what's going to stand out...

284
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:37,539
You can have strong dancers. You can put them anywhere.

285
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,748
But if you have a location, that will capture so much.

286
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,118
I'm sure it's beautiful.

287
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:43,477
The thing is,

288
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,717
it's not like we'll get to practice there every time.

289
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:49,457
We'll have to travel there with a load of people.

290
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,258
The all-gender theme would certainly be easier.

291
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,828
Should we just rule out outdoor?

292
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,999
It'd be funny if no one picks outdoor.

293
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,097
My first choice would be structure.

294
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:58,528
- Mine too. - Same.

295
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:01,398
The structure would have its own special vibes.

296
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,697
If we have a structure, it'd make the entire picture...

297
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,308
much more dynamic.

298
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,538
The structure theme was the one that caught my attention.

299
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:08,978
I'm with you on that.

300
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:12,009
But we can't practice until the structure is made.

301
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,548
We might get caught up in the idea of using the structure...

302
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,717
which could compromise the quality of our dance.

303
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,988
It's one of the concerns I have.

304
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,389
Accidents happen often with a structure.

305
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:23,818
Which one do you prefer?

306
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,659
I really want to win this 100 points.

307
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,998
- I never realized this before. - Yes.

308
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:28,999
I never realized it before.

309
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,798
Even just 50 points counts for so much.

310
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,398
We have to go all out for this.

311
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,468
I know. We'll do whatever it takes.

312
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,468
We have nothing more to lose right now.

313
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,737
- Okay. - All right!

314
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:38,768
- Let's go! - We can do this!

315
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,309
We can pick the theme we want.

316
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,179
Let's all pick the theme and then discuss.

317
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,338
- Okay. - Okay.

318
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:45,879
I wonder what they'll pick.

319
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,748
(To find out the crews' preferences, )

320
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:50,618
(they all pick the theme they want.)

321
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,749
Of course.

322
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:54,888
Oh, my gosh!

323
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,028
(But most of them seem to want the same theme.)

324
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,128
(The structure theme is popular.)

325
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,858
- Everybody wants it. - Everyone.

326
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,097
Wait, their choice is the most important.

327
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:05,499
They don't look so happy.

328
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,197
Wait a minute. Come on.

329
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:09,467
If they pick structure, it leaves only one slot.

330
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:10,498
Well...

331
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,638
No way.

332
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,868
(It can't be.)

333
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,178
(Here's BEBE's choice.)

334
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,238
(What?)

335
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,447
(Crushed)

336
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:20,878
(Everyone is afraid of their choice. What will it be?)

337
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,947
(BEBE chooses the all-gender concept.)

338
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,248
(That's what we thought!)

339
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:25,419
(Mischievous)

340
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:30,158
I'm known to have good chemistry with my dance partners.

341
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,457
I want it to be the case this time as well,

342
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,559
so I wanted the all-gender theme from the beginning.

343
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,428
- Why did you guys select... - Why?

344
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:38,968
the outdoor theme?

345
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,237
I think, again, we're an international crew.

346
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,338
We wanted to showcase our world and home ground.

347
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,179
- Gosh. - This is why we chose it.

348
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,679
Home ground?

349
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,379
- So they're going abroad? - Grand Canyon?

350
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,107
(We're from New Zealand. Why would we go there?)

351
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:56,478
So three of the crews have to change their choices.

352
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:57,818
This is so unexpected.

353
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,788
Why did so many choose structure?

354
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,118
Don't you think it'll be hard?

355
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:03,588
I thought they were joking.

356
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:04,858
It's never easy.

357
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,029
(Exchanging looks)

358
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,559
Can we...

359
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,058
Go ahead, NOB.

360
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,828
Can we...

361
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:14,328
change our choice?

362
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:16,367
- Yes, sure. - Okay then.

363
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:17,539
To which?

364
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:20,737
(LADYBOUNCE chooses the all-gender theme instead.)

365
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:21,809
Right.

366
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:23,838
Welcome aboard.

367
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,477
Strategically, we wanted to avoid competing against JAM REPUBLIC.

368
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:30,218
They will give off those exotic vibes of theirs...

369
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:32,718
and present the Korean viewers a new kind of dance.

370
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:36,487
What if we lose structure and end up with outdoor?

371
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:37,559
I'd hate that.

372
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,987
(The other 2 themes need 1 more crew each.)

373
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,898
All right. We need to sort this out quickly.

374
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,967
How about we take our pick in the order of the rankings?

375
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,298
That's not going to happen, of course.

376
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,638
(Booing)

377
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,898
(She's hilarious.)

378
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,437
How about you let the crews at the bottom go first?

379
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:54,467
No.

380
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:56,039
As far as I know,

381
00:14:56,108 --> 00:15:00,977
choreography crews consider videography so important.

382
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:03,317
I thought most of you would pick the outdoor theme.

383
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,288
Actually, we've filmed...

384
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:08,258
many things outdoors already, such as commercials.

385
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:10,889
If we do that again, it wouldn't be anything new.

386
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,558
I have a question.

387
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,159
Wolf'Lo, why didn't you pick outdoor?

388
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:16,957
Honestly, we don't have...

389
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,129
much experience in filming on location.

390
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,567
It's true.

391
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:24,168
(Trying not to laugh)

392
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:25,809
Why don't we take a few minutes...

393
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:27,538
to discuss it with the crew members?

394
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,038
Some of us might have to change our decisions.

395
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,848
This is an emergency. Get up.

396
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:36,379
We couldn't reach an agreement with these crews.

397
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,518
JAM REPUBLIC picked outdoor?

398
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,717
They're filming abroad.

399
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:42,059
- Abroad? - In New Zealand, their home.

400
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,488
They'll be doing it with their own dancers.

401
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:46,389
Everyone wants to avoid JAM REPUBLIC.

402
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,058
What I'm thinking is...

403
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,899
we either stick to structure or switch to all-gender.

404
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,929
Does anyone want to change their decision?

405
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,299
We'll change ours.

406
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,837
(Could it be...)

407
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,238
(They'll probably pick all-gender.)

408
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:01,509
Gosh.

409
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,509
Outdoor?

410
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:07,578
(Really? Deep N Dap?)

411
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,678
(We're going with outdoor.)

412
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,419
(Did they actually pick outdoor?)

413
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,818
Mina Myoung. I was impressed with her.

414
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,818
JAM REPUBLIC had chosen the theme,

415
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,429
and no one seemed to want it.

416
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:20,728
Well,

417
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,028
we can certainly make it work with a location.

418
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,129
Also, JAM REPUBLIC will be filming abroad.

419
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,097
We thought we could do...

420
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:32,067
- something contrasting. - That's cool.

421
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:34,438
They'll be a good rival, so that's why...

422
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,737
- we chose it. - Impressive, Deep N Dap.

423
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:37,909
It couldn't have been easy.

424
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,779
They're challenging themselves.

425
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:41,009
Or are we being reckless?

426
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:43,817
(This is me, Mina Myoung.)

427
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,118
What a charming woman.

428
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,158
Is there anyone else who wants to change their decision?

429
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,187
(One more crew needs to switch.)

430
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,727
Do the rest of you still want the structure theme?

431
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:52,889
I'm afraid so.

432
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,328
What about you, Wolf'Lo?

433
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:56,899
We couldn't find a solution either.

434
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,498
How about this then?

435
00:16:58,499 --> 00:16:59,828
We vote anonymously.

436
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,337
Please raise your hand...

437
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,209
if you don't think the structure theme is for Wolf'Lo.

438
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,337
I guess this decides it then.

439
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:08,978
- We'll go with all-gender. - Yes.

440
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,407
- Show us what you got. - Show us.

441
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,508
Certainly.

442
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,508
Although we strongly wanted the structure theme,

443
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,177
we've already used...

444
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,348
many different props during the previous missions.

445
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,689
Maybe we've shown people enough of that already.

446
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,189
We don't really have to pick structure again.

447
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,528
We got the all-gender theme!

448
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:26,689
(Let's go with all-gender.)

449
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:29,298
- All-gender is easier for us. - That's right.

450
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,397
We just wanted something more challenging.

451
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:34,199
We know tons of male dancers.

452
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:38,269
The all-gender theme is 100 percent about the dance.

453
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:40,908
Perhaps, this is a better way to showcase our strength.

454
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:42,439
It's settled.

455
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,608
Congratulations.

456
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,008
(Mega Crew Mission)

457
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,478
- Good. - Good luck, everyone.

458
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,219
- Let's make a good one. - Let's go!

459
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:50,117
Three teams compete under the all-gender theme.

460
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:51,789
That'd be the downside.

461
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:55,258
It'll be that much harder to win the 100 points.

462
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,628
We'll never be able to win with a mediocre performance.

463
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:01,428
We have to come up with something ground-breaking.

464
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:03,827
But do we have to make it obvious...

465
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,698
that we have male dancers?

466
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,468
Exactly. I don't think we do.

467
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,739
Rather than some sort of couple dance,

468
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,268
we actually wanted to dance...

469
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,939
like we are one.

470
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,779
Thank you all so much for coming.

471
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:21,049
We wanted to show a dance without distinction of gender,

472
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:24,019
so we formed a group that's half male and half female.

473
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,888
It's going to be all male dancers except for us.

474
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,989
That's our plan.

475
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:30,658
We'll be like girl bosses.

476
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,728
- Girl bosses. - That's what I was thinking too.

477
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:35,459
I think that's the way to make the best use of the theme.

478
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:36,998
With LADYBOUNCE's true energy,

479
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,868
we never get intimidated even by 50 men.

480
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,098
We wanted to make people know that.

481
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,439
I'm sure they'll all get celebrities.

482
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:47,039
- No, I think only one of them will. - You mean, BEBE?

483
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:49,178
- I bet they'll get big-shot idols. - Big-shot idols?

484
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,709
They know so many of them.

485
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,009
I wonder who they'll get.

486
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,877
Maybe it's KAI.

487
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:56,749
- He's serving in the military. - Right.

488
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,448
- Hey. - What's up?

489
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:01,559
We're filming Street Woman Fighter 2 right now.

490
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,758
Oh, he can't speak.

491
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,489
(He's hilarious.)

492
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,928
I've been dancing with Vata for years.

493
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,499
People say we're like siblings.

494
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:13,367
"Vata and Bada." We have similar names too.

495
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,468
I hope we can show people our chemistry.

496
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:16,838
I know, right?

497
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,709
You can't dance at all right now, right?

498
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:20,208
I can't.

499
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,708
I'd have to sit down and dance.

500
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,938
(Sadly, he suffered an injury.)

501
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:27,978
Is it a bad idea to collaborate with WeDemBoyz without Vata?

502
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:29,577
No one else is tall enough for me.

503
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:30,979
(Oh...)

504
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:33,448
No one comes to mind.

505
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:34,618
Same here.

506
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:35,789
What do we do?

507
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,189
(BEBE's first practice session after a few days)

508
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,858
Hello.

509
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,158
Hello.

510
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,028
- Hi. - Hello.

511
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,158
(Bowing)

512
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,028
We're WeDemBoyz.

513
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,029
(It's WeDemBoyz!)

514
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:49,638
- So you need us for this? - Yes.

515
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,438
- Oh, my goodness. - Please help us.

516
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:54,108
Well, let's do it.

517
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,039
(Screaming)

518
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,378
INGYOO, dance with me.

519
00:19:57,809 --> 00:19:58,908
Well...

520
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:01,279
I don't want to stand next to you.

521
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,917
If WeDemBoyz and we work together,

522
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,248
our dance gets so much trendier.

523
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:09,458
We're sure it's going to be really interesting.

524
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,387
First of all, we've decided to use only one song...

525
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:12,828
instead of mixing a few.

526
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,357
(Really?)

527
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:17,127
I was surprised to hear that they're using only one song...

528
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:21,938
because we danced to a medley of songs last year.

529
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:22,969
(WeDemBoyz danced to a medley of songs.)

530
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,539
It's a K-pop song.

531
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,078
I want to dance to a single song for the Mega Crew Mission.

532
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:34,308
It's more absorbing, and we can tell the story better...

533
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,178
if we dance to only one song.

534
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,549
- It's not easy to go with one song. - You're right.

535
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:40,818
They're incredibly bold.

536
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,618
We're challenging ourselves here.

537
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,788
If we do something that no one would want to do...

538
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,759
and do it well, it's going to be a hit.

539
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,427
Our theme is all-gender,

540
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:50,858
and we only got male dancers for this performance.

541
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,597
We wanted to try something new,

542
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:55,738
so we included a few moves where we touch each other.

543
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:58,568
I think we'll be able to express the theme well.

544
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,568
I want to make it look like a movie.

545
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,738
I'm sorry, but we'll be taking the 100 points.

546
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:04,838
You'll just have to deal with it.

547
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,317
We went on for 45 minutes,

548
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,788
so let's take a ten-minute break. Drink some water,

549
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,357
go over the moves, and we'll resume.

550
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,117
- Okay. - Thank you!

551
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,888
(What does INGYOO need right now?)

552
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:21,798
Thanks.

553
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,199
(It's time to rehydrate.)

554
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,969
(Gulping)

555
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,238
When you gulp it down...

556
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:31,667
after dancing for long, it's so good.

557
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:32,838
- It's so clean. - Yes.

558
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,769
- Cheers! - Cheers!

559
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,239
(They're all rehydrated now.)

560
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:40,508
I don't know if this is right.

561
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,548
(After a few days)

562
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,318
(Silence fills the room, and BEBE looks serious.)

563
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,249
It's really just...

564
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,959
I was confused and surprised.

565
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,258
I've never seen Bada...

566
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:55,729
fall apart like that before.

567
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:58,928
Usually, I believe in myself 100 percent.

568
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:01,168
I'm always really confident.

569
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:02,739
But...

570
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:06,168
to be completely honest...

571
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:08,638
I feel like...

572
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,709
this isn't something...

573
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,249
that I can handle.

574
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:21,918
(What happened to BEBE?)

575
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:24,387
- Hello! - Hello!

576
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,128
- Hello! - There are a lot of them.

577
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:29,298
(The studio is full of 1MILLION dancers.)

578
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,328
- This is so cool! - Thank you.

579
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,167
You can't ignore the grandeur that comes from a massive group.

580
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:37,468
I want us to have the most dancers.

581
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,208
We wanted to be the biggest group,

582
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:41,308
and there's no limit to the number of people.

583
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:43,739
So we decided to have 100 dancers.

584
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:46,548
I wanted to create...

585
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,979
an overpowering performance with all those people.

586
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,948
I decided to dance to "YELLOW" by Lim Kim...

587
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:57,759
because we can perform an oriental dance to that song.

588
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,657
Black and white, light and darkness,

589
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:02,999
or lotus flowers. That'd be our motif.

590
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,299
I wanted to express the harmony between yin and yang.

591
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:10,167
First of all, our theme is structure.

592
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:11,238
(Good!)

593
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:14,438
Since we insisted on the theme and won it,

594
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,407
I believe we need to prove...

595
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,408
that we can make good use of structures.

596
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,049
We got the structure theme!

597
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:23,118
(MANNEQUEEN also got the structure theme.)

598
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:27,448
I think we need to use the structures really well.

599
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,387
We should at least have 3 or 4.

600
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,418
We should start making them immediately.

601
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,428
First of all, we're going to make the structures.

602
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:38,928
We focused on big movements and dancing in sync.

603
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:42,598
- Hello. - Hello.

604
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:44,097
- Hello. - Hello.

605
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:45,539
(What are they doing here?)

606
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,038
(1MILLION has come to MANNEQUEEN's practice session?)

607
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,408
(Funky Y freezes in confusion.)

608
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,377
MANNEQUEEN chose the structure theme as well,

609
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,949
and we're going to let you take a look at their choreography.

610
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:58,519
(They get to take a look at their competitors' choreography.)

611
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:02,558
Please choose 1 of the 3 directors whose part you want to see.

612
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,259
Funky Y's part would be...

613
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,387
Like this. Some variations here, and this.

614
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,558
Yes. Exactly.

615
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,367
Yoonji's part would probably be the most flamboyant.

616
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,969
- It's probably the climax. - Yes.

617
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:17,137
We'd like to see...

618
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:18,298
(What will it be?)

619
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,408
Yoonji's part.

620
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:22,108
(Impressed)

621
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,678
- Mine? - Yes.

622
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,249
They look surprised.

623
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:28,748
I thought, "These guys made the wrong choice."

624
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:30,417
My part isn't the climax,

625
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:31,748
and it's without any structures.

626
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:33,818
I just thought they made the wrong choice.

627
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:37,219
(They start watching Yoonji's part.)

628
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:40,388
She'll probably use a baton.

629
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,729
(On guard)

630
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:45,469
(Stopping abruptly)

631
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:48,768
That's it.

632
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:50,198
You didn't even wait a second to stop.

633
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,168
She cut the music like a knife.

634
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:54,939
That's it.

635
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,478
- I think there's more. - No.

636
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,008
Her part had ended. We let you hear the music a little more.

637
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,708
I see. That's how you end it.

638
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,847
Their waacking dance was very much in sync,

639
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:05,077
but it wasn't anything more than that.

640
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:06,948
Thank you for showing us.

641
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:08,318
Good luck to you.

642
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,788
I'm so happy right now.

643
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,228
(Why are they so happy?)

644
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:14,258
We were so lucky.

645
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,999
I think it was a mistake. That notebook.

646
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:18,828
They should've closed it.

647
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,167
(A moment ago)

648
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,628
They're using four stairways.

649
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,338
- Four? - Look at the notebook.

650
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,367
(Looking down)

651
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:26,838
(Exchanging looks)

652
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,677
Their notebook was wide open right in front of us.

653
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:33,848
It had drawings of four stairways.

654
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:36,018
It was clearly stairways.

655
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,479
- That's right. - It's such a cliché.

656
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:40,147
You see stairways all the time.

657
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:43,188
We're certainly using better structures.

658
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:45,958
We'll be evaluated on how well we use the structures.

659
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,058
Exactly. That's why I feel confident.

660
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,458
- The 100 points will be ours. - Yes.

661
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:51,499
Thank you for the extra 100 points.

662
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,397
We know for sure it's going to be ours.

663
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,028
Don't bring any notes.

664
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,338
(1MILLION practices in the same studio.)

665
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:58,468
(Amy has found something.)

666
00:25:58,469 --> 00:25:59,739
They left this.

667
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,578
(What could it be?)

668
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:05,178
"Slow movement and facial expressions in contrast."

669
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:06,508
It's all in here.

670
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,979
"Dancers in the back do a quick freestyle and exit."

671
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,948
How could they expose so much?

672
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:11,949
They're fools.

673
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,117
I just found it lying on the floor.

674
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:17,259
I thought it was like a challenge letter.

675
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:19,827
Why did you leave this?

676
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,858
I think that's mine.

677
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:21,959
What's that?

678
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,529
A note on one of the parts.

679
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,867
If we want a secret weapon, it has to be...

680
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:27,968
Hello?

681
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,298
- Hey. - Hi.

682
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:30,837
If you could join us...

683
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:34,538
on one of the waacking dance parts, it'd be such a big help to us.

684
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:37,107
I have to take part in such a big event.

685
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:38,177
Hey!

686
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:40,748
- Our Lip J. - This is insane.

687
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,318
No one could beat us now.

688
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,219
Unbelievable. Just fold it.

689
00:26:44,678 --> 00:26:46,318
(I must've been out of my mind.)

690
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:48,518
- It's okay. - It's okay.

691
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,519
(It's no big deal.)

692
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,857
(It's MANNEQUEEN's turn to see 1MILLION's dance.)

693
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,988
Hello.

694
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,127
That's a lot of people.

695
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:56,998
- I see number 99. - There must be 100 of them.

696
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,157
I guess you're right.

697
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,367
They managed to get 100 dancers, which is amazing.

698
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:03,699
But are all 100 of them skilled dancers?

699
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,939
They all seem to be students.

700
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:10,009
(They watch Lia Kim's part.)

701
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,848
- It's oriental. - Yes.

702
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:17,077
It was all something I've seen before.

703
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,949
There was nothing new.

704
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:21,518
This is it.

705
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,588
(This is the end.)

706
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:25,328
- Those two people over there. - Who are they?

707
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:27,759
(Her eyes wander nervously.)

708
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,597
- The show's producers. - Producers?

709
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:31,959
- They're wearing number tags. - They have number tags.

710
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,269
I guess you were trying to hide them from us.

711
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:36,939
I think I know who that is.

712
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:39,739
- All right then. Thank you. - Thank you!

713
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:42,638
Let me walk you guys out. Thank you.

714
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,308
It's funny how she was wearing a hat and all to hide her face.

715
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:47,049
- Who's that? - YELL.

716
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,848
- The b-girl? - Yes.

717
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,278
Maybe YELL should put on a hat and a mask.

718
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,049
But they could still easily tell.

719
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,219
I didn't think they'd actually get 100 dancers.

720
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:59,627
If they have so many people, they might use simple structures.

721
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:01,627
- You're right. - This is like east versus west.

722
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:05,398
From the audience's viewpoint, they'll clearly see the contrast.

723
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:08,529
(1MILLION versus MANNEQUEEN, who will be the winner?)

724
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:12,739
All right, guys. We volunteered to change our decision...

725
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:14,208
and chose the outdoor theme.

726
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,038
We're an international crew.

727
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,438
We wanted to showcase our home ground.

728
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,448
She said she wanted to showcase their home ground.

729
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,607
We'll change ours.

730
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:22,748
(Really?)

731
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:25,118
I thought, "Okay, we'll show you our home ground too then."

732
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:26,387
Outdoor?

733
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,587
We can go the opposite way and show people the beauty of Korea.

734
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,989
There's a song by Lee Hi called "No One."

735
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,258
("No One" by Lee Hi)

736
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,898
(It's an emotional song sung with her soulful voice.)

737
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,367
The song is very sad and resentful.

738
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:42,068
The lyrics, music, and vocals.

739
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:43,768
We're resentful right now, right?

740
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:45,969
- That's right. - We certainly are.

741
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,438
Ranked number seven is...

742
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,539
(Deep N Dap finished 7th in the Class Mission.)

743
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:51,538
I can sense that...

744
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,847
everyone thinks we're the weakest crew.

745
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,877
If you think about our score in the HYBE Match,

746
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:58,848
it's pretty clear.

747
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,689
(Deep N Dap lost by a huge margin.)

748
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:05,458
I feel like we haven't been able to live up...

749
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:08,728
to people's expectations, which is frustrating.

750
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:12,498
Through the Mega Crew Mission, I hope to change that completely.

751
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:16,698
For our outfits, we could remake some traditional dresses.

752
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:19,708
We could also do the three-drum dance.

753
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:21,269
It's going to be so cool.

754
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,278
- All right. - Let's do this.

755
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,408
First off, let's learn a couple of rhythms.

756
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:27,847
I did it for a long time when I was little.

757
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:29,979
I practiced Korean traditional dance for about ten years.

758
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,048
I wanted to create a performance where I can show people...

759
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:35,959
my traditional dance skills.

760
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,689
(Struggling)

761
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:41,028
The three-drum dance is performed less and less now.

762
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:45,728
I hope our performance will help the dance to be continued.

763
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:48,469
We plan on making our performance quite traditional.

764
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,039
We hired some engineers to record the sound of the drums.

765
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:56,239
(They've mastered the drums now.)

766
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,377
Our theme is outdoor,

767
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:01,607
so we went to check out the location.

768
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:02,978
Maybe it's here.

769
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:04,577
Since we'll be filming outdoors,

770
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:07,887
there can be any number of unexpected events.

771
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:11,189
There's one thing we have no control over.

772
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:14,189
It's the weather.

773
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,628
This path is made of stones.

774
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,097
- Right. - We can't do it here.

775
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:22,029
According to the forecast, it's going to rain until the 22nd.

776
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:24,668
(Deep N Dap is faced with a big difficulty. What will happen?)

777
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,337
Let's say hello before we begin. In 1, 2, 3.

778
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:29,838
- Hello, we're Deep N Dap! - Hello, we're Deep N Dap!

779
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,008
Thank you so much for being here.

780
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:34,008
I invited two special dancers.

781
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,248
I'm sure you all know who she is.

782
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:38,317
It's Hyojin Choi, the leader of WANT.

783
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:39,347
(Hyojin Choi, the leader of WANT)

784
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:40,689
(Welcome)

785
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,489
(Making a strong impression)

786
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,358
(Hyojin was in the first season of the show as the leader of WANT.)

787
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:48,488
(She and Mina Myoung met when they were members of 1MILLION.)

788
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:49,958
(The two of them have been good friends ever since.)

789
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,868
(The two of them have been good friends ever since.)

790
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,528
She's going to help us.

791
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:57,568
Now, this is my older sister.

792
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:01,738
Hello, it's nice to meet you all.

793
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:04,508
My sister is also a dancer. She does Korean traditional dance.

794
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,147
I've been a dancer for almost 20 years,

795
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:08,677
and she's been a dancer for a long time too,

796
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:10,817
but we've never performed together.

797
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,387
Our genres are completely different.

798
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:13,688
In 7, 8!

799
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:15,347
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience...

800
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:18,318
to perform together with my big sister,

801
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,459
and it's really meaningful to me.

802
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,728
It's so cool, isn't it?

803
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,059
It's dynamite.

804
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:24,728
(A few days later)

805
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:26,127
(Someone is waiting for someone else.)

806
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:27,798
Hi. Where is she?

807
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,867
(In here?)

808
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:29,998
- You're here. - Hey.

809
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:31,068
(Who is she?)

810
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,709
How are you?

811
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:37,439
(SinB of VIVIZ with her eye-catching and bold dance moves)

812
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:39,748
SinB called to say...

813
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:41,677
she wanted to learn how to dance. That's how we first met.

814
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:44,478
We did a collaboration video to "Sweet but Psycho."

815
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:47,618
She came to my mind for the Mega Crew Mission, so I contacted her.

816
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:50,019
- Thank you so much for coming. - Don't mention it.

817
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,029
You know I saw you practice.

818
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:54,758
- SinB. - Yes?

819
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,158
Where are you? Okay.

820
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,398
(SinB arrived early to watch Deep N Dap practice.)

821
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,568
I watched it from beginning to end.

822
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,397
I think you can win first place.

823
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:03,768
You do? Please.

824
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,739
- I'll win 1st place with you. - Yes, 1st place.

825
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,238
(Deep N Dap in 1st place)

826
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,279
Out of the remaining seven crews,

827
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:11,708
which do you think is the strongest?

828
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:12,907
- It's JAM REPUBLIC. - Of course, it's JAM REPUBLIC.

829
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,048
- That's right. - It's JAM REPUBLIC.

830
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,408
Which team do you think will be good?

831
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:16,548
I think JAM REPUBLIC.

832
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:17,719
JAM REPUBLIC is a dark horse.

833
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,448
Kirsten...

834
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,989
used to be a member of the Royal Family.

835
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:23,918
She looked so cool standing in the center.

836
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:25,989
They will be a strong competitor in the Mega Crew Mission.

837
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:27,788
They will probably kill it.

838
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,199
They will turn the stage upside down.

839
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:32,127
Yes, I am confident.

840
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:34,097
I have been part of the Royal Family.

841
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:36,499
I have a lot of background work.

842
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,067
With the Royal Family for six years,

843
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,468
we performed a lot with a big crew.

844
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:43,039
Yes, very confident.

845
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,709
We will showcase why we are an international team.

846
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,647
We wanted to showcase...

847
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:49,978
our home ground.

848
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:52,648
(JAM REPUBLIC chose Outdoor Concept to display New Zealand's scenery.)

849
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,289
I was actually really excited.

850
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:57,888
Playing outdoors, no one has New Zealand.

851
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,427
In Auckland, there is a beautiful beach called Piha.

852
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:03,229
This is the location.

853
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:05,059
Oh, my gosh.

854
00:33:05,428 --> 00:33:09,168
We will be able to dance seen in the second photo.

855
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:12,038
The scenery is truly magnificent.

856
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,408
I don't think any other country in the world has scenery like that.

857
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:16,878
It's a black sand beach.

858
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,779
And it is huge.

859
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,719
You can have people standing in Piha.

860
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:25,118
You will see the numbers and we'll just be standing there.

861
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:27,348
I think it would be a beautiful way to show it.

862
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:29,958
- It's beautiful. - We're the only international team.

863
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,218
- Exactly. It's okay. - Sorry.

864
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,928
- Yes. - Exactly.

865
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:34,428
I think the beach would be great.

866
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:36,327
It would be incredible...

867
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,327
just to showcase it on another level.

868
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:40,928
How many people do you want to dance with?

869
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:44,299
At the moment, we have a lot in mind.

870
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:46,138
Possibly around 40.

871
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:47,668
There's a lot of people.

872
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,608
I want them all to come together...

873
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:52,779
and create something incredible.

874
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:54,449
I'm not worried about it.

875
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:56,578
If anything, I'm more excited.

876
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:58,918
I am hyped. I cannot wait.

877
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,347
I have high hopes,

878
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:04,518
and again, I look forward to creating and seeing the end product.

879
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,888
Again, it will be different.

880
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,259
I look forward to this mission.

881
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:11,027
(JAM REPUBLIC travels to New Zealand for the Mega Crew Mission shoot.)

882
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:13,028
(Will it go smoothly as JAM REPUBLIC planned?)

883
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:16,439
This will make it worse.

884
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,168
I didn't know what to do.

885
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,109
How can we get this to work?

886
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,538
We are so doomed.

887
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:28,309
It was so not what we expected.

888
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:32,149
We had to restart everything at that point.

889
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:34,518
In my head, I'm just thinking,

890
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,648
"Okay. Just go for it,"

891
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:38,789
because it's a team thing.

892
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:40,628
(What happened to JAM REPUBLIC?)

893
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:42,728
(The 7 crews finished their final rehearsals.)

894
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:45,157
This makes me upset.

895
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:46,628
They didn't put much thought into it although they're capable.

896
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,269
They can't all go on stage.

897
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:50,438
(Mega Crew Mission Final Result)

898
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,197
(The dancers are surprised at the shocking result.)

899
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:56,208
(Which crew will leave the fight club?)

900
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:57,277
(Rehearsal day)

901
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:58,339
Five, six.

902
00:34:58,778 --> 00:35:01,948
(The crews are gathered for an interim check.)

903
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,819
(The final rehearsal for the Mega Crew Mission is over.)

904
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,089
This is today's timetable.

905
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:09,618
- What is it? - Wait a second.

906
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,359
We can see the number of people. I don't believe it.

907
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,028
One hundred.

908
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,428
A hundred.

909
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:19,129
- I wonder how they did it. - They can't all go on stage.

910
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:20,927
I'm curious if all 100 people...

911
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:23,169
- were at practice. - I don't think it's possible.

912
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:25,738
It's 100 to 26.

913
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,939
It will be interesting.

914
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,408
What's surprising is JAM REPUBLIC has 26 people.

915
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:31,839
- Isn't 30 the minimum number? - Yes.

916
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:33,578
They didn't leave out a zero, did they?

917
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,608
If it's 26 people outdoors,

918
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:37,419
I think it would make too low of an impact.

919
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:40,019
Deep N Dap has an advantage.

920
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:41,588
(JAM REPUBLIC didn't meet the requirement.)

921
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:43,188
(What will happen to them?)

922
00:35:43,189 --> 00:35:45,887
We will now watch the rehearsal videos of six crews.

923
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:47,128
(Interim check)

924
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:48,388
Is this the actual video?

925
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,198
- It's the rehearsal video. - Okay.

926
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:52,359
Both the structure and dance moves weren't impressive.

927
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:54,867
They prepared something that doesn't fit the mission.

928
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:55,999
You're right.

929
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,069
The crew to be eliminated...

930
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:59,468
Which crew does Wolf'Lo think will be eliminated?

931
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:00,839
We think they will be eliminated.

932
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:04,137
- No way. - What?

933
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:05,778
This is all going to matter.

934
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,078
It's okay as long as it isn't us.

935
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:08,709
This hurts so much.

936
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,748
(My heart aches.)

937
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:12,378
- Okay. - Let's watch it.

938
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,048
(The Mega Crew interim check and evaluation begins.)

939
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:18,458
(Mega Crew Final Rehearsal, Wolf'Lo)

940
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,387
- Turn the volume up. - Yes, turn it up.

941
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,157
They're also a mixed team.

942
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:24,927
We're fighting for 100 points.

943
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:26,927
- I'm most excited to see them. - It's a hip-hop party.

944
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:29,238
(Wolf'Lo's final rehearsal video)

945
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:30,798
Their song choice is amazing.

946
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,367
(Constantly marvelling)

947
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:35,907
Look at details of how they stood up.

948
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:37,238
- That is cool. - That is cool.

949
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,407
How are they so in sync...

950
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,879
when they are doing fluid movements?

951
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,318
- They looked like a wave. - It was cool,

952
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:45,618
but I didn't see anything creative.

953
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,487
There was no narrative arc...

954
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,519
- in the directing. - You're right.

955
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:50,689
That's sad.

956
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,928
- Next. - Next.

957
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,257
(Mega Crew Final Rehearsal, LADYBOUNCE)

958
00:36:54,258 --> 00:36:55,327
I'll start it.

959
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,527
- I'm so curious. - LADYBOUNCE.

960
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:57,729
I can't wait to see LADYBOUNCE.

961
00:36:57,828 --> 00:36:59,928
- They always do something fun. - I bet it's something unexpected.

962
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:01,868
Why am I so nervous when I'm watching other team's videos?

963
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:04,169
(LADYBOUNCE's final rehearsal video)

964
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,597
They're totally in sync.

965
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,669
It's LADYBOUNCE style.

966
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,269
(Gasping)

967
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:09,637
This is a textbook mega crew performance.

968
00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,108
It's so clean.

969
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,278
There's nothing unnecessary.

970
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,648
It could seem boring in a way...

971
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,319
since they repeat the same moves.

972
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:19,589
(LADYBOUNCE's choreography has many similar moves.)

973
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,089
Sometimes simple is best,

974
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:25,018
but I don't think that applies to their dance.

975
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,027
(Something is missing.)

976
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:27,488
- Next. - Is it BEBE?

977
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:29,629
I'm really curious to see what BEBE did.

978
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:32,297
Who did BEBE use that you guys know?

979
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:33,427
WeDemBoyz.

980
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:35,027
BEBE danced with WeDemBoyz.

981
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,768
(How did they come up with this combination?)

982
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:37,838
I know what they're after.

983
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,138
The tiger within me?

984
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:40,908
(Maestro Yoon channels the tiger in her.)

985
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,938
We thought they'd dance with a celebrity.

986
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:45,277
They surprisingly didn't use any artists.

987
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:47,379
They don't have that many people either.

988
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,109
That's why I'm curious how they put the stage together.

989
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,478
(BEBE's final rehearsal video)

990
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,548
(Focused)

991
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:56,487
(Tilting her head to the side)

992
00:37:56,488 --> 00:37:58,718
They only used one song with this tempo?

993
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,589
Maybe I looked forward to it too much.

994
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,859
(The fabric performance is the punchline BEBE prepared.)

995
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,499
Why did they add that?

996
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:08,968
It's just there on the floor because they can't remove it.

997
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:10,899
I hate that.

998
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:13,237
That was a fatal mistake.

999
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:15,208
It makes me cringe.

1000
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,508
It's like I watched a music video.

1001
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:19,979
It isn't right for the Mega Crew Mission.

1002
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:22,618
There weren't any interesting points,

1003
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,578
nor were the props smart.

1004
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:25,848
BEBE will drop down.

1005
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,718
This makes me want to do even better.

1006
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:29,559
I see we have a strong chance of winning.

1007
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:31,089
- Who is next? - Next.

1008
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:32,887
It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1009
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:33,987
(JAM REPUBLIC, who chose the outdoor concept)

1010
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:35,927
- I really wanted to see this. - Wait a second.

1011
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:38,328
I need to take a deep breath before watching theirs.

1012
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:39,468
She's coming.

1013
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:40,668
If they do well with 26 people,

1014
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:42,938
I won't ever say anything bad about them.

1015
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:45,439
(JAM REPUBLIC's final rehearsal video)

1016
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:47,908
They have too few dancers.

1017
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,479
(Silence)

1018
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,309
They don't change the form to the end.

1019
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:57,479
They didn't change it at all from beginning to end.

1020
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:59,848
It's more like a medley than one whole performance.

1021
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:01,819
It screams, "I am the director."

1022
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,358
This...

1023
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,117
- makes me upset. - Right?

1024
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:08,228
We tried so hard,

1025
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,289
but I don't see that in them.

1026
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,729
I must've looked forward to it too much because of the Royal Family.

1027
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:12,898
(Nodding)

1028
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,728
Depending on how Deep N Dap does,

1029
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:18,197
my feedback on JAM REPUBLIC can change.

1030
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:19,609
- This is a huge contrast. - Right.

1031
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,169
- Are we watching Deep N Dap? - Yes.

1032
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:23,608
(Deep N Dap's final rehearsal video)

1033
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:25,638
They gave it a Korean touch.

1034
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,748
Look at the hat. They did a traditional theme.

1035
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:28,907
I knew it.

1036
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,078
- They should. - Who is that?

1037
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:32,718
- I love it. - This is nice.

1038
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:36,959
- It's SinB. - It's SinB.

1039
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:39,658
SinB danced quite a lot.

1040
00:39:39,988 --> 00:39:42,589
- It's Hyojin. - It's Hyojin.

1041
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:44,658
Hyojin sticks out.

1042
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,499
She's good.

1043
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:48,097
Hyojin is good at things like that.

1044
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,938
She looks like a true scholar.

1045
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:52,038
They're going to do this outdoors?

1046
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,137
- That would be so nice. - Yes.

1047
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,838
- I got goosebumps. - It's so nice.

1048
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,839
I love the structure. It's solid.

1049
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:58,508
I love it.

1050
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:00,048
- It goes so well with the song. - Yes, it does.

1051
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:02,078
- You know what? - What?

1052
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:03,519
- They might beat JAM REPUBLIC? - Yes.

1053
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:05,547
I expected them to get eliminated, but they're still here.

1054
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,689
I know.

1055
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:08,249
Imagine this were a real structure.

1056
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:12,289
- It would be so impressive. - Right.

1057
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:14,028
Is it 1MILLION versus MANNEQUEEN?

1058
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,527
(Mega Crew Final Rehearsal, 1MILLION)

1059
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:17,498
- A hundred. - I'm so curious how they'll do it.

1060
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,758
They brought a whole class.

1061
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,069
It's the biggest group.

1062
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:22,428
(1MILLION's final rehearsal video)

1063
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:23,798
I'm nervous.

1064
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:30,907
(The highlight where they depict a lotus flower)

1065
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,808
(Gasping)

1066
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:33,907
It's beautiful.

1067
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:35,008
Isn't this a year-end performance?

1068
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:37,947
There are 100 people moving,

1069
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:40,418
- but it isn't that messy. - No, it isn't.

1070
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:41,948
But it does make me dizzy.

1071
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:43,487
I don't know where to look.

1072
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:44,959
I especially felt that at the end.

1073
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:46,559
We're down to the last crew, right?

1074
00:40:46,629 --> 00:40:47,788
- MANNEQUEEN. - MANNEQUEEN.

1075
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:48,789
MANNEQUEEN.

1076
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,728
(MANNEQUEEN, the last crew of the interim check)

1077
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:52,129
(Looking forward to it)

1078
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:54,097
I can't wait to see MANNEQUEEN.

1079
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,768
Yoonji will plant her feet on the ground and twist her hands.

1080
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:56,898
(Channelling MANNEQUEEN)

1081
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:57,899
(So funny)

1082
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,338
(She becomes MANNEQUEEN.)

1083
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:00,637
After that, it's Redlic's turn.

1084
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:01,708
(Doing a wave)

1085
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,007
(Totally immersed)

1086
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,677
(MANNEQUEEN's final rehearsal video)

1087
00:41:05,678 --> 00:41:07,209
It's so clean.

1088
00:41:07,408 --> 00:41:09,448
The musicality is so cool.

1089
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:11,117
Honestly, it's obvious,

1090
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:12,678
but it looks so good.

1091
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:15,548
(Lip J is in the center showing off flashy waacking moves.)

1092
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:16,959
It's Lip J.

1093
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,519
- Gosh. - Lip J.

1094
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:21,157
- Lip J amazingly draws you in. - Right.

1095
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:22,758
I love Lip J so much.

1096
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:24,859
- It's what you mentioned earlier. - Right?

1097
00:41:25,328 --> 00:41:26,568
(Thinking)

1098
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:27,928
Why is it so chaotic?

1099
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,868
Look at that.

1100
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:31,468
Look how they left the stage.

1101
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,868
I don't know what to say.

1102
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:34,169
The crawling show!

1103
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,378
(Krumping is another highlight of MANNEQUEEN's mega crew.)

1104
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:38,538
- Krumping? - Krumping.

1105
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,809
They must be changing the vibe.

1106
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:41,448
(What?)

1107
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:42,809
That came out of nowhere.

1108
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:44,519
Adding krumping...

1109
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,487
- Was it necessary? - seems...

1110
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,288
like too much.

1111
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:49,757
They were too considerate of Buckey.

1112
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:51,418
I honestly looked forward to their performance.

1113
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:52,757
- I really did too. - This is wrong.

1114
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:56,157
Shouldn't we guess the crew that will be eliminated?

1115
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:58,158
Okay. Which team does MANNEQUEEN think will be eliminated?

1116
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:00,398
BEBE was so different from what we imagined.

1117
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:02,068
You're right. They were totally different.

1118
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:03,438
Are we going to go with this crew?

1119
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:05,798
- Yes, it's decided. - It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1120
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:08,108
I couldn't see any hard work.

1121
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,039
You're right. They didn't put much thought into it.

1122
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:11,208
Compared to their competence.

1123
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:12,879
They didn't put much thought into it although they're capable.

1124
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,617
- Team to be eliminated. - Team to be eliminated?

1125
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,618
Let's see.

1126
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:18,878
Who is it?

1127
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:21,318
(Which crew received the most votes and surprised everyone?)

1128
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:22,447
- What? - What?

1129
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:23,818
(Which crew received the most votes and surprised everyone?)

1130
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,487
They received the most votes.

1131
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:27,959
I don't want to open it, but I will.

1132
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:29,657
(BEBE received the most votes as the crew expected to be eliminated.)

1133
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:31,398
It looked more like a proposal video...

1134
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:32,868
than a mega crew performance.

1135
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,269
(BEBE was chosen by everyone as the crew expected to go home.)

1136
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:39,069
All the crews think we will be eliminated.

1137
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:41,407
We believed in our performance,

1138
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:44,638
but it could've seemed like the wrong choice for others.

1139
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:47,178
(Bada is deep in thought at the shocking result.)

1140
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:50,419
(Mega Crew Mission Result Announcement Day)

1141
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:52,717
Oh, my gosh.

1142
00:42:52,718 --> 00:42:54,047
We are back.

1143
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:55,649
We're back in the game.

1144
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,218
It's finally the day of the Mega Crew Mission result announcement.

1145
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,558
Do you think we'll compete in the Elimination Battle?

1146
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,189
We are always last.

1147
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:05,527
Our Jammies, did you vote for us?

1148
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:08,328
We're not ready to go home. Please.

1149
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:10,999
Don't you think the Mega Crew stage will be interesting this time?

1150
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:12,698
I expect various things from everyone.

1151
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,038
- Hello. - Hello.

1152
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,938
- Hello. - Look who's here.

1153
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,578
(A special judge to evaluate the crews with them)

1154
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:18,737
(The Mega Crew Mission was a surprise.)

1155
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,448
(But there was something even more shocking.)

1156
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:22,209
(World-famous dancer Rie Hata)

1157
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:23,879
This is an honour.

1158
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:25,149
(Another special judge, a familiar face)

1159
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,617
- Monika. - How are you?

1160
00:43:26,618 --> 00:43:27,718
Good.

1161
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:29,758
(Hook, the genius in powerful performances)

1162
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,318
(The leader of Hook)

1163
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,059
(Aiki)

1164
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:36,297
Let's all judge carefully.

1165
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:37,797
Let's do this well.

1166
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:39,628
- Okay. - We're ready.

1167
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:40,928
I think this will be fun.

1168
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:44,668
(This is where the Mega Crew Mission result will be announced.)

1169
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:49,508
(And this is where the second Elimination Battle will take place.)

1170
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:52,138
(Which two crews will compete in the Elimination Battle?)

1171
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:54,708
- Oh, man. - Oh my gosh.

1172
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:56,108
(The 7 crews enter the fight zone for the result announcement.)

1173
00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:57,848
(Slightly intimidated)

1174
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:59,618
I am 100 percent nervous.

1175
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:01,148
- It's scary here. - Is it?

1176
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:02,318
The floor is nice.

1177
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,559
- Battlers test the floor first. - It's nice.

1178
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,729
They don't look nervous.

1179
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:09,258
They don't have to be, since they got many views.

1180
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,698
I'm so nervous. Aren't you?

1181
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:13,098
Here he comes.

1182
00:44:13,368 --> 00:44:15,528
(Welcome!)

1183
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:18,498
Hello, I am Kang Daniel,

1184
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,407
the MC of Street Woman Fighter 2.

1185
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,637
(It's good to see you.)

1186
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:25,737
The Mega Crew Mission, the signature mission...

1187
00:44:25,738 --> 00:44:27,709
of Mnet's original dance series, has come to an end.

1188
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:30,618
However, out of the seven crews here,

1189
00:44:30,649 --> 00:44:32,347
one will be eliminated...

1190
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:34,919
and will have to go home.

1191
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,117
Please let it not be us.

1192
00:44:38,118 --> 00:44:40,658
The fates of the crews will be determined tonight.

1193
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:43,398
Which crew will be eliminated?

1194
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:45,027
It won't be us.

1195
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:46,399
You don't know that.

1196
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:48,097
We came this far.

1197
00:44:48,098 --> 00:44:49,197
I'd hate to go home.

1198
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:51,769
I won't give up hope to the end.

1199
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:53,569
The 500 points of the fight judges...

1200
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,378
and 500 points of the on-line public evaluation points...

1201
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:59,408
will be added up to a total of 1,000 points.

1202
00:44:59,508 --> 00:45:01,978
The crew in 1st place will receive 500 points,

1203
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:05,777
and points will be distributed to the rest according to the rankings.

1204
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:07,588
The four fight judges...

1205
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:09,487
watched the crews' performance videos...

1206
00:45:09,488 --> 00:45:12,519
and gave each of the three directors separate points.

1207
00:45:12,618 --> 00:45:14,887
There are additional points for each concept.

1208
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:17,827
The fight judges compared the performance videos...

1209
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:19,427
of the crews that chose the same concept.

1210
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:22,398
They chose one crew that used the concept best...

1211
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:24,939
and gave the crew an additional 100 points.

1212
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:27,438
- Concept points. - I hope we got it.

1213
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:30,938
- We need the 100 points. - It's a must.

1214
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,538
The online public evaluation points...

1215
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:36,519
were added up through the official Mnet platform...

1216
00:45:36,718 --> 00:45:39,248
of Street Woman Fighter 2 and Mnet Plus...

1217
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:41,888
from midnight on September 10 to midnight on September 19.

1218
00:45:42,149 --> 00:45:45,987
Since Street Woman Fighter 2 is loved throughout the globe,

1219
00:45:45,988 --> 00:45:47,927
many people participated in voting.

1220
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:50,858
All 7 crews got over 2 million views.

1221
00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:56,327
It added up to 26,690,752 views.

1222
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:58,839
- Gosh. - Within a week.

1223
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,308
Also, right after the videos were uploaded,

1224
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:04,708
they became the top 1 to 3 most popular videos.

1225
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:08,248
It was the highest record of all seasons.

1226
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:10,077
(Feeling proud)

1227
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:11,118
Highest.

1228
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:13,447
Slay.

1229
00:46:13,448 --> 00:46:15,117
There is a crew...

1230
00:46:15,118 --> 00:46:17,757
that got the highest number of views.

1231
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:18,818
It is 1MILLION.

1232
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,629
- Good job. - Good job.

1233
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:21,959
They were so cool.

1234
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:25,197
It's a result we didn't even imagine.

1235
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:27,568
We contemplated while we performed,

1236
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:31,797
wondering if our performance was one many people could relate to.

1237
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:36,308
We were so surprised to see all the positive feedback.

1238
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:41,809
I'd like to thank my crew and the 100 dancers that helped us.

1239
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:44,718
(Congratulations, 1MILLION!)

1240
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:46,117
Lucky.

1241
00:46:46,118 --> 00:46:49,319
The only thing revealed is the number of views.

1242
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,288
The "likes" and votes...

1243
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:54,628
aren't always in proportion to the number of views.

1244
00:46:54,629 --> 00:46:57,228
We still have to find out the fight judges' points,

1245
00:46:57,229 --> 00:46:59,628
concept additional points, the number of "likes..."

1246
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:01,568
by the online public and votes.

1247
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,768
Watch to the end to find out the result.

1248
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:06,569
- We really can't tell. - No, we can't.

1249
00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:10,007
We will now reveal the fight judges' points...

1250
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:12,208
of Deep N Dap and JAM REPUBLIC,

1251
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:14,577
who chose the outdoor concept.

1252
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:17,077
- What? - No.

1253
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:19,918
Deep N Dap must've gone through a lot of trouble...

1254
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:21,318
shooting outdoors in the summer heat.

1255
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:24,518
However, I heard there was a bigger problem than the weather.

1256
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:27,588
I heard you stopped the camera in the middle of practice.

1257
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:29,428
What happened?

1258
00:47:29,689 --> 00:47:31,459
- What is it? - They stopped shooting?

1259
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,269
We...

1260
00:47:35,928 --> 00:47:37,368
Well...

1261
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:41,968
(Remembering the process, Mina Myoung isn't able to talk.)

1262
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:45,879
It must've been emotionally tough.

1263
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:49,078
No. Don't cry.

1264
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,277
Can you hand me my sunglasses?

1265
00:47:51,278 --> 00:47:52,578
(Mina Myoung, the queen of surprises)

1266
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:54,988
She brought sunglasses today.

1267
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,249
I don't believe it.

1268
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:58,118
Good job.

1269
00:47:58,888 --> 00:47:59,958
(JAM REPUBLIC bursts into laughter as well.)

1270
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:00,959
I'm crying.

1271
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:03,728
In order to carry out the mission...

1272
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:05,629
(Not even the sunglasses can stop the tears of their leader.)

1273
00:48:05,658 --> 00:48:06,928
I'm sorry.

1274
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:09,629
(Something seems weird with Deep N Dap.)

1275
00:48:11,738 --> 00:48:14,838
Frankly, after watching Downy yesterday,

1276
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:17,808
I wondered if we should change the director for the first time.

1277
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,979
Also, JJ is stubborn.

1278
00:48:20,008 --> 00:48:21,978
I was wondering if I should change both.

1279
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:24,879
(Is Deep N Dap facing a part director change?)

1280
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,379
Can I step out for a moment?

1281
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:34,629
I want to quit.

1282
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:37,928
(What made leader Mina Myoung crumble?)

1283
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,859
Let's give it a try.

1284
00:48:40,468 --> 00:48:42,867
Downy was in charge of Part One.

1285
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:45,298
Three, four. That was the wrong direction. Try again.

1286
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:47,438
We'll have these three in the front try again.

1287
00:48:47,439 --> 00:48:51,108
Because I majored in Korean dance,

1288
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:54,277
I believe I should do a good job in this performance.

1289
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:56,148
Do you see my notes falling apart?

1290
00:48:56,149 --> 00:48:58,478
I write everything down in detail at every practice.

1291
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,248
I didn't sleep...

1292
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:01,488
and tried my best.

1293
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:05,559
(Chaos)

1294
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:07,058
There is no one to lift here.

1295
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,089
What?

1296
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:12,528
(Downy sensed something was going wrong.)

1297
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:14,327
One, two, three, four, five.

1298
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:15,867
- You need one more person. - Yes.

1299
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:18,069
One, two, three, four, five, six. We're missing one person.

1300
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:19,899
Do you know where your place is?

1301
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:26,178
(She tries to understand the situation and fix it.)

1302
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:29,709
(They aren't able to get back to practice.)

1303
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:31,178
I'm so confused.

1304
00:49:31,419 --> 00:49:32,947
I lacked experience in directing,

1305
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:34,387
so it didn't go as I expected.

1306
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,448
Is this your place?

1307
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,688
I thought a certain person was in her place,

1308
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:39,758
but she wasn't.

1309
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:41,827
It didn't go as I hoped it would.

1310
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,498
When we were creating a formation,

1311
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:45,327
it was total chaos.

1312
00:49:45,328 --> 00:49:47,468
Four, five, yes.

1313
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,697
When we change positions,

1314
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:52,539
I have to move to the back, but we're in each other's way.

1315
00:49:52,738 --> 00:49:55,039
(Flustered)

1316
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:58,777
Give me a second.

1317
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:00,407
(The helper dancers get more and more exhausted.)

1318
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:01,748
We had a time limit...

1319
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,478
but were stuck on the first part.

1320
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:05,117
I felt frustrated,

1321
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:06,748
and decided we couldn't keep this up.

1322
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:09,288
- How many people are we missing? - We filled them in.

1323
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:10,359
Did you fill in for everyone?

1324
00:50:10,819 --> 00:50:12,689
We're missing three people here.

1325
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:14,658
Who are the other two there?

1326
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:18,297
Where are the dancers that did the traditional dance?

1327
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:22,027
There are people standing outside the formation.

1328
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:24,098
When do they join?

1329
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:25,268
Right now.

1330
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:26,468
(Glancing at each other)

1331
00:50:26,598 --> 00:50:27,768
Two...

1332
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:30,007
Let's have the two of you join the last row.

1333
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:31,278
How many people do you need here?

1334
00:50:31,908 --> 00:50:33,507
I'll organize it for you.

1335
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:35,447
Lockers, raise your hands.

1336
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:36,507
One, two, three.

1337
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:37,947
When do the lockers join the formation?

1338
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:40,348
(Downy isn't able to answer right away.)

1339
00:50:42,888 --> 00:50:45,319
How can you not know that?

1340
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,328
- You should know it. - The lockers?

1341
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:51,058
(Suddenly, there is tension in the air.)

1342
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,898
I was harsh on her...

1343
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:54,498
because we weren't making any progress.

1344
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:56,228
I'm the leader and head director.

1345
00:50:56,229 --> 00:50:58,898
I had to do everything I could to complete the performance.

1346
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:02,168
Getting the maximum result was the most important matter.

1347
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:04,407
Go slow once, then fast once after creating steps. Okay?

1348
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:05,408
- Okay. - Okay.

1349
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:10,177
One, two, three, four, again.

1350
00:51:10,178 --> 00:51:12,118
It isn't symmetrical.

1351
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:14,047
Mina sounds harsh when she speaks.

1352
00:51:14,048 --> 00:51:15,518
When I was watching Downy,

1353
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:18,358
I was worried, thinking the pressure...

1354
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,519
would be too much for her to handle.

1355
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:22,128
(Deep N Dap is gathered together.)

1356
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:23,428
I have something to say.

1357
00:51:23,928 --> 00:51:26,868
One thing I felt during practice...

1358
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:30,539
was that Mina was a bit harsh when talking.

1359
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:32,398
We were flustered,

1360
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:34,708
and it was even worse for the other dancers.

1361
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:35,938
Also,

1362
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,108
I personally didn't feel like you trusted us.

1363
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:40,277
- Right. - So,

1364
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:42,208
I realized that we lacked trust...

1365
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:44,278
and that we were in a critical situation.

1366
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:46,577
I want to ask you this.

1367
00:51:46,578 --> 00:51:48,819
Have you had faith in me since the beginning?

1368
00:51:50,618 --> 00:51:53,158
Because I felt zero trust from you.

1369
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,827
I give you a comment...

1370
00:51:57,828 --> 00:51:59,998
or ask you to change something,

1371
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,467
you say, "I'll change that later," and go...

1372
00:52:01,468 --> 00:52:02,828
when I'm not even done.

1373
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:06,069
Isn't it better to have Hyojin come...

1374
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:09,538
- from behind? - That's the first part.

1375
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:10,678
Yes, it is.

1376
00:52:10,738 --> 00:52:13,109
Let's check it out and push that back.

1377
00:52:13,678 --> 00:52:15,478
Will you be able to see it? Stand on top of that.

1378
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,118
I just want to remember where they are.

1379
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:21,888
(Mina felt that she was leading the practice all by herself.)

1380
00:52:22,118 --> 00:52:23,818
"Why does she keep saying no to me?"

1381
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,058
That repeated,

1382
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,358
and I thought, "Does she dislike me?"

1383
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:28,428
Or, "Doesn't she trust me?"

1384
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:31,458
"I'm no longer a respected teacher."

1385
00:52:31,459 --> 00:52:33,968
"You don't see me as a teacher anymore."

1386
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:39,198
Can I step out for a minute?

1387
00:52:40,939 --> 00:52:44,438
(Mina leaves as they're talking about their emotions.)

1388
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:46,848
(JJ is deep in thought after listening to the leader.)

1389
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,919
I want to stop.

1390
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:58,289
(She ends up bursting into tears.)

1391
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:05,629
I've been choosing the positions for you.

1392
00:53:05,758 --> 00:53:08,729
I used to have other people tell me what to do,

1393
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:13,238
and I tried not to show you what I was feeling.

1394
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:15,108
But as the leader...

1395
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,939
and the general manager, I had to play the part.

1396
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:21,379
I'm not sure what to do.

1397
00:53:23,008 --> 00:53:24,419
I'm...

1398
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:26,448
so sorry.

1399
00:53:26,618 --> 00:53:29,547
You have a lot on your shoulders,

1400
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:30,887
and I feel that.

1401
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:32,617
I was trying to share the burden...

1402
00:53:32,618 --> 00:53:36,487
by quickly deciding what to do and show you the completed version.

1403
00:53:36,488 --> 00:53:38,298
I thought that would help you lessen the burden.

1404
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:39,858
Why don't we speed it up a bit?

1405
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:41,427
(JJ wanted to lessen the leader's burden...)

1406
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:43,027
(by leading the practice as much as she could.)

1407
00:53:43,028 --> 00:53:44,797
I only wanted to do better,

1408
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:46,538
but I was all over the place.

1409
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:48,538
I realized that it could lead to a misunderstanding...

1410
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,578
and I was making it so.

1411
00:53:50,678 --> 00:53:53,178
I had no intention to disrespect you.

1412
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:54,649
I'll...

1413
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,348
put on lighter makeup.

1414
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:00,887
We should have talked to each other,

1415
00:54:00,888 --> 00:54:03,519
but we couldn't, which led to this.

1416
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:06,088
I'm so glad that we talked today.

1417
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:07,388
I think it was necessary.

1418
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:09,487
Gather up, everyone!

1419
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:10,558
(The mega crew members are here early in the morning.)

1420
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,927
I've been a little sensitive in the last few days,

1421
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:14,769
so I'd like to apologize.

1422
00:54:14,828 --> 00:54:16,028
I'm not that intimidating.

1423
00:54:16,098 --> 00:54:17,338
I'll calm down.

1424
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:18,569
Sorry!

1425
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:19,998
Sorry, everyone.

1426
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,209
(Mina breaks the ice by apologizing.)

1427
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:24,208
(Deep N Dap and the mega crew continue practicing as one.)

1428
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:25,209
Too fast?

1429
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,709
- Yes. - That was way too fast.

1430
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:30,077
The atmosphere has eased off.

1431
00:54:30,078 --> 00:54:32,819
- Let's try the standing formation. - Okay.

1432
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:35,217
We were able to communicate more freely.

1433
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,718
I learned how to be a team.

1434
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:41,628
It was a process of seven people becoming one.

1435
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:43,697
No matter how well the leader leads the team,

1436
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:45,228
nothing matters...

1437
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:46,427
unless the teammates have your back.

1438
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:47,899
That was the biggest lesson I got.

1439
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:49,628
(The day of the shoot for the outdoor theme)

1440
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:51,868
(Let's go, Deep N Dap!)

1441
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:55,668
We got the outdoor theme, so we had a lot to keep track of.

1442
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:58,137
It was a dirt ground,

1443
00:54:58,138 --> 00:54:59,737
so it was tiring during the shoot.

1444
00:54:59,738 --> 00:55:01,109
Some people were injured.

1445
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:02,408
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1446
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:05,548
Brush the back of the person next to you.

1447
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:06,878
- How about your back? - I...

1448
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:07,918
(They all worked hard under the sun.)

1449
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:09,588
Though it was exhausting,

1450
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:11,919
they all helped without losing the power.

1451
00:55:11,988 --> 00:55:14,927
I was deeply touched.

1452
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:18,498
The helpers did all the work.

1453
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:21,368
I appreciate them for following our lead so well.

1454
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:23,298
And I want to thank the crew members.

1455
00:55:23,399 --> 00:55:27,508
I was grateful for everything in this mission.

1456
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:30,268
Now, we will watch...

1457
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,637
the mega crew video of Deep N Dap.

1458
00:55:33,638 --> 00:55:35,077
(Let's go, Deep N Dap.)

1459
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:36,448
Let's go.

1460
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:38,118
(Crying)

1461
00:55:38,379 --> 00:55:39,548
Don't cry.

1462
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:42,318
Why is she crying?

1463
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,117
I'm crying already.

1464
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:45,118
Shall we?

1465
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,859
I'm looking forward to the location of the outdoor theme.

1466
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:49,527
It's an American crew against a Korean crew.

1467
00:55:49,528 --> 00:55:50,598
This is interesting.

1468
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:51,928
(Excited)

1469
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,928
(Mega Crew Mission, Deep N Dap)

1470
00:56:07,348 --> 00:56:09,109
Let's go!

1471
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:10,309
It's alluring.

1472
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,078
Looking good!

1473
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:13,277
Let's do this.

1474
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:17,419
(Intro, "No One," "Court Musicians" choreographed by Deep N Dap)

1475
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:19,688
(Deep N Dap's theme: They applied their desire for dance...)

1476
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:21,628
(to an invisible being, and the intense introduction, )

1477
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,228
(which is a reconstitution of a creation by Yi Mae Bang, )

1478
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:24,928
(a holder of the national intangible cultural property.)

1479
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:27,467
That's amazing.

1480
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,368
It's amazing that they actually played the traditional drums.

1481
00:56:29,468 --> 00:56:31,268
(Wailing)

1482
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:32,399
(Goodness)

1483
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:48,589
- The background has its aura. - Right.

1484
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:09,467
Downy!

1485
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,577
(Downy started the performance.)

1486
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:12,339
Gosh. Check out their composition.

1487
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:30,387
I like this part.

1488
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:31,859
That's cool. The back.

1489
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:33,058
I got chills.

1490
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:34,868
It must have been so tough for the helpers.

1491
00:58:07,328 --> 00:58:09,129
- Sister! - Sister!

1492
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:14,069
(She tends to cry when she sees something cool.)

1493
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:38,928
SinB, let's go.

1494
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:47,709
SinB is gorgeous.

1495
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:51,238
Let's go, Minny Park!

1496
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,289
Here we go. Let's get it.

1497
00:59:02,718 --> 00:59:04,718
Here it comes!

1498
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,828
Let's go!

1499
00:59:08,888 --> 00:59:09,888
It's Hyojin.

1500
00:59:09,889 --> 00:59:11,198
Oh, from the last season.

1501
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:18,439
(Having fun)

1502
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:21,808
(They all start dancing.)

1503
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,468
- The mood changes completely. - Right.

1504
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:34,348
She's so good.

1505
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:35,548
I like the structure.

1506
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:41,689
This part is the best.

1507
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:45,229
It's the national flag!

1508
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:47,229
(Showing respect)

1509
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:49,268
It's the yin and yang of the national flag.

1510
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:52,297
(The Korean national flag)

1511
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:53,899
- That was really cool. - That was pretty.

1512
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:08,748
(Go, Locker Zee.)

1513
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:10,289
Let's go, Locker Zee!

1514
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:12,459
Locker Zee!

1515
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:13,718
Let's go!

1516
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:15,589
Go, Locker Zee!

1517
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:26,367
JJ!

1518
01:00:26,368 --> 01:00:27,539
Amazing.

1519
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,108
JJ!

1520
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:30,169
(I'm shy.)

1521
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,327
Well done!

1522
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:56,129
It must have been tough to dance outdoors.

1523
01:00:56,298 --> 01:00:58,238
(Thanking them vigorously)

1524
01:00:58,368 --> 01:00:59,898
Nice.

1525
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:00,968
That was nice.

1526
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:02,769
(The fight judges' evaluation)

1527
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:03,839
It looks like a music video.

1528
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,178
It's a fun choreography.

1529
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:08,648
- Could it be Hyojin! It is! - No way.

1530
01:01:08,649 --> 01:01:10,918
- Oh, my. She's good. - Hyojin!

1531
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:13,048
- She's so good. - All right!

1532
01:01:13,149 --> 01:01:15,419
She's a lot better than on Season One.

1533
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,388
Dancing on dirt must have been...

1534
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:20,927
tougher than it seems. They could have fallen.

1535
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:24,028
Props to the dancers for going through that.

1536
01:01:24,198 --> 01:01:28,229
I'll announce the fight judges' scores of Deep N Dap.

1537
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:31,137
(Outdoor Theme, Points by Fight Judges)

1538
01:01:31,138 --> 01:01:32,197
(That's insane.)

1539
01:01:32,198 --> 01:01:33,569
They show us right away?

1540
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:37,238
Gosh. Please help.

1541
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:38,677
I think they'll get a high score.

1542
01:01:38,678 --> 01:01:40,608
- Yes, overall. - I agree.

1543
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:41,808
They did so well.

1544
01:01:41,809 --> 01:01:43,248
They pulled off the outdoor theme...

1545
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:44,649
as a mega crew.

1546
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:46,249
My heart is beating...

1547
01:01:46,379 --> 01:01:48,218
- so fast. - I'm shaking.

1548
01:01:48,419 --> 01:01:49,819
Why am I so nervous?

1549
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:51,388
(Trembling)

1550
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:52,988
I feel sick.

1551
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:55,059
Please.

1552
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:58,798
(What's Deep N Dap's score from the fight judges?)

1553
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:02,399
(Out of 400 points for each part director)

1554
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:04,939
Well done.

1555
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:07,568
Well done!

1556
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:09,039
Oh, my days.

1557
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:11,578
JJ has the highest score.

1558
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:12,979
JJ!

1559
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,609
Downy!

1560
01:02:14,908 --> 01:02:16,578
Great job!

1561
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:18,847
- Good work, - Well done, guys.

1562
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:20,748
Deep N Dap's total score from the fight judges...

1563
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:24,257
is 1,076 out of 1,200.

1564
01:02:24,258 --> 01:02:25,958
- That's high. - That doesn't sound so bad.

1565
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:27,387
Right. It's not so bad.

1566
01:02:27,388 --> 01:02:28,458
It wasn't too bad.

1567
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:32,427
I was convinced that the directors would get at least 350 points,

1568
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:34,058
and we were off to a smooth start.

1569
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:35,597
We don't know how the other teams did.

1570
01:02:35,598 --> 01:02:36,968
They may be higher than them.

1571
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:41,737
I gave Part A, Downy's part, the lowest score.

1572
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:43,938
I think the opening could have been better.

1573
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:47,608
To show us the theme more clearly and more intensely,

1574
01:02:47,609 --> 01:02:49,208
she could have done it differently.

1575
01:02:49,209 --> 01:02:51,518
I think a lot of them were predictable.

1576
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:52,648
So, it could have been better.

1577
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:55,148
I personally like JJ's part the best.

1578
01:02:55,149 --> 01:02:57,418
It was a proper ending.

1579
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:58,887
The ending deserves praise.

1580
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:01,887
JJ, during this mission,

1581
01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:03,658
were there any regrets?

1582
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:06,498
I don't have any regrets.

1583
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:09,027
I'm satisfied that I could realize...

1584
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:12,697
what kind of crew Deep N Dap was through this mission.

1585
01:03:12,698 --> 01:03:13,998
And our work was the best.

1586
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,569
Awesome!

1587
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:18,077
Great.

1588
01:03:18,078 --> 01:03:19,637
But this is not the end.

1589
01:03:19,638 --> 01:03:22,148
The extra points for each team remain.

1590
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:26,047
By competing with JAM REPUBLIC, the crew that chose the same theme,

1591
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:30,047
which crew will take the 100 extra points?

1592
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:31,157
That's huge.

1593
01:03:31,158 --> 01:03:33,189
We have a winning chance if we beat them.

1594
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:36,827
Next, JAM REPUBLIC has chosen the outdoor theme with Deep N Dap.

1595
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:40,528
Here's the score from the fight judges.

1596
01:03:40,598 --> 01:03:41,967
It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1597
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:43,569
- I wonder what they got. - Right.

1598
01:03:43,598 --> 01:03:45,169
I am curious.

1599
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:46,598
We have high expectations.

1600
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:50,168
JAM REPUBLIC's Mega Crew Mission was...

1601
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:53,439
what I was looking forward to the most.

1602
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:56,248
But if it doesn't satisfy my expectations,

1603
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,379
I may be even more disappointed.

1604
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:02,447
I think this challenge was very challenging for us...

1605
01:04:02,448 --> 01:04:04,618
as the whole JAM REPUBLIC.

1606
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:06,319
And...

1607
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:12,798
(Kirsten sheds tears all of a sudden.)

1608
01:04:12,899 --> 01:04:14,129
I think she's crying.

1609
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:15,569
Kirsten is crying?

1610
01:04:16,129 --> 01:04:19,939
(Everyone is surprised by her tears.)

1611
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:21,467
Don't cry.

1612
01:04:21,468 --> 01:04:23,109
(Sobbing)

1613
01:04:23,368 --> 01:04:25,109
I never expected Kirsten to show tears.

1614
01:04:25,879 --> 01:04:28,609
(What happened to JAM REPUBLIC?)

1615
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:30,278
(New Zealand)

1616
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:33,379
(JAM REPUBLIC went to New Zealand to film the Mega Crew Mission.)

1617
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:35,947
I am so excited to show...

1618
01:04:35,948 --> 01:04:37,959
how beautiful New Zealand is.

1619
01:04:39,419 --> 01:04:43,059
(The place that has the beauty of nature)

1620
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:49,999
(New Zealand is where you can be overwhelmed by Mother Nature.)

1621
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:53,338
(They chose Piha Beach as their filming site...)

1622
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:56,508
(for the Mega Crew Mission.)

1623
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:59,479
(But...)

1624
01:05:00,678 --> 01:05:03,209
Guys, we are doomed.

1625
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:07,749
The sandstorm and the winds were crazy.

1626
01:05:08,048 --> 01:05:10,818
Currently, we're in winter,

1627
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:13,758
so the weather is not helping us.

1628
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,558
We weren't going to be able to use Piha Beach.

1629
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:17,927
We're very stressed...

1630
01:05:17,928 --> 01:05:20,257
because we had all mapped out...

1631
01:05:20,258 --> 01:05:22,967
the water, the sand, and the hills.

1632
01:05:22,968 --> 01:05:24,398
I don't know what to do.

1633
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:26,138
(They must change everything, the location to the composition.)

1634
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:28,368
What else is like New Zealand?

1635
01:05:28,669 --> 01:05:30,237
You guys...

1636
01:05:30,238 --> 01:05:32,008
You guys have always been good at rugby.

1637
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:33,808
Oh, yes!

1638
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:37,208
Rugby is the most celebrated sport here in New Zealand.

1639
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:38,918
It's our pride and our joy.

1640
01:05:38,919 --> 01:05:41,048
On a rugby stadium would be really cool.

1641
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:42,149
(JAM REPUBLIC checks out a rugby field.)

1642
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,289
Aye, captain.

1643
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:46,088
- Aye, aye. - Thank goodness for these jackets.

1644
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:47,729
These jackets are fly.

1645
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:49,629
This is made for New Zealand.

1646
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:53,059
The sun sets as the pre-game starts.

1647
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:55,098
The track would be like the game.

1648
01:05:55,428 --> 01:05:58,138
And in a victory dance when we win the game.

1649
01:05:58,368 --> 01:05:59,968
That storyline...

1650
01:06:00,098 --> 01:06:03,638
I just really knew that it was a strong storyline.

1651
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,907
And one. Go.

1652
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:09,848
(JAM REPUBLIC starts practicing with the helpers.)

1653
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,278
Yes. Dope.

1654
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:15,988
We're going to need more people.

1655
01:06:16,448 --> 01:06:19,717
The biggest difficulty we had to overcome...

1656
01:06:19,718 --> 01:06:21,589
was a lack of dancers.

1657
01:06:21,689 --> 01:06:22,689
(The announcement of the rules for the Mega Crew Mission)

1658
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:23,927
A mega crew must consist...

1659
01:06:23,928 --> 01:06:26,098
of 30 or more dancers, including the crew members.

1660
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:27,898
We've reached out to everyone.

1661
01:06:27,899 --> 01:06:30,197
I reached out to my people,

1662
01:06:30,198 --> 01:06:31,998
Ling reached out to her people.

1663
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,367
Emma had her sister, Shontelle,

1664
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:36,039
come and dance together as a partner.

1665
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:38,137
(The JAM REPUBLIC members posted on social media...)

1666
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,809
(to find helpers for the Mega Crew Mission.)

1667
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:42,048
(However...)

1668
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:44,249
We have 21 sitting right here.

1669
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:48,419
That's 21, 22, 23, 24, 25...

1670
01:06:49,618 --> 01:06:51,189
Is that 26?

1671
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:55,228
At this time, we aimed for more than 30 dancers.

1672
01:06:55,229 --> 01:06:57,458
And unfortunately, it was a tough time...

1673
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:00,197
because of other competitions going on.

1674
01:07:00,198 --> 01:07:01,827
(The dancers in New Zealand couldn't help...)

1675
01:07:01,828 --> 01:07:03,598
(due to other dance competitions.)

1676
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:07,297
So, unfortunately, we didn't reach the 30 mark,

1677
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:09,708
but we will not let that stop us.

1678
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:13,378
I want the audience to feel the story and the power.

1679
01:07:13,379 --> 01:07:17,978
I hope we make it feel like strong women coming together...

1680
01:07:17,979 --> 01:07:21,548
as a bigger group rather than five JAM REPUBLIC girls.

1681
01:07:22,048 --> 01:07:23,749
(The day of the mega crew shoot)

1682
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:27,358
This is going to be broadcast over there...

1683
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,588
and for the whole world to see it.

1684
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:33,559
Again, we just want to showcase home, our strength,

1685
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:36,468
and the power that we have as women.

1686
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:38,039
Just go crazy.

1687
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,538
One, two, three.

1688
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:42,109
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1689
01:07:43,069 --> 01:07:46,439
(The overall director, Kirsten, films her part.)

1690
01:07:46,508 --> 01:07:48,677
(But the dancers are wearing green, which is Deep N Dap's colour?)

1691
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:50,847
(And the helpers are holding Deep N Dap's banners.)

1692
01:07:50,848 --> 01:07:53,648
And because of the theme... It is a game.

1693
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,387
So, we need an opponent team.

1694
01:07:56,388 --> 01:08:01,018
And Deep N Dap is our challenger at this point.

1695
01:08:01,019 --> 01:08:04,358
This is why we chose pink and then green...

1696
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:07,058
so that it could highlight that this is a game...

1697
01:08:07,059 --> 01:08:08,698
and that this is a part of our theme.

1698
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:12,298
(Next, it's Emma's second part as a director.)

1699
01:08:12,598 --> 01:08:15,568
I don't have as much experience as others...

1700
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:18,909
especially in directing a dance video clip.

1701
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:21,178
Could I have a go into how we get here?

1702
01:08:21,548 --> 01:08:22,708
Or didn't we...

1703
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,078
Sorry. My brain's just...

1704
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:27,248
Can I get...

1705
01:08:30,288 --> 01:08:32,058
- I think we'll be fine. - Okay.

1706
01:08:32,059 --> 01:08:33,818
There will be still movements.

1707
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,359
- I think it'll be fine. - Okay.

1708
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:36,858
I have an idea.

1709
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:38,928
And you can pick who you want in for that.

1710
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:41,569
Rather it be what you want...

1711
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:43,997
If I could be there for Emma,

1712
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:47,239
I'm just giving options. I'm giving other thoughts.

1713
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,608
She decides yay or nay.

1714
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:53,478
This is the perfect time for her to take that role...

1715
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,308
and really allow herself.

1716
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:58,079
I trust her vision, as always.

1717
01:08:58,548 --> 01:09:01,348
(The shoot of Emma's part finally begins.)

1718
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:02,848
(At that moment)

1719
01:09:03,918 --> 01:09:06,489
(Kirsten slips and falls while dancing.)

1720
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:10,457
(She continues to dance without stopping.)

1721
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:14,298
(She ends up icing her thumb during the break.)

1722
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:18,798
I caught myself but on my thumb on the wrong hand.

1723
01:09:18,998 --> 01:09:22,008
(The shoot continued after that.)

1724
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:25,678
And I'm her opposite, so I can see her when we're dancing.

1725
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:29,079
The camera wasn't even on her. It was a close shot.

1726
01:09:29,309 --> 01:09:32,348
And she was just going hard.

1727
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:35,319
Even harder than before. I was like...

1728
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:38,688
It was very painful,

1729
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:41,059
and I just had to get through that take.

1730
01:09:41,788 --> 01:09:43,559
I think...

1731
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,228
I think anyone else would do the same thing.

1732
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:50,728
I personally think... If I'm injured,

1733
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:54,269
I'm going to make sure that it's my team at the end of the day,

1734
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:55,769
so...

1735
01:09:57,668 --> 01:10:02,748
I just wanted to give all my power and energy to Emma at that moment.

1736
01:10:03,678 --> 01:10:08,088
(She didn't want to cause trouble to Emma's part.)

1737
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:12,619
I've known Emma for a long time since she was a little girl.

1738
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:17,859
And to see her grow into this strong, powerful woman...

1739
01:10:18,029 --> 01:10:20,659
Seeing her lead other women was very powerful.

1740
01:10:22,329 --> 01:10:25,739
And I wanted to make sure that I was giving my all...

1741
01:10:25,838 --> 01:10:28,369
for Emma and for the group as a whole.

1742
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:33,239
It's a sisterhood thing. It's a crew thing.

1743
01:10:33,678 --> 01:10:34,908
You'll still give your all,

1744
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:38,048
no matter what you're feeling in that moment.

1745
01:10:39,918 --> 01:10:42,287
We did our best with what we could.

1746
01:10:42,288 --> 01:10:44,688
And the obstacles were very challenging.

1747
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:47,087
The location was not what we wanted.

1748
01:10:47,088 --> 01:10:51,029
But with what we had, we did the most we could.

1749
01:10:51,128 --> 01:10:53,058
And thank you to the team...

1750
01:10:53,059 --> 01:10:55,369
that was there with us on that journey.

1751
01:10:55,428 --> 01:10:56,668
I feel bad.

1752
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,069
I can tell that she went through a lot.

1753
01:10:59,598 --> 01:11:02,007
Of the three directors,

1754
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:05,609
let me announce Kirsten's score from the fight judges.

1755
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:06,838
Let's see.

1756
01:11:07,038 --> 01:11:08,609
I think she'll get a high score.

1757
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:12,418
Kirsten's score from the fight judges...

1758
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:15,149
is 382.

1759
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:19,758
(Kirsten got the highest score yet.)

1760
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:20,917
(Surprised)

1761
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:22,388
That's incredibly high.

1762
01:11:22,489 --> 01:11:24,189
That's high.

1763
01:11:24,288 --> 01:11:25,297
It's evaluating...

1764
01:11:25,298 --> 01:11:27,297
the directing capabilities of the part,

1765
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:28,569
- so it makes sense. - Right.

1766
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:33,297
We will now watch JAM REPUBLIC's performance video...

1767
01:11:33,298 --> 01:11:34,838
for the Mega Crew Mission.

1768
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:36,467
- Let's go! - Okay!

1769
01:11:36,468 --> 01:11:38,079
- Hey! - Yes!

1770
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:41,909
(Mega Crew Mission, JAM REPUBLIC)

1771
01:12:00,998 --> 01:12:02,329
(I love it!)

1772
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:03,497
- She's so cool. - Gosh.

1773
01:12:03,498 --> 01:12:04,569
I got goosebumps.

1774
01:12:04,628 --> 01:12:06,498
Is she a 3D character? Seriously.

1775
01:12:06,668 --> 01:12:08,938
("Pass That Dutch," "Czar," "Jele," and "Too Much" by JAM REPUBLIC)

1776
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:10,137
(The concept is the battle between the two crews in the stadium.)

1777
01:12:10,138 --> 01:12:11,268
(It includes their preparation of the battle, the battle itself, )

1778
01:12:11,269 --> 01:12:12,409
(and the celebratory message after their victory.)

1779
01:12:22,748 --> 01:12:23,819
Yes!

1780
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:26,087
- Using the barricades was so cool. - Nice.

1781
01:12:26,088 --> 01:12:28,087
The barricades must have been at their location.

1782
01:12:28,088 --> 01:12:29,989
I think that was a smart move.

1783
01:12:59,659 --> 01:13:02,958
(Getting goosebumps)

1784
01:13:18,878 --> 01:13:20,438
Hey, Emma!

1785
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,748
Emma seems angry.

1786
01:13:21,848 --> 01:13:24,309
(I'm proud of you, Emma!)

1787
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:49,938
Audrey!

1788
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:51,507
(Feeling shy)

1789
01:13:51,508 --> 01:13:52,878
- Let's go. - Audrey.

1790
01:14:38,788 --> 01:14:39,818
(Her mouth drops open.)

1791
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:40,958
What's happening?

1792
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:42,489
Here comes the queen.

1793
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:44,029
She's so cool!

1794
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:45,628
(Amazed)

1795
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,416
(Feeling the music)

1796
01:15:20,556 --> 01:15:22,226
(Shouting in amazement)

1797
01:15:22,355 --> 01:15:25,256
Gosh. They're dancing barefoot. That was the right call to make.

1798
01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:43,904
Gosh, this is insane.

1799
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:45,375
- I love it. - Hey.

1800
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:47,216
(The queen feels proud.)

1801
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:05,565
- Yes. - JAM REPUBLIC!

1802
01:16:07,436 --> 01:16:09,535
(JAM REPUBLIC!)

1803
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:12,535
(Acknowledging)

1804
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:13,876
That was so cool.

1805
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:16,046
Their performance was filled with cool dance routines.

1806
01:16:16,145 --> 01:16:18,815
They didn't have a lot of people, but it looked like they did.

1807
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,516
It didn't look like they didn't have enough dancers.

1808
01:16:20,641 --> 01:16:22,552
(I love it!)

1809
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:25,752
Kirsten is really good.

1810
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:27,922
I think she used the bleachers quite well.

1811
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:31,820
They covered the barricades with banners and dancers popped up.

1812
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:33,122
It was fun to watch.

1813
01:16:33,391 --> 01:16:35,930
For Parts A, B, and C,

1814
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:38,900
JAM REPUBLIC wanted to show us their individual talent.

1815
01:16:38,901 --> 01:16:40,101
So it was really good.

1816
01:16:40,202 --> 01:16:43,302
I wasn't completely sure about this part.

1817
01:16:43,401 --> 01:16:44,632
It didn't bring my excitement to the next level.

1818
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:48,242
I'm sure JAM REPUBLIC could have done something better.

1819
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:50,242
Part B was quite disappointing.

1820
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:54,911
Before I reveal the scores of Directors Emma and LaTrice...

1821
01:16:54,912 --> 01:16:56,211
from the fight judges...

1822
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:57,351
(Before the scores are revealed...)

1823
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:02,350
I must point out that JAM REPUBLIC had...

1824
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:05,922
less than 30 dancers which was 1 of the rules for this mission.

1825
01:17:06,391 --> 01:17:10,662
Therefore, the leader of the crew and the overall director, Kirsten,

1826
01:17:11,132 --> 01:17:14,302
will lose 100 points.

1827
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:16,202
That will be the penalty.

1828
01:17:16,571 --> 01:17:19,640
(Shocked)

1829
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:22,741
(Everyone is shocked.)

1830
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:23,941
A hundred points?

1831
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:25,282
That's way too harsh.

1832
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:26,842
Seriously?

1833
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,211
Really? Look.

1834
01:17:28,212 --> 01:17:30,781
(Kirsten's final score became 282 points.)

1835
01:17:30,782 --> 01:17:31,850
Oh, no.

1836
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:33,151
I feel so awful for her.

1837
01:17:33,552 --> 01:17:35,520
I know what happened to them.

1838
01:17:35,521 --> 01:17:37,320
I feel so bad. My heart breaks for them.

1839
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:38,662
Kirsten must be so disappointed.

1840
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:42,431
I was a bit shocked when they said I lost 100 points.

1841
01:17:42,632 --> 01:17:47,231
Again, it is part of the rules, and we didn't fulfill that.

1842
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:50,172
We'll just have to wait for LaTrice's and Emma's score.

1843
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,841
All right.

1844
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:56,071
I will reveal LaTrice's and Emma's scores from the fight judges.

1845
01:17:56,242 --> 01:17:59,480
(What are their scores?)

1846
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:03,011
(LaTrice: 378 points, Emma: 361 points)

1847
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:04,181
Nice.

1848
01:18:04,282 --> 01:18:05,421
- Nice. - Good job.

1849
01:18:05,422 --> 01:18:07,552
The total score of JAM REPUBLIC from the fight judges...

1850
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:09,221
is 1017 points.

1851
01:18:10,021 --> 01:18:11,291
Their score would've been higher...

1852
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:12,922
- if they didn't lose 100 points. - Right.

1853
01:18:13,462 --> 01:18:17,261
The score difference between the 2 crews is 59 points.

1854
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:18,701
If JAM REPUBLIC were to take...

1855
01:18:18,702 --> 01:18:20,400
the extra points of the outdoor theme,

1856
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:22,701
they would be able to turn the table around.

1857
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:24,702
The extra points will matter a lot now.

1858
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,371
I will now reveal the crew...

1859
01:18:26,372 --> 01:18:28,501
the fight judges chose for the extra points...

1860
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:29,641
of the outdoor theme.

1861
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,311
Please let it be us.

1862
01:18:31,412 --> 01:18:33,842
Don't you think we have a shot?

1863
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:36,981
I think Deep N Dap made the outdoor setting look more interesting.

1864
01:18:37,811 --> 01:18:39,281
The fight judges said their performance suited them well.

1865
01:18:39,282 --> 01:18:41,451
They said Deep N Dap highlighted our traditional elements well.

1866
01:18:41,452 --> 01:18:43,890
(Deep N Dap incorporated the traditional elements...)

1867
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,321
(into their outdoor setting well.)

1868
01:18:47,092 --> 01:18:49,391
I don't know what the result is going to be.

1869
01:18:49,462 --> 01:18:51,532
But I am very nervous.

1870
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,231
Will it be JAM REPUBLIC?

1871
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:54,931
It was more than just a background.

1872
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:56,100
Like they said...

1873
01:18:56,101 --> 01:18:57,501
- They incorporated it. - Right. They incorporated it.

1874
01:18:57,502 --> 01:19:02,041
(JAM REPUBLIC used three different places for different parts.)

1875
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:05,541
(Which one of the crew will win the extra points?)

1876
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:08,810
(Extra points: 100 points, JAM REPUBLIC)

1877
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:10,882
(JAM REPUBLIC won the extra points of the outdoor theme.)

1878
01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:12,082
Gosh. Thank the Lord.

1879
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:13,421
- Really? - Really?

1880
01:19:13,422 --> 01:19:14,650
(Kirsten finally relaxes after winning the extra points.)

1881
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:17,992
Thank goodness.

1882
01:19:18,092 --> 01:19:23,391
(On the other side, Deep N Dap couldn't win the extra points.)

1883
01:19:23,523 --> 01:19:25,922
- Gosh, what a bummer. - Right. What a bummer.

1884
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:29,671
Let's see which crew highlighted the outdoor setting better.

1885
01:19:29,672 --> 01:19:31,931
For Deep N Dap, the palace was behind them.

1886
01:19:32,002 --> 01:19:34,042
- They only danced in front of that. - Right. It was one-dimensional.

1887
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:35,940
But she started from the entrance door.

1888
01:19:35,941 --> 01:19:38,680
She walked up the stairs.

1889
01:19:38,681 --> 01:19:40,141
- And this too. - Yes.

1890
01:19:40,282 --> 01:19:41,841
- Right. - Right.

1891
01:19:41,842 --> 01:19:43,810
I think JAM REPUBLIC...

1892
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:46,282
did a better job at utilizing the outdoor theme.

1893
01:19:46,752 --> 01:19:48,451
I think at this point, it really helped,

1894
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,552
especially having the deductions.

1895
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:51,952
I'm happy with that.

1896
01:19:52,592 --> 01:19:54,962
We're very disappointed that we didn't win the extra points.

1897
01:19:55,122 --> 01:19:59,832
But seeing Kirsten losing 100 points...

1898
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:03,172
didn't make me all that happy.

1899
01:20:03,202 --> 01:20:07,541
Actually, the fact that they took the extra points...

1900
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:10,371
How should I say it? It put us at more ease.

1901
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,712
We lost, but we put up a good fight.

1902
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:14,811
We're happy to battle it out with your crew.

1903
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:16,481
Thank you.

1904
01:20:16,851 --> 01:20:18,081
Well done.

1905
01:20:18,082 --> 01:20:19,121
- Well done. - Well done.

1906
01:20:19,122 --> 01:20:21,151
- We lost, but we did well too. - Totally.

1907
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:22,721
Next,

1908
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:26,691
we have the crews that chose the structure theme.

1909
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:29,060
(Structure Theme Match: MANNEQUEEN versus 1MILLION)

1910
01:20:29,061 --> 01:20:30,861
We'll be watching two amazing performances.

1911
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,301
This match will be a crazy one.

1912
01:20:32,302 --> 01:20:34,430
Oh, my gosh. I didn't watch their video.

1913
01:20:34,431 --> 01:20:36,031
- Really? - I haven't watched it yet.

1914
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:37,231
The intro is quite touching.

1915
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,640
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1916
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:41,070
Funky Y, Yoonji, and Redlic...

1917
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:43,771
were the part directors of MANNEQUEEN.

1918
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:46,810
MANNEQUEEN revised their choreography...

1919
01:20:46,811 --> 01:20:49,010
even the day before the final rehearsal.

1920
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,212
- They were in a pressing situation. - Really?

1921
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:54,181
Actually, we weren't going to use...

1922
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:57,292
the structure for Yoonji's part.

1923
01:20:57,422 --> 01:20:59,221
But we revised the choreography completely.

1924
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:01,721
That must have been a lot of work.

1925
01:21:02,492 --> 01:21:04,731
Then they only had 1 or 2 days to rehearse everything.

1926
01:21:05,231 --> 01:21:06,431
- On the structure? - Right.

1927
01:21:06,632 --> 01:21:07,901
We have to survive.

1928
01:21:08,032 --> 01:21:10,070
The fact that we finished it...

1929
01:21:10,071 --> 01:21:11,071
(What happened to MANNEQUEEN?)

1930
01:21:11,502 --> 01:21:12,741
(Humming)

1931
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:13,871
(The excited first meeting with the structure)

1932
01:21:13,872 --> 01:21:14,971
I'm excited.

1933
01:21:15,002 --> 01:21:16,140
- Ta-Da. - Where is it?

1934
01:21:16,141 --> 01:21:17,212
(Amazed)

1935
01:21:17,912 --> 01:21:19,781
(Huge)

1936
01:21:19,782 --> 01:21:21,441
(Touched)

1937
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:24,180
The concept we had in mind was an orchestra.

1938
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:27,721
Different instruments come together to make one orchestra.

1939
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:30,952
We all specialize in different genres of dancing.

1940
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,220
(The 1st introductory meeting of the 8 crews)

1941
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,221
What's happening?

1942
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:35,391
- What? We're oil and water? - It says, "Oil and water."

1943
01:21:35,492 --> 01:21:37,731
- Most say we don't mix well. - Seriously.

1944
01:21:37,931 --> 01:21:40,230
In the Mega Crew Mission, we'll show we're not oil and water.

1945
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:42,631
We'll use all the different genres at our disposal,

1946
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:46,171
from waacking to krumping and choreo in the middle.

1947
01:21:46,172 --> 01:21:49,641
We'll prove that MANNEQUEEN is the Avengers of the crews.

1948
01:21:49,742 --> 01:21:52,781
We decided to invite some guests...

1949
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:55,241
who can greatly strengthen our performance.

1950
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:57,211
You all know them without any introductions, right?

1951
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,221
- Yes! - Nice to see you all!

1952
01:22:01,181 --> 01:22:03,751
She's a big star...

1953
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,792
born on "Street Woman Fighter."

1954
01:22:06,592 --> 01:22:10,361
We also invited Spella, an expert in tutting.

1955
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:13,962
We invited Spark as well, who's won global krumping contests.

1956
01:22:14,832 --> 01:22:17,172
With these ladies performing,

1957
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,641
we can't be left out.

1958
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:24,672
I just know, even with eyes closed, you'll be doing something like this.

1959
01:22:25,071 --> 01:22:26,980
- Yes. - They feel like a thousand people.

1960
01:22:26,981 --> 01:22:29,451
We'll win this easily with one hand tied behind our backs.

1961
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:31,582
We have one final guest who's very famous.

1962
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:34,321
This is our hidden member.

1963
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:35,421
(MANNEQUEEN's hidden member is aespa's WINTER?)

1964
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:36,691
I'll work hard.

1965
01:22:37,122 --> 01:22:38,291
(While recruiting helper dancers)

1966
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:39,821
I want to hear her voice too.

1967
01:22:40,391 --> 01:22:41,391
Hello?

1968
01:22:41,392 --> 01:22:42,430
(Going wild)

1969
01:22:42,431 --> 01:22:43,532
Just a minute.

1970
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:44,792
What's going on?

1971
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:47,962
Do you know I'm filming for Street Woman Fighter 2?

1972
01:22:48,502 --> 01:22:50,301
Of course, I do. Everyone's going crazy over it.

1973
01:22:50,302 --> 01:22:51,770
Of course.

1974
01:22:51,771 --> 01:22:54,042
- WINTER! - Nice to meet you!

1975
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:58,440
(She's friends with Redlic, who is aespa's dance director.)

1976
01:22:58,441 --> 01:22:59,782
This is Redlic's power.

1977
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:01,981
I'm in your hands.

1978
01:23:02,181 --> 01:23:06,121
You know the eye part that you all did?

1979
01:23:06,122 --> 01:23:07,480
- The eye part? - Yes.

1980
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:09,391
We needed a very significant person.

1981
01:23:09,592 --> 01:23:13,092
You can see our dance as a fight between classic and contemporary.

1982
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:15,890
Through the figure of WINTER,

1983
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:17,592
everything comes together.

1984
01:23:18,231 --> 01:23:20,502
The person who can bring oil and water together.

1985
01:23:21,231 --> 01:23:22,730
She's expressing who we are.

1986
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:25,131
We want to show how our diversity mixes together,

1987
01:23:25,132 --> 01:23:27,070
which is why we came up with this performance.

1988
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:29,412
Then go down, down again.

1989
01:23:29,912 --> 01:23:31,570
Yes, just like we did before.

1990
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:33,180
And 7, 8.

1991
01:23:33,181 --> 01:23:35,882
WINTER was also a student of Waackxxxy's.

1992
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:39,251
She'll be able to show off the waacking moves well.

1993
01:23:39,252 --> 01:23:42,221
That's why she's our hidden card.

1994
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:43,552
The best. MANNEQUEEN is the best!

1995
01:23:44,122 --> 01:23:45,890
They're slated to be number one.

1996
01:23:45,891 --> 01:23:47,821
- My goodness. - Slated to be number one.

1997
01:23:49,231 --> 01:23:51,431
- Let's start the practice for real. - All right.

1998
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:53,760
Ready, start.

1999
01:23:53,761 --> 01:23:56,671
- Until number 7. - And 1, 2, 3, 4.

2000
01:23:56,672 --> 01:23:59,241
And 5, 6, 7, 8.

2001
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:01,242
- And 2, 3, 4. - Wait a minute.

2002
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,640
This part doesn't move yet. Hold on.

2003
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:06,542
And 1, 2, 7, and stop.

2004
01:24:06,912 --> 01:24:08,342
Why is the timing so off?

2005
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:12,211
Each structure we're moving weighs 250kg.

2006
01:24:12,212 --> 01:24:15,422
They won't move with the beat the way we want them to.

2007
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:19,121
While there's some sophisticated, classic dance going on in front,

2008
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:21,890
- in the back... - Push it straight ahead.

2009
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:23,360
Wait, stop.

2010
01:24:23,361 --> 01:24:25,531
Pull it to the back.

2011
01:24:25,532 --> 01:24:28,501
Dancers in heels will run to release the lock on the wheels.

2012
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:30,871
They've gotten their toes stuck,

2013
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:32,871
and there are a lot of concerns about slipping.

2014
01:24:32,872 --> 01:24:36,811
They need to sacrifice a lot for the sake of the big picture.

2015
01:24:37,712 --> 01:24:40,341
That's why I think we should do it like this.

2016
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:42,510
Move a little faster, putting in a bit more strength.

2017
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:44,651
Just don't get hurt. It looks good now.

2018
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:48,480
I believe it was a leadership style with a gentle charisma.

2019
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:50,350
If it's too dangerous, stop the structure right away.

2020
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:51,751
Don't overdo it.

2021
01:24:51,752 --> 01:24:53,922
If it's too hard, hold onto it firmly, like this.

2022
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:57,360
Like this. You have to keep pushing towards the inside.

2023
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:58,390
Got it?

2024
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:59,501
Be careful.

2025
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:00,930
Thank you.

2026
01:25:00,931 --> 01:25:03,430
She has a warmth that can bring people together.

2027
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,501
You could see that while she was directing.

2028
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:07,171
It's really hard to manage, right?

2029
01:25:07,172 --> 01:25:09,242
I think those in the center have it the hardest.

2030
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:10,611
Good luck.

2031
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,382
- Is it all right? - Yes.

2032
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:14,081
We'll cut it off there.

2033
01:25:14,082 --> 01:25:17,211
We're going to do it fast, so be careful not to get hurt.

2034
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:18,212
- All right. - All right.

2035
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,282
Ready?

2036
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:22,320
In 1, 2, 3, 4...

2037
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:25,021
and 5, 6, 7, stop.

2038
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:28,292
It's totally perfect. Awesome.

2039
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:31,161
- It was really good. - Thank you for your hard work.

2040
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:32,360
- Was it all right? - Yes.

2041
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:34,860
Through all the past missions,

2042
01:25:34,861 --> 01:25:37,100
I don't feel like I've really done anything...

2043
01:25:37,101 --> 01:25:39,372
to stand out as a leader.

2044
01:25:39,571 --> 01:25:43,241
(During Monika's evaluation of the K-pop Death match Mission)

2045
01:25:43,242 --> 01:25:46,242
(I awarded points for Kirsten's leadership skill.)

2046
01:25:47,611 --> 01:25:49,381
This time,

2047
01:25:49,382 --> 01:25:52,311
I'll definitely show everyone...

2048
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:53,922
why I'm MANNEQUEEN's leader.

2049
01:25:55,052 --> 01:25:56,951
(The final practice day)

2050
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:59,021
But the waacking.

2051
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:01,321
They're all just on the floor.

2052
01:26:01,761 --> 01:26:04,690
There was a big difference in what I had pictured...

2053
01:26:04,691 --> 01:26:06,430
with and without the structures.

2054
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:08,230
Watching the performance until the end,

2055
01:26:08,231 --> 01:26:11,801
I didn't get the feeling we used the structures sufficiently.

2056
01:26:11,802 --> 01:26:13,871
Yoonji,

2057
01:26:13,872 --> 01:26:16,141
what about doing those moves as they walk down the stairs?

2058
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:19,680
(The leader, Funky Y, suggests a revision to use the structures.)

2059
01:26:19,681 --> 01:26:20,681
Like this.

2060
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:21,810
(Pondering deeply)

2061
01:26:21,811 --> 01:26:24,052
Yoonji's the director of that part regardless.

2062
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:26,150
Let's take a look.

2063
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:28,621
Slowly. And 5, 6, 7.

2064
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:30,220
(Yoonji agrees to use a structure for her waacking part.)

2065
01:26:30,221 --> 01:26:31,690
Face forward.

2066
01:26:31,691 --> 01:26:34,991
When your legs are spread diagonally,

2067
01:26:34,992 --> 01:26:36,961
you look like a violin bow and it looks pretty.

2068
01:26:36,962 --> 01:26:39,430
All right, let's give it a try. Let's take it slowly.

2069
01:26:39,431 --> 01:26:44,070
I had so much faith in Funky Y, MANNEQUEEN's leader.

2070
01:26:44,071 --> 01:26:47,570
We revised a lot of parts the day before.

2071
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:50,270
As for the krumping,

2072
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,070
how about putting it as the connection between two parts?

2073
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:55,310
It's not impossible to revise it.

2074
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:58,350
We didn't feel any desire to reject the revisions,

2075
01:26:58,351 --> 01:27:01,882
and we thought if we needed them, we should do them.

2076
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:05,691
The leader is in charge of the overall direction anyway.

2077
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:08,390
If she says something looks better, we'll revise it immediately.

2078
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:10,390
It's not easy to come up with something great the first time.

2079
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,802
- That looks good. - That looked good just now.

2080
01:27:12,962 --> 01:27:16,071
(Funky Y and Redlic insert krumping between their parts.)

2081
01:27:16,502 --> 01:27:18,031
(Revising it so the krumpers don't leave the stage.)

2082
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,241
It's no longer monotonous and it's become more colourful.

2083
01:27:20,242 --> 01:27:22,242
The revisions were a stroke of genius.

2084
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:24,242
I don't think we'll get a middling score this time.

2085
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:25,742
We're going to show off a perfect performance.

2086
01:27:26,712 --> 01:27:29,311
(After much practice, they're at their shoot)

2087
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:31,711
(Leader Funky Y shows the tears she's been holding back.)

2088
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:34,421
I totally know how they feel.

2089
01:27:34,422 --> 01:27:37,492
I believe this is a work created by all of your sacrifice.

2090
01:27:37,651 --> 01:27:38,951
(Funky Y conveys her thanks to dancers moving heavy structures.)

2091
01:27:38,952 --> 01:27:41,820
I knew we'd get this far for the Mega Crew Mission.

2092
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:42,931
(Funky Y conveys her thanks to dancers moving heavy structures.)

2093
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:46,901
Each and every one of these 68 dancers is MANNEQUEEN.

2094
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:48,631
We'll show everyone the best performance.

2095
01:27:48,632 --> 01:27:50,430
Everyone, put your right hand on your head like me.

2096
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,270
- Like this. - You do it like this.

2097
01:27:52,271 --> 01:27:53,701
Queen of queens, MANNEQUEEN.

2098
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,242
I know Yoonji is a queen.

2099
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:57,570
Starting now, we'll reveal the video...

2100
01:27:57,571 --> 01:28:00,742
for MANNEQUEEN'S Mega Crew Mission performance.

2101
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,412
(Here it comes.)

2102
01:28:02,882 --> 01:28:05,010
- Let's go! - It's an orchestra.

2103
01:28:05,011 --> 01:28:06,980
- Amazing. - Let's go!

2104
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,122
Here comes something legendary.

2105
01:28:08,282 --> 01:28:10,651
- Let's go! - MANNEQUEEN!

2106
01:28:10,721 --> 01:28:13,622
(Mega Crew Mission, MANNEQUEEN)

2107
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,011
("A La Turca," "Kairos" "What's up danger")

2108
01:28:32,542 --> 01:28:33,640
(MANNEQUEEN Mega Crew Theme)

2109
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:34,680
(An "orchestra of dance" with bodies as instruments...)

2110
01:28:34,681 --> 01:28:35,811
(expressing music, with stair-like structures symbolizing an orchestra)

2111
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:42,252
They're so perfectly in sync.

2112
01:28:43,321 --> 01:28:44,452
They're so aligned.

2113
01:29:11,082 --> 01:29:12,752
(Getting chills)

2114
01:29:13,452 --> 01:29:16,321
(Powerful Waackxxxy)

2115
01:29:39,342 --> 01:29:40,810
(It's Lip J!)

2116
01:29:40,811 --> 01:29:42,412
(Sister)

2117
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:44,651
Queen.

2118
01:30:04,172 --> 01:30:07,641
I love this part. Cera.

2119
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:09,571
- Let's go! - Cera.

2120
01:30:32,162 --> 01:30:34,930
(Targeting the heart)

2121
01:30:34,931 --> 01:30:36,802
Funky!

2122
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:02,560
- She's here. - It's WINTER.

2123
01:31:02,561 --> 01:31:03,662
It's WINTER.

2124
01:31:37,592 --> 01:31:39,260
Spella, let's go!

2125
01:31:39,261 --> 01:31:40,400
(Moved and getting chills)

2126
01:31:40,401 --> 01:31:41,632
This part is the best.

2127
01:31:46,071 --> 01:31:47,271
This is so good.

2128
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:38,921
Redlic tore it up.

2129
01:32:38,922 --> 01:32:40,121
What was that?

2130
01:32:40,122 --> 01:32:42,091
The waacking part was so impressive.

2131
01:32:42,092 --> 01:32:43,532
- That was so great. - Yes.

2132
01:32:44,431 --> 01:32:45,492
That's it.

2133
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:48,230
I got chills.

2134
01:32:48,231 --> 01:32:49,671
Wasn't that so moving?

2135
01:32:49,672 --> 01:32:51,731
I got chills regardless of my own will.

2136
01:32:53,271 --> 01:32:54,302
That was so cool.

2137
01:32:54,872 --> 01:32:56,001
We looked so cool.

2138
01:32:56,002 --> 01:32:57,741
Watching each crew...

2139
01:32:57,742 --> 01:32:58,811
makes me get emotional.

2140
01:32:59,481 --> 01:33:00,782
(During the fight judges' evaluation)

2141
01:33:00,981 --> 01:33:02,611
(Opening both eyes wide)

2142
01:33:04,082 --> 01:33:05,582
Lip J!

2143
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:07,720
- She looks so cool. - It feels like she's getting out...

2144
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:10,592
- all that she couldn't in PROWDMON. - I know.

2145
01:33:13,261 --> 01:33:14,661
That was amazing.

2146
01:33:14,662 --> 01:33:17,930
The dance itself is so good in this part.

2147
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,730
From afar, it may seem like a fun game,

2148
01:33:19,731 --> 01:33:21,532
but as a judge, this makes me want to go home.

2149
01:33:22,002 --> 01:33:23,701
Everyone says they want to go home.

2150
01:33:23,702 --> 01:33:25,171
(Everyone's so amazing.)

2151
01:33:25,172 --> 01:33:26,270
She always does that.

2152
01:33:26,271 --> 01:33:27,802
She always does really well on someone else's crew.

2153
01:33:28,571 --> 01:33:29,872
She should just do better in her own crew.

2154
01:33:30,842 --> 01:33:34,611
We will now reveal the fight judge scores for MANNEQUEEN.

2155
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:37,110
Don't worry. We'll get a good score.

2156
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,981
- Don't worry. We did well. - Yes, don't worry.

2157
01:33:39,382 --> 01:33:41,521
I'm sure they all got a good score.

2158
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:44,792
(Surprised)

2159
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:50,390
(Fight judge scores for the structure theme)

2160
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:54,061
Funky Y's fight judge score was 360 points.

2161
01:33:54,231 --> 01:33:56,901
(Funky Y got the lowest score.)

2162
01:33:57,101 --> 01:33:58,571
Funky Y's score is the lowest.

2163
01:33:58,672 --> 01:34:00,172
The leader's score is the lowest.

2164
01:34:00,471 --> 01:34:02,471
- The score's lower than expected. - You're right.

2165
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:06,341
We did well.

2166
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:07,912
You did a great job. You worked really hard.

2167
01:34:08,082 --> 01:34:09,511
We all did well.

2168
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:12,252
- We looked great. - We all did a great job.

2169
01:34:12,351 --> 01:34:15,851
(Fight judge scores for the structure theme)

2170
01:34:15,981 --> 01:34:18,690
MANNEQUEEN's lowest score was for the B part,

2171
01:34:18,691 --> 01:34:20,622
or Funky Y's part.

2172
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:25,890
Starting here, with the entrance of Buckey and the krumpers,

2173
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:28,401
I felt the flow suffered a bit.

2174
01:34:28,702 --> 01:34:31,671
The performance was so great that I don't want to say this,

2175
01:34:31,672 --> 01:34:33,640
but you could see dancers running around in the back...

2176
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:34,872
while they were moving,

2177
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:38,071
and you could see WINTER as she was leaving too.

2178
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,810
You can see the way they're going up the stairs.

2179
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:42,111
That's bad.

2180
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:43,912
We felt those aspects could've been better.

2181
01:34:45,981 --> 01:34:47,052
Don't cry.

2182
01:34:47,122 --> 01:34:48,481
- You did a good job. - Don't cry.

2183
01:34:48,651 --> 01:34:50,452
MANNEQUEEN's Funky Y,

2184
01:34:51,122 --> 01:34:52,891
how do you feel right now?

2185
01:34:55,292 --> 01:35:00,662
(Funky Y can't speak due to the many emotions she's feeling.)

2186
01:35:02,132 --> 01:35:03,231
You can do it.

2187
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:05,400
- You can do it, Funky Y. - Go slow.

2188
01:35:05,401 --> 01:35:07,172
- Just go slowly. - You did well, Funky Y. It's okay.

2189
01:35:09,672 --> 01:35:12,010
(The dancers cry in their hearts, knowing how she feels.)

2190
01:35:12,011 --> 01:35:14,081
- She did so much for this. - Oh, no.

2191
01:35:14,082 --> 01:35:16,311
Why is she crying? This is driving me insane.

2192
01:35:19,111 --> 01:35:20,252
You did great.

2193
01:35:20,521 --> 01:35:22,121
- Don't cry. - It's all right.

2194
01:35:22,122 --> 01:35:24,351
You looked really cool.

2195
01:35:24,691 --> 01:35:26,891
- Yes, you did well. - Don't cry.

2196
01:35:27,391 --> 01:35:30,332
Why do I always get a low score as the leader?

2197
01:35:30,832 --> 01:35:33,100
I want to be a help to my crew, and someone who supports them.

2198
01:35:33,101 --> 01:35:35,731
But I always have to be comforted by my crew,

2199
01:35:36,802 --> 01:35:38,332
and they have to tell me, "It's all right."

2200
01:35:38,471 --> 01:35:40,341
I want to be the one to do more...

2201
01:35:40,342 --> 01:35:41,801
and take care of them.

2202
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:42,872
(Rather than hearing that from them, I want to do more for them.)

2203
01:35:42,901 --> 01:35:45,742
I felt like my heart was tearing in two.

2204
01:35:46,342 --> 01:35:48,582
I don't think Funky Y's score...

2205
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:51,651
represents the team's score.

2206
01:35:52,712 --> 01:35:54,720
That's why I don't believe that score...

2207
01:35:54,721 --> 01:35:56,952
shows Funky Y's value.

2208
01:35:58,221 --> 01:36:00,061
- Of course. - That's right.

2209
01:36:00,191 --> 01:36:01,391
It was really cool.

2210
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:04,832
Funky Y is a very impressive and precious leader to us.

2211
01:36:04,931 --> 01:36:07,632
I'm also very proud of our performance.

2212
01:36:08,401 --> 01:36:10,431
- They did well. - That was very cool.

2213
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:12,431
She's so right. Everything she said was right.

2214
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:17,172
- You did great. - You did great.

2215
01:36:17,372 --> 01:36:18,711
You did great.

2216
01:36:18,712 --> 01:36:20,742
- You're the best. - Scores aren't everything.

2217
01:36:23,681 --> 01:36:27,121
Next, we have 1MILLION's fight judge scores,

2218
01:36:27,122 --> 01:36:30,492
who chose the same structure theme as MANNEQUEEN.

2219
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:32,491
I'm looking forward to seeing 1MILLION.

2220
01:36:32,492 --> 01:36:33,792
The directors for 1MILLION...

2221
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:36,792
were Lia Kim, Amy, and Harimu.

2222
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:39,131
- Wait! - What?

2223
01:36:39,132 --> 01:36:40,302
They had 100 people?

2224
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:42,761
Gosh.

2225
01:36:42,861 --> 01:36:44,132
Are they for real?

2226
01:36:44,571 --> 01:36:46,100
We decided to be ambitious,

2227
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:51,510
and had the dream of showing the world a mega crew...

2228
01:36:51,511 --> 01:36:53,281
of 100 people.

2229
01:36:53,282 --> 01:36:55,980
That's where we started, but from the start,

2230
01:36:55,981 --> 01:36:58,952
we faced so many obstacles we started to doubt it was possible.

2231
01:36:59,382 --> 01:37:00,452
Having 100 people would never be easy.

2232
01:37:00,651 --> 01:37:03,252
Our heads would've exploded if we had 100 people.

2233
01:37:03,992 --> 01:37:05,751
We kept bumping into walls,

2234
01:37:05,752 --> 01:37:07,691
and I'm sure it was hard for the members as well.

2235
01:37:08,221 --> 01:37:10,091
(Only 1MILLION members remain in the studio after practice.)

2236
01:37:10,092 --> 01:37:11,230
To be honest,

2237
01:37:11,231 --> 01:37:14,301
after watching our practice today,

2238
01:37:14,302 --> 01:37:15,532
I got hit by reality.

2239
01:37:15,601 --> 01:37:18,131
(What happened to 1MILLION?)

2240
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,002
(D-5 to performance day)

2241
01:37:20,172 --> 01:37:24,241
(1MILLION is working hard at practicing.)

2242
01:37:24,242 --> 01:37:26,412
(Looking serious and sensitive)

2243
01:37:26,511 --> 01:37:28,010
The helper dancers are going full out,

2244
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:29,241
so why are the rest of you just marking?

2245
01:37:29,242 --> 01:37:30,911
All of the timing is off right now.

2246
01:37:30,912 --> 01:37:34,321
(The practice room freezes over with Lia Kim's feedback.)

2247
01:37:34,422 --> 01:37:36,051
Knowing that we only have five days left,

2248
01:37:36,052 --> 01:37:37,690
all the little details that were off...

2249
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:39,591
kept catching my eye and bothering me.

2250
01:37:39,592 --> 01:37:41,292
Let's make sure we're perfectly synced up first.

2251
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:45,560
(They start to clean up the details for Director Amy's part first.)

2252
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:47,961
(Lia Kim watches Amy directing.)

2253
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:49,461
Is it here? There?

2254
01:37:49,462 --> 01:37:51,231
There should be an empty space. Is it here?

2255
01:37:52,872 --> 01:37:54,671
Wasn't it supposed to be four people here?

2256
01:37:54,672 --> 01:37:55,971
(Amy is unable to direct her dancers properly.)

2257
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:57,641
Amy kept acting confused.

2258
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:02,610
I've never choreographed 100 dancers before,

2259
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:04,052
so it was very confusing.

2260
01:38:05,351 --> 01:38:07,752
There's no hope for this performance anymore.

2261
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,051
When you're doing this move,

2262
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:12,092
shoot your hands upwards.

2263
01:38:12,191 --> 01:38:13,991
- Let's do it that way. - Once the beat drops,

2264
01:38:13,992 --> 01:38:15,162
there's no impact with that move.

2265
01:38:16,691 --> 01:38:18,430
Whoosh! You have to raise them like this.

2266
01:38:18,431 --> 01:38:19,730
When you lift your head,

2267
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:22,730
think about lowering your chin slightly.

2268
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:25,271
Just make sure your head is parallel to the ceiling.

2269
01:38:25,332 --> 01:38:27,301
From your center, go straight up.

2270
01:38:27,302 --> 01:38:30,571
(Lia Kim leads the practice as the overall director.)

2271
01:38:30,641 --> 01:38:34,411
This was the first time we've had a general director.

2272
01:38:34,412 --> 01:38:37,481
That's why I didn't know how to approach it.

2273
01:38:37,582 --> 01:38:40,521
(They try practicing again with Lia Kim's moves, but...)

2274
01:38:40,882 --> 01:38:42,781
(it's a mess.)

2275
01:38:42,782 --> 01:38:43,891
Gosh.

2276
01:38:43,992 --> 01:38:45,591
In my view,

2277
01:38:45,592 --> 01:38:47,291
this means you're going 0.5 more, right?

2278
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:50,292
- Yes. - They're confused by the change.

2279
01:38:50,361 --> 01:38:51,831
Hurry up and memorize the move.

2280
01:38:51,832 --> 01:38:53,502
Memorizing it isn't the issue here.

2281
01:38:56,261 --> 01:38:57,400
What was that?

2282
01:38:57,401 --> 01:38:59,331
(The conflict in opinion makes tensions run high...)

2283
01:38:59,332 --> 01:39:01,440
(in the practice room.)

2284
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:04,711
I think it's too far to hold this pose and then move.

2285
01:39:04,712 --> 01:39:05,771
(Amy presents her opinion forcefully.)

2286
01:39:07,882 --> 01:39:09,610
The members...

2287
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:12,651
don't seem to be aware that I'm the overall director.

2288
01:39:12,712 --> 01:39:14,520
This side is going to get pushed out anyway.

2289
01:39:14,521 --> 01:39:16,751
They just talk amongst themselves, decide amongst themselves,

2290
01:39:16,752 --> 01:39:18,252
and move forward that way.

2291
01:39:18,492 --> 01:39:19,690
You should be right here.

2292
01:39:19,691 --> 01:39:22,520
(Lia Kim watches the situation first.)

2293
01:39:22,521 --> 01:39:23,792
In that case, that's right.

2294
01:39:24,662 --> 01:39:26,390
Let's do a few run-through first.

2295
01:39:26,391 --> 01:39:27,632
We're going to decide on this first.

2296
01:39:30,372 --> 01:39:31,832
Do they even need me?

2297
01:39:32,231 --> 01:39:35,301
I got the feeling from practice last time...

2298
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:37,672
that you were all moving ahead without me.

2299
01:39:37,842 --> 01:39:40,341
When you exit, the first row will exit too.

2300
01:39:40,342 --> 01:39:41,742
We decided that two rows would exit together.

2301
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:44,281
(Everyone directed differently due to miscommunication.)

2302
01:39:44,282 --> 01:39:46,011
This is what we decided on.

2303
01:39:46,252 --> 01:39:47,680
(Lia Kim felt she wasn't being acknowledged as overall director.)

2304
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:49,721
- You were doing something else. - Yes.

2305
01:39:49,821 --> 01:39:51,491
You looked like your mind was on other things,

2306
01:39:51,492 --> 01:39:52,520
so we decided to handle things on our own.

2307
01:39:52,521 --> 01:39:55,421
It came out of a desire to be considerate to you.

2308
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:58,430
We knew that if you had to take on everything,

2309
01:39:58,431 --> 01:39:59,832
you'd be overwhelmed.

2310
01:40:00,101 --> 01:40:02,231
We needed to maximize time.

2311
01:40:02,332 --> 01:40:04,301
The dancers were waiting around,

2312
01:40:04,302 --> 01:40:05,631
so I decided to take charge.

2313
01:40:05,632 --> 01:40:07,872
(They each started practice for their own parts.)

2314
01:40:07,971 --> 01:40:09,911
I know what you mean.

2315
01:40:09,912 --> 01:40:11,171
I need a lot of time to think.

2316
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:13,480
That means the faster ones will go...

2317
01:40:13,481 --> 01:40:15,010
and get a head start.

2318
01:40:15,011 --> 01:40:17,010
But if there's a part that I don't understand,

2319
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,752
then I can't direct the last rehearsal.

2320
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:21,851
Yes, that's something we didn't consider.

2321
01:40:21,922 --> 01:40:23,591
We were simply thinking...

2322
01:40:23,592 --> 01:40:25,151
that we could just learn the moves and that's that.

2323
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:27,092
We were thinking it would be over that simply,

2324
01:40:27,191 --> 01:40:30,261
that we didn't think to tell you how we proceeded.

2325
01:40:30,361 --> 01:40:32,332
I think our communication issues were our biggest problem,

2326
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:36,162
but I'm confident that we can resolve things together.

2327
01:40:36,401 --> 01:40:38,901
Lia, we'll just do the steps like this.

2328
01:40:39,101 --> 01:40:42,501
- Just the ready circle should come, - Right.

2329
01:40:42,502 --> 01:40:44,610
- and do this part. - The sides don't need precision.

2330
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:49,082
(1MILLION perfects their performance by conferring with one another.)

2331
01:40:49,141 --> 01:40:51,151
It's good now. Let's do it like this.

2332
01:40:51,611 --> 01:40:54,681
Do you think it's okay that we can see dancers here?

2333
01:40:54,752 --> 01:40:57,021
I thought this part looked sloppy as well.

2334
01:40:57,122 --> 01:40:58,421
Should we have them walk off so it looks cleaner?

2335
01:40:58,422 --> 01:40:59,650
I do think that will look cleaner.

2336
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:00,860
We have a variety of opinions coming forward,

2337
01:41:00,861 --> 01:41:03,632
and my crew members trust me and follow my lead.

2338
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:07,231
We're conferring again today.

2339
01:41:07,702 --> 01:41:09,831
As soon as we wake up, we watch our practice videos,

2340
01:41:09,832 --> 01:41:11,570
decide what we need to do,

2341
01:41:11,571 --> 01:41:13,741
practice, and confer.

2342
01:41:13,742 --> 01:41:15,440
We did that over and over in an endless cycle.

2343
01:41:15,441 --> 01:41:17,011
We couldn't help but become sensitive.

2344
01:41:17,141 --> 01:41:19,141
It must be really hard for you, Lia.

2345
01:41:19,311 --> 01:41:20,981
Why? Isn't it just as hard for you?

2346
01:41:21,042 --> 01:41:23,381
- I'm not the director though. - Oh, the directing.

2347
01:41:23,382 --> 01:41:25,181
- But that part is fun. - It's fun for you?

2348
01:41:25,651 --> 01:41:28,451
Choreographing a performance with 100 dancers is a dream.

2349
01:41:28,452 --> 01:41:30,122
It's a huge challenge for me.

2350
01:41:30,321 --> 01:41:32,951
Lia has to put it all together.

2351
01:41:32,952 --> 01:41:35,992
She needs to pay attention from the beginning to the end.

2352
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:39,361
I know how much effort she puts into leading 100 dancers.

2353
01:41:39,632 --> 01:41:41,631
She is losing sleep over it.

2354
01:41:41,632 --> 01:41:44,600
That's why we believe in her and follow her.

2355
01:41:44,601 --> 01:41:45,771
That was cool.

2356
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:50,211
"For the dancers who helped us..."

2357
01:41:50,212 --> 01:41:53,041
"and 1MILLION, I will make a really cool performance."

2358
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:54,742
"I will make it work." I had that thought.

2359
01:41:54,882 --> 01:41:59,111
There is someone I called over as a special guest.

2360
01:41:59,181 --> 01:42:02,282
(Which special guest will help 1MILLION's mega crew?)

2361
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:05,821
I am the 100th helper, Sandara Park. It's nice to meet you.

2362
01:42:05,952 --> 01:42:08,122
(2NE1's Sandara Park was sensational from the début she debuted.)

2363
01:42:08,361 --> 01:42:11,462
(Sandara Park showed off various charms.)

2364
01:42:11,561 --> 01:42:13,131
She is a friend who is my age.

2365
01:42:13,132 --> 01:42:14,930
No one believes it.

2366
01:42:14,931 --> 01:42:17,270
We are very close friends.

2367
01:42:17,271 --> 01:42:18,901
(They are friends who are both 40 years old.)

2368
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:21,801
When I thought about the concept of a lotus flower,

2369
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:24,770
I realized that Sandara would be fitting.

2370
01:42:24,771 --> 01:42:26,671
She is well-known to be diligent.

2371
01:42:26,672 --> 01:42:30,150
She is someone who can do her part with a sense of responsibility.

2372
01:42:30,151 --> 01:42:32,881
So I chose her as the heroine of the lotus flower performance.

2373
01:42:32,882 --> 01:42:36,082
With you, we will place first.

2374
01:42:36,321 --> 01:42:37,991
- We must place 1st. - Let's place 1st.

2375
01:42:37,992 --> 01:42:39,291
- We must place 1st. - Let's place 1st.

2376
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:41,091
- Whether we win or lose, - Whether we win or lose,

2377
01:42:41,092 --> 01:42:42,992
- let's go! - let's go!

2378
01:42:43,221 --> 01:42:45,360
Let's start from the beginning with music.

2379
01:42:45,361 --> 01:42:47,561
(1MILLION has the final rehearsal.)

2380
01:42:49,202 --> 01:42:52,332
(The structure moves diagonally, not straight.)

2381
01:42:52,372 --> 01:42:55,141
(The circle comes apart and moves!)

2382
01:42:55,242 --> 01:42:57,441
The structure came apart.

2383
01:42:59,242 --> 01:43:01,480
(The right side needs to be spread further.)

2384
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:03,851
You need to spread the structure further.

2385
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,650
The structure...

2386
01:43:05,651 --> 01:43:06,711
(Squeezing her eyes shut)

2387
01:43:06,712 --> 01:43:09,922
It started out as a big mess.

2388
01:43:09,981 --> 01:43:12,951
Let's redo the first part with the structure.

2389
01:43:12,952 --> 01:43:14,861
(The structure comes forward in a straight line.)

2390
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:16,720
Yes, it should move like that.

2391
01:43:16,721 --> 01:43:18,430
Make sure you center it.

2392
01:43:18,431 --> 01:43:19,690
Center it.

2393
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:21,001
This is when it becomes crooked.

2394
01:43:21,002 --> 01:43:23,031
You probably aren't pushing hard until the end.

2395
01:43:23,032 --> 01:43:25,600
In the end, you need to go further without getting nervous.

2396
01:43:25,601 --> 01:43:27,440
- You tried to stop it, right? - Yes.

2397
01:43:27,441 --> 01:43:28,970
- I didn't want it to go further. - It keeps getting crooked.

2398
01:43:28,971 --> 01:43:30,242
I was so upset.

2399
01:43:30,941 --> 01:43:35,912
(Will 1MILLION perform well without making a mistake?)

2400
01:43:36,481 --> 01:43:37,581
Now, we will check out...

2401
01:43:37,582 --> 01:43:41,081
1MILLION's mega crew performance video.

2402
01:43:41,082 --> 01:43:43,851
I can't believe we will watch it now.

2403
01:43:44,052 --> 01:43:45,150
One hundred dancers.

2404
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:46,821
- Let's see the flower. - Let's go.

2405
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:51,132
(Mega Crew Mission, 1MILLION)

2406
01:44:04,742 --> 01:44:06,070
(Amazed)

2407
01:44:06,071 --> 01:44:08,180
That represents the Korean peninsula.

2408
01:44:08,181 --> 01:44:10,150
- How did she think of that? - Seriously.

2409
01:44:10,151 --> 01:44:14,282
("Haegeumsanjo," "Self-made BGM," "YO-SOUL," and "YELLOW" by 1MILLION)

2410
01:44:15,422 --> 01:44:16,850
(1MILLION's Mega Crew performance shows the beauty of the East...)

2411
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:18,621
(and the contrast between yin and yang, light and dark...)

2412
01:44:18,622 --> 01:44:20,761
(through costumes, structures, and 100 dancers.)

2413
01:44:42,011 --> 01:44:43,140
Crazy.

2414
01:44:43,141 --> 01:44:44,581
The structure is really nice.

2415
01:44:44,582 --> 01:44:46,111
It's a battle of ideas.

2416
01:45:26,992 --> 01:45:28,861
(The human lotus flower stirs up the studio.)

2417
01:45:28,992 --> 01:45:30,291
She is so beautiful.

2418
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:31,760
How pretty.

2419
01:45:31,761 --> 01:45:33,632
They really used the right person.

2420
01:45:33,832 --> 01:45:35,131
I didn't expect to see her there.

2421
01:45:35,132 --> 01:45:36,971
Okay. Lotus flower.

2422
01:45:55,922 --> 01:45:58,520
Here comes the highlight.

2423
01:45:58,521 --> 01:45:59,622
(With black tape on their arms, they showed a lotus flower bloom.)

2424
01:46:01,662 --> 01:46:02,820
I got goosebumps.

2425
01:46:02,821 --> 01:46:03,890
What a sight.

2426
01:46:03,891 --> 01:46:05,161
This is driving me crazy.

2427
01:46:05,162 --> 01:46:07,730
- I have so much respect for them. - That was legendary.

2428
01:46:07,731 --> 01:46:09,901
Let's go.

2429
01:46:52,271 --> 01:46:53,782
Are you ready?

2430
01:46:55,181 --> 01:46:56,841
(They nailed it.)

2431
01:46:56,842 --> 01:46:58,252
I love that.

2432
01:46:58,351 --> 01:46:59,382
Let's go.

2433
01:46:59,952 --> 01:47:01,382
They did so well.

2434
01:47:25,011 --> 01:47:26,372
(That's insane!)

2435
01:47:26,511 --> 01:47:27,781
Crazy.

2436
01:47:27,782 --> 01:47:29,941
- They really are a mega crew. - I am drooling.

2437
01:47:30,141 --> 01:47:31,381
It's like computer graphics.

2438
01:47:31,382 --> 01:47:33,181
- I know. - Computer graphics.

2439
01:48:00,882 --> 01:48:02,582
How did they practice?

2440
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:07,781
- It was so cool. - It was cool.

2441
01:48:07,782 --> 01:48:09,551
I am giving a standing ovation.

2442
01:48:09,552 --> 01:48:11,291
One hundred dancers did their parts.

2443
01:48:11,292 --> 01:48:13,492
- They get thumbs up. - Thumbs up.

2444
01:48:13,691 --> 01:48:15,461
They utilized the structures so well.

2445
01:48:15,462 --> 01:48:16,621
It was a strong performance.

2446
01:48:16,622 --> 01:48:19,131
- We did so well. - We did so well.

2447
01:48:19,132 --> 01:48:20,731
It brought back so many memories.

2448
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:22,260
(The fight judges' evaluation)

2449
01:48:22,261 --> 01:48:24,930
(Startled)

2450
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:25,931
That's insane.

2451
01:48:26,672 --> 01:48:28,672
How cool.

2452
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:30,042
It's the Taegeuk symbol.

2453
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:35,641
(She is so moved that she screeches like a dolphin.)

2454
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,842
It's three-dimensional.

2455
01:48:37,082 --> 01:48:38,311
She is so cute.

2456
01:48:39,181 --> 01:48:41,221
(Getting up)

2457
01:48:41,282 --> 01:48:42,582
One hundred dancers.

2458
01:48:42,922 --> 01:48:46,091
This is a scale only 1MILLION can pull off.

2459
01:48:46,092 --> 01:48:48,821
I can't believe they showed that in two minutes. It was the best.

2460
01:48:48,962 --> 01:48:49,962
Don't you think...

2461
01:48:49,963 --> 01:48:51,861
the performance was fitting for the Olympics?

2462
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:54,631
We will now reveal the fight judge scores...

2463
01:48:54,632 --> 01:48:58,332
for the directors of 1MILLION, Amy and Harimu.

2464
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:00,270
Why am I so nervous?

2465
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:01,371
(Holding)

2466
01:49:01,372 --> 01:49:02,571
It's okay.

2467
01:49:02,941 --> 01:49:05,111
I bet they will get over 385 points at the very least.

2468
01:49:05,242 --> 01:49:08,440
I think they will receive the highest score and place first.

2469
01:49:08,441 --> 01:49:11,111
(What will be their fight judge scores?)

2470
01:49:12,082 --> 01:49:14,180
(Amy: 388 points, Harimu: 385 points)

2471
01:49:14,181 --> 01:49:16,680
(Amy: 388 points, Harimu: 385 points)

2472
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,421
(Amy and Harimu received higher scores than Redlic, )

2473
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:19,751
(the member who got the highest score in MANNEQUEEN.)

2474
01:49:19,752 --> 01:49:21,220
- Well done. - We will win.

2475
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,721
- All right. - I am close to tears. Hold on.

2476
01:49:24,431 --> 01:49:25,831
They did really well.

2477
01:49:25,832 --> 01:49:27,730
They did well. I acknowledge that.

2478
01:49:27,731 --> 01:49:31,271
We will now reveal the fight judge score for Lia Kim.

2479
01:49:31,571 --> 01:49:32,701
- 1MILLION... - I bet it's high.

2480
01:49:32,702 --> 01:49:34,672
My guess is 390 points.

2481
01:49:34,742 --> 01:49:35,970
I am so curious.

2482
01:49:35,971 --> 01:49:37,610
- I bet it will be really high. - I know.

2483
01:49:37,611 --> 01:49:40,981
I am hoping for a good result.

2484
01:49:41,082 --> 01:49:42,211
(Lia Kim)

2485
01:49:42,212 --> 01:49:43,581
(No...)

2486
01:49:43,582 --> 01:49:45,081
(way)

2487
01:49:45,082 --> 01:49:46,511
(Their jaws drop.)

2488
01:49:46,611 --> 01:49:48,651
(What's the score for Lia Kim, the general director of 1MILLION?)

2489
01:49:50,122 --> 01:49:52,092
It's 392 points.

2490
01:49:52,351 --> 01:49:53,650
(They did it!)

2491
01:49:53,651 --> 01:49:56,690
(Lia Kim's fight judge score is 392 points.)

2492
01:49:56,691 --> 01:49:57,761
It's the highest score.

2493
01:49:57,931 --> 01:49:59,690
It's the 1st time someone's score went over 390 points.

2494
01:49:59,691 --> 01:50:01,501
That's almost the perfect score.

2495
01:50:01,502 --> 01:50:02,962
Will they win by a landslide?

2496
01:50:03,302 --> 01:50:05,101
(Lia Kim, you worked hard.)

2497
01:50:05,271 --> 01:50:06,600
I did this with you guys.

2498
01:50:06,601 --> 01:50:09,101
We did this together. I didn't do it alone.

2499
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:12,440
I think those arms that remind me of Zolaman...

2500
01:50:12,441 --> 01:50:13,980
really made a difference.

2501
01:50:13,981 --> 01:50:15,281
I think they look like cranes.

2502
01:50:15,282 --> 01:50:17,140
They look like cranes of Korea.

2503
01:50:17,141 --> 01:50:19,552
The birdlike features make the performance very Korean.

2504
01:50:19,611 --> 01:50:21,821
Don't describe them as cranes when I talked about Zolaman.

2505
01:50:21,922 --> 01:50:24,092
(I can't believe her.)

2506
01:50:24,191 --> 01:50:27,991
In the opening, there was the pink part at the center.

2507
01:50:27,992 --> 01:50:30,890
The choreography that made use of 100 dancers toward the end...

2508
01:50:30,891 --> 01:50:32,632
and their energy...

2509
01:50:32,662 --> 01:50:35,832
made them the best team I have watched so far.

2510
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:38,531
Directors were in charge of different parts,

2511
01:50:38,532 --> 01:50:43,241
but we shared the process with the members.

2512
01:50:43,242 --> 01:50:45,810
We helped each other...

2513
01:50:45,811 --> 01:50:48,180
and discussed the matters together to create this performance.

2514
01:50:48,181 --> 01:50:51,081
So I am thankful for my teammates.

2515
01:50:51,082 --> 01:50:52,212
(Everyone worked hard.)

2516
01:50:52,282 --> 01:50:54,281
Now come the two crews' total scores.

2517
01:50:54,282 --> 01:50:55,881
MANNEQUEEN got 1,100 points.

2518
01:50:55,882 --> 01:50:58,720
1MILLION got 1,165 points.

2519
01:50:58,721 --> 01:51:00,720
The difference between the scores is 65 points.

2520
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:02,861
I will now reveal which crew the fight judges chose...

2521
01:51:03,061 --> 01:51:06,191
for the concept extra points.

2522
01:51:06,231 --> 01:51:08,661
What? The extra points will change the scores.

2523
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:12,100
MANNEQUEEN might take the extra points.

2524
01:51:12,101 --> 01:51:14,941
(The synchronized waacking seized everyone's attention...)

2525
01:51:15,071 --> 01:51:16,241
(and the separated stairs expressed genres...)

2526
01:51:16,242 --> 01:51:17,412
(in MANNEQUEEN's Mega Crew performance.)

2527
01:51:17,441 --> 01:51:18,941
Extra points.

2528
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:21,042
- It will be 1MILLION. - I know.

2529
01:51:21,212 --> 01:51:22,912
They used the structures so well.

2530
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:24,451
(Though the shadow, lotus flower, moon, and staircases, )

2531
01:51:24,452 --> 01:51:28,552
(1MILLION used the structures in various ways.)

2532
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:30,951
- Please let it be 1MILLION. - Please.

2533
01:51:30,952 --> 01:51:31,992
One hundred points.

2534
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:34,591
I think we really did our best.

2535
01:51:34,592 --> 01:51:35,922
I think we did well.

2536
01:51:36,061 --> 01:51:39,032
I think we did a better job of utilizing the structures.

2537
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:41,730
(Extra points)

2538
01:51:41,731 --> 01:51:45,230
(1MILLION received the extra points of 100 points.)

2539
01:51:45,231 --> 01:51:46,331
Okay.

2540
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:51,510
I think 100 helpers are the ones who made the 100 points possible.

2541
01:51:51,511 --> 01:51:53,110
I want to share the honour.

2542
01:51:53,111 --> 01:51:55,741
(Unfortunately, MANNEQUEEN didn't get extra points.)

2543
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:57,412
They used the structures well.

2544
01:51:57,481 --> 01:51:59,782
They did well, so I understand the decision.

2545
01:51:59,912 --> 01:52:02,320
Their ideas shined in their use of the structures.

2546
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:05,151
The part where they come forward is quite fun.

2547
01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:07,520
They used the round hole really well.

2548
01:52:07,521 --> 01:52:09,122
After they run around,

2549
01:52:09,221 --> 01:52:10,890
we see a heart.

2550
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:13,890
If a study on the structures is a part of the skills,

2551
01:52:13,891 --> 01:52:15,532
1MILLION won by a landslide.

2552
01:52:15,632 --> 01:52:17,201
Even if I had gone against them,

2553
01:52:17,202 --> 01:52:18,701
I would have said that 1MILLION was the winner.

2554
01:52:18,702 --> 01:52:20,101
(I totally acknowledge them.)

2555
01:52:20,172 --> 01:52:25,371
I really wanted to do well in the Mega Crew Mission.

2556
01:52:25,372 --> 01:52:27,010
I was really desperate to do well.

2557
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:29,810
I want to applaud MANNEQUEEN too.

2558
01:52:29,811 --> 01:52:33,110
(1MILLION and MANNEQUEEN respect each other.)

2559
01:52:33,111 --> 01:52:34,721
I am disappointed,

2560
01:52:34,821 --> 01:52:38,291
but MANNEQUEEN showed itself well through the Mega Crew Mission.

2561
01:52:38,292 --> 01:52:41,921
(MANNEQUEEN fought well!)

2562
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:45,361
Now come the fight judge scores for the crews...

2563
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:47,760
that chose the all-gender theme,

2564
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,231
LADYBOUNCE, BEBE, and Wolf'Lo.

2565
01:52:50,502 --> 01:52:51,731
(Worried)

2566
01:52:51,832 --> 01:52:52,872
It's our turn.

2567
01:52:53,002 --> 01:52:54,270
(I am nervous.)

2568
01:52:54,271 --> 01:52:55,601
The all-gender theme was chaotic.

2569
01:52:55,842 --> 01:52:59,641
Firstly, I will announce LADYBOUNCE's fight judge score.

2570
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:02,480
They must be nervous.

2571
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:04,350
LADYBOUNCE, for this mission,

2572
01:53:04,351 --> 01:53:07,251
you worked with many people for the very first time.

2573
01:53:07,252 --> 01:53:08,882
Were there any difficulties?

2574
01:53:09,181 --> 01:53:10,321
(Sighing)

2575
01:53:12,992 --> 01:53:15,761
For the very first time,

2576
01:53:16,861 --> 01:53:20,132
the members had emotional struggles.

2577
01:53:20,391 --> 01:53:21,631
I really didn't think...

2578
01:53:21,632 --> 01:53:24,171
this mission would shake up my career, values,

2579
01:53:24,172 --> 01:53:26,601
and everything as a dancer.

2580
01:53:28,242 --> 01:53:29,342
Let's begin.

2581
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:31,940
(Vessi, Biggy, and Naro practice the formation and moves.)

2582
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:33,872
(The leader, NOB monitors the practice video.)

2583
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:35,610
I think it would be nice to do that.

2584
01:53:35,611 --> 01:53:36,980
(Even when they talk about the formation, )

2585
01:53:36,981 --> 01:53:38,351
(her eyes are focused on the screen.)

2586
01:53:38,412 --> 01:53:39,712
What do you think?

2587
01:53:40,452 --> 01:53:41,581
What was that?

2588
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:43,481
We would be thankful if you could listen as well.

2589
01:53:44,021 --> 01:53:45,421
Why don't we get the overall structure first...

2590
01:53:45,422 --> 01:53:46,792
and add details later?

2591
01:53:46,851 --> 01:53:48,360
(NOB just nods without a word when they ask for her opinion.)

2592
01:53:48,361 --> 01:53:51,431
That's a good idea, but I think it will be hard.

2593
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:54,061
(There is strange tension between the leader and directors.)

2594
01:53:56,632 --> 01:54:00,001
(NOB leaves in the end.)

2595
01:54:00,002 --> 01:54:03,470
There has been an emotional rift between NOB and me...

2596
01:54:03,471 --> 01:54:05,141
for a long time.

2597
01:54:06,412 --> 01:54:10,382
(What happened between the two of them?)

2598
01:54:10,681 --> 01:54:13,010
Which crew do you think will place first?

2599
01:54:13,011 --> 01:54:14,381
We need to pick the number one crew.

2600
01:54:14,382 --> 01:54:15,421
For me, the answer is clear.

2601
01:54:15,422 --> 01:54:16,521
- 1MILLION? - Yes.

2602
01:54:16,552 --> 01:54:17,922
I think it will be a unanimous vote.

2603
01:54:17,992 --> 01:54:19,720
1MILLION.

2604
01:54:19,721 --> 01:54:20,860
How annoying.

2605
01:54:20,861 --> 01:54:21,961
(1MILLION checks the result.)

2606
01:54:21,962 --> 01:54:22,962
Yes!

2607
01:54:23,761 --> 01:54:25,060
- What? - First place.

2608
01:54:25,061 --> 01:54:27,061
They expect us to place first.

2609
01:54:27,191 --> 01:54:29,032
It's gold.

2610
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:31,502
(1MILLION received votes from 4 out of 6 crews.)

2611
01:54:31,601 --> 01:54:32,931
- We did it! - Yes!

2612
01:54:33,002 --> 01:54:34,701
Let's keep up with this energy...

2613
01:54:34,702 --> 01:54:36,201
and place first in the mission.

2614
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:38,570
For the number one expectation,

2615
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:41,581
the crew will take the center in the group trailer...

2616
01:54:41,582 --> 01:54:42,712
of Street Women Fighter 2.

2617
01:54:44,252 --> 01:54:46,010
- Center! - Isn't that incredible?

2618
01:54:46,011 --> 01:54:47,820
We will take over the trailer.

2619
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:49,122
It's the best one...

2620
01:54:49,952 --> 01:54:52,021
among the benefits we have seen so far.

2621
01:54:52,292 --> 01:54:54,292
(The day of the group trailer shoot)

2622
01:54:54,361 --> 01:54:55,520
(The dancers of the 8 crews practice early in the morning.)

2623
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,760
(WOOTAE's choreography and Honey J's direction...)

2624
01:54:57,761 --> 01:55:00,031
(were added for the trailer of Street Women Fighter 2.)

2625
01:55:00,032 --> 01:55:01,761
The two of you should cross.

2626
01:55:03,756 --> 01:55:06,356
I will stay focused and learn the dance right away.

2627
01:55:08,096 --> 01:55:10,225
(1MILLION showed their sense of presence...)

2628
01:55:10,226 --> 01:55:12,494
(and had a successful shoot.)

2629
01:55:12,495 --> 01:55:14,305
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2630
01:55:14,306 --> 01:55:19,235
(To be continued)

2631
01:55:19,436 --> 01:55:21,575
I am here to be a special judge.

2632
01:55:21,842 --> 01:55:24,780
If it weren't for you, I would have been very nervous.

2633
01:55:24,781 --> 01:55:26,652
Frankly speaking, who do you think will win?

2634
01:55:26,781 --> 01:55:30,451
My expectations on other crews have been wrong.

2635
01:55:31,113 --> 01:55:33,584
- I heard about the event voting. - There is such a thing.

2636
01:55:33,762 --> 01:55:36,320
- Start the app. - Okay.

2637
01:55:36,321 --> 01:55:38,061
Slide the screen.

2638
01:55:38,062 --> 01:55:39,091
(When you slide the screen, you get voting page.)

2639
01:55:39,092 --> 01:55:42,001
You can predict who will win.

2640
01:55:46,001 --> 01:55:47,941
Vote for the crew you think will win.

2641
01:55:47,942 --> 01:55:49,771
You can win a ticket to watch the final.

2642
01:55:49,772 --> 01:55:51,642
I will vote...

2643
01:55:51,741 --> 01:55:53,642
and hope to win a ticket to the final.

2644
01:55:53,719 --> 01:55:57,660
(LADYBOUNCE, BEBE, and Wolf'Lo chose the all-gender theme.)

2645
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:59,780
(The helper dancers wait to practice for the Mega Crew performance.)

2646
01:55:59,781 --> 01:56:02,222
Guys, Baby Sleek's choreography will change.

2647
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:04,490
I changed the formation.

2648
01:56:04,491 --> 01:56:08,192
Think of it as starting over today.

2649
01:56:08,262 --> 01:56:12,192
(Wanting to do well, she changes the dance repeatedly.)

2650
01:56:12,262 --> 01:56:14,201
She keeps taking up the practice time.

2651
01:56:14,432 --> 01:56:15,801
She focuses on the details...

2652
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:17,102
but doesn't wrap up the part.

2653
01:56:17,302 --> 01:56:19,602
Finish up the 1st song in 30 minutes.

2654
01:56:19,701 --> 01:56:21,302
I can't get the details right in 30 minutes.

2655
01:56:21,402 --> 01:56:23,971
We can't worry about the details now.

2656
01:56:23,972 --> 01:56:25,642
Numbers 2 and 3 haven't even begun yet.

2657
01:56:26,071 --> 01:56:28,211
(Will Wolf'Lo's Mega Crew performance go smoothly?)

2658
01:56:28,312 --> 01:56:31,611
(The day the final result of the Mega Crew Mission...)

2659
01:56:31,612 --> 01:56:33,311
(gets revealed)

2660
01:56:33,312 --> 01:56:35,052
The crew that will leave the fight club is...

2661
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:38,022
Actually,

2662
01:56:38,321 --> 01:56:40,820
LADYBOUNCE was shown to the public for the first time...

2663
01:56:40,821 --> 01:56:42,722
through this show.

2664
01:56:43,762 --> 01:56:45,092
We practiced hard.

2665
01:56:46,562 --> 01:56:51,401
We practiced diligently for the battle.

2666
01:56:51,402 --> 01:56:52,902
So no matter which crew we go against...

2667
01:56:53,171 --> 01:56:56,471
(Mina Myoung can't go on.)

2668
01:56:56,472 --> 01:56:57,710
Bada of BEBE.

2669
01:56:57,711 --> 01:57:01,482
(Did BEBE become a candidate for elimination?)

2670
01:57:01,642 --> 01:57:02,881
What a surprise.

2671
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:04,682
Firstly...

2672
01:57:09,352 --> 01:57:11,692
We did our best. We challenged ourselves.

2673
01:57:11,717 --> 01:57:14,247
We just need to take responsibility.

2674
01:57:14,362 --> 01:57:16,522
Let's show what we need to show with diligence...

2675
01:57:16,621 --> 01:57:17,791
and survive.

2676
01:57:19,392 --> 01:57:20,561
(Elimination Battle)

2677
01:57:20,562 --> 01:57:22,001
Which crew...

2678
01:57:22,031 --> 01:57:23,932
will leave the show?

2679
01:57:24,031 --> 01:57:27,342
The second crew to be eliminated is...

2680
01:57:27,671 --> 01:57:32,841
(After a fierce competition, )

2681
01:57:32,842 --> 01:57:39,182
(which crew will be the second one to leave the fight zone?)
