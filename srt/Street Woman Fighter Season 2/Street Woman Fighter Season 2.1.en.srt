00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,609
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,050
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,570
(Prologue: Determine the number-one dancer in the world)

4
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,658
You are the best woman fighters...

5
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,670
that go beyond the Republic of Korea and represent the world.

6
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,738
You only have one goal.

7
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,399
To take the symbol of the number-one street dancing group in the world,

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,069
this trophy.

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,709
Even among the best dancers, there are ranks.

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,809
This is a competitive fight club where you must stand...

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,310
on top of your opponent.

12
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,180
I'll tell you the special rule about this place.

13
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,249
One. All fights are allowed...

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,319
regardless of where you're from and how experienced you are.

15
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,930
They came to Korea to have fun.

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,159
Do they think we're easy?

17
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,598
This is war.

18
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,430
That sounds fun. It's a world battle.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,029
What the heck?

20
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,068
Shut your mouth.

21
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,530
It's game time.

22
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,739
They're insane. They're messing with us.

23
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:40,769
We ought to destroy them.

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,839
Give us the queen's throne, and get out of here.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,208
I'm going to bite one of them.

26
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,208
This isn't a dance-off. This is a straight-up fight.

27
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,809
I'm actually going to break her.

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,250
Is there going to be an actual fight?

29
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,819
Two. No respect is needed for those who don't deserve it.

30
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,559
She's too bad.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,988
That was a mess.

32
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,089
Is she even human?

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,599
I just can't bring myself to respect her.

34
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,459
She calls that a dance move?

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,030
She's got absolutely no presence.

36
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,569
No one's ever heard of you.

37
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,870
Did she disrespect me just now?

38
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,439
So, do it well.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,009
Three. The loser will face merciless humiliation.

40
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,109
It pisses me off.

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,279
We lost.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,479
Then, we have to keep quiet.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,349
I can't wait to go home.

44
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,860
It was degrading.

45
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,460
Shoot. I'm so upset.

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,229
I want to stop.

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't lose and act like the victim.

48
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,110
Only one crew can be the winner.

49
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,379
You must fight everyone before you and win if you want to survive.

50
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,348
We have to fight, win, and dominate them.

51
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,550
We have to prove ourselves.

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,990
We're here to be the champion.

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,650
Be the champion or nothing.

54
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,020
The best dance-off you've seen on a larger scale.

55
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,930
Who will be at the top of the global rank?

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,699
We're about to change the game.

57
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm going to beat you.

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,929
We'll show you the power of Japan.

59
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,870
We'll beat all the other crews and take the trophy.

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,468
We have to win.

61
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,139
They're an easy target.

62
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,809
This is the spiciness of Korea.

63
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,080
Korea has to defeat Japan.

64
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm going to show you who the queen is!

65
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,780
Your skill becomes power while you're here.

66
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,679
Street Woman Fighter 2.

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,150
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

68
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,319
Ready?

69
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,819
Fight.

70
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,930
We will now begin the voting of crew performances.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,098
This is a very important vote that will determine the champion.

72
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,739
All the votes will accumulate...

73
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,869
and turn into the crews' scores.

74
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,938
You can vote once every day,

75
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,649
and you can vote for multiple crews as well.

76
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,109
The voting period starts now and ends in the final episode,

77
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,680
on October 31, at 6pm.

78
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,948
Starting now, vote for the crew...

79
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,649
that will top the global rank.

80
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,489
Five, four,

81
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,289
three, two, one.

82
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,860
Ready? Fight.

83
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,299
(Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province)

84
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,068
- Street Woman Fighter 2. - Season 2!

85
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,439
We're here.

86
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,809
Okay. Shall we begin?

87
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,180
Hi.

88
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,480
Walk proudly.

89
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,849
Let's get it.

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,349
(There are familiar names in this crew.)

91
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,850
1MILLION's logo looks the prettiest.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,550
1MILLION.

93
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:46,060
(The dance academy that leads the global dance culture)

94
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,188
We've worked with the best artists...

95
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,930
from probably most agencies the most times.

96
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,869
Our crew was founded in 2000... Was it in 2014?

97
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,398
You can look it up online.

98
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,000
It's on Wikipedia because we're so famous.

99
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,309
I brought 1MILLION...

100
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,008
to Street Woman Fighter 2 as its leader. I'm Lia Kim.

101
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,709
We've won global competitions.

102
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,148
I believe that I've been to the top...

103
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,649
of street dancing and choreographies.

104
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,920
(Following Lia Kim, the Korean dance leader, )

105
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,660
(1MILLION, the choreography crew, impresses the whole world.)

106
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,188
Beauty.

107
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,889
- Beauty! - Beauty!

108
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,929
Use this fixer to fix ourselves to number one.

109
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,759
Number one!

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,730
We can totally wear it when we dance.

111
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,639
- We should wear yellow. - Yes.

112
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,338
Let's go.

113
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,008
Here we go.

114
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,779
(They're energetic from the start.)

115
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,409
(Dancing)

116
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,479
Six, seven, eight, one.

117
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,508
(Staring)

118
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,649
(Perfect to the finish)

119
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,078
Hello, we're...

120
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,389
- MANNEQUEEN. - MANNEQUEEN.

121
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,549
Please introduce MANNEQUEEN to us.

122
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,560
- From our origin story? - Our whole history.

123
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,818
"Dancing 9?"

124
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,258
That was for this show.

125
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:55,629
I was building it up to this point.

126
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:59,559
We were on the show "Dancing 9" from Mnet,

127
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,870
and it united us.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,338
They invited us to "Street Man Fighter" as well,

129
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,639
and it led to this.

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,638
We've been on many world competitions...

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,910
and won a lot of them.

132
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,110
(The world-class crew that took over the world, MANNEQUEEN)

133
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,878
Let's go!

134
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,749
- Here we go. - I'm excited about the hideout.

135
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,179
- Right! - Here it comes.

136
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,489
(The crews' hideouts are on the 3rd floor.)

137
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,720
- It's pretty. There's a room. - Gosh.

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,419
Oh, we have to write these.

139
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,720
How about, "Who would dare?"

140
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,489
- I like it. - Good idea.

141
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,629
"Who would dare?"

142
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,029
"Dare?" They seriously wrote that.

143
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
"Dare?"

144
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,629
(Glaring)

145
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,370
(Silent)

146
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,699
- "Dare?" Dare what? - Ours...

147
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,198
- "Dare what?" - Dare what?

148
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,739
- Is that Deep N Dap? - What?

149
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,810
Deep N Dap?

150
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,638
I don't get it.

151
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,949
Do they honestly think that they stand a chance against us?

152
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,948
I'm actually curious.

153
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,018
(1MILLION's fight board)

154
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,679
- "We got first..." - "First prize."

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,250
Don't be ridiculous!

156
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,860
Don't be ridiculous!

157
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,360
- That's absurd. - They're YouTubers.

158
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:05,860
They're so lame.

159
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,099
They're the worst.

160
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,470
That was crazy.

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,828
Come on!

162
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,169
(The third crew arrives at its hideout.)

163
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,669
So cute!

164
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,869
Hi!

165
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,239
We're Deep N Dap.

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,009
- Nice to meet you. - Hi.

167
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,049
"Dap" means something along the lines of "great."

168
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,509
So, it means that we're great.

169
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,179
Hello, I'm the leader of Deep N Dap,

170
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,850
Mina Myoung. It's a pleasure.

171
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,948
The most famous one is...

172
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,560
"All I Wanna Do" by Jay Park.

173
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,828
(She can cover groovy solo artists...)

174
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,629
(and girl bands of various styles.)

175
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,699
(The legendary choreographer, Mina Myoung, )

176
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,569
(leads Deep N Dap, the trendy choreography crew.)

177
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,970
I love the green colour.

178
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,338
What was WAYB's colour in the first season?

179
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,539
- Blue? - Blue.

180
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,508
Then, BEBE will be the first to be eliminated.

181
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,339
(Then, BEBE will be the first to be eliminated.)

182
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,549
Let's go!

183
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,109
(BEBE is the 4th crew to come to Street Woman Fighter 2.)

184
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,119
That's a gorgeous blue colour.

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,019
BEBE, let's go!

186
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,349
Hi, we're...

187
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,959
- BEBE. - BEBE.

188
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,389
(Bada created the choreography for KAI's "Rover.")

189
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,059
I've been directing a lot of KAI's performances,

190
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,198
so a lot of people know me as a choreographer for artists.

191
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,568
(She's known for her work...)

192
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,969
(on "Savage" and the highlight of "Next Level" by aespa.)

193
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,568
(All K-pop fans know who Bada is, )

194
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,309
(and she leads BEBE.)

195
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,039
BEBE's strength is...

196
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,078
our popular appeal to the younger generation...

197
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,779
and the young energy.

198
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,250
Our weakness?

199
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,289
We're too innocent.

200
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,419
(Pure and innocent)

201
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,919
(Laughing)

202
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,359
Bada!

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
(Am I shaking?)

204
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,189
Goodness. What is it?

205
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,100
(The fifth crew to come to the fight club)

206
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,029
(Catching people's attention)

207
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,199
(This crew is intimidating from the get-go.)

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,699
Look. Street Woman Fighter 2.

209
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,440
Aren't we the only ones that dance street?

210
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,809
We're a hip-hop dance crew, Wolf'Lo.

211
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,408
Our crew's strength is...

212
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,210
that we're the best in dance-offs.

213
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,278
(All the dancers who are good at dance-offs)

214
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,289
We dance a specific genre of hip-hop that's called classic.

215
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,359
Congratulations on experiencing something new...

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,259
by going against us.

217
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,330
(Clapping)

218
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,229
All the moves that you've had so far?

219
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,629
You'll have to prepare much more than that.

220
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,199
Oh, this is...

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,799
These are the hideouts.

222
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,869
- I'm scared. - About what?

223
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,309
There's a researcher who failed her experiment.

224
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,710
Her hair...

225
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,179
Where's 1MILLION?

226
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,549
(At 1MILLION's hideout, they're just having fun.)

227
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,820
They must be here to have fun.

228
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,919
I guess they find still find it fun.

229
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,389
This is fun.

230
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,860
(The sixth crew at the fight club, JAM REPUBLIC)

231
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,759
Is that the trophy?

232
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,299
(What greets them?)

233
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,028
(The only trophy that will be given to the champion crew)

234
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,669
- Am I allowed to touch... - Are we allowed to touch it?

235
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay. Go on.

236
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,970
Oh, it's heavy.

237
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,769
(She can feel the weight of the crown on her fingers.)

238
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,969
Oh, cool. It's got our names on it!

239
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,609
Hi, we are...

240
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,440
- JAM REPUBLIC. - JAM REPUBLIC.

241
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,679
We're from many countries.

242
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,579
We're representing international queens...

243
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,419
and incredible dancers.

244
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,590
Hi, I'm Kirsten Dodgen from JAM REPUBLIC.

245
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,220
(Grinning)

246
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,959
I've been strongly a part of the Royal Family.

247
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,729
I've been very grateful...

248
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,469
to have performed with a lot of artists.

249
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,299
I've performed many times with Rihanna,

250
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,440
Justin Bieber,

251
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,009
and Jason Derulo.

252
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,979
I do have an eye into the K-pop world, and I think it's...

253
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,909
the perfect opportunity to see what comes from it, and...

254
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,080
I'm excited.

255
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,579
Coming all the way to Korea and doing this,

256
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,319
we're going to show it through our movements.

257
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,189
We're definitely going to fight to win.

258
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,388
We are bringing the world stage.

259
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,360
(Wait for the world-class performance.)

260
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,990
(All 8 crews have arrived at the fight club.)

261
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,429
(Where the intense dance-offs of 8 crews will take place)

262
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,000
(Which crew will enter the fight zone first?)

263
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,940
This is the fight zone.

264
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,569
That's incredible.

265
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,110
- It's pretty cool. - BEBE!

266
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,538
Okay. Shall we sit?

267
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,649
Let's sit.

268
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,849
I can't believe it.

269
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,120
- Me neither. - But it felt like I had to come.

270
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,850
Bring it.

271
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,789
(The evaluation video of BEBE by the other crews)

272
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:30,189
Who's the most successful one there? Bada?

273
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,058
She's taking over the choreography world.

274
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,769
The sensational choreographer.

275
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,269
Other than Bada, I don't...

276
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,769
see the appeal of that crew.

277
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,269
Of that crew.

278
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,639
Why don't we get closer?

279
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,308
They remind me of Aiki's group...

280
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,548
because she also had her students in the last season.

281
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,320
Yes. But her students seem stronger.

282
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,888
When you look at her students,

283
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,960
they just look like Bada's copycats.

284
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,658
Being Bada's student is their career.

285
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,729
Because they lack a career.

286
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,200
Why are they even here?

287
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,528
If they don't watch it,

288
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,369
it'll start and end with Bada.

289
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,470
I'm worried it won't even come to that.

290
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,570
Bada is more popular than her talent calls for.

291
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,479
(Glancing around)

292
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,939
Bada is relying on herself...

293
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,149
and participating with teammates who lack the skills?

294
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,879
Take care of your family and be the first to leave.

295
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,549
(The evaluation video about BEBE ends.)

296
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,159
(I didn't like that.)

297
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
I didn't like that.

298
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,959
I'm getting hotter as I get upset.

299
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,029
Me too.

300
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,340
- This makes me mad. - Me too.

301
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,469
(BEBE is speechless at the unexpected harsh criticism.)

302
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,940
The anger...

303
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,038
is rising inside of me.

304
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,979
- My hands are shaking. - Mine too.

305
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
(Shaking)

306
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,919
We got this.

307
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:00,450
(Nodding)

308
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,720
Let's show them.

309
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,548
Let's really show them.

310
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,189
Hurry up and come on.

311
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,320
(Hurry up and come on.)

312
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,928
- Don't get intimidated, everyone. - Right.

313
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,058
You know this is a competition.

314
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,960
Get hyped as we walk in. They're all dead.

315
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,330
Let's go.

316
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,200
(A scream turns the fight zone upside down!)

317
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,999
Hello.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,840
- I'm so excited. - This is pretty.

319
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,639
I'm so happy.

320
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,009
They must be happy.

321
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:26,308
- Are you ready? - Yes.

322
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,480
Oh, yes.

323
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,549
(The second crew that made a loud entrance)

324
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,548
- LADY BOUNCE. - BOUNCE.

325
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,119
- Hi. - Hi.

326
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,349
We're LADY BOUNCE.

327
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,719
We do hip-hop,

328
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,759
(Hip-hop)

329
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,159
voguing,

330
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,590
Afro,

331
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,928
tutting,

332
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,959
and many other genres of dance,

333
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,600
trying to interpret it in our own style.

334
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,168
We got together 15 years ago.

335
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,609
After leaving a dance studio,

336
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,268
we created a team called LADY BOUNCE.

337
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,079
We have strong and firm teamwork.

338
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,509
You won't be able to ignore the difference in quality.

339
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,079
(A long-standing, unique, and skilled crew)

340
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,220
(LADY BOUNCE has a noticeable unique style.)

341
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,590
This must be the fight zone.

342
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,360
Hello.

343
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,189
Hello, we're LADY BOUNCE.

344
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,259
Yes, sir.

345
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,830
(Staring)

346
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,168
They're good at staring.

347
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,138
(Strange tension hangs in the air between the two crews.)

348
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,008
They might be cold...

349
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,309
because they saw our comment.

350
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,808
I feel bad about that.

351
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,679
What can we do? We have to be objective.

352
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,449
(The evaluation video for LADY BOUNCE begins.)

353
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,419
It's a long-standing female hip-hop crew.

354
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,788
Everyone who has been dancing for a while knows them.

355
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,929
Those who are new won't know them.

356
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,859
(Is that so?)

357
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,758
I just passed by her,

358
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,128
so I don't know if her name is "NOB" or "Yes."

359
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,739
I don't know if her name is "NOB" or "Yes."

360
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,870
I just know she exists.

361
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,240
(NOB)

362
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,250
She's calling me "Yes?" Unbelievable.

363
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,079
They're an old crew.

364
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,979
They seem a bit outdated.

365
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,850
They are stuck in the past.

366
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,489
I think you're wrong.

367
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,860
(I think you're wrong.)

368
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,789
(Glaring at her)

369
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,099
Do you think the 15 years...

370
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,469
were created by themselves?

371
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,429
No, their studio created it for them.

372
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,240
Their studio created it for them.

373
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,739
They say they've been performing for 15 years,

374
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,980
but have they been doing it on their own?

375
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,250
Seriously?

376
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,548
For a crew that's been together for 15 years,

377
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,990
their performance isn't that impressive.

378
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,158
If they were a restaurant, I'd say the food is good,

379
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,658
but it's just one of the many restaurants on the street.

380
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,668
I know we can totally beat them.

381
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,370
Fifteen years is nothing.

382
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,408
This is infuriating.

383
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,509
(This is infuriating.)

384
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Come on.

385
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,879
Their attitude as they take our 15 years lightly is ridiculous.

386
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,350
Have they done it?

387
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,759
They called us outdated.

388
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,159
Those newbies.

389
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,289
Being young doesn't mean they're all modern.

390
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,599
I hate the silence.

391
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,699
Why aren't they here yet?

392
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,969
(Which crew is entering next?)

393
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,070
MANNEQUEEN is here.

394
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,869
I wonder how they're dressed.

395
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,398
It'll be flashier than anyone else.

396
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,570
A sparkly dress?

397
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,538
(They are right.)

398
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,609
Let's go.

399
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,079
(MANNEQUEEN enters the fight club.)

400
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,049
- They're so sparkly. - They look flashy.

401
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,980
It looks like Funky Y is at an awards ceremony.

402
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,548
Gorgeous.

403
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,090
She looks special.

404
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,960
(Glaring)

405
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,258
(Staring)

406
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,589
She doesn't avoid eye contact.

407
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,590
(All eyes are on them.)

408
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:03,860
Okay.

409
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,460
I'll show them what I got.

410
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,170
We need to restore order.

411
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,838
(They are at a loss for words.)

412
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,940
(MANNEQUEEN puts BEBE in their place.)

413
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,210
Thank you.

414
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,219
(Yoonji shows them what she's got.)

415
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,250
(Turning away coldly)

416
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,519
She drains my energy.

417
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,259
It didn't affect me.

418
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,789
- They look so young. - I know.

419
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,960
They're babies.

420
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,429
(The evaluation of MANNEQUEEN by the other crews)

421
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,730
Thank you.

422
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,639
- Stand up. - It's us.

423
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,308
They're so famous. Yoonji, Waackxxxy, Funky Y.

424
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:49,838
- The amazing waacking team. - That's right.

425
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,008
Yoonji.

426
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,578
She uses more facial expressions than dance skills.

427
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,910
I wouldn't call her a dancer.

428
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,279
(What did you just say?)

429
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,319
There's nothing special here for me.

430
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:10,489
She didn't stand out. She was the weakest in the group.

431
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,459
I don't know if they made her leader because she's the oldest...

432
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,029
or the best-known.

433
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,798
Her choreography is always the same.

434
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,108
(Meowing)

435
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,240
(Meowing)

436
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,439
It's like this.

437
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,509
I looked just like her, right?

438
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,880
What is she doing? Is she a cat?

439
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,949
Funky Y has been dancing for 17 years,

440
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,750
but she doesn't have a strong identity.

441
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,089
I think she should use this chance to objectify herself.

442
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,099
This is interesting.

443
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,769
Show them, Funky Y.

444
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,740
This makes me mad.

445
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,240
It makes me mad too.

446
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,210
What should we do?

447
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,548
- It's time for a global crew. - I know.

448
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,778
(Global crews, JAM REPUBLIC and TSUBA KILL, aren't here yet.)

449
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:03,949
Who is right next to us?

450
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,549
- It's TSUBA KILL. - I see.

451
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,778
They're right next to TSUBA KILL.

452
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,220
I bet the tension will be insane.

453
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,089
What were they thinking sitting next to us?

454
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,690
- TSUBA KILL. - From Japan.

455
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,389
It's Korea versus Japan.

456
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,430
- Come on. - Bring it on.

457
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,169
(Kirei.)

458
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,229
What does that mean?

459
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,299
- Pretty. - Pretty.

460
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,098
Nice to meet you.

461
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,439
(They say all the Japanese words they know.)

462
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,509
(Idiot)

463
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:32,078
Should we do it in Japanese?

464
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,439
(Overthrow)

465
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,578
(TSUBA KILL is the best in the world!)

466
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,809
(We are the winners.)

467
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,150
We are...

468
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,589
- TSUBA KILL. - TSUBA KILL.

469
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,319
Two, two.

470
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:46,258
Akanen is like a celebrity.

471
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,589
She's a celebrity in the world of dance.

472
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,258
That's how influential she is,

473
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,230
and everyone knows who she is.

474
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,868
I think she is number one...

475
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,269
in the Japanese choreography scene.

476
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,598
They always have Afro or dance hall moves.

477
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,169
Their role model...

478
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,339
seems to be Sayaka.

479
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:08,409
We each have our beauty and strength.

480
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,919
I watched this show in Japan.

481
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,548
There are many talented dancers in Japan,

482
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,889
but I was sad we weren't able to show the world.

483
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,318
We will show you the result...

484
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,758
we won't be ashamed of as the representative of Japan.

485
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,429
(You want to win, right?)

486
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,730
(Let's win.)

487
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,399
Let's go.

488
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,899
Let's go.

489
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,970
Let's go.

490
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,639
Hurry up. You're slow.

491
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,440
Korea is all about being fast.

492
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,309
This is awesome.

493
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,740
- Wait. It's huge. - Let's go.

494
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,649
This is cute.

495
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,710
I don't believe it.

496
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,119
Are they tourists?

497
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,088
This is awesome.

498
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,519
It's scary because everyone is so quiet.

499
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,689
They are dressed in traditional Japanese clothes.

500
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,690
Unbelievable.

501
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,259
They're dressed so nicely.

502
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,430
We should've worn hanbok.

503
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,858
Let's wear hanbok.

504
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,699
I suddenly feel patriotic.

505
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,130
We have to beat them.

506
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,170
Our seats are over there.

507
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,268
(All eyes are on them.)

508
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,038
They are all in battle mode.

509
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,849
(Laughing)

510
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,980
They're so cheerful.

511
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,880
Rena is very cute.

512
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,989
It's great that we can meet so many dancers at once.

513
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,088
- I agree. - Right?

514
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,490
They must be unfamiliar with this.

515
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,589
They must be so nervous being in a foreign country.

516
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,159
Imagine we had to battle in a different country.

517
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,268
They're very courageous to be here.

518
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,630
But we won't go easy on them.

519
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,239
They said our dance was low in quality.

520
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,769
- Who said that? - Next to you.

521
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,480
(The evaluation of TSUBA KILL by the other crews)

522
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,779
This is how we see it.

523
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,180
(Curious and focused)

524
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,788
There are numerous dancers...

525
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,450
who go to Japan to learn how to dance.

526
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,789
Japanese dancers are unique.

527
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,630
Okay, got it.

528
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,230
I feel relieved after seeing them dance together.

529
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,200
I feel the same.

530
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,399
I think there is a high possibility...

531
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,569
the Japanese team will get eliminated first.

532
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,180
They aren't as good as I imagined.

533
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,709
This is all they have...

534
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,309
when they are here to represent Japan?

535
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,680
There must be a talented crew,

536
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,690
but I don't think they're here.

537
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,289
Interesting.

538
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,859
I didn't expect goosebumps,

539
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,399
but I was hoping they'd catch my eye,

540
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,900
but it wasn't even eye-catching.

541
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,230
I expect them to be a disaster.

542
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,069
There are so many talented dancers in Japan.

543
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,240
They should pull themselves together.

544
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,079
(The evaluation video for TSUBA KILL ends.)

545
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,380
Unbelievable.

546
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,150
They're just mean.

547
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,989
(Laughing)

548
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,819
Sayaka.

549
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,258
They're shocked.

550
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,390
But it's true.

551
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,759
Right.

552
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,959
(No Respect, Teams currently named)

553
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
(What?)

554
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,099
Name all the weak members you think you can beat.

555
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,700
Weak members we can beat?

556
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,038
Not in choreography,

557
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,039
but in a freestyle battle? Okay.

558
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,980
I bet there are many.

559
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,709
What's this?

560
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,879
(4 people chose the members of TSUBA KILL as weak.)

561
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,079
Really?

562
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,919
(Akanen 2, Sayaka 1, Momo 1)

563
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,949
Interesting.

564
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,019
This will be interesting.

565
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,389
We get to see Akanen, Sayaka,

566
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,659
and Momo battle.

567
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,720
Nice.

568
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,559
Is Bada the only one with two No Respect votes?

569
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,660
Yes.

570
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,000
They didn't name the others because they don't know them.

571
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,929
They don't want to tire themselves out...

572
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,328
by battling them.

573
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,799
They can beat everyone else.

574
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,000
This keeps falling off.

575
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,900
(Hitting her leg)

576
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,509
Who else is coming?

577
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

578
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,009
It's Deep N Dap.

579
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,180
They're finally here.

580
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,318
They're finally here.

581
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,778
They fight with their words.

582
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,789
Funky Y...

583
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,989
They'll listen since they're in kindergarten.

584
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,858
(Mina Myoung attacked the other crews in the evaluation.)

585
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,829
People call everyone a choreographer nowadays.

586
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,859
It's offensive.

587
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,569
Mina Myoung is rude.

588
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
How is she going to take responsibility for her words?

589
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,200
Can't you use the loser's chip?

590
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,509
Put it on "lose."

591
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,710
Place the chip on the blackboard.

592
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:33,910
(Putting it up)

593
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,809
- She's upset. - This will be tough.

594
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,048
Hurry up.

595
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,619
Many people are waiting for you.

596
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,379
(They are here.)

597
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,849
My goodness.

598
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,859
Hooray.

599
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,990
Who was that?

600
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,359
- Hooray. - This is cool.

601
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,298
(Seven women enter giving off a strong vibe.)

602
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,328
Hello.

603
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,730
- Hello. - This is insane.

604
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,099
They're so noisy.

605
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,700
They're so loud.

606
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,970
So loud!

607
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,440
We're so loud.

608
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,809
We're so loud.

609
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,380
They're all laughing.

610
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,989
Where are our seats?

611
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,750
Do we sit here?

612
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,219
Go up.

613
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,219
They talk the most.

614
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,390
(Nodding)

615
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,699
The noisiest person dies first in movies.

616
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,858
(Noisy)

617
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,029
(Let's wait and see.)

618
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:34,299
Why is the loser's chip under "lose?"

619
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,369
Is it supposed to be here?

620
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:37,640
Did someone put it there?

621
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,939
- Who put it here? - No one.

622
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,108
Who put it here?

623
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,950
(Feigning ignorance)

624
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,150
I don't know.

625
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:48,220
Why is it here?

626
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,649
I'm the "worst" leader.

627
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,919
Could it be here because of that?

628
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
(Remembering)

629
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,028
(Crew pre-evaluation)

630
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,758
(They voted for the leader who seems least qualified.)

631
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,460
(Who got the most votes out of the 8 leaders?)

632
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,499
(Deep N Dap's leader Mina Myoung was chosen as the worst leader.)

633
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,068
Okay.

634
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,700
(Deep N Dap's leader Mina Myoung was chosen as the worst leader.)

635
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,308
Mina Myoung of Deep N Dap.

636
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,879
(Mina Myoung was chosen as the No Respect leader by 15 people.)

637
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,380
The worst leader?

638
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,740
Excuse me!

639
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,249
- Who voted for her? - Okay.

640
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,950
- Are they out of their minds? - Our leader?

641
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,479
Out of the eight teams?

642
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,890
(Nodding)

643
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,959
My hands are shaking.

644
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,959
- My hands are shaking. - No.

645
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,730
Calm down.

646
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,230
I'm not sure how many leaders...

647
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,460
possess the leadership I do.

648
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,299
I can never admit it.

649
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,539
I'm curious what people will say in the video about this team.

650
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,369
(The evaluation of Deep N Dap by the other crews)

651
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,749
In the case of Mina Myoung,

652
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,479
she's famous, and I've heard of her since a long time ago.

653
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,048
However, as a leader,

654
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,318
does she have the ability or foundation...

655
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,059
required to lead a team?

656
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,630
Okay.

657
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,299
I don't know Mina Myoung that well.

658
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
She's just one of the dancers.

659
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,839
She's unbelievable.

660
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,169
That was the harshest.

661
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,309
What comes to mind when I hear of Mina Myoung...

662
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,769
is 1MILLION.

663
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,339
All her experience is with 1MILLION.

664
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,709
"I used to teach 1MILLION."

665
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,909
"I got this many views with 1MILLION."

666
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,480
It's the biggest part of her career.

667
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,549
I did all that.

668
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,889
Mina Myoung.

669
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,920
(Calm down, Mina Myoung.)

670
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,390
That's where JJ went.

671
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,900
Members of 1MILLION are here.

672
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,529
Is it okay to do this when they were part of 1MILLION?

673
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,529
They all know she was a member of 1MILLION.

674
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,400
That's so ungrateful.

675
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,399
That's so ungrateful.

676
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,170
Ungrateful? What are you talking about?

677
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,308
She wouldn't have had a chance if it weren't for Lia.

678
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:52,410
I know.

679
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,539
It's unbelievable.

680
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,879
Since they derived from 1MILLION,

681
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
you could say they are our students.

682
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:03,990
(The evaluation video for Deep N Dap ends.)

683
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,118
That was harsh.

684
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,619
They must be upset because of 1MILLION.

685
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,829
They're facing 1MILLION.

686
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,900
Deep N Dap and 1MILLION have a long history.

687
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,399
Did Mina Myoung and Lia Kim...

688
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,939
meet for the first time here?

689
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,969
After Mina Myoung left?

690
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,669
- I don't think they met. - At all?

691
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,170
I think things ended badly between them.

692
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,879
My goodness.

693
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,980
(The dancers are surprised Lia Kim and Mina Myoung are participating.)

694
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,549
Wait. They're both on the show?

695
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,819
- They meet again here. - Unbelievable.

696
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,419
(Mina Myoung, Lia Kim)

697
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,819
That's a video of them dancing together.

698
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,990
I don't believe it.

699
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,489
I know of Mina Myoung as one of the core members...

700
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,190
who led 1MILLION to become better with Lia Kim in the start.

701
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,298
They were together for a long time like a duet,

702
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,130
but I heard they parted on bad terms.

703
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,869
They were dancing separately.

704
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,569
Since 2017 or 2018,

705
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,740
I didn't even speak to Lia Kim.

706
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,379
If she carefully thinks about...

707
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,779
why no one is there anymore,

708
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,880
she'll know the answer.

709
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,919
- They haven't met for years, right? - That's right.

710
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,390
Are they meeting for 1st first time in 4 to 5 years?

711
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,490
This is crazy.

712
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:13,059
They'll throw punches at each other.

713
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,019
It's not my business.

714
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,789
- Watching fights is the best. - I agree.

715
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,230
They're finally coming.

716
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,798
(Curious and looking forward to it)

717
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,629
Here they come. I hear them.

718
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,669
- I think they're coming. - They're here.

719
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,930
(I think 1MILLION is coming.)

720
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,139
I'm looking forward to this the most.

721
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,569
I wonder how much tension there will be between them.

722
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,140
(1MILLION enters with all the dancers watching them.)

723
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,410
(Eyes fixed on them)

724
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,559
(The tension in the fight zone is suffocating.)

725
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,829
There is so much tension I don't believe it.

726
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,900
(1MILLION and Deep N Dap finally meet.)

727
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,508
(Turning her head)

728
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,539
(Lia Kim turns her head after glancing at Mina Myoung.)

729
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,079
(1MILLION and Deep N Dap are facing each other.)

730
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,018
- We're seated facing Deep N Dap. - I know.

731
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,779
Our eyes keep meeting.

732
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,089
I feel nauseous right now.

733
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,559
The reactions are so interesting.

734
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,088
They keep looking at each other.

735
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,259
It's scary.

736
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,569
I feel my energy getting drained.

737
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,129
Do I put this up?

738
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,798
(The evaluation of 1MILLION begins in the tense atmosphere.)

739
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,169
1MILLION...

740
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,608
made Korean choreographers become known as talented.

741
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:40,538
I admit that.

742
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,880
They aren't as trendy as Deep N Dap.

743
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,149
My goodness. She said that? I'm sorry.

744
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,579
(Glaring at her)

745
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,489
- She glared at me. - Watch this.

746
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,118
(They learned Lia was on the show during the crew lineup reveal.)

747
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,358
It's okay.

748
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,829
(Barking)

749
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,660
That was amazing.

750
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,828
- That gave me the chills. - Good job.

751
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:02,999
Even my dog knows.

752
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,130
It has a good judgement of character.

753
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,039
(What did you say?)

754
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,368
(Mina Myoung learned Lia Kim would be on the show.)

755
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,440
My goodness.

756
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,140
Let's hear what they say.

757
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,808
I feel anger rising inside me.

758
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,579
(I feel anger rising inside me.)

759
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,618
(Come on up.)

760
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,849
- Come on up. - Please.

761
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,929
When I saw the members,

762
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,229
I felt like yawning.

763
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,230
Honestly, if I were a member of that crew,

764
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,899
I'd feel so embarrassed.

765
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,469
You can't be part of us.

766
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,839
There is no way you'd be a member of our crew.

767
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,680
She has so much experience with choreography.

768
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,109
Who cares?

769
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,710
Didn't someone else choreograph this dance?

770
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:52,619
This.

771
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:54,920
- Really? - Really?

772
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,919
She came up with this dance.

773
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,859
Is she seriously going to talk like that?

774
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,490
She's out of her mind.

775
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:06,500
I guess she might pick me as the No Respect Dancer.

776
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,400
She wouldn't be my choice because she's not even worth it.

777
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,500
If she gets...

778
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,000
her butt kicked...

779
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,839
(Oh, boy.)

780
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,339
It'd be so embarrassing.

781
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,450
I'm not scared of her.

782
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,349
I'm not scared of her.

783
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,348
You're not scared of me?

784
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:33,589
(Tension builds up more because of their war of nerves.)

785
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,960
- You're not scared of me? Really? - Right.

786
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,859
We'll see.

787
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,368
I don't know what she thought was unfair to her.

788
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,899
I just can't understand.

789
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,999
She's staring hard.

790
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,838
- Who? - Lia Kim.

791
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,170
At us? She'll make a hole in our faces.

792
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,680
The fight is real for those two.

793
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,278
It's real. It's like they're here to actually fight.

794
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,410
I really hope they won't lose and leave in the first round.

795
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,920
I want to see them fight.

796
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,250
A fight between grown-ups. It's going to be fun.

797
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,558
Who's next?

798
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,589
(Which crew will join them next?)

799
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,588
Oh, my goodness.

800
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,929
Wolf'Lo is so scary.

801
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,999
I think they're all ready to come right out.

802
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,829
"Let's go. Let's do this."

803
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,470
I can't wait to compete.

804
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:20,940
What's that? It surprised me.

805
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,609
- "To the fight zone." - Let's go.

806
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,039
- We're up. - Shall we?

807
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,809
Fight zone.

808
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,009
They should all know what an honour this is.

809
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,079
Let's meet those soon-to-be losers.

810
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,979
I think they're coming.

811
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,249
There's a buzz.

812
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,619
- They're coming. - They're coming.

813
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,318
We should howl.

814
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,920
(Howling)

815
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,089
- Here they come. - I want to see their aura.

816
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,799
(Wolf'Lo walks into the fight zone without hesitation.)

817
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,969
This is going to be fun.

818
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,700
- This is amazing. - I love it.

819
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,098
- They're scary. - They're so scary.

820
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,368
They were my seniors at school.

821
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,409
Really?

822
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,278
I'm scared. Don't look up.

823
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,109
They look cute.

824
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,480
You're right.

825
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,920
(Amazed)

826
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,320
Their charisma.

827
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,619
It's powerful.

828
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,219
They look so confident.

829
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,158
Halo is wearing black lipstick.

830
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,460
Really?

831
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,589
Haechi Wang has such a powerful presence.

832
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,698
- Haechi Wang is quite a character. - It's no joke.

833
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,169
How cool.

834
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,868
I've seen that hair in the "Harry Potter" movie.

835
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,039
- Her hair is so scary. - Quiet. She might hear you.

836
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,239
She's looking around.

837
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,309
A staredown.

838
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,579
- They're scary. - They're scary.

839
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,848
- They're intimidating. - They're real tough girls.

840
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,479
- Right. They look confident. - They're what you call tough girls.

841
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,489
- It shows their experience. - You're right.

842
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,118
I used to be a huge fan of Chocol's.

843
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,219
- Really? - I was basically a groupie.

844
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,090
Where do we sit?

845
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,229
- Over there. - I see.

846
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,829
They ranked us number eight.

847
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,598
(Everyone...)

848
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,130
(freezes.)

849
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,638
Come here for a second.

850
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,369
(They ranked us number 8.)

851
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,669
(So it's you.)

852
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,010
Guys, come here.

853
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,709
Hang on. What are they, loan sharks?

854
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,078
They're frightening.

855
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,179
BEBE?

856
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,050
- Don't be intimidated. - Gosh.

857
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:18,218
(Tension runs high in the fight zone.)

858
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,219
- BEBE? - I know.

859
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,690
Gosh, what do we do?

860
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,289
"What do we do"?

861
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,459
Poor Bada. She's frightened.

862
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,630
(Bada)

863
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,699
Gosh.

864
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,170
This place is tough.

865
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,639
It's really tough.

866
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,309
I'm getting...

867
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,550
a little annoyed.

868
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,279
- There's a war of nerves going on. - There is.

869
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,288
They're laughing, but it's actually a war of nerves.

870
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,590
I can feel it. They're tough.

871
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,630
- They'll play something, right? - Play what?

872
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,789
I wonder how they bad-mouthed us.

873
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,868
Here we go.

874
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:07,170
(The other crews' evaluation of Wolf'Lo)

875
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,538
Hello!

876
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,908
We finally have a good street dance team.

877
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,009
Street dance!

878
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,650
- Hello, ma'ams. - Hello, ma'ams.

879
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,949
Hello.

880
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,179
Look how nice they are now.

881
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,619
- Why are you only nice to them? - I'm sorry.

882
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,150
They're a legitimate hip-hop dance crew,

883
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,689
and I wonder if the public could understand their work.

884
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,360
Of course. They certainly can.

885
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,529
"I go my way. I don't care what you say."

886
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,099
With that kind of attitude, how will they choreograph for the missions...

887
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,539
and survive each stage?

888
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:42,638
That was chill.

889
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,368
- Like we're here in a jam session. - Yes.

890
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,678
- You know what I mean? - Yes.

891
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,609
I don't really want to see their dance...

892
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,309
because I think it's going to be bad.

893
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,019
(Shocked)

894
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,349
- What the... - What? You don't want to see it?

895
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,090
(Swallowing hard)

896
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,789
Honestly, I think their moves are old.

897
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,360
Honestly, I think their moves are old.

898
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,788
(Who was that?)

899
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,329
Honestly, I think their moves are old.

900
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:07,698
She doesn't know the difference between old and classic,

901
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,000
so let's show her the meaning of classic.

902
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,400
Why is she suddenly so quiet?

903
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,139
What? She's 40 years old?

904
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,440
(Momo is shocked.)

905
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,808
(The unexpected attack against age makes them burst into laughter.)

906
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,280
(Oh, boy.)

907
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,150
(Laughing)

908
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,619
Who's that?

909
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,149
That's so mean.

910
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,289
Seriously, girls.

911
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,889
Isn't she the oldest one here?

912
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,259
That's right, she is.

913
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,159
She's a dancer with a lot of experience.

914
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,699
Let's sit.

915
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,059
They're scary.

916
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,268
They don't know anything.

917
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,340
They can't even say anything other than our moves are old.

918
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,570
Well, it's true. We are old.

919
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,010
They'll get old too.

920
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,010
Don't be so upset about age.

921
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,249
I'm young, so it's fine.

922
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,880
(Not offended at all)

923
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,348
That's just you!

924
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,348
(The youngest member of Wolf'Lo)

925
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,788
You know, their presence...

926
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:08,320
has changed the air in this place.

927
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,789
They have strong characters, and it really is intimidating.

928
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,760
They are dope.

929
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,460
I can't lose to them.

930
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:17,369
- I'll beat them with dance. - I know. They are...

931
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,799
This is the last one.

932
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,099
This crew is intimidating.

933
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,969
It's amazing that JAM REPUBLIC is here.

934
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:25,010
I guess we finally get to meet Kirsten.

935
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,709
You're right. My gosh.

936
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,440
We'll be seeing Kirsten in person.

937
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,110
She's a celebrity among dancers.

938
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,479
Kirsten was supposed to come to Korea,

939
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,049
so I signed up for all four of her classes.

940
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,888
But she couldn't come because of her visa.

941
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,419
I'm not lying. I actually cried.

942
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,019
- I was so upset. - Don't say that.

943
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,059
Seriously. This is a competition.

944
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,199
Yes. Get out!

945
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,929
"Get out?" They're not even here yet.

946
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,029
Hey. Don't even blink when Kirsten gets here.

947
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,300
- Of course not. - Stare her down.

948
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,070
(Glaring)

949
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,239
I'm practicing.

950
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,579
(In the hideout of the last crew)

951
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,980
(Screaming)

952
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,049
Are you ready?

953
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,319
(Excited)

954
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,119
- That was so exciting. - Oh, my gosh.

955
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,618
That was so exciting.

956
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:12,919
- I love you. Thank you. - Okay.

957
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,760
- Shall we do this? - Let's do this.

958
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,558
Entrance. It's going to be fire.

959
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,559
- Yes. - Let's go.

960
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,828
Three, two, one.

961
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:19,860
- Yes! - Yes!

962
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,768
Okay. Do you remember...

963
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,129
I hope we get the flag.

964
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,529
They're coming.

965
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,000
Here we go. They are coming.

966
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,539
We're going...

967
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:32,609
- Oh, my gosh. - Darn.

968
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,239
- Gosh. - Gosh.

969
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,050
Oh, my. You guys. This is crazy.

970
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,849
- Are we ready? - Yes.

971
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,448
Oh, my gosh.

972
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,819
(They enter with a powerful presence.)

973
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,319
- Gosh. - Hello.

974
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,360
Gosh.

975
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,658
Come on.

976
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:51,988
Welcome to Korea.

977
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,300
(Welcome to Street Woman Fighter 2.)

978
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,260
I can't believe they're actually here.

979
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,570
This is so cool.

980
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,238
- Look at her figure. - It's crazy.

981
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,869
She reminds me of Gabee.

982
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,409
I can feel their energy.

983
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,138
Look at Audrey.

984
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,348
- Audrey is so beautiful. - I know, right?

985
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:12,348
Wait, she's so pretty.

986
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,079
I know. She's beautiful.

987
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,289
Gosh, she's gorgeous.

988
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,189
What? We have a doll.

989
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,658
She's twinkling.

990
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,629
She's like a girl from a teen movie.

991
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,729
She actually looks like Audrey Hepburn.

992
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,229
Maybe she's named after her.

993
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,198
She should be on top of a music box.

994
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,968
She's an eye-catcher.

995
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,769
- Right? - She's really beautiful.

996
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,268
It's okay. We're more beautiful.

997
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:34,699
She looks like Anne Hathaway.

998
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,638
We're more beautiful. You look more like Anne Hathaway.

999
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,010
(You're the best, Tatter.)

1000
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,940
I wonder how many of them were chosen as the No Respect Dancer.

1001
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:44,309
I want to hear what they said about JAM REPUBLIC.

1002
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,980
I wonder what they said.

1003
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,018
This is going to be fun.

1004
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:49,690
I can't wait. Let's see it.

1005
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,989
(The other crews' evaluation of JAM REPUBLIC begins.)

1006
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,030
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

1007
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,199
I was not ready for this.

1008
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,828
JAM REPUBLIC's strength is...

1009
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,670
their experience at big events. You can't ignore that.

1010
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,010
They all think they're the best.

1011
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,808
Every one of them wants to be the heroine.

1012
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,110
Will they be able to show a united front?

1013
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,149
In Royal Family,

1014
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,619
Kirsten is usually their number two.

1015
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,289
Number two?

1016
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,989
(Glancing)

1017
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,030
Why isn't Parris Goebel coming?

1018
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,299
Parris Goebel? That's insulting.

1019
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,598
I was so excited...

1020
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,170
thinking Parris Goebel was coming.

1021
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,609
Parris Goebel has the most powerful presence.

1022
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,809
I'm glad she's not going to be here.

1023
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,309
She really got used.

1024
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,848
- Are they fake? - You're right.

1025
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,449
A second-rate version of Royal Family?

1026
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:53,819
That's so mean.

1027
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,849
Gosh.

1028
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,389
It looks fake?

1029
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:58,920
Oh, my gosh.

1030
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,289
(Glancing)

1031
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:07,598
Audrey. She obviously lacks experience.

1032
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,969
She's like an amateur dancer.

1033
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,400
(Amateur)

1034
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,070
Honestly, she's like a novice.

1035
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,670
She's still like a baby.

1036
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,139
My eyes go to her face, not her moves.

1037
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,078
She's a pretty doll.

1038
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,509
She's a pretty doll,

1039
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,619
so she could just stand still and do nothing.

1040
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:29,019
I'm crying.

1041
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,989
(No Respect Dancers on JAM REPUBLIC)

1042
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:33,719
- Word. - Interesting.

1043
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:38,029
(JAM REPUBLIC was chosen by 10 people as the weakest dancer.)

1044
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,729
(Audrey)

1045
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,659
(Audrey)

1046
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,769
(Everyone is shocked.)

1047
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,980
Yes!

1048
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,809
She's thrilled.

1049
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,279
What does that thumbs-up mean? I'm curious.

1050
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,018
How could she thank everyone...

1051
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:04,690
- for such a thing? - I know, right?

1052
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,090
That's dumb.

1053
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,119
You got this, girl.

1054
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,529
- Show them. - Show them how it's done.

1055
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,230
They didn't know who they chose.

1056
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:13,558
This is brutal.

1057
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:15,460
This must hurt. What if she cries later?

1058
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,469
I bet she's shocked.

1059
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,538
This is how you get burned in Korea.

1060
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,340
Hang in there, Audrey.

1061
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,908
They've come to a tough place.

1062
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:25,539
Welcome to your nightmare.

1063
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,939
- She got the most votes. - I know.

1064
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,408
- She must compete with six people. - Six?

1065
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,519
- She has to dance six times. - I wonder how she feels right now.

1066
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,948
I feel like your lips are like this.

1067
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,949
It's like my smile is shaking.

1068
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:41,159
Wait, you two...

1069
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,489
(Sighing)

1070
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,029
(This place is scary.)

1071
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,800
This is so much more than what I thought it would be.

1072
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,029
I still can't believe I'm in the same space...

1073
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,468
as JAM REPUBLIC.

1074
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:54,499
This is large-scale.

1075
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,069
It's insane. This is unbelievable.

1076
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,170
This feels more intense than the last season, doesn't it?

1077
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,309
Everyone is here now.

1078
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,179
The real battle begins now.

1079
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,249
(They compete fiercely against the weakest dancer of their choice.)

1080
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,218
(A strong global dance crew has joined Street Woman Fighter 2.)

1081
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:15,658
(A battle between the teacher and the student)

1082
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:18,590
(What's the meaning of their tears?)

1083
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:21,329
Gosh, it scared me.

1084
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,529
Is the show host coming?

1085
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,570
He'll walk in through there.

1086
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,440
It's Daniel!

1087
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,009
- He's gorgeous. - My gosh!

1088
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,510
- For two seasons straight. - He's back.

1089
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,709
Now it really feels like we're starting.

1090
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,848
Hello. Welcome to the Mnet original dance series,

1091
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,549
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1092
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,988
I'm your host, Kang Daniel.

1093
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:44,149
(Cheering)

1094
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,448
(Welcoming the host)

1095
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,919
I was so happy to see him.

1096
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,959
He's an experienced show host...

1097
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,959
who hosted "Street Woman Fighter" and "Street Man Fighter."

1098
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,729
I thought about who could replace him,

1099
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,130
but none came to mind.

1100
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,299
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1101
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,299
Not only the best dancing crews in Korea...

1102
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,099
but global named crews have joined us,

1103
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:02,169
making this a bigger international dance competition.

1104
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,409
You'll fight to crush all the other crews...

1105
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,940
(I'll crush them all.)

1106
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,309
and reach the top. Only one crew can do that.

1107
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:10,609
1MILLION.

1108
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,679
Us.

1109
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,479
Frankly, in the current state,

1110
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,779
they could never beat us.

1111
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,150
We're about to change the game, and I hope you're ready.

1112
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:20,589
I'm going to do everything in my power,

1113
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,960
win the competition, and go back to Japan.

1114
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,459
Here's the first dance battle...

1115
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,760
to be the winner of this competition.

1116
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,399
The signature of the Mnet original dance series.

1117
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,110
No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer.

1118
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,808
(Thrilled)

1119
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:42,538
Pick the weakest dancer.

1120
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,610
Yes!

1121
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:46,348
All right then. Please get changed for the battle.

1122
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:48,019
We'll meet back here in the fight zone.

1123
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,518
Let's smash the place.

1124
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,988
JAM REPUBLIC and TSUBA KILL seemed...

1125
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,589
a little dazed.

1126
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,659
They're just excited.

1127
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,459
Exactly. Have fun. It's chill.

1128
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,959
It's not that deep.

1129
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,860
It's like playing a game. It's game time.

1130
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:05,499
Audrey's pants are covered with the stickers.

1131
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Are they?

1132
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:07,999
Do you see who has the most stickers?

1133
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,170
- I think it might be Audrey. - Yes.

1134
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,468
This column will remain empty.

1135
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,110
Nothing will get on it.

1136
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,039
Only this column will be full.

1137
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,308
I'm so lucky to be on the same team as Waackxxxy.

1138
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,719
How could anyone beat such a woman?

1139
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:22,718
Look at Waackxxxy. So intimidating.

1140
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,589
She's dancing while doing crunches.

1141
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,948
(The 8 crews are ready for the battle.)

1142
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,689
Now, let me introduce the three fight judges...

1143
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,889
who will be the judges of your dance-offs.

1144
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,828
Who are they?

1145
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:34,900
I can't wait.

1146
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,169
She's a dancer with unique moves who was born to be a woman of power.

1147
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,099
The leader of PROWDMAN, Monika!

1148
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,010
(Everyone is surprised.)

1149
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,309
Monika!

1150
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,840
From the first season.

1151
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,550
Okay, I got it.

1152
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,178
(Monika captivated us...)

1153
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:56,079
(with her rough words and honesty in the previous season.)

1154
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,348
(She's the leader of PROWDMAN...)

1155
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,860
(who creates unique colours for her crew with new ideas.)

1156
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,619
She's beautiful.

1157
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,429
I can accept her as the judge.

1158
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,760
We're going to hear her biting words today.

1159
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,929
The artist known for his powerful and sexy performance.

1160
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,340
The leader and main dancer of MONSTA X, Shownu!

1161
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,440
(This is incredible.)

1162
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:22,440
This?

1163
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,519
(He's known for his solid dance skills and sexy performance.)

1164
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,589
(He's a talented artist...)

1165
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,218
(with great energy and powerful moves.)

1166
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,819
(The main dancer of MONSTA X)

1167
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,329
(Shownu)

1168
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,429
I'm a big fan of MONSTA X's.

1169
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,130
He's like a ray of sunshine in this tough place.

1170
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:46,939
From the perspective of both the public and a pro dancer,

1171
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,039
he'll make a balanced assessment, and I'm looking forward to it.

1172
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,308
In this new season of Street Woman Fighter,

1173
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,480
we'll have a special judge in each mission.

1174
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,948
Oh, my gosh!

1175
00:47:56,949 --> 00:48:00,119
Let me introduce the special judge for this battle.

1176
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,448
The leader...

1177
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:04,420
of the world-world-renowned dance crew, the Kinjaz. Mike Song!

1178
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,860
Mike Song!

1179
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,529
(Cheering)

1180
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,559
Mike Song!

1181
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,000
Yes!

1182
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,529
(He's a legendary dancer who has participated in...)

1183
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,500
(international dance competitions with dancers all over the world.)

1184
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,339
- Little sad. - Yes.

1185
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,309
(Mike Song made sharp and witty comments as the judge.)

1186
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,709
He's a world-famous dancer.

1187
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,519
I think having an international judge...

1188
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,288
makes the competition international,

1189
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,250
and it makes it on a higher level.

1190
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,118
This is an insane lineup.

1191
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,119
(An insane lineup)

1192
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,158
It's well-balanced. A choreography and a street dancer.

1193
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,589
Monika, our fight judge.

1194
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,359
What will be your criteria today?

1195
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,529
Honestly, some of the crew leaders here...

1196
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,299
have been a dance contest judge for a long time.

1197
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,908
So I dare say...

1198
00:48:56,909 --> 00:49:00,009
I'll be cruelly objective and consider only what I see here.

1199
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,110
I won't consider my seniors' achievements in the past...

1200
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,480
but only the results.

1201
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,379
Based on what I've learned in my music career...

1202
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,578
and my sincere love for this show,

1203
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,089
I'll evaluate your dance honestly.

1204
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,888
Everybody here is a professional.

1205
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:15,259
I don't need to tell you that.

1206
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,388
And it's going to be whoever's day it is today.

1207
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,259
I have much respect for all of you guys.

1208
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,829
I'll do my best to be...

1209
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,899
a perfect judge for you today.

1210
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,500
(You guys are the best.)

1211
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,569
Now, lastly,

1212
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,308
it's our DJ who'll play music for the battle. DJ SOM!

1213
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:35,380
Yes! Let's go!

1214
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,808
When the battle begins,

1215
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:40,578
each dancer will be given 40 seconds to dance.

1216
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:42,518
When it's over, the judges...

1217
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:44,690
will hold up their cards to decide the winner.

1218
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,518
But if two or more judges ask for a rematch,

1219
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,658
the two dancers will dance at the same time...

1220
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,558
to determine the winner.

1221
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,928
According to the results, you'll get a chip.

1222
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:58,669
Please put it on your crew board...

1223
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,800
and count your wins and losses.

1224
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:04,569
No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer.

1225
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,609
We'll begin Round One.

1226
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,009
(Let's do this.)

1227
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,610
Oh, my gosh. It's starting.

1228
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:11,948
The floor looks great, and things are heating up.

1229
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:12,949
I'm going to crush them all.

1230
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,249
Would anyone dare to pick me? Go ahead.

1231
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,819
I'm not mad at you. I don't care.

1232
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,959
I'm going to destroy them and teach them a lesson.

1233
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,989
The 1st dancer for the 1st battle is...

1234
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,699
From 1MILLION...

1235
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,639
I'm going to show them how it's done.

1236
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,638
Redy.

1237
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,268
(Redy of 1MILLION)

1238
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,238
- Yes! Let's go! - Redy!

1239
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,839
- Let's go! - Redy, are you ready?

1240
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,179
- Are you ready? Ready or not? - Let's do it.

1241
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,650
Let's go, Redy.

1242
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,219
She looks so young.

1243
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,848
(When the crews were revealed)

1244
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:49,920
Redy.

1245
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,549
She's 25 and has been a dancer for 9 years.

1246
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,558
- The girl before was 16 years old? - Yes.

1247
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,789
Yes? It's nine years.

1248
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,558
She's always been known as a good dancer.

1249
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,099
She got a lot of attention. She was a hot rookie.

1250
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,500
Redy has distinctive characteristics.

1251
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,599
- Gosh, it scared me. - Goodness.

1252
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:07,300
It's so unique.

1253
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,769
She has her own unique style.

1254
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:11,710
I bet she lives in her own unique world.

1255
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:14,078
She has unique vibes,

1256
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,380
and she dances like a cat.

1257
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,510
A cat well in control of her body.

1258
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:20,879
She's one of the hottest dancers...

1259
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,288
on 1MILLION right now. She gets amazing numbers of views.

1260
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,250
(Redy's video gets the most views.)

1261
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,518
Redy of 1MILLION.

1262
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,929
Please pick a dancer you think you can beat.

1263
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,399
Hey, you should all be prepared.

1264
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,460
Will it be me?

1265
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,729
- Let's see. - Let's see if she picks one of us.

1266
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,800
Who will she pick?

1267
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,939
(They suddenly started trying some weird moves.)

1268
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,110
(It was like a dance to trot music.)

1269
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,679
- Trot music? - Trot music?

1270
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,980
(Redy?)

1271
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,509
Redy? Where's she? Who?

1272
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,549
(Who's that?)

1273
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,178
(I don't even know who she is.)

1274
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,189
(She came up to me.)

1275
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,190
(I was sitting in the back, )

1276
00:51:58,191 --> 00:51:59,889
(and it was hilarious.)

1277
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:03,488
I always stand up for myself. That's who I am.

1278
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:04,659
Well...

1279
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,190
As...

1280
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,429
Why is she coming over here?

1281
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,429
The No Respect Dancer, I choose...

1282
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,599
- Is it us? - Why?

1283
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,369
(Redy called Halo's dance trot.)

1284
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,280
As the No Respect Dancer, I choose...

1285
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,348
Oh, it wasn't us.

1286
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,650
I was seething.

1287
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,820
I've wanted to battle her.

1288
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,550
Because I can win.

1289
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,948
(Who's her opponent that she thinks she can win?)

1290
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:33,690
It's Bada of BEBE.

1291
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,320
- Okay! - Let's go.

1292
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,859
(Redy chooses Bada, BEBE's leader.)

1293
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,198
Bada!

1294
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,300
Do you know Bada?

1295
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,900
I've heard of her name.

1296
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:46,699
- She's a famous choreographer. - A choreographer, I see.

1297
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,639
(Even Mike Song has heard of Bada's name.)

1298
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,440
She's currently the most popular one.

1299
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,739
Most dancers will know who Bada is.

1300
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:57,709
Which dancer makes the most choreographies?

1301
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,250
The most popular one among entertainment agencies.

1302
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:01,519
Me?

1303
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,789
No one else can dance like me in the dance world.

1304
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,590
I think I'm pretty good too.

1305
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,488
(You're the best.)

1306
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:12,059
Look at her choreography history!

1307
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,960
"Next Level" by aespa.

1308
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,399
This move from "Next Level."

1309
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,459
(Doing the highlight of the song)

1310
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,070
- Right away. - I made that.

1311
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:26,139
It's safe to say that Bada's choreo has become a whole genre.

1312
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,779
She's trendy.

1313
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,979
(This choreographer is even loved by the artists' fans.)

1314
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,448
Among the choreographers for female bands,

1315
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:32,650
she's probably one of the best.

1316
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,549
And she's tall,

1317
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,820
so she fills the screen.

1318
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,250
And she's incredibly strong.

1319
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,190
She's like the female version of Vata.

1320
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,019
She must only have strengths.

1321
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:45,058
- I guess so. - Right.

1322
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,428
But I feel like she's...

1323
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:48,630
a bit stiff.

1324
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,829
Redy's going against Bada. This should be fun.

1325
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,699
You must be calm yet crazy.

1326
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,539
Why did I pick her?

1327
00:53:56,769 --> 00:53:59,739
I'd have to talk to you all night to explain it.

1328
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,110
I'm serious.

1329
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:03,609
She's too...

1330
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,078
(Relax.)

1331
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,150
She's getting angry.

1332
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,679
She's not using her body.

1333
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,718
She's a dancer, and she's not using her body?

1334
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,388
But it's not like she's doing it on purpose like doing the robot.

1335
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:15,360
It's more like she can't.

1336
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,729
But you two were in the same crew once.

1337
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,789
Were you?

1338
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,260
Yes.

1339
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,899
Bada and I were on the same team,

1340
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,469
and it was called Cupcakes.

1341
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,598
Bada of BEBE.

1342
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,170
(Redy chose Bada as the No Respect Dancer.)

1343
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:31,808
I thought so.

1344
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:33,379
Because they were in the same crew.

1345
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,480
Are they on bad terms?

1346
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,449
We used to...

1347
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,150
dance together.

1348
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,479
We were best friends.

1349
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,618
(Bada and Redy)

1350
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:43,719
We practically grew up together.

1351
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,619
We relied on each other when we were on the team.

1352
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:49,820
I used to like her.

1353
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,158
We were pretty close back then,

1354
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,460
but not so much right now.

1355
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:55,759
I used to greet her by her name.

1356
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,300
Now we're so awkward that I use the honorifics.

1357
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,599
When I see her get on the elevator,

1358
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,638
I hide and wait...

1359
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,340
for the next elevator.

1360
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,070
(When the 8 crews met)

1361
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:07,539
They're here.

1362
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:14,480
(They didn't even look at each other as Redy walked by.)

1363
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,919
(What happened to these two best friends?)

1364
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,189
The crew was disbanded,

1365
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,459
and I kept texting and calling her.

1366
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,030
But judging from her response,

1367
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:27,099
it didn't seem like...

1368
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:29,800
she valued me that much.

1369
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,999
I stopped trying to reach her,

1370
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,130
and we grew apart instantly.

1371
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,669
I had other teammates whom I was working with,

1372
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,238
so I understand what made her so upset.

1373
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,509
It changed my ideas about personal relationships.

1374
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,710
That was because of her.

1375
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,980
From my point of view, growing apart was natural.

1376
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:49,349
It's not like...

1377
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,920
I did her wrong.

1378
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:52,589
Bada is a dancer...

1379
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,658
whom people like even when she does nothing.

1380
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:59,789
She's received attention since a long time ago.

1381
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:04,029
So, she probably doesn't know what it feels like to be a dancer...

1382
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,570
whom people don't pay attention to.

1383
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,469
But I'm not so compatible with people like her.

1384
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,510
People who have never faced any storms of life.

1385
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:14,940
It feels like envy to me.

1386
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,948
Redy of 1MILLION,

1387
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:19,880
you chose Bada of BEBE as your No Respect Dancer.

1388
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,079
I...

1389
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,780
don't respect you.

1390
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:25,949
I don't respect you.

1391
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:30,190
(Oh, my gosh.)

1392
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,659
That's it.

1393
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,428
Not Redy. Soo Bin!

1394
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,030
(Her real name is Shin Soo Bin.)

1395
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,070
You're still an eighth-grader to me.

1396
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,808
An eighth-grader to me.

1397
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:47,009
(Poor her.)

1398
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,079
An eighth-grader?

1399
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:49,780
A baby?

1400
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,709
- She's gangster, right? - Yes.

1401
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,010
I like her energy.

1402
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,849
She does look young.

1403
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,819
When we were disbanded,

1404
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,689
we had to go solo and improve.

1405
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,189
But she only does things that she likes without learning.

1406
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,429
I don't respect such dancers.

1407
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:10,698
But the fact that she chose me as her No Respect Dancer...

1408
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,829
made me angry.

1409
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,299
Okay!

1410
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,599
Redy of 1MILLION will attack first.

1411
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,210
Bada of BEBE will attack next.

1412
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:21,480
The two dancers' battle begins now.

1413
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,678
You guys ready?

1414
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:25,609
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1415
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,750
Fight!

1416
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:34,690
I think I'll win if I calmly show them what I've got.

1417
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,460
Okay!

1418
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,429
Go, girl!

1419
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,630
Okay.

1420
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,699
The same old moves.

1421
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:53,139
Okay!

1422
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,679
- Yes! - Let's go!

1423
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,179
She hit that.

1424
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,550
Let's go!

1425
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:07,718
Five, four,

1426
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:10,189
three, two, one.

1427
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,530
Switch! BEBE's Bada.

1428
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:16,500
I wanted to show her who made actual progress.

1429
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,610
Oh, my gosh. She's so tall.

1430
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,409
I hate it when people use their height!

1431
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,079
I wanted her to grow up a little.

1432
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,320
I wasn't scared.

1433
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,360
That energy!

1434
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:15,920
Four...

1435
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,429
Okay!

1436
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,189
Three, two, one.

1437
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,659
One.

1438
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,459
- Battle over. - Let's go!

1439
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,730
What the heck.

1440
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,070
She's way too good.

1441
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,139
You totally beat her.

1442
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,539
You killed it. That's all there is to it.

1443
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:34,739
Let's check out the result of the battle.

1444
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,980
I was thinking, "I want to win."

1445
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,650
I thought, "I won. I turned the tables."

1446
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,690
Open your cards in 3, 2, 1.

1447
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:47,590
(Who's the winner of this dance-off?)

1448
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:58,030
- Yes! - Yes!

1449
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:01,268
With a score of 3 to 0, Bada of BEBE...

1450
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:04,570
defeated Redy of 1MILLION.

1451
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,038
(The BEBE members are glad.)

1452
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,639
(Bowing)

1453
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,110
Please go back to your seats.

1454
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,449
(Mixed feelings)

1455
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,018
- Well done. - Good job.

1456
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:15,678
- You were great. - Great job.

1457
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,218
- You were awesome. - Absolutely.

1458
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:18,519
- You were the best. - You killed it.

1459
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:21,860
I was impressed by both of you.

1460
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,129
Redy of 1MILLION shocked me.

1461
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,558
But I reckon that Bada's moves suited the song more,

1462
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,000
and she was more relaxed.

1463
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,800
I'll be honest to help you improve.

1464
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,199
You're still an eighth-grader,

1465
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,809
even from my point of view.

1466
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,949
But Bada is certainly out of this league.

1467
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,379
Bada of BEBE, the winner,

1468
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,789
may attach the winner's chip to your crew.

1469
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:53,889
I felt amazing.

1470
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,090
And attach the loser's chip to 1MILLION.

1471
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,659
- Okay. - Okay.

1472
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,500
It's all right.

1473
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:09,139
I completely threw it away.

1474
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,809
I regretted it.

1475
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,808
(A little break after the fierce battle)

1476
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:14,279
- Here? - Does your back hurt?

1477
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,408
(A little break after the fierce battle)

1478
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,939
(Who are...)

1479
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,980
(the dancers looking at?)

1480
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:23,380
(Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC)

1481
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:24,889
I want to watch Kirsten dance.

1482
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,820
I know, right? I can't wait to watch it.

1483
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,989
I'm curious.

1484
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:31,159
(And someone else is paying attention to her.)

1485
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:33,158
Goodness. It's Kirsten.

1486
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:35,959
(All the judges have their eyes on Kirsten.)

1487
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,828
(When the crews were revealed)

1488
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:40,868
(No way!)

1489
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:42,170
(Gasping)

1490
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,809
- Wait. - Hold on.

1491
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:47,239
- It's her. - Is this for real?

1492
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,539
Are you serious?

1493
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,179
Are you?

1494
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:52,010
Is this for real?

1495
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,409
From the Royal Family?

1496
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,879
If you're even a tiny bit interested in dancing,

1497
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,250
you know about the Royal Family.

1498
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:02,389
(The Royal Family is a global crew led by Parris Goebel.)

1499
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,759
The crew has global fame.

1500
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,860
In terms of performances,

1501
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,130
the crew is literally the best.

1502
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:11,730
It's the most skilled crew.

1503
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,869
The whole world is their fan.

1504
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,409
BLACKPINK once did the Royal Family's performance.

1505
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:22,139
(BLACKPINK covered the Royal Family's choreography.)

1506
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,109
I've watched so many videos of the Royal Family.

1507
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,409
She was mostly at the center.

1508
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,150
The key members.

1509
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:30,749
She's like Parris Goebel's number-two dancer.

1510
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,820
What's up, guys? I'm Parris Goebel.

1511
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:35,488
Kirsten was one of my main girls.

1512
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:38,089
On every project I was on, she was there with me.

1513
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,559
She was by my side.

1514
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,499
The dancer who was in Justin Bieber's music video...

1515
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,900
can't be here.

1516
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,369
Justin Bieber.

1517
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,300
Ciara.

1518
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:47,800
CL.

1519
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,570
She's worked with numerous artists.

1520
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:53,509
The way she dances to the rhythm is so rhythmical.

1521
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:59,010
Her power and energy are fantastic.

1522
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:02,218
I'll be in awe if I see her in person.

1523
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:04,050
To be frank, she's the best.

1524
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,460
The dancer to participate in the 1-on-1 battle is...

1525
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,260
JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten.

1526
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,099
(It's the big one.)

1527
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:15,800
At last.

1528
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,400
She's here.

1529
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,570
Here comes Kirsten.

1530
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,570
Will we finally get to watch Kirsten's dance?

1531
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:29,710
Hello.

1532
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,019
No Respect Dancer that I would like to defeat...

1533
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:42,219
I'm terrified.

1534
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:46,960
I can't even imagine dancing against Kirsten.

1535
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,059
Her aura is overwhelming.

1536
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,070
I truly didn't want to go against her.

1537
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,440
Who do you think she picked?

1538
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,800
Hopefully, it's not me.

1539
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,909
My No Respect Dancer is...

1540
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,538
Waackxxxy.

1541
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,750
(Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN)

1542
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,518
Waackxxxy!

1543
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:09,480
(Grinning)

1544
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,388
(Is this...)

1545
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,090
(really happening?)

1546
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,360
That's insane!

1547
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:18,059
This will be so fun.

1548
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,730
How dare you choose me?

1549
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,860
Who's the dancer that you can't beat?

1550
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,030
Waackxxxy.

1551
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,900
She scares me!

1552
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,340
I might actually die if she hits me.

1553
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,069
I absolutely love her energy, and she understands the song.

1554
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:36,179
She's skilled, and her moves are high quality.

1555
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,150
I honestly don't want to fight her in a dance-off. She's too good.

1556
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,849
How many battles have you participated in so far?

1557
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,690
About 500 times as a joke.

1558
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,948
Her battle history.

1559
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,759
They're all first place or second place.

1560
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,320
Oh, you're right!

1561
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,289
She wins the championship in almost every competition.

1562
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,360
(Lip J)

1563
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:58,369
(She even beat the legendary waacking dancer, Lip J.)

1564
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,599
She's also gone global.

1565
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,538
She's an international dancer now.

1566
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:04,839
I won the title when I went to the US.

1567
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,009
In Russia, Germany,

1568
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,379
France, China, Indonesia,

1569
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,010
Malaysia, and even in Singapore.

1570
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:12,908
To be frank, I won the championship even last week.

1571
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,979
There were...

1572
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,420
two competitions in France, and I won both of them.

1573
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:18,519
Waackxxxy is on a national level.

1574
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,848
She's at the top already.

1575
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,320
She's number one, no doubt.

1576
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,420
(When the 8 crews met)

1577
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,488
(Waackxxxy)

1578
01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:26,960
(Waackxxxy got one No Respect sticker.)

1579
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,230
How dare she?

1580
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,800
(The dancer who gave her the sticker will be revealed.)

1581
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,230
That must have been from Kirsten.

1582
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:35,469
(Flicking)

1583
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,940
You're fearless.

1584
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:40,739
She's finally here.

1585
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:42,809
Here come the participants.

1586
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,510
(Composed)

1587
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,519
(When they chose the No Respect Dancers)

1588
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,750
Good power.

1589
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,488
The strongest one I've seen.

1590
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,449
She's really powerful.

1591
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,359
(Kirsten doesn't hesitate to choose her opponent.)

1592
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,789
She's so powerful. And I wanted that push.

1593
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:01,828
When I watched the video, you were world-class.

1594
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:03,360
And I would love to take you on.

1595
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,800
Let's battle.

1596
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,070
That's admirable.

1597
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:11,710
That's cool. She wants to battle a strong one.

1598
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:14,238
Thank you so much for liking my video.

1599
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:15,979
But I'll show you my dance.

1600
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,038
Okay. Let's go.

1601
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,650
(This is getting intense.)

1602
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:19,909
I'm scared.

1603
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,749
This is a battle of the century.

1604
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:22,980
This is insane.

1605
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,489
You can't even pay to watch this.

1606
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,050
Big match.

1607
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,158
This ought to be fun. It's a world battle!

1608
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:31,788
I am very proud to represent New Zealand.

1609
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:34,630
And I have to show why I'm the best and why...

1610
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:36,428
I deserve to take it out.

1611
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,098
Korea is extremely strong right now.

1612
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,629
I believe that we're the best.

1613
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,900
I'm definitely going to win.

1614
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:43,069
The world-class choreographer and the world-class waacking dancer.

1615
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,210
The battle of the two dancers begins now.

1616
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:46,570
You guys ready?

1617
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,408
Let's fight.

1618
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:50,279
(Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN goes first.)

1619
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,179
I'll prove why I'm a world-class dancer.

1620
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,179
Yes, let's see how it goes.

1621
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,619
- Go! - Let's go.

1622
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,829
Oh, my gosh!

1623
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:21,980
Okay.

1624
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,449
That's sick.

1625
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:31,420
Oh, my.

1626
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:53,969
Three, two, one. Switch!

1627
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,380
Switch!

1628
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,650
JAM REPUBLIC, Kirsten!

1629
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,079
I am the best.

1630
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,719
Come on, Kirsten. Bring it.

1631
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,690
(All eyes on her)

1632
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,429
(Impressed)

1633
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:48,159
I was like, "What?"

1634
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:54,029
She's good.

1635
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,100
Sexy!

1636
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,309
Three, two, one.

1637
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,779
The battle's over.

1638
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:11,420
- Amazing. - That was wonderful.

1639
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:14,220
It's an honour just to be here.

1640
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,288
(Even the judges are shocked by the fierce battle.)

1641
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,689
That was impressive.

1642
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:21,060
She's the best.

1643
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,300
Kirsten is certainly good.

1644
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:26,299
- She's got a great sense of rhythm. - I know. It's perfect.

1645
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,739
Still, Waackxxxy did better.

1646
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,000
She did so well.

1647
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,698
Her energy is on another level.

1648
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:31,909
Totally.

1649
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:34,608
How would we choose the winner? I know that I can't.

1650
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:38,550
Let's check out the result of the battle.

1651
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:40,978
No. This is too difficult.

1652
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:42,680
(Getting a headache)

1653
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,849
Judges, open your cards.

1654
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,988
That result was a win, for sure.

1655
01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:49,289
Obviously, I'd win.

1656
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,029
Three, two, one.

1657
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,198
(Shownu chooses MANNEQUEEN.)

1658
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,000
(Who did Mike and Monika vote for?)

1659
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,329
(They both abstained from voting.)

1660
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,970
It's a tie.

1661
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,539
Extra round!

1662
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,139
All right!

1663
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,279
Let's go. Come on, Waackxxxy!

1664
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:13,279
I'll show you our level difference.

1665
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:15,750
Let's go!

1666
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,479
I felt very confident.

1667
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:19,219
It's a rematch.

1668
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,390
You guys ready? Let's go.

1669
01:10:22,189 --> 01:10:25,529
(The 40-second moves begin simultaneously.)

1670
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,560
Yes.

1671
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:29,800
Let's go!

1672
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,840
(Shrieking)

1673
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,180
Yes!

1674
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,350
Yes!

1675
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,119
Let's go.

1676
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,948
All right.

1677
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:55,760
Go. Hey.

1678
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:07,329
This is crazy.

1679
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:09,970
Yes.

1680
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:16,909
All right. Over here.

1681
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:19,149
Oh, my gosh.

1682
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,979
(Surrendering)

1683
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:24,180
Her hips are up here.

1684
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,689
I even lost track of time.

1685
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,389
Do you know what's crazier?

1686
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:29,488
I can't tell who the winner is.

1687
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:30,688
This might be trickier.

1688
01:11:30,689 --> 01:11:32,129
I bet it's another rematch.

1689
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,159
Another tie?

1690
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:34,630
No, they have to decide this time.

1691
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,829
What is this? This is too difficult.

1692
01:11:37,229 --> 01:11:38,430
I shouldn't have watched it.

1693
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,729
It's time to decide.

1694
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,970
Fight judges, card open.

1695
01:11:43,069 --> 01:11:44,710
Please.

1696
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:45,810
Three,

1697
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,779
two,

1698
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,840
one.

1699
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:52,779
(What's the result of the rematch between the best dancers?)

1700
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:59,819
(They both get 1 vote each.)

1701
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,960
(Who did Monika choose?)

1702
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,489
- Gosh. - Who won?

1703
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,460
(Judge Monika abstained from voting again.)

1704
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,629
What?

1705
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,669
(Complete chaos)

1706
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,739
No way. You can't opt out here.

1707
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,039
I can only choose one?

1708
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,198
- So she'll break the tie. - There's no passing.

1709
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,568
That's insane. I can't do that!

1710
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,009
Whoever you pick will be the winner.

1711
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,840
The victory lies in your hands.

1712
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,409
- Here I go. - I know.

1713
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:28,149
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1714
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,818
(Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC wins with a score of 2 to 1.)

1715
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:34,419
Oh, yes.

1716
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:38,060
(JAM REPUBLIC cheers.)

1717
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,460
Oh, yes.

1718
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,029
(Regretful)

1719
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,170
Kirsten is no joke.

1720
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,238
Oh, my gosh. Good job.

1721
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,408
- Okay, word. - That was insane.

1722
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,409
You killed it.

1723
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:54,680
- You did really well. - This makes no sense.

1724
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,380
She's really angry.

1725
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,810
She's enraged now.

1726
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:01,948
In this last round, both dancers were at the same level.

1727
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,749
But Kirsten grabbed my attention a little more.

1728
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,519
Yes, she should've danced in her own style.

1729
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,220
Yes, she ended up following the other's lead too much.

1730
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:11,288
That was such a great battle. It was so energizing.

1731
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:14,960
The reason I chose Kirsten at the end...

1732
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,228
was that she made the song come alive a bit more,

1733
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:18,568
and I weighed that more importantly.

1734
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:20,929
Rather than being too serious,

1735
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,868
I had no choice but to give it to the person expressing the song.

1736
01:13:23,869 --> 01:13:26,509
That's why I hope you understand my decision.

1737
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:28,840
But it was a very difficult one.

1738
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:32,550
I took the win.

1739
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,949
I feel good.

1740
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,289
I feel really proud of what I put out.

1741
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,319
You did great. You're the best.

1742
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:42,519
(Sighing)

1743
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,788
No matter what, I had to win...

1744
01:13:44,789 --> 01:13:46,429
for my team's sake.

1745
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:49,799
I'm just so angry that the start ended up this way.

1746
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,060
I couldn't control my expression.

1747
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,938
Let's continue.

1748
01:13:54,939 --> 01:13:58,039
The dancer in the next battle is MANNEQUEEN's...

1749
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,939
They're going twice in a row.

1750
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:01,239
This is amazing.

1751
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,180
Yoonji?

1752
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:05,279
It's Yoonji.

1753
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,809
(Yoonji from MANNEQUEEN)

1754
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:07,949
I'm going to kill everyone.

1755
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,618
She's ready to take someone down.

1756
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:12,019
She's totally ready.

1757
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,649
- Gosh. - Let's go!

1758
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,389
- I'm so scared. - She's angry.

1759
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,430
- Yes, she's scary. - She seems crazy.

1760
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:20,259
She's scary.

1761
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,599
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1762
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,529
My eyes were rolled back in a fury, seriously.

1763
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,969
If they want to mess with my sisters, I'll show them up.

1764
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,840
I'll assassinate them in the battle with my dancing.

1765
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,799
She's scary.

1766
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,869
- Yoonji's legit angry. - She's really angry.

1767
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,010
I'm very angry right now.

1768
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:39,478
MANNEQUEEN has come here...

1769
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:41,010
as the crew known to be strongest in battles.

1770
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:43,680
I think it's time we showed that.

1771
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,549
I was really scared.

1772
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,420
"Please don't pick me" is what I was thinking.

1773
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,288
(At the introductory meeting of the 8 crews)

1774
01:14:49,289 --> 01:14:51,429
(MANNEQUEEN was chosen as weakest by 7 crews.)

1775
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:53,559
- I don't have any. - It went away?

1776
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,028
If I want to win, I don't want to face her.

1777
01:14:56,029 --> 01:14:57,398
She's a very scary person.

1778
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:58,868
She's very fierce.

1779
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,868
Who can win against her in a battle?

1780
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,099
No one can win against her.

1781
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,939
I think of her as a crazy dancer.

1782
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:05,970
I think it's time to show that.

1783
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:07,908
I've said this already,

1784
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:10,579
but who's the one chewing up and spitting out battles lately?

1785
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,750
Did I enjoy that too much?

1786
01:15:17,449 --> 01:15:19,020
I've told you who it is.

1787
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,390
This battle, I can show you later.

1788
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:26,229
What was that?

1789
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:29,059
This battle, I can show you later.

1790
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,429
Kirsten, come out, girl.

1791
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:32,829
This battle, I can show you later.

1792
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,300
(Kirsten, come out, girl.)

1793
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,539
Kirsten, come out, girl.

1794
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,939
I'm going to take revenge for my sister.

1795
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,680
Come out, girl.

1796
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:50,319
(Kirsten chose Waackxxxy in the previous battle.)

1797
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,619
(She's got no fear.)

1798
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,159
(Let's go, Waackxxxy!)

1799
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:57,959
(Go, Waackxxxy! Go!)

1800
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,430
(Kirsten won the battle.)

1801
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,569
Let's grit our teeth and do this.

1802
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,039
(Kirsten, come out, girl.)

1803
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:15,010
I'm going to take revenge for my sister.

1804
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,238
- Yes! - Come out, girl.

1805
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,309
(Yoonji chose a revenge battle against Kirsten.)

1806
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,219
I'm going to show you who is the hottest girl in South Korea.

1807
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,249
You know, girl?

1808
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,279
I'm going to show you.

1809
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:26,789
(I'm going to show you.)

1810
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,720
You're dead. You're dead now.

1811
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,859
Word. She's acting tough.

1812
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:35,659
She's very angry.

1813
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,629
She's angry...

1814
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,399
that Waackxxxy lost to Kirsten.

1815
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,068
This is the real deal.

1816
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:44,939
- The real deal. - I'm getting goosebumps.

1817
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,739
I'm so scared right now.

1818
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,140
(I'm going to show you who is the queen!)

1819
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:53,379
I'm going to show you who is the queen!

1820
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,149
- Yes. You're the queen! - Yes!

1821
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,060
I'm excited.

1822
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:11,229
Let's see. We're here in Korea now.

1823
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,430
- So let's see. - All right.

1824
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:16,568
She won against our strongest sister?

1825
01:17:16,569 --> 01:17:18,140
I need to take her down, no matter what.

1826
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,969
She wanted to get revenge.

1827
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,438
She wanted to make sure...

1828
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:26,250
that her sister's title was not taken from her.

1829
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:27,750
Fair enough.

1830
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,350
We have Yoonji from MANNEQUEEN going first.

1831
01:17:33,689 --> 01:17:36,219
- Let's go, Yoonji. - Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC...

1832
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,619
will go second.

1833
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:42,028
She intended to change the flow of the battle entirely.

1834
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:44,359
That could be explained fully by her pose alone.

1835
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:46,930
She's small but so fierce.

1836
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,170
This is over. It's really over.

1837
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:50,438
It's totally over.

1838
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:51,510
Good luck, Kirsten.

1839
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,309
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1840
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,010
- Let's go. - It's too hard to dance after this.

1841
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,408
We have the next battle between these two dancers.

1842
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,479
- Are you guys ready? - Yes.

1843
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,849
Even if it's by offering up every moment I've spent dancing,

1844
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,919
I will win.

1845
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,090
I'll show them.

1846
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,720
You are my next target.

1847
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,760
Let's go. Fight!

1848
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,159
Let's go!

1849
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,470
Let's go, Yoonji!

1850
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:29,380
Let's go!

1851
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:30,840
She's crazy.

1852
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,579
No one can stop Yoonji now.

1853
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,220
All right!

1854
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,949
Let's go.

1855
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,689
Fight!

1856
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:58,609
She's insane. I think she's insane.

1857
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:05,250
Her eyes look crazy now.

1858
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,220
All right, switch!

1859
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:20,590
Hey, that was perfect!

1860
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,399
Kirsten, let's go.

1861
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,429
Yoonji, I know your emotions are very strong.

1862
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,368
But let's not get overly emotional.

1863
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:31,840
Let me show you how it's done.

1864
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,810
- Hey. - Let's go.

1865
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,380
Let's go.

1866
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,020
Energy.

1867
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,090
Energy.

1868
01:19:52,489 --> 01:19:53,489
She hit her.

1869
01:19:58,029 --> 01:19:59,800
- Energy. - She's insane.

1870
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,600
- In 4, 3, 2, 1. - Go!

1871
01:20:35,739 --> 01:20:36,840
That's it!

1872
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:40,810
Give it up for Kirsten and Yoonji.

1873
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:42,810
I mean...

1874
01:20:42,909 --> 01:20:44,739
I think it's hardest to be a judge.

1875
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:47,108
Do dancers not talk, normally?

1876
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:48,420
Do they all just communicate through dancing?

1877
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:52,149
(Dancer 1 communicating through dance)

1878
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,460
(Dancer 2 communicating through dance)

1879
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,688
Kirsten's butt is attached here.

1880
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:00,689
How can you beat that?

1881
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:03,000
That was amazing.

1882
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,269
MANNEQUEEN challenged Kirsten.

1883
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:08,199
What if they all lose to her?

1884
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:10,099
She won, right?

1885
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,299
She definitely won.

1886
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,770
It wouldn't make sense if she lost this one.

1887
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:16,609
Let's confirm the results of the battle.

1888
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,550
Fight judges, card open.

1889
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,578
It wouldn't make sense for me to lose this one.

1890
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:23,649
Two...

1891
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:25,619
I'm very confident.

1892
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:27,550
One!

1893
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:41,198
(Yoonji wins!)

1894
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,099
She got revenge for Waackxxxy.

1895
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,568
Yoonji, you did great.

1896
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:46,209
Yoonji!

1897
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:48,510
I was going insane, soaring high, I felt great, so great!

1898
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,339
(Waiting to shake hands)

1899
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,850
- You killed that. Amazing. - I love you.

1900
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,149
That was so creative. Seriously. Thank you.

1901
01:21:54,949 --> 01:21:56,278
Could everyone return to their seats?

1902
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:57,279
Fight judges, get ready.

1903
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,019
- Gosh, that was crazy. - That was fun.

1904
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,688
That was insane. You killed it.

1905
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:02,760
I know. She was really strong.

1906
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:04,389
That was incredible.

1907
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,859
That was just amazing...

1908
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:10,329
dance quality and performance at the highest level.

1909
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:12,970
Yoonji was just...

1910
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,340
all feeling, 200 percent, and I could feel that completely.

1911
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:20,238
And when you're feeling it 200 percent,

1912
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,779
that'll win you a battle, 1,000 percent.

1913
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,108
Plus your experience, your musicality,

1914
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:28,079
your ability to make those moments, if you combine all that,

1915
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,849
that's a winner, a champion.

1916
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,880
Yes.

1917
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:35,288
I always thought the only proper and most impressive battler...

1918
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:37,420
in the world was my own Lip J.

1919
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,060
But now...

1920
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,460
I think Lip J's going to need to practice more.

1921
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,698
Really.

1922
01:22:43,699 --> 01:22:45,930
I think you're the perfect battler.

1923
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:51,239
I feel even better when I win against a strong opponent.

1924
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,538
I was actually quite surprised.

1925
01:22:52,539 --> 01:22:54,069
Kirsten's really great.

1926
01:22:54,939 --> 01:22:58,209
(Yoonji showed a great battle against a strong opponent.)

1927
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:00,810
Continuing on, the next dancer to participate in a battle...

1928
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,350
is from 1MILLION.

1929
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:08,858
It's Harimu.

1930
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,189
(Harimu from 1MILLION)

1931
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,158
She's got so much talent.

1932
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,789
Having a lot of talent is what her image is.

1933
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,099
"Street Dance Girls Fighter."

1934
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,260
A dancer who's been on TV a lot.

1935
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,899
She was on a show called "CAP-TEEN."

1936
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:21,000
Hello, my name is Park Hae Rim.

1937
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:22,699
I've seen her dance and sing,

1938
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,310
and I saw her as part of Amazon on "Street Dance Girls Fighter."

1939
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,209
I didn't know she'd be on this show too.

1940
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,339
To be on Street Woman Fighter 2 after "Street Dance Girls Fighter."

1941
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,109
Not "Street Dance Girls Fighter,"

1942
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,010
but if you have a season two of "Street Woman Fighter..."

1943
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,019
Hello.

1944
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,719
I've come back to Street Woman Fighter 2.

1945
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,749
I'm Harimu!

1946
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,419
- Now we no longer have... - Now we no longer have...

1947
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,060
- anywhere to retreat to. - anywhere to retreat to.

1948
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,359
We're sensitive

1949
01:23:45,789 --> 01:23:47,389
(Just watch. This is gradient energy.)

1950
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,299
It's not a lot, but we're sensitive

1951
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,270
(The human vitamin of 1MILLION, Harimu)

1952
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,770
I'm so happy right now.

1953
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:56,499
The No Respect Dancer...

1954
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,340
who I can win against is...

1955
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:04,909
Is it MANNEQUEEN again?

1956
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,350
It must be MANNEQUEEN.

1957
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:11,449
- Is she picking Redlic? - Is it Redlic?

1958
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,448
I associate her with aespa.

1959
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,989
The in-house choreographer for aespa.

1960
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,359
Starting with "Black Mamba..."

1961
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,059
("Black Mamba" by aespa)

1962
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,659
I choreographed the chorus for "Black Mamba,"

1963
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,429
and for "Dreams Come True,"

1964
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,698
I choreographed at least 90 percent of it.

1965
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:28,369
With the exception of "Next Level," I did nearly all their dances.

1966
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,140
Most recently, I believe she also did "Spicy."

1967
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:36,738
(Redlic is famous as aespa's choreographer and video director.)

1968
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:40,010
She's good at turns and has a lot of strength.

1969
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:41,949
She has a lot of good energy.

1970
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,578
I choose Redlic,

1971
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,188
of MANNEQUEEN.

1972
01:24:46,189 --> 01:24:48,560
(Redlic of MANNEQUEEN)

1973
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,560
What?

1974
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,329
She told her own teacher...

1975
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:56,930
to come on out.

1976
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,399
Her face totally changed.

1977
01:25:00,869 --> 01:25:02,640
It's Redlic.

1978
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:04,340
I predicted this.

1979
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:05,810
She was a tiger cub.

1980
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,408
(At the time they announced the crew lineups)

1981
01:25:07,409 --> 01:25:08,579
- What? - What?

1982
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,709
Does that mean Harimu and Redlic have split up?

1983
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:12,909
They were in BELEGACY.

1984
01:25:12,979 --> 01:25:15,978
Harimu and Redlic were in BELEGACY together.

1985
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:19,049
I heard Harimu was a student of Redlic's for a long time.

1986
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:21,959
(Harimu, 13 years experience)

1987
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,189
So she's here.

1988
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,289
I see.

1989
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:26,759
In 2018, I gathered some dancers...

1990
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,499
who caught my eye and formed a crew.

1991
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,329
It was a crew of my students.

1992
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:36,698
(Redlic's dance crew, BELEGACY, was known for full energy moves.)

1993
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:38,139
We had a lot of problems arise,

1994
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,510
so the crew was disbanded.

1995
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:44,010
Redlic would find work for us.

1996
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:46,108
She wasn't the director.

1997
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:49,619
I was brought on as a dancer under a different director.

1998
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,849
But there was a misunderstanding in that situation,

1999
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:55,119
and that director said something to Redlic.

2000
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,630
The director told me that Harimu had acted rudely.

2001
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,929
They told me that if my student were to act like this,

2002
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,929
they wouldn't be able to work with me anymore.

2003
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:05,800
Of course, it's a situation that would make Redlic angry.

2004
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:09,000
I scolded her very strongly for the first time then.

2005
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:12,210
But she never asked me...

2006
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:14,470
what happened.

2007
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,880
She just scolded me.

2008
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,778
I was sad about it.

2009
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,579
(I was sad she didn't listen to me.)

2010
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:24,979
If I said something, it would feel like I'm making excuses for myself.

2011
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,049
Because it was just so...

2012
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,390
(Harimu still feels misunderstood and sad about what happened.)

2013
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:32,359
"If you guys are going to work like this, I can't work with you."

2014
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,729
"I won't see you anymore."

2015
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:36,600
I ended up disbanding the crew that day.

2016
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:40,699
So she's attacking her, in the end.

2017
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:46,539
I was so angry.

2018
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:49,180
- I'm a little scared. - Let's go, Redlic!

2019
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,579
This is a real battle.

2020
01:26:50,609 --> 01:26:52,079
They're both serious right now.

2021
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,750
The vibe is so bad right now. It's so scary.

2022
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,720
I'll prove what kind of power a former student has.

2023
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,760
Can Harimu really win against me?

2024
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:18,340
The pupil will surpass the master.

2025
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:23,010
I will work to earn a complete victory.

2026
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,050
She raised a tiger cub.

2027
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,760
I'll do my best.

2028
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,398
We need to grit our teeth, Redlic.

2029
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:49,499
- You can do it. - Let's go.

2030
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,300
- We'll die if we lose here. - Let's go.

2031
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:53,609
I'll win no matter what.

2032
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:55,109
They look legitimately angry.

2033
01:27:55,609 --> 01:27:56,779
I think they're really enraged.

2034
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,279
You'll win. For real.

2035
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:02,119
- I'll work hard. - You can do it.

2036
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:05,119
I'm upset.

2037
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,060
Think about everything she's done to you until now.

2038
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,589
(The MANNEQUEEN hideout)

2039
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:14,728
(The worst dancer for MANNEQUEEN is Redlic with 14 votes.)

2040
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:17,828
(Harimu chose Redlic as MANNEQUEEN'S worst dancer.)

2041
01:28:17,829 --> 01:28:19,568
I'm the teacher who raised her.

2042
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:21,100
Is she in her right mind?

2043
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,038
(She's battling against an opponent she knows so well.)

2044
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:27,309
And I know...

2045
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:31,609
what her psychological weaknesses are.

2046
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,079
What does she know about me?

2047
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:38,119
(Harimu of 1MILLION versus Redlic of MANNEQUEEN)

2048
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:45,220
Meeting each other this way is so...

2049
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:47,089
I hated that situation.

2050
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:48,960
She used to be so precious to me.

2051
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:53,429
- Don't cry. - Good luck.

2052
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,269
- Now's not the time to cry. - Don't cry.

2053
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,868
- Don't do that. - Don't cry.

2054
01:28:56,869 --> 01:28:58,039
You can't do this now.

2055
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,340
- Yes. - If you do this, you'd lose.

2056
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,109
This is so painful.

2057
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:06,250
Oh, no. She can't cry.

2058
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:07,850
She can't cry now.

2059
01:29:10,819 --> 01:29:12,119
Our eyes met,

2060
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,989
and I couldn't stop crying, for some reason.

2061
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,319
Let's battle well. I'll hold my tears back.

2062
01:29:18,789 --> 01:29:19,959
You guys ready?

2063
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,189
Let's go.

2064
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,059
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2065
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,130
Fight!

2066
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,069
Go! Tear it up!

2067
01:29:34,739 --> 01:29:36,180
Go! Even stronger there!

2068
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:51,090
Nice!

2069
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,899
Why isn't she dancing?

2070
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,399
She's wasting her time.

2071
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:02,969
No, she has to dance.

2072
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:05,199
Keep going until the end. More!

2073
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:06,840
- More! - Keep going!

2074
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:08,340
- That's it. - Hey!

2075
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:13,079
In 5, 4...

2076
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:19,188
- And 3, 2, 1. - Let's go.

2077
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:20,890
- Switch. - Let's go.

2078
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,720
- Let's go. - Do it!

2079
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:23,989
Yes.

2080
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,129
Let's go!

2081
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,159
Okay!

2082
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:33,670
- Yes. - Yes!

2083
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,539
Let's go!

2084
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:40,569
- That's it! - Let's go!

2085
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,618
In 5, 4...

2086
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:56,520
and 3, 2, 1.

2087
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:57,859
Battle over.

2088
01:30:58,689 --> 01:30:59,829
Well done.

2089
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,228
- Redlic didn't dance enough. - She was too emotionally weak.

2090
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:07,398
Redlic danced too little.

2091
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:09,199
That's true. She danced way too little.

2092
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:16,039
Her face looks dissatisfied.

2093
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,949
- I think Harimu's going to cry. - I know.

2094
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:20,550
I've never seen Harimu like that.

2095
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,919
Both Redlic and I...

2096
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,720
have never faced each other in different crews before.

2097
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:29,720
I just felt upset and disappointed.

2098
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:32,859
Let's reveal the results of this battle.

2099
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,929
Fight judges, card open.

2100
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:37,460
In 3, 2, 1.

2101
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:43,640
(What is the final result?)

2102
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,170
Yes!

2103
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:53,609
Harimu of 1MILLION beat Redlic of MANNEQUEEN.

2104
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:59,020
I thought Redlic didn't make good use of her time.

2105
01:31:59,149 --> 01:32:02,619
It was too bad that she glared at Harimu 2 to 3 times.

2106
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,759
As a result, I had to support Harimu more,

2107
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,760
who used that to her advantage.

2108
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:10,060
Please go back to your seats.

2109
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:16,399
Oh, no.

2110
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,039
- Oh, no. - Okay.

2111
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,310
Okay. It's okay.

2112
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,949
Good job.

2113
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:28,680
I feel like crying.

2114
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:34,519
I like her so much.

2115
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,319
It's just... I'm sorry.

2116
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,489
I'm sorry I caused her damage.

2117
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:44,528
After all, she said I caused her damage,

2118
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:46,270
and I feel sorry about that.

2119
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:50,539
She was a teammate and student that I adored.

2120
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:53,739
I hate her, but I love her.

2121
01:32:54,539 --> 01:32:57,239
But I resent her, but I still like her.

2122
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:01,148
I didn't care about the battle.

2123
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:04,779
When she danced, nothing mattered. She was just so adorable.

2124
01:33:04,949 --> 01:33:08,989
It's a fact that she's a person I am grateful for.

2125
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,329
Redlic, you're still amazing too.

2126
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:18,100
(Who will Lia Kim choose as No Respect Dancer?)

2127
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:20,369
(She seems to have a lot of complaints about me.)

2128
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,569
(The ultimate battle begins!)

2129
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,539
(Honestly, it wasn't good.)

2130
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:30,109
(How will this battle end?)

2131
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,039
I want another battle.

2132
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,409
Hey, don't warm up. It's scary.

2133
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:36,349
(Shall we...)

2134
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:38,319
(warm up?)

2135
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,550
This is really fierce.

2136
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,149
(Glaring)

2137
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,720
Their energy is very strong.

2138
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:48,390
(What's strong?)

2139
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:50,760
- I can feel it. - That was good.

2140
01:33:52,569 --> 01:33:53,869
That was good.

2141
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,169
(In a very intense jungle, here's a lovely girl with a smile.)

2142
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:57,799
Hey, Audrey is really...

2143
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,270
Only Audrey has this kind of vibe.

2144
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,239
- She's cute. - She's pretty.

2145
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:05,210
She looks so innocent.

2146
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,909
I want to see you guys dance.

2147
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,648
(Our Audrey is cute!)

2148
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:11,078
Her crew looks at her heartwarmingly.

2149
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:12,118
Exactly.

2150
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:14,189
So cute. C, U, T, E.

2151
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:17,890
Hi, I'm a part of JAM REPUBLIC, and my name is Audrey Lane.

2152
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,059
I'm the youngest in my crew.

2153
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,489
(She's an uncontaminated, bright soul.)

2154
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,960
(Suddenly lying down)

2155
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,199
Audrey.

2156
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:30,500
She is so cute.

2157
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,010
That's so cute, Audrey.

2158
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,568
(She acts cute too.)

2159
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:36,608
Nice.

2160
01:34:36,609 --> 01:34:37,680
(Cuteness overload)

2161
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:40,408
(She's the smiling angel of Street Woman Fighter 2...)

2162
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:42,310
(who always keeps her smile on.)

2163
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,719
(JAM REPUBLIC faces the inevitable time of assessment.)

2164
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,919
Okay.

2165
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,549
Who's the weakest? Oh, my gosh.

2166
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,858
(The weakest dancer of JAM REPUBLIC is...)

2167
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:51,159
(Number of votes)

2168
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:52,528
The worst dancer!

2169
01:34:52,529 --> 01:34:53,658
(They voted for the weakest dancer in each crew.)

2170
01:34:53,659 --> 01:34:55,359
I'll do the easiest one first.

2171
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:57,229
JAM REPUBLIC's Audrey.

2172
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:58,960
How did Audrey do?

2173
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:01,899
- She was pretty but... - She was just a pretty dancer.

2174
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,969
- I picked Audrey. - Audrey.

2175
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:05,568
- Audrey. - Audrey.

2176
01:35:05,569 --> 01:35:06,670
I picked Audrey too.

2177
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:07,810
(Audrey. She was pretty, and that's all I remember.)

2178
01:35:07,811 --> 01:35:11,439
(Audrey was voted the most as the weakest dancer.)

2179
01:35:11,579 --> 01:35:13,108
(The weakest dancer of JAM REPUBLIC is Audrey)

2180
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:14,680
(A total of 33 votes)

2181
01:35:15,449 --> 01:35:16,649
Thirty-three?

2182
01:35:16,949 --> 01:35:18,149
They want us... What?

2183
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,590
Oh, jeez.

2184
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,318
(Glancing)

2185
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:23,819
Audrey got six stickers.

2186
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,389
She is the one...

2187
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,460
- with the most No Respect stickers. - This is a first.

2188
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,130
Which dance did she do?

2189
01:35:30,729 --> 01:35:32,259
(During the introductory meeting)

2190
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,670
Her shoulders are up.

2191
01:35:34,869 --> 01:35:36,039
Her shoulders are up.

2192
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:39,369
Her shoulders are up.

2193
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:45,210
If you are a choreographer, you need to put the shoulders down.

2194
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:46,909
Korea is the best at giving lessons.

2195
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:50,649
She hunched her shoulders when she danced, which bothered me.

2196
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:53,090
She was like this.

2197
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:55,619
It's the shoulders.

2198
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:00,158
They like... It's like you can't even look at my pretty face...

2199
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,028
when my shoulders are up there, you know.

2200
01:36:03,029 --> 01:36:04,728
At least you're pretty.

2201
01:36:04,729 --> 01:36:07,300
- They just think you're sweet. - They don't even know.

2202
01:36:07,829 --> 01:36:10,770
I just couldn't understand it in any way.

2203
01:36:12,909 --> 01:36:16,310
The No Respect Dancer I can beat is...

2204
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,409
The weakest dancer I chose was...

2205
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,188
- JAM REPUBLIC's... - JAM REPUBLIC's...

2206
01:36:26,189 --> 01:36:27,719
- Audrey. Come on. - Audrey.

2207
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,520
(Audrey was chosen as the weakest by many dancers.)

2208
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,129
(She's so cute!)

2209
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:37,599
- She's a girl. - I know. She's a baby.

2210
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,499
Oh, no!

2211
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,728
- I'm really curious about Audrey. - Yes.

2212
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:42,100
Let's go, Audrey.

2213
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,169
Break it up. You got it in you, Audrey.

2214
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,299
You got it.

2215
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,938
I'm pretty sure...

2216
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:50,609
Audrey fully came out and showed everyone.

2217
01:36:50,779 --> 01:36:52,849
Any words before the battle?

2218
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,680
I think you're still a baby,

2219
01:36:55,949 --> 01:36:58,449
so this big sister will dominate you.

2220
01:36:58,819 --> 01:37:00,390
You baby. I'll show you.

2221
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:03,390
I would just like to say good luck.

2222
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,488
(A polite attitude that's scarce before the battle)

2223
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:06,658
She's so polite.

2224
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:08,059
Is she a girl of Confucianism?

2225
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,959
- How could she be that polite? - I know.

2226
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,499
Deep N Dap's Soll versus JAM REPUBLIC's Audrey.

2227
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,329
LADYBOUNCE's Vessi versus JAM REPUBLIC's Audrey.

2228
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,100
The battle begins now!

2229
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:18,500
You guys ready?

2230
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:19,908
- Yes! - Let's go!

2231
01:37:19,909 --> 01:37:20,969
Fight!

2232
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,539
I can totally beat her.

2233
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:33,619
- Keep going! - Let's go!

2234
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,960
If you are going to try to intimidate me,

2235
01:37:43,229 --> 01:37:44,728
you need more confidence.

2236
01:37:44,729 --> 01:37:46,630
LADYBOUNCE's Vessi, let's go!

2237
01:37:48,069 --> 01:37:50,970
Yes!

2238
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,250
I will lead the battle at my own pace.

2239
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,020
(Annoyed)

2240
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:08,389
Three, two, one!

2241
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:11,019
Switch to JAM REPUBLIC's Audrey!

2242
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,389
- Let's go, Audrey! - Let's go!

2243
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,529
How will she do it with that pretty face?

2244
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:17,100
She's a pretty doll.

2245
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:19,300
I think she's on a baby level.

2246
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:21,129
(Most dancers see her as the weak one, )

2247
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,800
(but how will she dance?)

2248
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:26,270
(Focused)

2249
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:28,869
Somehow, it's scary!

2250
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:33,750
I'm going to surprise all of you with my dancing.

2251
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:44,559
(Shocking twist)

2252
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,060
Look. Look at her face. It changes, right?

2253
01:38:47,229 --> 01:38:48,390
(Immediately changing)

2254
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,859
Flexible!

2255
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:04,310
What?

2256
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:05,778
What?

2257
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:08,949
Switch to Audrey from JAM REPUBLIC.

2258
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,550
- Yes. - Look at her change.

2259
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:16,189
- Gosh. - Audrey's scary!

2260
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:30,438
(She nailed it!)

2261
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:32,199
(Our little sister showed it!)

2262
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,550
Who underestimated Audrey?

2263
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:45,550
Oh, my!

2264
01:39:45,979 --> 01:39:47,618
Hey!

2265
01:39:47,619 --> 01:39:49,148
Hey, back off!

2266
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:50,390
(What did I just see?)

2267
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,590
Three...

2268
01:39:53,159 --> 01:39:56,399
Three, two, one.

2269
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,829
She suddenly bowed.

2270
01:39:59,229 --> 01:40:00,229
Nice!

2271
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:01,569
Yes, Audrey!

2272
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,199
Okay.

2273
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,038
She went there with her shoulders.

2274
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:06,209
She went two meters.

2275
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,170
She can be in "The Exorcist."

2276
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,539
(Did you say my shoulders were up there?)

2277
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:13,479
The looks on her face changed when she started dancing.

2278
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,380
- Now, the angel's face is back! - Exactly!

2279
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,549
I was shocked by Audrey.

2280
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:21,089
Usually, she's like this.

2281
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:23,188
But when she started dancing, she changed.

2282
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:24,259
Amazing.

2283
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,489
(Audrey was amazing!)

2284
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:27,459
She's a crazy one with bright eyes.

2285
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:28,528
(A lovely lunatic with bright eyes)

2286
01:40:28,529 --> 01:40:30,960
Now, let's see the result of the battle.

2287
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,600
Fight judges, card open.

2288
01:40:33,869 --> 01:40:36,100
Three, two, one!

2289
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,068
It's 2 to 0. It's 2 to 1.

2290
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:42,340
(Against Soll, 2 to 0, against Vessi, 2 to 1)

2291
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:47,009
JAM REPUBLIC's Audrey takes the win.

2292
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:48,549
Audrey is a strong one.

2293
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:49,879
She's good.

2294
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,478
Audrey showed many weapons.

2295
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:54,219
Because everyone is on a high level,

2296
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,089
instead of just showing movements,

2297
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:57,720
you have to show us your weapons.

2298
01:40:58,289 --> 01:40:59,459
(Good job, Audrey!)

2299
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,688
Good one. You were so calm with your ways.

2300
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:03,099
That was fire.

2301
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,500
Thank you so much.

2302
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,399
You killed her with kindness.

2303
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:10,000
I'm of course happy that I had two battles.

2304
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:11,869
That's it. I just feel happy.

2305
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,670
(Thumbs up)

2306
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,069
Can you clap for the slate?

2307
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:17,739
Thank you.

2308
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:21,550
Now, the dancer for this battle is...

2309
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,188
1MILLION's Lia Kim.

2310
01:41:26,189 --> 01:41:27,890
(1MILLION's leader, Lia Kim)

2311
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,090
Finally!

2312
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:32,859
Here she comes.

2313
01:41:40,029 --> 01:41:42,630
So scary!

2314
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,438
She's way up there.

2315
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:46,709
Lia Kim is famous herself.

2316
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:48,908
She's a legend in the dancing scene.

2317
01:41:48,909 --> 01:41:52,710
I was sure that she'd participate as a judge.

2318
01:41:53,779 --> 01:41:56,220
She already recorded top as a battle dancer.

2319
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:59,788
She took first place for popping and took second place...

2320
01:41:59,789 --> 01:42:01,189
for locking simultaneously once.

2321
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:03,959
Including locking and popping,

2322
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,229
she is good at various genres.

2323
01:42:06,489 --> 01:42:09,600
She ruled the world in the realm of battle.

2324
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,698
I was shocked...

2325
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:13,828
by "TT" back then.

2326
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:15,769
The choreography was groundbreaking.

2327
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:17,099
Because she is famous...

2328
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,368
and have influence among choreographers...

2329
01:42:19,369 --> 01:42:23,078
She let the world know that Korea has great choreographers.

2330
01:42:23,079 --> 01:42:24,938
She's the first generation of the choreography.

2331
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:27,349
K-pop choreography and Korean dancers...

2332
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:28,879
have become popular because of her.

2333
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,850
1MILLION's Lia Kim,

2334
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:35,890
please choose a dancer you can beat.

2335
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:38,989
We keep...

2336
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,089
Who will she choose?

2337
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,289
Will it be Deep N Dap again?

2338
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:46,270
(Deep N Dap and 1MILLION are calling at each other.)

2339
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:47,398
(1MILLION and Deep N Dap...)

2340
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:51,869
(already had three battles.)

2341
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:56,909
We keep facing Deep N Dap.

2342
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:04,020
Do I have to keep dealing with them?

2343
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,390
What do we do?

2344
01:43:06,619 --> 01:43:07,688
Maybe Mina Myoung?

2345
01:43:07,689 --> 01:43:09,050
Is it going to be Mina Myoung?

2346
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:12,960
Many clips of her went viral.

2347
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:18,359
(Response to Mina Myoung's choreography was explosive.)

2348
01:43:18,529 --> 01:43:20,698
I started dancing...

2349
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:22,398
after watching Mina Myoung's dance.

2350
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:24,898
She's so smooth in using the body lines.

2351
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:28,368
She has a big star power too.

2352
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,180
She has long expertise and experience.

2353
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:32,979
We can't talk about choreography without mentioning her.

2354
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,680
She's a star created by 1MILLION.

2355
01:43:34,779 --> 01:43:37,919
She used to be the 1st generation of 1MILLION.

2356
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,988
The name of 1MILLION just won't go away.

2357
01:43:40,989 --> 01:43:43,460
I just want to be myself now.

2358
01:43:44,619 --> 01:43:50,130
(Still, the label of 1MILLION follows Mina Myoung.)

2359
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,000
(No. I'm not in 1MILLION.)

2360
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:55,269
- This is fun. - It is fun, indeed.

2361
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,800
This is how they provoke me.

2362
01:43:58,039 --> 01:44:01,170
They provoke me like this. Seriously.

2363
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,368
This is what annoys me.

2364
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:04,509
I really don't want them to talk about 1MILLION.

2365
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:06,209
To get rid of the label,

2366
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:08,249
I have to show that I'm Deep N Dap...

2367
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,019
to stop that nonsense.

2368
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,149
I really want to escape from them.

2369
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,448
(Starting with Deep N Dap's Gooseul...)

2370
01:44:14,449 --> 01:44:16,788
(Gooseul lost, )

2371
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:18,520
(and JJ lost.)

2372
01:44:18,689 --> 01:44:21,560
(Deep N Dap has lost all battles against 1MILLION.)

2373
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,560
- Did 1MILLION beat us twice? - Three times.

2374
01:44:24,829 --> 01:44:27,328
Are all 1MILLION's wins all from us?'

2375
01:44:27,329 --> 01:44:28,329
Yes.

2376
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:29,369
That's annoying.

2377
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:33,839
It's lame that we lost three times to not just anybody...

2378
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,340
but 1MILLION.

2379
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,408
Quality-wise, we're different.

2380
01:44:37,409 --> 01:44:40,109
We are not on a level they can compare to.

2381
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:42,079
They are facing each other too.

2382
01:44:42,279 --> 01:44:43,420
Something must have happened.

2383
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,078
Because she left the team.

2384
01:44:45,079 --> 01:44:46,788
When I looked at the video of the two,

2385
01:44:46,789 --> 01:44:49,249
they were in great sync.

2386
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,560
They used to dance like twins.

2387
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,788
I heard they ended badly,

2388
01:44:53,789 --> 01:44:56,059
and they are totally over.

2389
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:57,799
Since Insane Brain,

2390
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,228
I was in 1MILLION until 2019.

2391
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:01,369
It's about ten years.

2392
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,538
I thought of her as a family.

2393
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:04,600
(Lia Kim, Mina Myoung)

2394
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,639
I loved her.

2395
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:07,640
(Mina Myoung, Lia Kim)

2396
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:11,609
But I wasn't treated properly.

2397
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,608
I just can't understand why she thinks...

2398
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:16,108
she was treated unfairly.

2399
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:18,680
There was only one thing I wanted.

2400
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,719
I asked to raise the pay for the choreography demo.

2401
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,688
But the raise never came.

2402
01:45:24,689 --> 01:45:26,829
I wasn't worth it.

2403
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,029
Pay?

2404
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,099
As for the choreography fee,

2405
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:33,170
we would split it in half if we worked together.

2406
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:35,499
It's not that I take more money.

2407
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,039
I trusted her way too much.

2408
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:41,170
I loved her too much.

2409
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,959
I guess can't forget about it,

2410
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,029
considering how emotional I just got.

2411
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:05,329
I have no complaints about Mina.

2412
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,800
I didn't know...

2413
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:10,840
she had so many complaints.

2414
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,579
(Mina Myoung raised a question on the choreography.)

2415
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,039
Is she really going to speak like that?

2416
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,680
Gosh, that's crazy.

2417
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:22,478
When they request for a choreography,

2418
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:25,948
they ask for Lia Kim as the director.

2419
01:46:25,949 --> 01:46:27,750
Then we start making the choreography.

2420
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:29,219
But do they think...

2421
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:32,889
that I steal their opportunities?

2422
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:34,089
They wouldn't have a chance...

2423
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,288
- if it weren't for Lia. - Exactly.

2424
01:46:35,289 --> 01:46:37,000
I think she's so ungrateful.

2425
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,630
It's nonsense.

2426
01:46:38,829 --> 01:46:43,269
What does it mean that she worked on the choreography 100 percent?

2427
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:46,099
When I participate as a director,

2428
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:49,938
I control the quality as a whole.

2429
01:46:49,939 --> 01:46:51,608
"Is the choreography good?"

2430
01:46:51,609 --> 01:46:53,078
"Is there any room to improve?"

2431
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:54,349
I checked those things.

2432
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:57,779
Then does that mean I didn't do anything?

2433
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:01,488
If she's an executive director, she should write that.

2434
01:47:01,489 --> 01:47:03,759
She can't call herself "Choreographer Lia Kim."

2435
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,589
If it includes the moves I make,

2436
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:09,289
it says, "Choreography by Lia Kim and this person."

2437
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:12,858
If I checked and confirmed the final choreography,

2438
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:15,300
it says, "Directed by Lia Kim."

2439
01:47:15,829 --> 01:47:18,500
I made the choreography together!

2440
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:20,369
But why?

2441
01:47:20,539 --> 01:47:22,408
Mentioning her name...

2442
01:47:22,409 --> 01:47:25,609
and talking about her itself...

2443
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,710
is already uncomfortable.

2444
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:30,448
Of course, I don't respect her,

2445
01:47:30,449 --> 01:47:32,979
but she doesn't deserve to get my no respect.

2446
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:36,220
But if I have to battle her?

2447
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,189
Then I won't do it.

2448
01:47:42,029 --> 01:47:45,698
The weakest dancer I chose is...

2449
01:47:45,699 --> 01:47:47,630
- Won't it be Mina? - Exactly.

2450
01:47:47,729 --> 01:47:48,970
It must be Mina Myoung.

2451
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:52,539
(Will Lia Kim choose Mina Myoung like expected?)

2452
01:47:57,609 --> 01:47:59,339
Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung.

2453
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:05,118
(1MILLION's Lia Kim versus Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung)

2454
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,119
Mina Myoung.

2455
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,019
I've waited for this moment!

2456
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,789
It's the battle between the big ones!

2457
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,528
It's finally here.

2458
01:48:14,529 --> 01:48:15,590
I wanted it.

2459
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:17,760
I'm standing up for this.

2460
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,770
This is serious, so it feels different.

2461
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:22,199
It's not fun anymore.

2462
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:25,770
She's too weak to battle against me.

2463
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:29,210
Yes. It was as expected.

2464
01:48:30,409 --> 01:48:31,779
Right.

2465
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:35,109
(Then I won't do the battle!)

2466
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,590
I knew she'd pick me.

2467
01:48:47,489 --> 01:48:49,829
(When Lia Kim was called...)

2468
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,560
It's me.

2469
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:53,800
- I could be someone else. - It will be me.

2470
01:48:54,029 --> 01:48:55,329
It's going to be me.

2471
01:48:56,699 --> 01:48:58,369
Yes. It was as expected.

2472
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:01,109
Right.

2473
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:05,639
You seem to have many complaints about me.

2474
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,809
Right.

2475
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:08,479
It's not a complaint.

2476
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:13,988
I'm highly doubtful...

2477
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:17,959
that you earned the title, head choreographer,

2478
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,858
with your effort alone.

2479
01:49:20,859 --> 01:49:23,159
I didn't steal it from somewhere.

2480
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:26,229
It's nonsense.

2481
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:32,699
Let's stop talking and dance.

2482
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:37,810
Oh, my gosh.

2483
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:39,738
It's really scary.

2484
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:42,108
This is a real fight.

2485
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:43,949
Can I say one more thing?

2486
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:45,278
You talk too much.

2487
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:46,850
(You talk too much.)

2488
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,749
(Will you be quiet?)

2489
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:50,920
Will you be quiet?

2490
01:49:57,930 --> 01:49:58,930
Okay.

2491
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:06,339
No, let's just do it. It's so upsetting.

2492
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,869
Okay. Let's go!

2493
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:12,010
Oh, my goodness!

2494
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:15,379
- What do we do? - It's cold!

2495
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:17,579
- Crazy! - Goodness!

2496
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:22,788
I didn't want to do the battle.

2497
01:50:22,789 --> 01:50:26,560
But it'd cause damage to our crew, so I did it.

2498
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,828
I want her to show me the direction she was going for...

2499
01:50:29,829 --> 01:50:31,630
with her dance.

2500
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,828
World-class battle dancer and world-class choreographer,

2501
01:50:34,829 --> 01:50:36,198
Lia Kim from 1MILLION...

2502
01:50:36,199 --> 01:50:37,398
versus a legendary choreographer...

2503
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:39,439
who loves K-pop, Mina Myoung from Deep N Dap.

2504
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:41,108
You guys ready?

2505
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:42,810
Go, Mina Myoung!

2506
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,908
Fight!

2507
01:50:44,909 --> 01:50:47,509
(It will be revealed next week.)

2508
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:49,009
We built it together.

2509
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,879
I didn't ignore your efforts.

2510
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,648
You did your best too.

2511
01:50:52,649 --> 01:50:53,789
I didn't...

2512
01:50:55,489 --> 01:50:57,520
- For goodness' sake. - It's okay.

2513
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,090
As you come and go...

2514
01:51:03,659 --> 01:51:05,059
When it's the Korea-Japan match,

2515
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:06,430
we have to win.

2516
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,728
I chose...

2517
01:51:07,729 --> 01:51:09,430
Akanen of TSUBA KILL.

2518
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:11,738
(It's finally time for the Korea-Japan match.)

2519
01:51:11,739 --> 01:51:13,469
(Mini of Wolf'Lo versus Akanen of TSUBA KILL)

2520
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:14,809
I'm so excited.

2521
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:16,039
You have to win.

2522
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:17,839
I will be brutal.

2523
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,310
When it comes to dance,

2524
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:20,510
Japan does better.

2525
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:23,478
(Everyone was hyped about the battle.)

2526
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:25,880
(Mini versus Akanen, who will win?)

2527
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:27,488
She's representing Japan,

2528
01:51:27,489 --> 01:51:28,819
and she can only dance like that?

2529
01:51:28,989 --> 01:51:30,560
This will be an easy win.

2530
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:33,219
Korean dancers are...

2531
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,629
not that good.

2532
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:36,329
(Is this it?)

2533
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,528
When it comes to dance skills,

2534
01:51:38,529 --> 01:51:40,399
I think I'm much better.

2535
01:51:40,899 --> 01:51:42,769
I think we are better...

2536
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:43,800
than all of them.

2537
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,869
The next mission is Class Mission.

2538
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:49,970
We're finally doing it.

2539
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:51,778
"Hey Mama" and "New Thing" are coming back.

2540
01:51:51,779 --> 01:51:53,578
People loved it,

2541
01:51:53,579 --> 01:51:55,250
and it became a sensation.

2542
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:58,249
(The leaders have gathered in the same place.)

2543
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:00,289
(The lineup here is top-notch.)

2544
01:52:00,449 --> 01:52:01,749
(The leader class competes fiercely with choreography.)

2545
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:04,489
Bada was the only one that caught my eye.

2546
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,760
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

2547
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:10,529
(But Lia Kim keeps making mistakes.)

2548
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:13,028
A choreographer stops during the routine...

2549
01:52:13,029 --> 01:52:15,329
because she can't keep up?

2550
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:18,899
I want Bada's choreography the most because it's the coolest.

2551
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,809
If I choose that, Bada will be the main dancer.

2552
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:23,538
I think I can steal Lia Kim's moves.

2553
01:52:23,539 --> 01:52:24,739
I'm 100 percent sure I can.

2554
01:52:24,939 --> 01:52:26,439
What? Is it over?

2555
01:52:28,649 --> 01:52:30,549
(Which choreography did the leader class choose?)

2556
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:33,379
Taking the choreography and doing it the way to get the main dancer.

2557
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:35,850
The main dancer is supposed to stand out.

2558
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,589
(An audition for the main dancer by class)

2559
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:40,228
I was waiting for that moment.

2560
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:41,489
This is when the real battle starts.

2561
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:44,959
Yoonji and Waackxxxy are..

2562
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,829
Strong competitors.

2563
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:48,970
(The middle-class are keeping Yoonji and Waackxxxy in check?)

2564
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:50,139
What's that?

2565
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:51,538
I was looking forward to seeing them.

2566
01:52:51,539 --> 01:52:52,938
I thought maybe it'd be hard to watch,

2567
01:52:52,939 --> 01:52:54,239
or even scary.

2568
01:52:54,439 --> 01:52:56,568
When people see Yoonji and Waackxxxy's dance,

2569
01:52:56,569 --> 01:52:58,038
will they think it's beautiful?

2570
01:52:58,039 --> 01:53:00,249
What if they say it's too scary to watch?

2571
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:01,850
Will they be able to endure their energy?

2572
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:03,409
I understand that.

2573
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:07,250
(An audition for the main dancer among the sub-leader class)

2574
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:10,019
To be honest, I thought it was unfair.

2575
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,889
It looked like she was not even trying.

2576
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:14,289
She's competing with her physical strength.

2577
01:53:14,359 --> 01:53:16,489
That's what I was thinking.

2578
01:53:17,029 --> 01:53:18,429
I was grinding my teeth while dancing...

2579
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:19,630
because I wanted to win so bad.

2580
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:22,600
Honestly, I knew she was my rival.

2581
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:25,538
But hearing that, my thoughts have changed.

2582
01:53:25,539 --> 01:53:28,510
(It's a psychological battle between two sub-leaders.)

2583
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,938
I thought I was being respectful to them.

2584
01:53:31,939 --> 01:53:33,140
- But... - You were.

2585
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:35,749
They must prove their worth...

2586
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,220
during the ranking battle by class.

2587
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:39,778
The main dancers, who will be the star of the dance videos,

2588
01:53:39,779 --> 01:53:41,449
will be chosen from each class.

2589
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:46,419
Why did we come from Japan if we won't be in the video?

2590
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,689
I don't understand why we had to come all the way here.

2591
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:51,060
Should we go back to Japan?

2592
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:59,238
(Vote now for the crew song performance...)

2593
01:53:59,239 --> 01:54:03,170
(to determine the final winning crew.)
