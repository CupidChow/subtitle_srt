1
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,088
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,989
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,699
It was the moment of truth.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,729
It was my turn to show off my skills.

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,899
I brought this outfit for the Class Mission.

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,128
Who stood out?

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,839
I honestly thought that it'd be me.

8
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:31,969
(Sighing)

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,139
Harimu stands out the most.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,109
No one can beat her in terms of outfits.

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,710
She ate a whole zebra.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,009
(The second zebra in the fight zone, Mini)

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,750
That girl wearing pink is awesome.

14
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,119
She only wore pink clothes.

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,219
She never missed a day of wearing pink.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,358
Even her bag. It's awesome.

17
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,688
I brought all my pink items.

18
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:52,719
I have to buy more now.

19
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:53,890
I ran out of them.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,229
My type was...

21
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:56,490
Sayaka.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,259
She's just so sexy.

23
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,829
Tight shirts and bell-bottoms.

24
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,329
But she always has some holes.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
And all her clothes are gorgeous.

26
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,310
I brought 44kg of clothes from Japan.

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,239
Because I didn't want to lose.

28
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,848
(But she still has nothing to wear.)

29
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,679
(Pondering)

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,849
Should I wear my hat or not?

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,849
I should wear it if I want to look tough.

32
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,319
Bada is extremely tall, right?

33
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,260
So, she looks good in whatever she's wearing.

34
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,658
What she prefers is...

35
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,359
the trendy and cool style much like her dance.

36
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,099
But Haechi Wang was as tall as Bada.

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,669
How come kids these days...

38
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,430
are so long and tall?

39
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,539
I realized that the important part was...

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,310
to dress according to the genre.

41
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,939
When we dance, the first thing that people see is our outfits.

42
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,079
The outfit changes the mood of the whole performance.

43
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,379
I've always wanted a performance where the dancers stood out.

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,519
We came up with fancier outfits.

45
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,659
We certainly want to look extremely cool on stage.

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,889
(We're the Stylish Woman Fighters.)

47
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,158
(The dance videos of each class are revealed.)

48
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,159
This is competitive.

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,999
The main dancer will now point to the worst dancer.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I choose...

51
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,568
(Who's the worst dancer that surprised everyone?)

52
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,830
I was furious.

53
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,569
(The two finalist crews will be chosen.)

54
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:12,999
One crew got that many votes?

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,908
(Which crew that lost by a landslide will be eliminated?)

56
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,979
(Vote for your favourite crew!)

57
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,310
Street Woman Fighter 2, Class Mission.

58
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,508
The main dancer...

59
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,619
(The main dancers of the leader, sub-leader, and rookie classes...)

60
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,649
(have been decided.)

61
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,520
(Main Dancer Audition, Middle class)

62
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,819
The Main Dancer Audition for the middle class will begin.

63
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,589
There are so many people.

64
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,758
This is going to be tough.

65
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,189
I bet it's going to be fierce.

66
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,770
Whose dance was chosen in the middle class?

67
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,099
We need to pick the choreography.

68
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,840
But I don't want to pick any of them.

69
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,479
All six choreographies weren't so good.

70
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,378
I don't know. I forgot all of them.

71
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,710
(All the choreographies so far)

72
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,120
Shall we begin?

73
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,089
(Waackxxxy and Yoonji from MANNEQUEEN go next.)

74
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,389
The seventh one.

75
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,989
When we made this sequence,

76
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,889
we had the online challenge in mind.

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,030
We believe that it'll be a popular challenge...

78
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,969
when it's revealed to the public.

79
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,900
So anyone could do it.

80
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,469
It's nice and easy.

81
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,909
They were clever.

82
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,348
It went beyond genres,

83
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,680
and it was a simple yet powerful performance.

84
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,889
I didn't really understand.

85
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,289
Simple is good, but I believe that dancers are artists.

86
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,489
(Their demonstration ends with a bang.)

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,830
Oh, my gosh.

88
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,500
I love this one.

89
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,629
I think it's perfect.

90
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,068
I love it so much. The details are perfect.

91
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,568
(Their choreography has favourable responses.)

92
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,809
Why don't we watch TSUBA KILL's choreo?

93
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,739
- I'm nervous. - Nervous.

94
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,710
Very nervous.

95
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,408
Once we heard that we were making a dance video,

96
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,280
I wanted to make something that was cool.

97
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:09,489
First of all, we're professional dancers.

98
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,188
We're not TikTok dancers. We're actual dancers.

99
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,800
(We're not TikTok dancers. We're actual dancers.)

100
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,859
(Reading the room)

101
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,528
"Why would you do an easy one when there's a cool one?"

102
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,929
That's what it felt like when she said it.

103
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,768
We're not going to do simple steps.

104
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,040
We still have to be dancers.

105
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,009
I hope you guys get it.

106
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,079
I thought that was targeted at us.

107
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,679
(Waackxxxy and Yoonji went against Momo and Yumeri...)

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,149
(at the 2-on-2 battle.)

109
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,660
(Momo and Yumeri were defeated.)

110
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,389
I absolutely want to win, Yumeri.

111
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,959
I'd never get it if they didn't choose ours.

112
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,850
(Momo and Yumeri finish their demonstration last.)

113
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,290
I spotted a few mistakes.

114
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,750
(Slipping)

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm thinking, as a group...

116
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,930
I feel like everyone's going to pick this one.

117
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,999
It had good balance. Yes.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,198
(Keeping them in check)

119
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,628
Judging from the level of completion,

120
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,299
it was impressive.

121
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,869
- Thank you. - Thank you.

122
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,109
(They respond favourably to the choreo.)

123
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,769
How about we take a vote?

124
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,180
TSUBA KILL and MANNEQUEEN are tied 4 to 4.

125
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,479
Why don't we discuss?

126
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,579
(The rest of the 6 crews will discuss.)

127
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,579
Do you think you can take over MANNEQUEEN's choreo?

128
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,849
- Can you? - I think we have a shot.

129
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,850
- The main dancer position? - Yes.

130
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,850
- You can? - Yes.

131
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:51,660
MANNEQUEEN's choreo is easier for everyone to learn.

132
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,289
And then, you can execute it in your own style.

133
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,860
But TSUBA KILL's choreo is just more difficult.

134
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,129
- I guess we're out. - Yes.

135
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,599
We've decided on MANNEQUEEN's choreo.

136
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,768
- Thank you! - Thank you.

137
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,269
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

138
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,980
I was irritated.

139
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,679
We reckoned...

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,009
that other dancers stood a chance at MANNEQUEEN's choreo.

141
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,349
So, a lot more people...

142
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,850
could go for the main dancer position.

143
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,589
I could never understand why they chose that.

144
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,129
They took MANNEQUEEN's.

145
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,528
- What? Are you serious? - Yes.

146
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,458
Their only reason was because they wanted to be the main dancer.

147
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,370
It was disappointing, overall.

148
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,499
We should have just free-styled...

149
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,138
and have the judge choose the dancer tomorrow.

150
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,869
That's how we should have decided.

151
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,638
I'm starting to get angry.

152
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,909
I still think that our choreo was better.

153
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,249
I don't like how it ends.

154
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,980
I hate it.

155
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,750
But we can change it up when we become the main dancers.

156
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,719
We don't think that our choreo lost.

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,929
We believe that we love dancing as much as they do,

158
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,959
so we'll walk the walk instead of just talking the talk.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,328
That's cool.

160
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,999
We hate losing.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
So, we'll fight.

162
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,169
We were two dancers who were dying to fight.

163
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,740
We're definitely going to be the main dancers.

164
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,439
I'm into Friedrich Nietzsche, the philosopher.

165
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,979
He said that you must win by a landslide when you win.

166
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,279
It shouldn't even be close.

167
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,879
- Let's finish it. - Let's do it.

168
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,578
- Ready? - Let's go,

169
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,689
- Yoonji and Waackxxxy! - Let's fight!

170
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,920
(The Main Dancer Audition for the middle class starts.)

171
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,458
(Group number one, Chocol and Haechi Wang)

172
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,019
(Waackxxxy and Yoonji)

173
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,160
Yes!

174
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,869
(Chocol and Haechi Wang make a mistake from the start.)

175
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,410
Oh, no. They slipped.

176
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,439
That's all right. Keep going.

177
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,120
They're so good.

178
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,628
(Group number two, Naro and Vessi)

179
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,068
(Kyma and Cheche)

180
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,769
- Let's go! - Okay.

181
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,099
Being a main dancer is easy.

182
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,170
Yes!

183
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,509
We don't even start dancing unless we're confident.

184
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,139
Okay.

185
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,110
All right!

186
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,750
Looking good.

187
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,559
Okay.

188
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,730
Well done!

189
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,869
Let's go!

190
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,070
I was determined to take the position.

191
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,479
It's pretty obvious. If you watch us for five seconds, you can tell.

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
(Group number three, Debby and Amy)

193
00:08:58,481 --> 00:08:59,538
(Ling and Audrey)

194
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,080
- Let's go! - Go, girls!

195
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,750
Hey.

196
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,580
Yes.

197
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
(Fiery)

198
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,990
- Yes! - Let's go.

199
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,758
Nice.

200
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,860
- Nice. - Yes!

201
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,399
Okay.

202
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,740
Hey.

203
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,950
(Audrey and Ling killed it!)

204
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,480
That was beautiful.

205
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,750
- Let's go, Deep N Dap! - Deep N Dap!

206
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,058
The main dancers will be decided by this.

207
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,158
I wanted to show them.

208
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,229
- Let's go! - Go!

209
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,128
We didn't want to dance to the original choreo the same way,

210
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,200
so we decided to add our vibe to it.

211
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,128
We can add some of our own stuff, can't we?

212
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,138
Yes, you can!

213
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,210
We're not robots, so doing it the same way is boring.

214
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,739
(Eagle eyes)

215
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,779
Yes!

216
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,138
(Group number four, Minny Park and JJ)

217
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,279
(Yumeri and Momo)

218
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,279
They added a move.

219
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,419
We're going to be the main dancers.

220
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,700
What?

221
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,039
It's way too different. They can't change the whole thing.

222
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
Yes!

223
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,190
(TSUBA KILL nailed it!)

224
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,489
- They changed it a lot... - They changed it a lot.

225
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,758
Into their own style.

226
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,860
Were we allowed to change some of the moves?

227
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,229
It's okay to change it.

228
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,658
But they should have at least tried to keep it similar to ours.

229
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,059
They just did what they wanted.

230
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:05,000
We'd like to watch some of you one more time.

231
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,109
MANNEQUEEN and TSUBA KILL.

232
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,239
- Good luck! - We'll never let them take it.

233
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,909
I knew it!

234
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,449
- Next, 1MILLION and... - Yes!

235
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,379
- Don't be nervous. - Let's take it!

236
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,648
JAM REPUBLIC.

237
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,149
- Use your face, Ling. - Let's go.

238
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,589
We've got this.

239
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,220
Let's show them the difference.

240
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,319
We wanted to show them...

241
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,019
- how desperate we were. - Exactly.

242
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,288
(Second audition, group number one)

243
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,330
(Yumeri and Momo, Waackxxxy and Yoonji)

244
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,899
(They're feeling it!)

245
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,710
Here it comes!

246
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,309
Yes!

247
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,320
Hey.

248
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,500
Hey!

249
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,239
- Let's go, girls. - Come on!

250
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,570
- Let's go. - Go, 1MILLION!

251
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,809
Let's go.

252
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,210
Hey!

253
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,779
Here they go.

254
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,149
Yes.

255
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,649
Hey, now.

256
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,990
Nice.

257
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,740
Have you decided?

258
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,878
(Amazed)

259
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,378
Please.

260
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,678
We had the best teamwork.

261
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,849
I think they might lose the part...

262
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,878
because their facial expressions are way too intense.

263
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,119
The judges might have thought it was too much.

264
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,019
MANNEQUEEN is in trouble.

265
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,288
I think they did better.

266
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,628
In terms of quality... It was top quality.

267
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,959
But they weren't main dancer material for me.

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,258
- They were just dancers. - I see.

269
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,199
Their personalities on video were strong.

270
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,340
All right. I will now announce the main dancer of the middle class.

271
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,169
Please.

272
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,809
The main dancer of the middle class is...

273
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,440
Please.

274
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,308
"They have to pick us."

275
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,750
That was all I had in mind.

276
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,619
I want to win and contribute to our crew.

277
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,788
(The competition was twice as fierce.)

278
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,519
(Which duo will be the main dancers?)

279
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,490
They're MANNEQUEEN's Waackxxxy and Yoonji.

280
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,299
(We did it!)

281
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,330
Yes!

282
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,330
(Dashing)

283
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,928
I was so scared.

284
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,638
- We were all scared. - We did it.

285
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,739
Waackxxxy and Yoonji.

286
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,100
(Disappointed)

287
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,210
Why? I seriously don't get it.

288
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,149
(Main Dancers for the middle class, Yoonji and Waackxxxy)

289
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,409
They got the title after all.

290
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,419
That's the MANNEQUEEN we know.

291
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,019
We've got to get on their good side now.

292
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,918
Yumeri seems really pissed.

293
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,388
She looks like she's about to cry.

294
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:16,189
Well, I have no choice but to accept the result.

295
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,859
I just kept telling myself we could only go up from here.

296
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,730
(Disappointed)

297
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,298
It was hard for me to make this decision,

298
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,499
to be honest.

299
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,940
I personally like to see different kinds of expressions.

300
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,508
Watching Yoonji and Waackxxxy dance...

301
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,439
is like watching a scary movie...

302
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,210
or a war movie. They express such intense emotions.

303
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,548
That's what makes it hard to forget. It leaves a strong impression.

304
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,620
However,

305
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,319
I wonder if people would find...

306
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,919
their dance beautiful.

307
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,730
Seeing their movements,

308
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,999
would they simply think...

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,028
those women are sexy?

310
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,569
Or would they say it's too scary to watch?

311
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,429
Would they be able to accept their energy?

312
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,500
Through this opportunity,

313
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,739
I want the public to experience this kind of intensity too.

314
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,878
I want them to have a new perspective, ideas,

315
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,949
and feelings toward dancing.

316
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,949
That's why I made a bold choice and picked...

317
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,579
Yoonji and Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN.

318
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,489
(Monika gave them honest feedback after careful consideration.)

319
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,659
I had mixed feelings that can't be described in one word.

320
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,959
People comment on our YouTube videos...

321
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,758
- about our figures... - Right.

322
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,398
And looks. We get a lot of those.

323
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,258
Frankly, they never bothered me.

324
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,569
But today, I thought, "Should I not have ignored them?"

325
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,739
They never affected me before,

326
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,899
but today, I started to have doubts.

327
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,638
For the first time, I started wondering if it's actually...

328
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,779
important for our dance to look good and beautiful,

329
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,220
and it hit me really hard.

330
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,330
I understand what she said.

331
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,599
It's true that we need to tone down our energy.

332
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,070
Because we can't do everything perfectly.

333
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,199
(While feeling relieved she won the title, )

334
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,039
(Yoonji has a lot on her mind.)

335
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,609
(Main dancers: Bada, LaTrice, )

336
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,939
(Yoonji and Waackxxxy, Rena)

337
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,509
(The day of dance video shoot for the Class Mission)

338
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,149
- It's a prison. - This is nice.

339
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
- Look at those cars. - So cool.

340
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:22,549
This is all so grand.

341
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,090
We're going to be dancing here?

342
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:25,359
This is so cool.

343
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,519
Amazing.

344
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,629
(The sets with different themes are revealed.)

345
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,129
(It's time for makeup.)

346
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,500
Keep your eyes closed.

347
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,898
Oh, my goodness.

348
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,809
(The leaders' shocking makeover?)

349
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,110
No one would want to talk to me.

350
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,679
How does Bada look?

351
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,878
(Dazzling)

352
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,918
I was so jealous.

353
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,689
While we looked all messy,

354
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,120
Bada looked fresh and pretty alone.

355
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,789
I thought, "So that's one of the perks of being the main dancer."

356
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,429
The main dancer got better treatment including the makeup.

357
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,160
- Right. - I can't stand it.

358
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,159
- We should be the heroines. - I can't.

359
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,299
I've got nothing.

360
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,899
Being the main dancer has its perks.

361
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,499
It's going to look great. It's a nice remover.

362
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,709
(Glancing)

363
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,940
- Hey, LaTrice. - Hey.

364
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,479
Ta-Da.

365
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,108
(Harimu got LaTrice a present.)

366
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,749
- So cute. - That's so darn cute.

367
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,380
It was a heartfelt gift, but to be completely honest,

368
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,289
I didn't want her to pick me as the worst dancer.

369
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,089
(Glancing)

370
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,459
I thought, "That wouldn't make any difference."

371
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,288
I just thought I shouldn't get on her bad side...

372
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,160
and get picked as the worst dancer.

373
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,828
(All groups start filming the video.)

374
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,630
- Let's rehearse it. - Okay.

375
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,970
In 3, 2, 1. Start.

376
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,009
(The leaders are perfectly in sync even during the rehearsal.)

377
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,539
Let's watch it first.

378
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,450
- Hello, it's Kang Daniel here. - Gosh.

379
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,150
- What's this? - He scared me.

380
00:17:58,779 --> 00:17:59,919
(Surprised)

381
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,549
Hey. Attention, please.

382
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,219
I have something to tell you guys.

383
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,989
Since you will be graded individually for this mission,

384
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,729
you should try and stand out in the video...

385
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,599
so the judges will notice you, right?

386
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,568
For that reason, you can now rearrange...

387
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,869
your places in the completed choreography.

388
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,099
- Gosh. - What?

389
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,709
(Rearrange places?)

390
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,839
What the heck?

391
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,578
But the person who can make this call...

392
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,279
is the main dancer.

393
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,019
No.

394
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,288
Since your individual score is important,

395
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,990
promote yourselves to seize the last chance.

396
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:39,959
(A new rule is added to the Class Mission.)

397
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,288
He tells us this at the last moment?

398
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,930
We have a new rule.

399
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,529
The competition will be fierce.

400
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,930
Everyone would fight hard to get closer to the center.

401
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,099
I love it.

402
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,568
I was going to ask for it anyway.

403
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:52,869
I have to stay on my toes.

404
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,409
I'll do my best where I am now, and won't let anyone...

405
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,568
take my place.

406
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,679
Dancers in my group asked me to change their places.

407
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,108
We're the largest group of 16 people.

408
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,179
- It's our decision. - That's right.

409
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,818
(A gas station in Hannam-dong)

410
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,490
(It's where the sub-leaders are filming their dance video.)

411
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,459
I have to make an appearance in the video...

412
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,129
to give the judges something to evaluate.

413
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,288
Maybe to the left or...

414
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,499
(Raising hand)

415
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,230
- Yes. - For the second part,

416
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,329
can I dance closer to the center?

417
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,298
Switch with Downy.

418
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,869
(Switch with Downy.)

419
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,369
- No, I reject. - Reject?

420
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,179
It didn't have to be Downy,

421
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,879
but LaTrice told me to switch with her.

422
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,108
Downy, timing.

423
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:37,880
Downy, be careful. Your timing...

424
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,778
- Downy. Yes. - I have to go.

425
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,018
It was a little bit out.

426
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,019
Downy.

427
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,858
I was just dancing in my own style,

428
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,758
but she kept saying I was doing it wrong.

429
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,229
When I asked for a change of place,

430
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,390
I think she had me switch with Downy without hesitation...

431
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,700
because she didn't trust her.

432
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,829
(Downy was placed near the center next to LaTrice.)

433
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,839
(After Biggy's request, she was moved to the side.)

434
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,109
I like that.

435
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,639
My decision is this take.

436
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,108
- I like the switch. - The switch?

437
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,809
Yes, I like it. Sorry.

438
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,749
It felt like she was trying to exclude me,

439
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,349
and it was so upsetting.

440
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,349
I don't want to do this.

441
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,119
I can't do this.

442
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,690
(They had to stop the shoot.)

443
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,230
(What will happen to the sub-leaders?)

444
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,159
Hey. There!

445
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,629
(The rookies are getting along well.)

446
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,670
That's cute.

447
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,399
Everyone was excited...

448
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,308
except for one person. She looked unhappy.

449
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,639
Everyone was just having fun.

450
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,179
They didn't seem worried or intimidated by others.

451
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,839
Frankly, I'm so scared.

452
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,479
During the practice,

453
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,220
I couldn't keep up with the others.

454
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,019
I really don't want to come in last and get picked as the worst dancer.

455
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,759
When this mission is over, you're all dead.

456
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,229
- Great job, everyone! - Nice job!

457
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,329
Good work.

458
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,999
(The day after the shoot, )

459
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,129
(everyone is gathered at the fight club.)

460
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,369
- Gosh. - Hey!

461
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,069
Goodness.

462
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,368
Are you doing all right?

463
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,669
- Yes. - Yes, Bada.

464
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,740
- Are you okay? - I'm dead tired.

465
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,670
How was it? Was there a war of nerves?

466
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,608
I worked my butt off.

467
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,639
She says she worked hard.

468
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,949
If I get picked as the worst dancer,

469
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,210
then I'd just walk out of here.

470
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,379
Because that'd be a cheap shot. I worked so hard.

471
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
That can't happen.

472
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:22,589
- How was your outfit? - Different from the main dancer's?

473
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,660
It was totally different. The makeup too.

474
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,659
They messed up our faces...

475
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
while Bada looked beautiful.

476
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,159
Bad girl.

477
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,659
It doesn't matter if you're older or more experienced.

478
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,329
The main dancer has all the power.

479
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,699
We're at war here.

480
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,969
Hey, how was the sub-leader class?

481
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,868
Everybody would agree that the competition...

482
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,239
was the fiercest among the sub-leaders.

483
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,508
- Tensions ran so high. - Interesting.

484
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,880
I heard you took someone's place.

485
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,379
It wasn't me. It was Biggy.

486
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,449
Really?

487
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,308
Biggy keeps getting on my nerves.

488
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,319
- Why? - She just does.

489
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,589
Downy made a lot of mistakes that day.

490
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,189
Deep N Dap?

491
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,919
I thought about whether I should ask or not hundreds of times,

492
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,959
and I decided to speak up.

493
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,689
I wanted to get over the switch,

494
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,429
but she kept tiptoeing around me.

495
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,959
What did she expect?

496
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,659
If Downy becomes the worst dancer,

497
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,969
- She might. - she might blame me for it.

498
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,039
- Who do you think is the worst? - Biggy.

499
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,339
Even if I'm the worst dancer, I'm still proud of myself.

500
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,338
I couldn't have worked harder than that.

501
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,009
- Me neither. - Right, we did our best.

502
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,149
Welcome to Street Woman Fighter 2.

503
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm Kang Daniel, your host.

504
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,518
(Welcoming the host)

505
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,549
Yes!

506
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,318
Here's how we'll decide the rankings for this mission.

507
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,558
The fight judges will grade your performance individually,

508
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,689
and the rankings will be decided...

509
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,798
based on the sum of your crew members' scores.

510
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,229
Here's the main dancer of each class.

511
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,368
The leader class, Bada of BEBE.

512
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,798
The sub-leader class, LaTrice of JAM REPUBLIC.

513
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,308
The middle class, Waackxxxy and Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN.

514
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,808
The rookie class, Rena of TSUBA KILL.

515
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:53,979
They have the power to pick the worst dancer...

516
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,549
and deduct 50 points from her crew.

517
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:00,720
Please watch your video and choose...

518
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,289
the worst dancer in your class.

519
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,660
This is it.

520
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,989
They'll choose straight away?

521
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,588
Don't pick me.

522
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:10,690
Oh, my gosh.

523
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,859
I just trust that I will not be the worst dancer.

524
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,969
This is what we've been waiting for.

525
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,139
In the last episode,

526
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,669
the battles were all so crazy, right?

527
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,809
I'm just as excited as you are.

528
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,608
I wonder if Rena showed her detailed expressions...

529
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,909
in the video as well.

530
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,609
- Yes, you're right. - Yes.

531
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,278
Here's how the dance begins.

532
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,649
(The rookies begin their practice with Rena's new dance piece.)

533
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,118
We'll decide where the hands go later.

534
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,959
Let's put them here for now.

535
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
(Let's put them here for now.)

536
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,660
What's going on?

537
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,358
She hadn't finished the dance.

538
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,970
It was disorganized.

539
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:50,469
What was the next move again?

540
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,470
(Things aren't going smoothly because the dance is incomplete.)

541
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,500
I was really worried.

542
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,109
(Sighing)

543
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,139
I felt bad for the other dancers,

544
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,549
but I didn't want to compromise my dance piece.

545
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,308
(Hesitating)

546
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,318
I might change this later, but can we try it once?

547
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,689
(I might change this later, but can we try it once?)

548
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,150
She wasn't even prepared. How could she be the main dancer?

549
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,220
(Thinking)

550
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,089
It's okay.

551
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,930
You're kind.

552
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,500
I was unhappy, but what could I do?

553
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,160
We all have to smile, don't we?

554
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,460
Is this okay?

555
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,900
(Smiling)

556
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:26,139
I don't want to be the worst dancer,

557
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,339
so I've been helping Rena a lot.

558
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,639
Can we all strike different poses?

559
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,848
(Redy helps Rena by translating Korean into Japanese.)

560
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,008
That's okay.

561
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,808
Rena, how about this?

562
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,419
(She also gives Rena new ideas.)

563
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,180
- Up? Okay. - Up.

564
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,750
Thank you.

565
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,720
She was trying hard.

566
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm not going to sit back and watch.

567
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,190
It's not working.

568
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,629
The cable doesn't fit?

569
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,759
(Gooseul helps setting up the speaker.)

570
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,298
(She also reassures Rena.)

571
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,169
- It's okay. - Rena.

572
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,969
(She asks for Rena's permission to go to the restroom.)

573
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,569
You can go to the restroom.

574
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,240
I think there's a slight chance I'll be the worst dancer.

575
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,140
Let's start by ruling out one of the pieces.

576
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,348
I think...

577
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,579
(Gooseul picked Rena's dance piece as the worst.)

578
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,480
It might be too difficult for us to learn in such a short time.

579
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,589
She looked angry for the first time.

580
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,990
I've got to be nice to Rena...

581
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,390
so she won't pick me as the worst dancer.

582
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,028
(TSUBA KILL's hideout)

583
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:25,359
- Rena. - Yes?

584
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,599
Congratulations.

585
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:29,470
Thank you.

586
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,799
You were great.

587
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,170
(Rena was touched.)

588
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,279
I'm sure I won't be the worst dancer.

589
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,778
(The day of the rookies' dance video shoot)

590
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,880
Korean famous vitamins.

591
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,049
It's a present.

592
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,449
(Thanks to the present, they start out on good terms.)

593
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,489
How cute.

594
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,649
Thank you.

595
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,889
- Up, down, up, up, down - Up, down, up, up, down

596
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,019
I guess everyone is smiling...

597
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,859
and being nice to Rena to get on her good side.

598
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,929
(Yeni Cho and Buckey are practicing quietly.)

599
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,169
I have only one goal.

600
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,299
To avoid finishing last and being the worst dancer.

601
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,099
The others can do whatever they want.

602
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,839
I'm worried I might be the worst dancer.

603
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,879
I'm dancing behind Rena, and I'm invisible at first.

604
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,349
The fact that you can't see me at the beginning...

605
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,710
makes me really worried. I feel anxious.

606
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,250
I don't know.

607
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,349
What am I going to do?

608
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,890
Honestly, you can barely see me in the video, right?

609
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,359
I'm always in the back.

610
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,788
(Rena put Gooseul on the side.)

611
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,430
I'm never close to the center.

612
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:32,059
I'm not in the place where people can notice me,

613
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,259
and I'm not happy with it.

614
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,669
You and Tatter stand out the most.

615
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,700
I could take your place.

616
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,339
Go ahead.

617
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,700
But not mine.

618
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,910
Redy.

619
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,508
I have an idea.

620
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,739
It's about the move we do on the stairs.

621
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,348
(There's a part where they dance on the stairs.)

622
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:55,118
(The 4 of them are supposed to dance together in the center.)

623
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,019
This is it.

624
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,490
- It might break. - We can't do this. It won't work.

625
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,659
What if we suggest we do it just the two of us?

626
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,729
I like that.

627
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,358
- It's just us - It's just us

628
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,459
Then we go like this.

629
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,730
(Gooseul and Redy come up with their own dance in advance.)

630
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,868
- Nice. - Nice.

631
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,240
We have to push for it.

632
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:14,039
I love it. It's much better than the original.

633
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,339
- Yes? - Rena.

634
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,069
- Look. We can't do it. - We can't do it.

635
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,480
What should we do?

636
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,609
(There isn't enough time for all 4 of them to dance.)

637
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,179
It'll be hard for all of us to go down the stairs.

638
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,989
Also, Gooseul and I don't have...

639
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,149
our own part.

640
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,389
(We don't have our own part.)

641
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,358
"Focus." This is it.

642
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,759
We were hoping for something more.

643
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,929
Okay.

644
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,130
What do you think about making some changes?

645
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,299
Yes, okay.

646
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,239
Then we should probably call Buckey.

647
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,669
It's difficult for the four of us to do it together.

648
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,838
Maybe the two of them could do it alone up to this part.

649
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,108
(The two of them could do it alone.)

650
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,479
We stay up there,

651
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,950
and our part ends there.

652
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,778
I was like, "What on earth happened?"

653
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,719
We were supposed to do it together,

654
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,518
but they changed it on the spot.

655
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,018
It was so stressful.

656
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:10,490
(Buckey was supposed to dance in the center with Rena.)

657
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,900
(After the change, she was excluded from the part.)

658
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,538
(Satisfied)

659
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:22,338
It seemed like the right thing to do,

660
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:25,538
but I was still losing my part.

661
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,940
I was just confused.

662
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,609
(At that moment)

663
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,318
The thing is, I don't make an appearance...

664
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:35,549
until the twerking,

665
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,220
and I barely do anything during the stair dance.

666
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,528
I just wanted to ask you if you can make...

667
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,059
some changes for me too.

668
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,630
You have a point.

669
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,940
The twerking is...

670
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,269
The song's title is "Twerk,"

671
00:28:56,369 --> 00:29:00,209
and the twerking is like the highlight of the whole dance.

672
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,578
I hope you'll do your best during that part.

673
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,650
What do you think?

674
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,048
What if I'm not okay with it?

675
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,960
(What if I'm not okay with it?)

676
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,720
(Displeased)

677
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,268
But whether you're okay with it or not,

678
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,099
I call the shots, right?

679
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,669
I felt that it's unfair,

680
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,768
and I just had a feeling...

681
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,778
that I might be the worst dancer.

682
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,308
I have a few people in mind.

683
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,679
I'm going to make the decision after the shoot.

684
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,848
For my crew and myself,

685
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,249
I don't want to be the worst dancer.

686
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,960
I'm going to do my very best.

687
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,419
All right. Let's now watch...

688
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,859
the rookie's dance video.

689
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,959
Oh, my gosh!

690
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,298
(They couldn't be more nervous.)

691
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,000
- Gosh. - I'm nervous too.

692
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,869
Here we go.

693
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,380
Okay, let's go.

694
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:14,680
("Twerk" by MIYEON and YUQI of (G)I-DLE)

695
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,789
(Emma is the best.)

696
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:26,160
Let's go.

697
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,099
(Way to go, Emma!)

698
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,150
That was cute.

699
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,250
Good job.

700
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,499
(Capri is the best.)

701
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,599
That's cute.

702
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,710
How cute.

703
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,159
(They're loving it.)

704
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,689
(Full of excitement)

705
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,890
It looks great.

706
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,039
(Listen to "Twerk" on all streaming platforms.)

707
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,308
It was awesome.

708
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,920
It's amazing how the video shows everyone.

709
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,749
Oh, my goodness!

710
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,989
- Hey! - You did a great job!

711
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,460
You looked so cute.

712
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,629
Hey, you did great.

713
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,459
Buckey, you did great.

714
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,799
Rena let everyone take the stage in turns.

715
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,798
Cool.

716
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,098
The choreography itself is really good.

717
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,440
- I love it. - Yes.

718
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,409
There are some moves that anyone can try and enjoy.

719
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,569
Rena killed it.

720
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,338
Totally.

721
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:54,109
I think we made the right choice.

722
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,919
Rena seems to have levelled up with her choreography. Right?

723
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,450
I can sense Capri's strong determination.

724
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:03,990
It's like she wants to dance until her body breaks.

725
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,359
Capri is a natural.

726
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,018
Hey, you were amazing.

727
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,358
Great job.

728
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,558
I think the judges...

729
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,929
will give Capri a good score.

730
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,160
Capri stood out.

731
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,159
You have one minute.

732
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,000
Rena, please discuss with your crew and decide the worst dancer.

733
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:21,799
She'll choose right away like this?

734
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,210
Please, Rena.

735
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,839
It'd better not be us.

736
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,309
Don't pick us.

737
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,480
If they mess with us, they'll be crying later.

738
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:34,348
Based on what I've seen, I've been considering...

739
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:35,789
two people.

740
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,889
Yeni Cho.

741
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,990
Yeni Cho?

742
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,858
Yeni Cho did a little solo dance,

743
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,660
but it wasn't really attractive.

744
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,960
She didn't own the scene.

745
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,230
We look so bad on camera. That's our weakness.

746
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,098
I think I'll be the worst dancer.

747
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:50,169
I prepared myself for it.

748
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,269
(Sighing)

749
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,669
Buckey had a little bit lower energy.

750
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,709
Everybody had so much energy.

751
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,240
- It's hard to match that quality. - Right.

752
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:04,709
When you think about the ranking, it's okay to go with MANNEQUEEN.

753
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,078
Wolf'Lo is in first place.

754
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,419
MANNEQUEEN is in second.

755
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,549
I feel like I'm in bit of danger.

756
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,459
Since we have main dancers...

757
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,319
- They'll try to reduce our score. - That's right.

758
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,259
Main dancer, Rena of TSUBA KILL,

759
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,329
select the worst dancer of the rookie class.

760
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,099
This makes me so nervous.

761
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,299
This is driving me nuts.

762
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,639
- It won't be you. - I'm still nervous.

763
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,179
Since everyone worked together to create the performance,

764
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,439
it broke my heart...

765
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,409
to select the worst dancer.

766
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,449
But I've made my choice.

767
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,619
She keeps looking at me.

768
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,349
The person...

769
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,389
(Holding their hands tight)

770
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,690
I chose as the worst dancer...

771
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,059
(The rookies are nervous.)

772
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,030
(Who did Rena choose as the worst dancer in the rookie class?)

773
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:00,769
is Buckey of MANNEQUEEN.

774
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,869
Buckey of MANNEQUEEN.

775
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,610
(Tatter is shocked.)

776
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,349
This is so unexpected.

777
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,549
(I'm safe.)

778
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,719
(I'm safe also.)

779
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,619
I got goosebumps.

780
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,389
I can't look at Buckey. What should I do?

781
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,630
Buckey of MANNEQUEEN was chosen as the worst dancer.

782
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,929
Why do you think you were chosen as the worst dancer?

783
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,139
I'm not sure,

784
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,769
but when we were told we could change positions,

785
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,308
I made a suggestion to Rena.

786
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,780
Maybe she wasn't happy with it.

787
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,549
(Buckey and Rena disagreed during the position changes.)

788
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,919
(But whether you're okay with it or not, )

789
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,090
(I call the shots, right?)

790
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,389
I'm not sure.

791
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
(Feeling perplexed)

792
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,189
(MANNEQUEEN is powerful.)

793
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,190
(They are strong.)

794
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,760
(It will be a good idea to reduce their points.)

795
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,360
I'm ashamed to face my crew.

796
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,968
I feel so bad and like I'm not of any help.

797
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,799
I feel really bad.

798
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,698
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

799
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,069
- It's truly okay. - You did great.

800
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,138
We expected this.

801
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,638
We already thought...

802
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,339
TSUBA KILL would choose us as the worst dancer.

803
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,979
Rather than being surprised,

804
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,949
I thought, "Okay, bring it on."

805
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,249
The main dancer of the Sub-leader class...

806
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,519
was LaTrice of JAM REPUBLIC.

807
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,319
(Proud)

808
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,759
Sub-leader Mini!

809
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,189
I'm so nervous right now.

810
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,859
- It's okay. - It'll be okay.

811
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,098
I'm scared.

812
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,960
- I'm so nervous. - I'm not surprised.

813
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,669
LaTrice looks nervous.

814
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,829
LaTrice?

815
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,799
There was some trouble...

816
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,309
in our class.

817
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,968
There must have been tension in this class.

818
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,109
I'm scared.

819
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,439
The tension was so intense,

820
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,409
I almost got sick when I went home.

821
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,250
Let's get the first part.

822
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:56,989
(Their first practice session begins in silence.)

823
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,219
(She didn't translate the lyrics before creating the dance.)

824
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,760
(That made me think she didn't put in an effort.)

825
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,360
(Tension is in the air.)

826
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,828
(Glancing around)

827
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,669
It's my choreography and I made it,

828
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,070
so I want to show you my versatility.

829
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,769
- Open. - Open.

830
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:16,969
Here?

831
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,210
I lied.

832
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,879
In.

833
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,078
- In? - Okay.

834
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,139
In.

835
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,210
Sorry, it's open first.

836
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,280
Five, six, seven, eight.

837
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,820
Sorry.

838
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:30,920
Sorry.

839
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,658
One more time looking in.

840
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:34,959
- Okay. - Look in.

841
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
- In? - Yes.

842
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:36,988
Any questions?

843
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,928
Do we open our hands?

844
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:40,199
Anything for now.

845
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,299
(Bewildered)

846
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,469
Everybody, let's practice hands.

847
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,199
But I don't know if everybody will do it later.

848
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,539
What was that?

849
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,939
She was supposed to put it together before coming,

850
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,638
not do it on the spot.

851
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,509
Even if she were doing it impromptu, she needed to make fast decisions.

852
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,420
She doesn't have enough experience as a director.

853
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,590
What do I do after this?

854
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,190
I started doubting her more.

855
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,288
We did things you'd see at a dance academy,

856
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,788
like changing rows.

857
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,289
We practiced spreading out.

858
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,499
It was so boring.

859
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,269
It was a choreography for the dancers of a solo artist.

860
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,400
Does she want to dance alone?

861
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,610
She wasn't being considerate of all the dancers.

862
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,940
Yes, cool.

863
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,710
Yes, perfect. Cool.

864
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,780
(Did we hear wrong?)

865
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,780
We're finished with the tryout. Done.

866
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,380
What? This is it?

867
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,389
It's over? What did we do?

868
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,718
We had 1 move, just 1 formation.

869
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,328
Does part 2 only have 1 formation?

870
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:44,928
We will practice clean...

871
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,429
and use the camera tricks.

872
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,000
What is this?

873
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,070
Don't worry.

874
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,299
Does she mean we'll be doing everything else on stage?

875
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,538
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

876
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,669
Even if we shoot knowing every detail,

877
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,409
- Right. - there are delays.

878
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:00,609
No.

879
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,809
(There will be no problems.)

880
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,110
Just practice.

881
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:06,280
Just trust the choreography.

882
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,549
Focus only on the choreography.

883
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,590
- Okay. - Okay, got it.

884
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:12,559
(In the end, LaTrice gets up to leave.)

885
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,960
I swayed a little bit.

886
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,860
I want to give them what they want.

887
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,699
Can I ask for some dancers?

888
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,769
(The sub-leader class dancers show up at the studio.)

889
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,309
Hi.

890
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,908
Kirsten was with her.

891
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,980
What's this? Why is she here?

892
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,448
(LaTrice went to leader Kirsten after much contemplation.)

893
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:39,009
Are you okay? How much more do you have to choreograph?

894
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,479
The second half.

895
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,920
- So you need a formation. - Yes.

896
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,149
Even if they follow you...

897
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,288
Yes.

898
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,988
Even if you look at the camera,

899
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,229
you are making a full circle, and you go this way.

900
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,559
- Okay, I like that. - Right.

901
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,800
Kirsten came through and said,

902
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,359
"You can do it."

903
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,368
I want four for the flow part.

904
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:01,369
In the second part, it'll be a duo of Lusher and me.

905
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,710
(LaTrice practiced the duo separately with Lusher.)

906
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,738
She's here for moral support.

907
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,738
Kirsten opened the idea,

908
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,149
and I finished it.

909
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,909
Yes, that's so good.

910
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,920
Five, six, seven, eight.

911
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,119
Okay.

912
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:18,789
Was she our executive director?

913
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,018
(Sub-leaders' dance video shoot, a gas station, Hannam-dong)

914
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,230
Always remember you can change it.

915
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:29,629
She kept checking with Kirsten during the shoot.

916
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,929
Yes, I liked it. I think it's really nice.

917
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:33,869
You're good.

918
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,340
(What is she doing?)

919
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,969
Kirsten was doing everything.

920
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,709
I think the girls just need to make sure they stay in line.

921
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,710
Okay.

922
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:43,879
Can you tell the girls they need to stay in one line?

923
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
One line?

924
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:46,379
Kirsten, did you see that?

925
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,119
- Formations look nice and clean. - Yes.

926
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,718
I think you need to move faster.

927
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,750
Okay.

928
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:52,558
Kirsten seemed to give her the confidence.

929
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,489
She seemed to find satisfaction in Kirsten's approval.

930
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,029
I thought Kirsten was her mom.

931
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,689
As the main dancer,

932
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,500
I wasn't sure was a good director.

933
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,500
Remember your solo is the highlight.

934
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,440
The dance break is cool. I want to do it solo.

935
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,468
- You can. - You have full control.

936
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:11,239
Yes, then I don't have to worry about teaching them the dance break.

937
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,138
She said she'd do it solo.

938
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,610
I realized I wouldn't be seen in the video.

939
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,808
(The sub-leaders go to LaTrice.)

940
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,619
Our part is not enough.

941
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,449
There are 8 counts for 4 people,

942
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,189
and 4 counts for 3 people.

943
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,519
The rest is yours.

944
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,928
That meant my solo would be...

945
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:33,230
cut eight counts short.

946
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,928
(The others ask her to give up some of her solo part, )

947
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,299
(and she considers it.)

948
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,839
Our faces will barely show.

949
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,069
I understand.

950
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,769
Let me think.

951
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,440
(Remember your solo at the end is the highlight.)

952
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,179
What should we do?

953
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,808
(Will she divide the part or do it by herself?)

954
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,849
(What will LaTrice choose to do?)

955
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,718
We will now begin watching...

956
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,919
the sub-leaders' dance video.

957
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,989
Will I be in it?

958
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,549
I have to be in it.

959
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,119
- You'll be in it. - Please.

960
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:02,158
- I'm only going to watch Mini. - I'll only follow the pink hair.

961
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,590
I'm sure you'll stand out.

962
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:06,328
- I'm nervous. - Sayaka.

963
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:08,329
It's okay even if you're named the worst dancer.

964
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,868
Just watch and enjoy it.

965
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,699
- Okay. - Let's go.

966
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:29,550
(Nervous)

967
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,319
(Marvelling)

968
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,519
(All I see is Lusher.)

969
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,840
(Watching closely)

970
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,800
Nice. You're so pretty.

971
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:36,849
You're so good.

972
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,679
(Revealing the highlight, the dance break!)

973
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,059
(Awesome)

974
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,730
She did that in heels?

975
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,529
(Listen to "Click Like" on all streaming platforms.)

976
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,129
Lala, nice.

977
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,259
- Slay. - Slay.

978
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,529
- Awesome. That was so cool. - That was amazing, Sayaka.

979
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,899
That's a relief.

980
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,238
All I could see was you.

981
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,539
Really? I love it.

982
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,769
- I don't know what to say. - You did so well.

983
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,980
This is good.

984
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,079
It's so good.

985
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,138
(Smiling)

986
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,479
Everyone in this class is good.

987
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,579
I could see each member clearly.

988
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:15,348
Compared to how LaTrice ruined the dance,

989
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,749
it looked good on video.

990
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,819
It's annoying.

991
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,820
(Punching the cushion)

992
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,888
(During the judges' evaluation of the sub-leaders)

993
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:22,658
(They killed it!)

994
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:24,359
The last solo parts...

995
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,859
showed that it was competition time.

996
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,359
It wouldn't have been this nice if she did it by herself.

997
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,399
You're right.

998
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,698
It looks good because they all danced.

999
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,138
LaTrice should thank...

1000
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,610
the members for this.

1001
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,739
LaTrice, discuss with your crew...

1002
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,849
to choose the worst dancer.

1003
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,750
(I'm parched.)

1004
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,178
My goodness.

1005
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,788
What should my choice be based on?

1006
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,119
It can be behind the scenes.

1007
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:54,118
(The dancers are nervous as the worst dancer is being chosen.)

1008
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,718
Harimu surprisingly didn't stand out, right?

1009
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,889
Where was she?

1010
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:00,529
Harimu doesn't stand out when they dance in sync.

1011
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,759
She really stood out in "Street Dance Girls Fighter."

1012
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,029
She was very sexy.

1013
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,940
Could it because she's with older dancers?

1014
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,399
Did you honestly see me?

1015
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,468
You didn't, did you?

1016
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,908
I felt like I could do better in the performance,

1017
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:14,479
and I was so doubtful.

1018
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,110
I thought I could be chosen as the worst dancer.

1019
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:18,749
Who didn't stand out?

1020
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,049
I feel like that person didn't.

1021
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,050
(Who?)

1022
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:23,150
You're right.

1023
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,448
I just hope it isn't me.

1024
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,559
I don't think it will be.

1025
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:28,859
I love the choreography.

1026
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,590
It feels like Redlic's style.

1027
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,629
(Redlic helped create the flow part for 4 people.)

1028
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,029
- Yes. - Is this good?

1029
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,030
Cool.

1030
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:38,629
I choreographed the flow part with her,

1031
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,169
and I helped organize the dance.

1032
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,800
I honestly don't think she will choose me.

1033
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:44,969
I don't think I'll be the worst dancer.

1034
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,538
Main dancer, LaTrice,

1035
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:50,250
name the worst dancer of the sub-leader class.

1036
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,320
I'm so nervous.

1037
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:55,749
(Nervous)

1038
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,949
I don't think it'll be me.

1039
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,190
I did a good job.

1040
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,718
This is such a hard decision for me.

1041
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,158
(Who did LaTrice choose as the worst dancer?)

1042
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,199
Please.

1043
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,460
Please.

1044
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,529
I'm sorry. I choose...

1045
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,339
Redlic of MANNEQUEEN as the worst dancer.

1046
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,139
(Redlic of MANNEQUEEN is the worst dancer.)

1047
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:20,738
Redlic is the worst dancer.

1048
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:22,439
That's a relief.

1049
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,309
It's such a relief. She didn't pick me.

1050
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,609
MANNEQUEEN?

1051
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,749
(Unbelievable)

1052
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,780
What just happened?

1053
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:29,348
(The dancers stir at the shocking result.)

1054
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:32,089
My goodness.

1055
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,459
I got goosebumps.

1056
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,690
They must be so mad.

1057
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,360
Redlic must be really mad.

1058
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,288
She helped LaTrice a lot.

1059
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,459
- I see. - That's why.

1060
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,698
Redlic must think how LaTrice could dare choose her...

1061
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:43,900
after getting all the help.

1062
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,039
(Is this the center?)

1063
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,110
(Redlic organized the formation instead of LaTrice.)

1064
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,779
She was second-guessing you.

1065
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,679
I don't think you made it clear when you spoke about it.

1066
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:00,279
(No.)

1067
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,819
(This is right.)

1068
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,050
(The dance break part was supposed to be over there.)

1069
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:05,050
(Hang on. I forget. Wait.)

1070
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,360
(It's right.)

1071
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,059
I could just feel that she didn't fully trust me as a leader.

1072
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:14,929
I'm so scared.

1073
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,829
I feel...

1074
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:19,939
there was a little bit of energy between Redlic and me.

1075
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,340
Redlic didn't feel the smoothest to work with.

1076
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,039
That was harsh.

1077
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,280
She's very honest.

1078
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,049
I think she has her guard up against me.

1079
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,750
I wonder if she has a conscience.

1080
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,078
I wonder if she has a conscience.

1081
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,320
If she has a conscience?

1082
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,558
I'd be grateful if she could place a hand...

1083
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,089
on her heart and think about it.

1084
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,190
(I'd be grateful.)

1085
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:46,559
She's scary.

1086
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,260
That was brutal.

1087
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,129
She's smiling but not on the inside.

1088
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,368
(There is tension in the air due to an unexpected outcome.)

1089
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,098
Redlic of MANNEQUEEN caused a point deduction.

1090
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,868
- She didn't fulfill her role... - It's totally fine.

1091
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,678
- as a sub-leader. - It's okay.

1092
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,979
They gained 100 points, then lost it all.

1093
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,479
(MANNEQUEEN was chosen the worst in two classes.)

1094
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,019
- Yoonji is really upset. - She's mad.

1095
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,249
The members of our crew...

1096
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,948
are not the worst in dancing.

1097
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,159
They chose us because they have their guards up against us.

1098
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,559
(It is the day of the middle class' dance video shoot.)

1099
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,229
- My gosh. - This is amazing.

1100
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,230
Awesome.

1101
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,539
- Unbelievable. - The scale is mind-blowing.

1102
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,039
I can't believe this is real and filmable.

1103
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:33,638
I think our class will be the best...

1104
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,940
in this mission.

1105
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,480
Our song is the most powerful,

1106
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:38,110
and I think our video will look good.

1107
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,150
Audrey.

1108
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,618
There you go.

1109
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,649
(First practice after selecting the main dancer)

1110
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,920
(Can you do something like this?)

1111
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,518
(She does it immediately.)

1112
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,589
I like it.

1113
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,788
(Audrey is in the center of the dance formation.)

1114
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,159
That's so nice.

1115
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,259
I really appreciated...

1116
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,829
that Waackxxxy and Yoonji gave me the center position.

1117
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,699
Audrey's moves are insane.

1118
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,340
(They monitor it right away.)

1119
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,078
Yumeri used to be here,

1120
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,710
but it changed to Yoonji.

1121
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:15,079
I was in the center at first.

1122
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,549
(Yumeri was the center of a different choreography as well.)

1123
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,419
However, my position changed...

1124
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,820
for some reason the next day.

1125
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,530
I can barely be seen.

1126
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,900
I thought they were trying to hide Momo and me from the camera.

1127
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:31,129
Interesting. They have their guard up.

1128
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,769
We're their targets.

1129
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,099
I'm going to start getting meaner.

1130
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:37,839
I wouldn't have changed spots...

1131
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,610
if Yumeri did a good job during practice.

1132
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,538
We'd already given the other parts...

1133
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,279
to other people, then looked at the whole picture.

1134
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,980
I changed it because of the quality.

1135
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:50,948
They're so good.

1136
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,789
It's much better with you, Yoonji.

1137
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,659
Did you see that? The camera didn't show me.

1138
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,829
Let's try lining up.

1139
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,000
I think we can stand like this for now.

1140
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,428
We'll be showing the least on video if it's like this.

1141
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,368
We're in the same line as you guys.

1142
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:07,799
You don't want us to be seen.

1143
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,299
We're way in the back.

1144
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,538
No, you're not that far back.

1145
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,538
- You can be in the middle. - Okay.

1146
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:14,779
- Yes. - Here?

1147
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,809
Yes.

1148
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,610
(We won't be on camera.)

1149
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,750
Hi, it's Kang Daniel.

1150
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,589
You can now change positions...

1151
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,549
from your current ones in the completed performance.

1152
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,559
What?

1153
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,689
(This is their last chance to change positions.)

1154
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,719
Then it'll be better to speak up.

1155
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:31,928
If you ask to change positions,

1156
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:33,529
you might end up being chosen as the worst dancer.

1157
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,359
If I push too hard to switch positions,

1158
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,268
but make a mistake, it'll harm everyone.

1159
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:38,900
Does anyone want to change spots?

1160
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,400
I wonder what everyone will do.

1161
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:45,738
We used to stand on the inside.

1162
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:47,609
- I prefer it here. - Me too.

1163
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,678
Of course.

1164
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,750
You can't see me at all because of the lights.

1165
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,948
As you all know,

1166
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:55,518
you can't all be seen well because of the venue.

1167
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,518
I tried to accept the ideas...

1168
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,719
as long as it didn't break the balance.

1169
00:51:58,889 --> 00:51:59,920
Let's have...

1170
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,829
Deep N Dap, switch with JAM REPUBLIC.

1171
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,459
Deep N Dap doesn't have much time dancing in the center.

1172
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,328
JAM REPUBLIC...

1173
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,269
has a part where they dance in the center for a long time.

1174
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,138
When we watch it on video,

1175
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,639
- the formation looked good. - Okay.

1176
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,439
Let's keep the others as it is.

1177
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,539
- Okay. - Okay.

1178
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,309
Do you even need us?

1179
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:27,279
(Do you even need us?)

1180
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,549
(Everyone freezes at Momo's unexpected comment.)

1181
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,948
"You can't see us."

1182
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,589
"We're way in the back. We're hidden."

1183
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,689
I understand comments like that.

1184
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,488
But the first thing she said was,

1185
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:37,589
"Then what do you need us for?"

1186
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,859
She started with an offensive comment.

1187
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,130
There was tension in the air.

1188
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,899
There is nothing we can do because of the space.

1189
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,968
However...

1190
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,638
(Yoonji tries to explain her reasons to TSUBA KILL.)

1191
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,308
You can go right or left, so you're in the middle.

1192
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:55,308
Then you will be shown.

1193
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:58,308
If you don't want us to be seen,

1194
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,449
we can disappear.

1195
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,980
No, it's not that.

1196
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,988
We just want to make it wider...

1197
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:06,288
- because of the walls. - Okay.

1198
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:07,320
I see.

1199
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:08,860
Although I don't get it.

1200
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,259
TSUBA KILL saw the monitor and realized they weren't on camera.

1201
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,000
I looked and couldn't see them at all either.

1202
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:19,698
They were hidden.

1203
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,439
They looked worse than a shadow.

1204
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,969
They were literally backup dancers.

1205
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,738
The middle class is a large group with 16 members...

1206
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,439
that put together a performance together.

1207
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,449
I believe it must've been even more competitive.

1208
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,279
I look forward to the middle class video the most.

1209
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,919
- They have many members. - Yes, they do.

1210
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,619
They also filmed it in a cave.

1211
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:39,419
We're finally watching it.

1212
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,459
It was a battle between the two crews.

1213
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,788
We will now watch the dance video of the middle class.

1214
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:45,888
This is insane.

1215
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,029
(The main dancers are nervous.)

1216
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,999
- I wonder how much we'll show. - We won't.

1217
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,400
I bet we won't be shown at all.

1218
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,199
I hope it turned out well.

1219
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,599
(Nervous Ling)

1220
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:56,969
Swipe.

1221
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,249
(Cheering loudly)

1222
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,719
That's insane!

1223
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,820
The intro is so captivating.

1224
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,908
(Audrey slays.)

1225
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,650
- Who's at the center? - Audrey.

1226
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,058
(The amazing waacking sisters)

1227
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,360
Awesome.

1228
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:51,889
(This is a large-scale video.)

1229
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,919
It looks so good.

1230
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,729
When else will we ever film such a high-quality video?

1231
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,130
It was such a good experience.

1232
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,510
(Listen to "Swipe" on all streaming platforms.)

1233
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,879
That was fabulous.

1234
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,139
(Fabulous)

1235
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,479
You guys killed it.

1236
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,909
That was sick.

1237
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:19,010
- I like the quality. - Yes.

1238
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,820
They put a lot of work into it.

1239
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:23,249
It's a great video,

1240
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,949
but Yoonji and Waackxxxy are certainly memorable.

1241
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,819
But all I see are Yoonji and Waackxxxy.

1242
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,960
And Audrey was memorable once.

1243
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,730
You can't tell, right? It's like, "Are we even in it?"

1244
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,960
Even I can't find myself in the video.

1245
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,558
It'll be difficult for the judges to evaluate it.

1246
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,730
They won't be able to tell them apart.

1247
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,339
(When the fight judges graded the dance video)

1248
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,539
I love this part.

1249
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,269
It's like "The Lord of the Rings."

1250
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,078
This part is fantastic.

1251
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,779
This part too. Not all 16 of them are here,

1252
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,880
- Right. - so they're all different.

1253
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,550
This is a personal opinion.

1254
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,279
When Yoonji and Waackxxxy performed a duet,

1255
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,019
I wouldn't add another duet.

1256
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,250
That was...

1257
00:56:58,349 --> 00:56:59,550
a bit disappointing.

1258
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,259
There are no ups and downs.

1259
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,859
They could have utilized other dancers more.

1260
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,389
- Exactly. - Do you know what I'm saying?

1261
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,029
The main dancers of the middle class,

1262
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,129
Waackxxxy and Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN,

1263
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,070
please discuss with the crew members to pick the worst dancers.

1264
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,499
I love you.

1265
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,869
I love you dearly.

1266
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,139
(Do you feel my affection, Yoonji and Waackxxxy?)

1267
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,309
Don't.

1268
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,139
Don't do anything right now.

1269
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,239
Who do you think will be the worst dancer from the video?

1270
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,780
I couldn't see any of them.

1271
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,709
Right. So I don't think the video will determine it.

1272
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,218
- It'll be how they did on set. - Indeed.

1273
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,320
MANNEQUEEN might pick TSUBA KILL.

1274
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:32,519
To get back at them?

1275
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,689
(Rena of TSUBA KILL picked MANNEQUEEN's Buckey...)

1276
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,360
(as the worst dancer in the rookie class.)

1277
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,960
I think those two crews will keep fighting.

1278
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,230
- Against TSUBA KILL? - So do I.

1279
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,400
It'll be an exchange.

1280
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:43,769
- They're clearly going to pick us. - Right.

1281
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,500
I noticed that Yoonji hated me during the shoot.

1282
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,038
I'm sure that she doesn't hate you.

1283
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:52,610
Maybe she's self-conscious around you guys.

1284
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,679
On the day of the shoot, TSUBA KILL was certainly stubborn.

1285
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,449
So, that might be a good reason for us to choose TSUBA KILL.

1286
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,118
The main dancers of MANNEQUEEN, Waackxxxy and Yoonji,

1287
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,389
please pick the worst dancers.

1288
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:11,659
The worst dancers of the middle class are...

1289
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:14,399
(Please spare us.)

1290
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,098
(Audrey and Ling are nervous.)

1291
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:17,099
Thank you.

1292
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,169
This is driving me crazy.

1293
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,269
(Tense)

1294
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,239
My heart is racing.

1295
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,070
My babies.

1296
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,710
It can't be us.

1297
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,309
It was cute.

1298
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:27,940
The video turned out well.

1299
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:31,449
(Who will Waackxxxy and Yoonji pick as the worst dancer?)

1300
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:34,049
Cheche and Kyma of BEBE.

1301
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,379
(The worst dancers of the middle class)

1302
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,718
(BEBE's Cheche and Kyma)

1303
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:38,989
(An unexpected choice)

1304
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,860
That was surprising.

1305
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,058
Cheche and Kyma of BEBE.

1306
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:44,229
(Startled)

1307
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,960
Them? Why?

1308
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,129
- I did not see that coming. - Me neither.

1309
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,530
Maybe they were afraid of Yumeri.

1310
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:52,928
They didn't pick TSUBA KILL.

1311
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,070
(They picked Cheche and Kyma, unlike everyone's prediction.)

1312
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:55,768
They're keeping BEBE in check.

1313
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:57,469
- To hold them in check. - Indeed.

1314
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:00,509
It's not that we think that they're actually the worst.

1315
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,479
We got the feeling that other dancers...

1316
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,609
were energetic during the shoot.

1317
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,348
But they seemed a bit...

1318
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:09,549
too normal to us.

1319
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,389
So, we picked them after a long deliberation.

1320
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,719
They did look like little babies.

1321
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,019
They weren't bad, though.

1322
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,590
They did work hard.

1323
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,860
But they weren't good enough as they were too young.

1324
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,328
BEBE's Cheche and Kyma,

1325
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,800
please say a few words for the crew members.

1326
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:28,400
Do you have anything to say?

1327
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,538
(They can't seem to speak as it's too unexpected.)

1328
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:35,280
(It's all right.)

1329
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,780
Are they going to cry?

1330
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:38,449
Please don't cry, babies.

1331
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,119
Cheche.

1332
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,988
First, I want to apologize...

1333
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:50,389
for bringing minus points to the team.

1334
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:53,860
We'll prove to you that we're not the worst dancers.

1335
00:59:58,369 --> 00:59:59,968
The leader of BEBE, Bada.

1336
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,440
How do you feel right now?

1337
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,468
Well,

1338
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:07,578
if there must be negative points,

1339
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:10,448
you should know that I have the power...

1340
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:12,409
as the main dancer.

1341
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,750
(No way.)

1342
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,420
She announced to get her revenge.

1343
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:22,488
I think I can solve it by using strategies.

1344
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,360
So, that's how it'll go from then.

1345
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,829
That was awesome.

1346
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,099
How is she so cool in everything she does?

1347
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:31,769
That's cold.

1348
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,069
Bada is so upset.

1349
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,239
They should have picked TSUBA KILL.

1350
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,009
(What is the future of these crews?)

1351
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,539
How do you think they made it?

1352
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,610
The leader battle.

1353
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:41,809
I can't wait to find out.

1354
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,440
(The worst dancer, leader class)

1355
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,480
I want to know!

1356
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,119
Our leader!

1357
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,949
Funky Y, I love you.

1358
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,448
I'm so excited about the leader class.

1359
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:53,449
This ought to be cool.

1360
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,559
The main dancer of the leader class is...

1361
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,190
BEBE's Bada.

1362
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:05,500
(Bada became the main dancer after a close match with Kirsten.)

1363
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,900
First of all...

1364
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,268
I'll keep describing them. I have all the themes.

1365
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:10,809
- So... - Goodness.

1366
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:16,440
I began as soon as I heard the song.

1367
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:18,178
I didn't want the other leaders to find fault with me.

1368
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,750
So I tried to perfect it.

1369
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,679
And I wanted to increase the performance video's quality.

1370
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,820
Can we start the second part?

1371
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
- Yes. - Okay.

1372
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:27,289
Are you all right with it?

1373
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,089
- Totally. - Absolutely.

1374
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,989
- It's great. - Yes.

1375
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:33,960
The leaders are so amicable.

1376
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,230
I thought, "Please don't pick me as the worst dancer."

1377
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,429
It's a cool set.

1378
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,569
(The leaders start filming in earnest.)

1379
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,339
(The shoot goes smoothly.)

1380
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,210
Everyone followed my lead, so it was nice.

1381
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:50,610
None of them was the worst dancer during the shoot.

1382
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,320
I'll have to be strategic while taking the score into account.

1383
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:56,279
From now on,

1384
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,689
we will watch the dance video of the leaders.

1385
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,118
Let's go!

1386
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:01,219
All right.

1387
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,389
I can't wait to watch it.

1388
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,090
(Nervous and excited)

1389
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:10,699
("Smoke" by Dynamic Duo and Lee Young Ji)

1390
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,509
(The crowd goes crazy from the beginning.)

1391
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,679
It's already cool.

1392
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:53,238
So pretty!

1393
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,539
This is insane.

1394
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:48,630
That's super cool.

1395
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:12,750
So cool.

1396
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:39,250
(Listen to "Smoke" on all streaming platforms.)

1397
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,848
(Cheering)

1398
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:46,388
(They all fell in love with the leaders.)

1399
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:48,118
That was amazing!

1400
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,320
That's our leader.

1401
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,158
(My leader, Bada, is the best.)

1402
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,429
That was fantastic.

1403
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,429
- I want Bada to hug me just once. - Come on.

1404
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,868
(When the fight judges graded the dance video)

1405
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:01,000
(No words needed)

1406
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,869
This is certainly the leaders' video.

1407
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,440
It's so obvious.

1408
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,010
This scene is my favourite.

1409
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:08,409
It's so neat.

1410
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,609
This part went to the perfect dancer.

1411
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,678
Yes.

1412
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,309
They all look good.

1413
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:17,349
This part was great too.

1414
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:20,019
"See-saw." Did you see that?

1415
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:21,719
It was well-choreographed.

1416
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,319
It's so smart.

1417
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,788
- So many smart choices. - Right.

1418
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,859
- I loved watching this team. - Yes.

1419
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,500
- Masterpiece. - Yes.

1420
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,029
We will give you one minute.

1421
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,968
Bada, please discuss your teammates...

1422
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:36,269
and pick the worst dancer of your class.

1423
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,610
If we're going to pick a crew that's never been picked before,

1424
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,609
it should be JAM REPUBLIC.

1425
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,709
They're going to pick JAM REPUBLIC.

1426
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,279
Yes, I agree.

1427
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,079
JAM REPUBLIC has a main dancer.

1428
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:50,820
I just have a feeling that Bada is going to pick me.

1429
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:52,889
I can feel it.

1430
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:54,889
Or Deep N Dap?

1431
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,819
- I didn't see Mina in the video. - Me neither.

1432
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,158
I didn't even know she was in it.

1433
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,988
None of our crew members was chosen as the worst dancer,

1434
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,429
so she might pick us.

1435
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,429
(Tense)

1436
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,670
Wolf'Lo is never picked.

1437
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,598
They might pick Wolf'Lo.

1438
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,170
But Halo was so cool in the video.

1439
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,268
I'm certain that they won't choose our crew.

1440
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:13,039
Try and pick us. I won't let it slide.

1441
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:15,110
How about LADYBOUNCE?

1442
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,638
What's the point of holding us in check?

1443
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,649
I know, right?

1444
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,308
Just leave us alone.

1445
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,649
They've been leaving us alone.

1446
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:21,819
- Just leave us be. - Right.

1447
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,820
I have a feeling that they'll choose MANNEQUEEN.

1448
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,348
She said that she'd take the strategic approach.

1449
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,359
Exactly.

1450
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,189
(MANNEQUEEN chose BEBE's Cheche and Kyma...)

1451
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,988
(as the worst dancers of the middle class.)

1452
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,328
(You should know that I have the power...)

1453
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,799
(as the main dancer.)

1454
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,669
(I think I can solve it by using strategies.)

1455
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,139
(So, that's how it'll go from then.)

1456
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:43,939
I think she'll pick us.

1457
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,069
She's got the perfect reason to pick us.

1458
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,239
I wonder who they'll choose.

1459
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,279
The worst dancer of the leader class...

1460
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,380
that I think is unqualified is...

1461
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:56,179
Then it can't be me. I'm qualified.

1462
01:06:57,449 --> 01:06:58,948
Please don't look at us.

1463
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:01,860
(Who will Bada choose as the main dancer?)

1464
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,059
It's going to be us.

1465
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,530
It's Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung.

1466
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:10,359
(The worst dancer of the leader's class, Mina Myoung)

1467
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,030
I knew it.

1468
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,039
(That's a relief.)

1469
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,070
They didn't pick MANNEQUEEN.

1470
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,010
What?

1471
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:23,210
That's unexpected.

1472
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:25,980
- It's all right, Mina. - It's fine.

1473
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:29,118
Mina Myoung of Deep N Dap, you've been chosen as the worst dancer.

1474
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,019
Why do you think you were picked?

1475
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:36,460
I did my best in the position that I was given...

1476
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:40,559
So I'm not sure why.

1477
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,899
As you all know, none of the leaders...

1478
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,099
deserve to be the worst dancer.

1479
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,299
Please keep in mind that we only chose you...

1480
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,739
for strategic reasons.

1481
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,038
Mina of Deep N Dap.

1482
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,808
Can you say a few words to your crew mates...

1483
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,679
who trusted and rooted for you?

1484
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,920
Sure. At least, none of my members became the worst dancer,

1485
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:04,389
so I'm glad.

1486
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:08,860
(Mina ends up shedding tears as she feels sorry.)

1487
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,689
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

1488
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,130
Come on, Mina.

1489
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,760
Come on.

1490
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:18,369
It'll be a bigger blow when your leader gets it.

1491
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,069
Right. The leader has responsibilities.

1492
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,869
I'm not crying because I'm upset.

1493
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,710
Our crew has been perceived as the weaker team...

1494
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,279
because of me,

1495
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:34,350
and it was pretty upsetting.

1496
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,689
But I'm glad that none of my members was picked as the worst dancer.

1497
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,659
I'm so proud of them.

1498
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:44,359
I'll keep doing my best...

1499
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,430
to be...

1500
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,869
the best leader for them.

1501
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,409
You're already the best leader.

1502
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,539
- You're the best, Mina. - We love you.

1503
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,710
It's so sad because I know what that feels like.

1504
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:09,750
It's okay. It's not over yet.

1505
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,890
(K-pop Death match Mission to determine the crew's survival)

1506
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:15,618
(One crew will be eliminated.)

1507
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:16,919
I had never thought of it.

1508
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,989
(Are you kidding me?)

1509
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,329
(A fierce battle for the song)

1510
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:21,629
(This has to be ours.)

1511
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,858
(It was extremely boring.)

1512
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:26,369
(Who will end up winning the song?)

1513
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,170
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

1514
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:30,198
You have been competing without a break...

1515
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,709
during the Class Mission.

1516
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:35,109
I will announce the final results of all eight crews.

1517
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,809
It's the moment of truth.

1518
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,108
Will it be a ranking?

1519
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:39,608
Wolf'Lo could be lower than we thought.

1520
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:40,809
They must be.

1521
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,579
The whole list will change today.

1522
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:44,219
(Nervous)

1523
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,049
Here's how the Class Mission...

1524
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,659
will be graded.

1525
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:49,488
A hundred extra points for the main dancer.

1526
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:50,988
The worst dancer,

1527
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:53,488
picked by the main dancer, will lose 50 points.

1528
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,629
The individual scores given separately...

1529
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,568
based on the fight judges' evaluation.

1530
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,000
The sum of all these points will determine the ranking.

1531
01:10:01,369 --> 01:10:04,309
The first crew to be revealed is...

1532
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,339
the fifth-place crew.

1533
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,909
- Fifth? - Fifth?

1534
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:09,879
Please let it be our crew.

1535
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,880
Let's keep our place.

1536
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:13,709
If we place fifth, that'd be two steps higher.

1537
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,749
Fifth place is...

1538
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,050
(The 5th-place crew of the Class Mission is...)

1539
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,618
MANNEQUEEN.

1540
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:19,519
(Class Mission, 5th place, MANNEQUEEN)

1541
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,550
What?

1542
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,220
How did we get so low?

1543
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:24,359
We went from 2nd place to 5th place?

1544
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:26,460
Our tactic worked.

1545
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,728
(MANNEQUEEN's final score)

1546
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:30,059
MANNEQUEEN's Waackxxxy and Yoonji were chosen...

1547
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,568
as the main dancers of the middle class,

1548
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:33,068
hence getting an extra 100 points.

1549
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:35,568
But Redlic of the sub-leader class and Buckey of the rookie class...

1550
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:36,898
were chosen as the worst dancers,

1551
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,539
and they lost a total of 100 points.

1552
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,908
So, that's zero points.

1553
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,380
Is it because of the individual score?

1554
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,510
I will announce the individual scores.

1555
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,108
Why am I so nervous?

1556
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,350
It's so tense.

1557
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:49,879
(Funky Y: 100, Redlic: 250)

1558
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,019
(Waackxxxy and Yoonji: 280, and Buckey: 140)

1559
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,919
(MANNEQUEEN's final score, 780)

1560
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,288
They got 280 points. That's huge.

1561
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:56,459
Waackxxxy and Yoonji got 280 points from the middle class?

1562
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,759
Waackxxxy and Yoonji alone...

1563
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,858
- earned a total of 380 points. - I know.

1564
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:03,858
Funky Y has a low score. It's 110.

1565
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,470
(Leader, Funky Y, 110 points)

1566
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,099
Eighth place is Funky Y.

1567
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,439
Seventh place is MANNEQUEEN's Funky Y.

1568
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,169
Bada stood out too much.

1569
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:14,209
It would have been better with stronger gestures.

1570
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:16,479
She wasn't that memorable.

1571
01:11:16,979 --> 01:11:19,209
I brought too few points for a leader.

1572
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,578
I was sorry...

1573
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:23,079
that my crew's total will be lower because of me.

1574
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:25,550
From 2nd to 5th place. That's a huge drop.

1575
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:27,759
Do you see how badly we need that timeout?

1576
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,889
Especially the tactic.

1577
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,959
But MANNEQUEEN?

1578
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,289
We can't guess anything.

1579
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,858
The next crew is...

1580
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:36,600
the fourth-place crew.

1581
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:37,969
Fourth place?

1582
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,329
- Fourth place. - Fourth place.

1583
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:42,739
I predict that we'll go up to fourth place.

1584
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,709
Overall, we stood out.

1585
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,608
I believe that we've done such a good job,

1586
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:48,340
so we might climb up the ladder.

1587
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:49,739
Fourth place goes to...

1588
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,250
(Anxious)

1589
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:53,108
LADYBOUNCE.

1590
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:56,549
(Class Mission, 4th place, LADYBOUNCE)

1591
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:57,850
LADYBOUNCE.

1592
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:00,889
They went from 8th place to 4th place?

1593
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,359
How did that happen?

1594
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:05,259
LADYBOUNCE has neither a main dancer...

1595
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,688
nor the worst dancer,

1596
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,198
so it starts from zero.

1597
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,799
The individual scores must have been pretty high.

1598
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,599
I bet Capri took all the points.

1599
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,170
Here are the individual scores of LADYBOUNCE.

1600
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,599
(NOB: 190, Biggy: 180)

1601
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,799
(Vessi and Naro: 140 points, and Capri: 280 points)

1602
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,670
(LADYBOUNCE's final score, 790)

1603
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:20,109
Capri is amazing.

1604
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,509
Capri was certainly good.

1605
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,210
I feel like crying.

1606
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:26,879
Rena of TSUBA KILL has done a wonderful job,

1607
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,919
but Capri was as good as her.

1608
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,679
She was on the right,

1609
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,249
and she was so good that I could feel it.

1610
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,089
She finds the right moments well.

1611
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,788
She tried to stand out by using her energy,

1612
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:39,159
so I gave her some points for that.

1613
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,228
- Great job. - You saved our lives.

1614
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:43,728
As the youngest one...

1615
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:47,028
and as a friend whom everyone relies on,

1616
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,640
I was proud of finally playing a part.

1617
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,409
- The rankings change in a flash. - Totally.

1618
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:54,739
That's why individual scores are important.

1619
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,279
The next crew placed third.

1620
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:00,579
- Please. - Please.

1621
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:02,119
Maybe?

1622
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,380
- Right. - Maybe.

1623
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:06,149
It's probably one of the crews with extra points.

1624
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:08,719
TSUBA KILL, JAM REPUBLIC, and BEBE.

1625
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,089
It has to be one of the three.

1626
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,828
I think BEBE will secure its ranking.

1627
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:14,658
It has to be either 3rd place or 6th place.

1628
01:13:14,659 --> 01:13:16,130
I wanted to keep our ranking.

1629
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,929
- My heart. - Previously, we were fourth.

1630
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,339
We were happy with at least third place.

1631
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,970
I was getting really nervous.

1632
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,970
(Restless)

1633
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,670
The third-place crew is...

1634
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:29,709
BEBE.

1635
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,550
(Relieved)

1636
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:33,649
- We saved it. - Nice save.

1637
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,618
Bada was chosen as the main dancer in the leader class...

1638
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:38,389
and earned 100 extra points.

1639
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:42,159
But Kyma and Cheche of the middle class lost 50 points.

1640
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,359
Here are the individual scores.

1641
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,260
Bada must have a high score.

1642
01:13:46,829 --> 01:13:48,059
(Bada: 300, Lusher: 220)

1643
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,559
(Kyma and Cheche: 90, and Tatter: 230)

1644
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,629
She earned 300 points?

1645
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,600
That's the perfect score. The perfect score is 300 points.

1646
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:55,470
That's incredible.

1647
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:57,099
You got the perfect score.

1648
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,139
(Bada gets the perfect score.)

1649
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,339
Bada is impressive.

1650
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,970
- She brought in 400 points alone. - Yes.

1651
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,039
- She's carrying her team. - Yes, she's pulling all the weight.

1652
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,049
I put down Bada in first place.

1653
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:06,578
Of course, Bada gets first place.

1654
01:14:06,579 --> 01:14:08,618
Bada.

1655
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:09,919
The formation was neat.

1656
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,188
Everybody looked strong.

1657
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:14,118
She figured out their talents and used them well.

1658
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,959
Her concept was memorable too. She used the lighter.

1659
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,630
Bada made such an iconic performance.

1660
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,999
We've been showing the results people are surprised by.

1661
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,399
I want to prove to people a bit more that we're amazing dancers.

1662
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:28,699
As for the ranking of the next crew I will announce,

1663
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:32,170
it's the lowest ranking. It's the crew that came in last.

1664
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,669
- Which crew? Deep N Dap? - Which crew?

1665
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,239
I think it might be Wolf'Lo or Deep N Dap.

1666
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:37,078
- Gosh, I'm nervous. - It can't be us.

1667
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:39,608
- I hope we come in sixth place. - Please.

1668
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,978
I think it might be us.

1669
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:43,349
Our team lost 50 points because of me.

1670
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:45,089
So I was a bit nervous.

1671
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,419
The crew that came in eighth place...

1672
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,420
(Which crew came in 8th for the Class Mission?)

1673
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:49,419
is Wolf'Lo.

1674
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,688
(Wolf'Lo gets ranked 8th in the Class Mission.)

1675
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:53,959
- Okay. - Oh, my gosh.

1676
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,460
I had a feeling it would be us.

1677
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,868
They went from 1st place to 8th place?

1678
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,199
- Gosh. - From 1st place to 8th place?

1679
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:01,839
(Everyone is shocked.)

1680
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,238
It just took a dramatic turn.

1681
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:04,738
You never know what could happen here.

1682
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:09,038
No one in Wolf'Lo was chosen as the main or worst dancers.

1683
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,479
So they started at zero points.

1684
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,578
I guess their individual scores were all low.

1685
01:15:12,579 --> 01:15:14,550
I will now reveal the individual scores.

1686
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:16,219
(Halo: 140, Mini: 90)

1687
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,889
(Chocol and Haechi Wang: 90, and Yeni Cho: 90)

1688
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,688
(Wolf'Lo's final score, 410)

1689
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:22,059
- That's way too low. - Right.

1690
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,358
- We didn't get a lot of points. - That's way too low.

1691
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,229
- Ninety was the lowest score. - That's way too low.

1692
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:27,929
- Really? - Gosh.

1693
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:30,698
- Oh, no. - I think everyone came in last.

1694
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:32,398
But they were really strong when it came to battling.

1695
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,099
- But their choreography is weak. - Right.

1696
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,799
- I placed Mini in eighth place. - Same here.

1697
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,469
I placed her in eighth place.

1698
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,839
She had to be in love when she did this choreography.

1699
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,478
It's not just about skills.

1700
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:44,538
She did stand out in the video, but I still wanted more.

1701
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:46,648
- I placed Yeni in eighth place. - Yeni Cho.

1702
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:49,618
I don't think the choreography suited Yeni Cho's style.

1703
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:51,389
She wasn't aware of her presence in the video.

1704
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:53,519
She didn't seem to have a good understanding of it,

1705
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,590
so I placed her in eighth place.

1706
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,819
(They got the lowest score in the 3 classes.)

1707
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,959
I had a feeling that I would be ranked last.

1708
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,699
This is like getting a report card.

1709
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:05,630
The numbers don't change. So I need to accept that.

1710
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,039
- You did great. - Yes.

1711
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,799
- It's because she worked hard. - Right.

1712
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
We're good at dance battles.

1713
01:16:10,801 --> 01:16:13,038
I admit that we're not good at executing choreographies. Yes.

1714
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,209
- Of course. - I admit that.

1715
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,438
It's something we haven't done before.

1716
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:16,509
We can show them...

1717
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,278
- what we can do next. - We can do it.

1718
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:21,078
Everyone did their best with this mission.

1719
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:24,789
It was unfortunate. But we realized we had to be clearly better to win.

1720
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,350
We must accept the result and prepare for the next mission.

1721
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,159
I will now announce the crew in seventh place.

1722
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,130
Which crews still remain? Us and...

1723
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,028
(Now, 4 crews remain.)

1724
01:16:37,029 --> 01:16:39,800
Come on. 1MILLION and our crew are the only Korean crews left again.

1725
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,898
I think 1MILLION will come in 7th place.

1726
01:16:41,899 --> 01:16:44,369
It's Deep N Dap. I think we came in sixth place.

1727
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:46,210
The crew in seventh place is...

1728
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:48,438
Please.

1729
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:49,840
Don't look at us.

1730
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,249
Deep N Dap.

1731
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:58,849
(Deep N Dap gets ranked 7th in the Class Mission.)

1732
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,749
Mina Myoung, the leader of Deep N Dap,

1733
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,059
was chosen as the worst dancer.

1734
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,459
Her crew lost 50 points because of that.

1735
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,529
It's okay.

1736
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:07,858
It's okay.

1737
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:10,100
I will now reveal the individual scores.

1738
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,328
(Mina Myoung: 110, Downy, 200)

1739
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,198
(Minny Park and JJ: 90, and Gooseul: 190)

1740
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:15,238
(Deep N Dap's final score, 540)

1741
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:16,800
- Their individual scores were low. - Yes.

1742
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,608
I wanted to do well as their leader and show them...

1743
01:17:19,609 --> 01:17:21,340
I was capable, but I couldn't do it.

1744
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,738
So I feel bad for my crew members.

1745
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:24,750
I felt really bad.

1746
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:28,219
The crew in 6th place is 1MILLION.

1747
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,219
(1MILLION gets ranked 6th in the Class Mission.)

1748
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,688
(Lia Kim: 210, Harimu: 180, Amy and Debby: 140, and Redy: 190)

1749
01:17:33,689 --> 01:17:36,460
(1MILLION's final score, 720)

1750
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:39,658
It's great that our ranking went up by one.

1751
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:42,059
- It didn't go down, at least. - Yes.

1752
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,260
- Our ranking keeps going up. - Yes.

1753
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,568
It was sad that none of us was chosen as the main dancer.

1754
01:17:47,569 --> 01:17:50,199
But I said, "Let's go up one at a time."

1755
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:54,209
We want to deem ourselves with the next mission.

1756
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:58,349
I have only 1st and 2nd places to announce now.

1757
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,078
JAM REPUBLIC and TSUBA KILL are the only crews...

1758
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:01,779
that haven't been announced yet.

1759
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:04,618
(These 2 crews have additional 100 points.)

1760
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:06,089
(Utterly nervous)

1761
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:08,959
One hundred percent. We aim for first.

1762
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,919
Which place do you think they will announce first?

1763
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,929
I think they'll announce...

1764
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:12,930
- first place first. - Is that so?

1765
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,189
The crew in first place is...

1766
01:18:14,729 --> 01:18:15,828
TSUBA KILL.

1767
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:16,930
I bet it's JAM REPUBLIC.

1768
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:19,169
(Which crew won 1st place of the Class Mission?)

1769
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,528
It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1770
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,739
(JAM REPUBLIC gets ranked 1st in the Class Mission.)

1771
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:23,970
Oh, my gosh.

1772
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:25,840
It's JAM REPUBLIC.

1773
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,238
(Sighing)

1774
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,010
I will now reveal the individual scores.

1775
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:33,578
(Kirsten: 270, LaTrice: 300, Ling and Audrey: 290, and Emma: 150)

1776
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:34,709
(JAM REPUBLIC's final score, 1,110)

1777
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,278
- LaTrice got 300 points? - She got 300?

1778
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,250
- She got a perfect score too. - Yes.

1779
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,249
(All the fight judges chose her as 1st place.)

1780
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,289
They got 290 points?

1781
01:18:42,859 --> 01:18:45,259
- Really? What? - Yes!

1782
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,930
- Yes. - Didn't they beat the main dancers?

1783
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,028
- What did you guys get? - We got 280 points.

1784
01:18:52,029 --> 01:18:53,899
How did they get more points than Waackxxxy and Yoonji?

1785
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:57,038
They kept putting Audrey in the center.

1786
01:18:57,039 --> 01:18:58,569
Of course, they were going to stand out.

1787
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:01,938
I put down JAM REPUBLIC as first place.

1788
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:03,879
I did the same. I gave them first place.

1789
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,849
I gave MANNEQUEEN second place.

1790
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:08,520
But Audrey was the one who gave me the most memorable scene.

1791
01:19:08,649 --> 01:19:10,818
They were in the center 80 percent of the performance.

1792
01:19:10,819 --> 01:19:12,749
But if I were to remember this video for one scene,

1793
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,349
I would remember Audrey's scene.

1794
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,959
Especially with 16 people in the group,

1795
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,890
you need to find yourself an edge.

1796
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,260
- Good job. - Audrey here.

1797
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,429
I did my best as the main dancer.

1798
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,398
So it was a bit sad that they got more points than us.

1799
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,599
We came in here to prove ourselves.

1800
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,438
And I think we're off to a great start.

1801
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:33,439
I can't wait to be together with them...

1802
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,179
to do the next challenge...

1803
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,909
because I think we're going to go off.

1804
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:43,148
By default, TSUBA KILL came in second place.

1805
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:44,419
(TSUBA KILL gets ranked 2nd in the Class Mission.)

1806
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,288
The main dancer of the Rookie Class, Rena of TSUBA KILL...

1807
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:48,420
brought additional 100 points to her crew.

1808
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,890
I will now reveal the individual scores.

1809
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:54,358
(Heart-pounding)

1810
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:57,499
(Akanen: 230, Sayaka: 260, Momo and Yumeri: 90, and Rena: 290)

1811
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,028
(TSUBA KILL's final score, 970)

1812
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,699
Momo and Yumeri only got 90 points?

1813
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,270
Really?

1814
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:06,239
Only Momo and Yumeri got such a low score.

1815
01:20:06,609 --> 01:20:10,639
(Momo and Yumeri: 90)

1816
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,779
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1817
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:14,579
I'm so sorry.

1818
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,850
By the way, 4 crews got 90 points for the middle class.

1819
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,050
(Many of the crews got the lowest score for the middle class.)

1820
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,560
I'll give the same ranking to the rest of the crews.

1821
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,389
Do you know that video?

1822
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:28,429
Royal Family was in the music video for the song, "Hello BitXXXX."

1823
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,059
CL's known to give powerful performances.

1824
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:34,368
And the dancers did the same choreography with her.

1825
01:20:34,369 --> 01:20:35,969
But all of them stood out in the video.

1826
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,538
Because their synergy all came together,

1827
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,510
CL seemed even more powerful.

1828
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,680
That video showed how dancers could improve the performance.

1829
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:45,179
But I didn't see that from this video.

1830
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,948
The dancers in the back weren't strong enough. It was clear.

1831
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:49,249
To stand out,

1832
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,118
the dancers will have to be better than that.

1833
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:53,618
They should have given us a better performance.

1834
01:20:53,619 --> 01:20:54,649
That's disappointing.

1835
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:01,600
Don't cry. It's not your fault.

1836
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:03,399
It's okay.

1837
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,170
Everyone knows. It's okay.

1838
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:08,500
It's okay.

1839
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,470
- She's crying. - There she goes.

1840
01:21:10,539 --> 01:21:12,039
She worked really hard.

1841
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,578
Let's beat them next time.

1842
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,739
It's okay.

1843
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,379
Keep your eye on us now.

1844
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,220
Our real journey starts now. Thank you.

1845
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:34,528
It's a good thing that our crew came in second place.

1846
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:37,228
But if we worked harder and contributed to our crew,

1847
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:39,129
we could have won first place.

1848
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,799
It made me think that...

1849
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,538
I would be able to grow as a dancer after this challenge.

1850
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:46,210
So I'm grateful that I went through this difficult challenge.

1851
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,640
I will work hard with my crew and make sure to come out on top.

1852
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:51,749
(The rankings of the crew in order: JAM REPUBLIC, TSUBA KILL, BEBE, )

1853
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,509
(LADYBOUNCE, MANNEQUEEN, 1MILLION, Deep N Dap, and Wolf'Lo)

1854
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,519
You were evaluated based on your individual skills...

1855
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,519
for the Class Mission.

1856
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,720
And the eight crews are in different places now.

1857
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,189
Your survival will depend on this next mission.

1858
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:05,389
Please.

1859
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,229
After this mission, the very first crew...

1860
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,799
will be eliminated from Street Woman Fighter 2.

1861
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,028
(The first crew to get eliminated?)

1862
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:13,228
(LADYBOUNCE, currently in 4th place)

1863
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:14,599
(1MILLION, currently in 6th place)

1864
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,669
No.

1865
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:16,938
Bye.

1866
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:17,939
It's fine as long as it's not us.

1867
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:21,568
There's no way our crew will get eliminated.

1868
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:24,938
I don't want to experience getting placed on the bottom again.

1869
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:28,180
This next mission will determine the first crew to get eliminated.

1870
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,779
It's called the K-pop Death match Mission.

1871
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,788
The major four entertainment agencies in Korea...

1872
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:36,559
popularized the performances of Korean artists all over the world.

1873
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,129
And you will perform songs from these agencies to battle it out.

1874
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,460
(They will perform the songs from 4 major agencies.)

1875
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:44,759
(Suddenly striking up a dance move)

1876
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,799
Oh, my gosh.

1877
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,499
She's the one who came up with the choreography.

1878
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,238
We have a lot of experience in this field.

1879
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:53,210
Of course, we'll win first place.

1880
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,778
I thought that I would be the best person...

1881
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:57,709
to come up with the perfect choreography...

1882
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,050
for K-pop songs.

1883
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,579
This sounds fun.

1884
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:03,349
I can't picture JAM REPUBLIC performing K-pop songs.

1885
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,249
I think again, this will be the first time...

1886
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,188
that people see us...

1887
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:09,459
doing K-pop as the mission or the challenge.

1888
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,729
I'm very excited and confident.

1889
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,059
The crews that chose the same entertainment agency...

1890
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,529
will battle it out 1 on 1.

1891
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:19,669
That's nice. We get to choose then.

1892
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,100
Gosh, which one should we pick?

1893
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:24,238
One crew will come out as a winner, and the other as a loser.

1894
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,868
It will be advantageous for you to compete against a crew...

1895
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:28,579
you have a shot at beating.

1896
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:31,010
Gosh, this is about strategies again.

1897
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,349
We have to be smart about this too.

1898
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:34,749
- We need a song... - Let's see.

1899
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,118
- we can get people to pump up... - Yes.

1900
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:37,648
No matter how good we are.

1901
01:23:37,649 --> 01:23:40,049
If that's what you want, we should pick HYBE.

1902
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,589
If we want to clearly show them our style,

1903
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,819
we must go with HYBE.

1904
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,589
As for "Next Level" and "Kick It,"

1905
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:47,988
working around the original choreography will be key.

1906
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:49,728
I think we can make "Kick It" come alive.

1907
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:52,368
But the original for "Next Level" is too strong.

1908
01:23:52,369 --> 01:23:53,670
I wonder who came up with that.

1909
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,269
(That was me.)

1910
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,000
Then should we go with JYP or HYBE instead?

1911
01:23:57,439 --> 01:23:59,538
I think everyone will choose HYBE.

1912
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:00,609
I agree.

1913
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,109
This is fire. This song is so lit.

1914
01:24:03,409 --> 01:24:05,809
- "Kick It" is actually really cool. - I like "Kick It."

1915
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,949
There's absolutely no way.

1916
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,180
Couldn't they just be in the same one?

1917
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:13,449
- That scared me. - There's something on the screen.

1918
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:15,158
(Please move to the song you'd like among SM, YG, JYP, and HYBE.)

1919
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:17,720
We have to move to the song we want.

1920
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:18,858
- Okay, let's go. - All right.

1921
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:19,859
Have a safe trip.

1922
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,858
- We're going to get it. - We'll be back.

1923
01:24:21,859 --> 01:24:23,460
- From here... - We'll wait inside.

1924
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,430
We'll wait there, then see who else comes in.

1925
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:28,999
- Okay. There's no one here. - There's no one here?

1926
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,100
JYP.

1927
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,039
I'm the expert at JYP choreography.

1928
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,709
I'm not scared no matter who else comes in.

1929
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,039
Tell them to come if they want.

1930
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,109
If we can't talk it out, we'll just fight them.

1931
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,809
(MANNEQUEEN heads out.)

1932
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:39,949
Let's go.

1933
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:42,449
We're going to win no matter what.

1934
01:24:42,949 --> 01:24:44,119
Is anyone there?

1935
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,489
Quick, hide it.

1936
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,119
Hide this so they can't see "HYBE."

1937
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:52,659
- Get rid of the "HYBE." - Get rid of it.

1938
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,729
- "You've come to the wrong place." - Like this.

1939
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:55,930
No one else can come.

1940
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,469
(LADYBOUNCE chooses SM, and Wolf'Lo chooses YG.)

1941
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,970
I hope no one else comes.

1942
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:02,738
But anyone can come too.

1943
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:05,709
We're on the edge of the cliff, so we have nowhere else to go.

1944
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:08,538
People might have thought we would come here already.

1945
01:25:08,539 --> 01:25:10,179
I'm sure some crews knew we would pick YG...

1946
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,309
and chose to avoid us...

1947
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,579
since they don't want to face us.

1948
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:15,880
We're in last place. Why wouldn't they want to face us?

1949
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:18,119
(The one who laughs in hard times will end up on top.)

1950
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,949
Who do you think will come?

1951
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:21,920
- I think BEBE. - BEBE?

1952
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:25,590
- Someone's there. - Yes.

1953
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:27,929
The path splits.

1954
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:28,930
(There are different crews waiting at both spots.)

1955
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:30,359
It's JYP and HYBE.

1956
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:32,529
Should we go with our original decision?

1957
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,329
They're coming here.

1958
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,270
Of course.

1959
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,810
- You're here. - This is so annoying.

1960
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,079
Deep N Dap isn't bad.

1961
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,539
We can win against them.

1962
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,550
Okay.

1963
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,119
- Hello. - BEBE came in.

1964
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,020
The team we wanted to avoid the most.

1965
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,890
I wonder what Bada will pick.

1966
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,189
I don't think she'll go with SM.

1967
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:56,359
- If BEBE chooses this one... - They could be good at that.

1968
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:59,389
Lia Kim was right there,

1969
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:01,430
so I thought it wouldn't be easy.

1970
01:26:01,659 --> 01:26:04,100
(The two crews that wanted to avoid each other have met.)

1971
01:26:04,329 --> 01:26:06,898
(JAM REPUBLIC heads out.)

1972
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:09,038
(Waving)

1973
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,239
(The SM Room)

1974
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:12,539
(Passing by)

1975
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,238
(JAM REPUBLIC passes by the SM Room.)

1976
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,939
(My heart is racing.)

1977
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:18,609
Down the stairs we go.

1978
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:21,448
(Their footsteps make everyone feel nervous.)

1979
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:22,750
Super graceful.

1980
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,520
It's Kirsten.

1981
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,789
Don't come here. Please.

1982
01:26:29,289 --> 01:26:32,989
(JAM REPUBLIC chooses HYBE.)

1983
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,800
JAM REPUBLIC came.

1984
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:37,659
We're doomed.

1985
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,229
(Dejected)

1986
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:42,470
I'm pretty sure two crews can only make the cut.

1987
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:45,510
It was very interesting. We didn't know what would happen.

1988
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,840
(Another pair of footsteps draw closer.)

1989
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:49,840
- Who is it? - It's here.

1990
01:26:50,109 --> 01:26:51,180
There's more?

1991
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,479
No way.

1992
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,779
Here we come.

1993
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:00,089
(TSUBA KILL chooses JYP.)

1994
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,989
With 1MILLION and BEBE.

1995
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,920
I see.

1996
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,390
I didn't like the idea of facing BEBE.

1997
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,858
(All 8 crews finished choosing their agencies.)

1998
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:11,398
Only one crew each...

1999
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:13,198
chose YG and SM.

2000
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,228
- Hooray! - Awesome!

2001
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,499
(These crews automatically pass since they're the only ones.)

2002
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,639
I told you!

2003
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,169
(These crews automatically pass since they're the only ones.)

2004
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:20,710
You can lose your matches then face us.

2005
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:25,279
Of the 3 crews, only 2 crews can face each other.

2006
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,078
The crews will fight each other using the song...

2007
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:29,350
to determine which two crews will ultimately face off.

2008
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,089
(That's ridiculous.)

2009
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,250
Really?

2010
01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:35,090
I didn't think of that.

2011
01:27:35,489 --> 01:27:38,788
We'll give you 30 seconds of music to battle with.

2012
01:27:38,789 --> 01:27:41,329
Create a choreography you can definitely win with.

2013
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:42,959
(A deep sigh)

2014
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,100
(There's so much I could say, but I won't.)

2015
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,430
Are you kidding me?

2016
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:49,539
I thought we were just going to talk in a civilized way,

2017
01:27:49,869 --> 01:27:51,100
woman to woman.

2018
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,339
So there's no shortcut.

2019
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,609
It's a system where we need to earn our win with effort.

2020
01:27:55,939 --> 01:27:58,609
Let's make a perfect 30 seconds.

2021
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:01,180
But if we're not chosen, we have to make a new one.

2022
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,649
We can just make sure we're chosen.

2023
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,949
We'll make one they have to choose.

2024
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,189
But BEBE and TSUBA KILL.

2025
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:08,119
Our pride will really be hurt if we lose here.

2026
01:28:08,289 --> 01:28:09,489
We won't lose.

2027
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:12,159
(D-day for the song battle)

2028
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:13,528
Let's go, Redlic!

2029
01:28:13,529 --> 01:28:15,189
(The crews are busy practicing until the last minute.)

2030
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,399
- Kyma, you need to pop more there. - Okay.

2031
01:28:17,829 --> 01:28:18,969
Be accurate!

2032
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:21,368
This is my chance to show people...

2033
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:23,300
why I'm a hot choreographer.

2034
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:24,669
Have fun with it.

2035
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:27,409
I'm confident if it's JYP music.

2036
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:30,909
We'll show the choreography that fits JYP the best.

2037
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,608
A K-pop mission?

2038
01:28:32,609 --> 01:28:34,949
Of course we'll do well.

2039
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,520
HYBE will definitely be Deep N Dap's.

2040
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:38,948
- Let's go. - Right.

2041
01:28:38,949 --> 01:28:42,119
Maybe we just go in and show them what we've created.

2042
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:44,220
Now we just have to practice hard.

2043
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,189
If we don't get the song, we'll have wasted a day.

2044
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:48,590
We need it no matter what.

2045
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:52,069
(The crews stayed up all night to win the song of their choice.)

2046
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,299
(The K-pop Death match Mission Song Battle)

2047
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,769
It's the day of the song battle...

2048
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,340
for the K-pop Death match Mission.

2049
01:28:57,869 --> 01:28:59,310
We need to get the song.

2050
01:28:59,369 --> 01:29:02,439
The agencies chosen by 3 crews, which need to be reduced to 2,

2051
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:05,949
are JYP, which has 1MILLION, BEBE, and TSUBA KILL,

2052
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:10,050
and HYBE, which has Deep N Dap, JAM REPUBLIC, and MANNEQUEEN.

2053
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,189
The results of the song battle to pick the two crews for a song...

2054
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:14,649
Who will decide?

2055
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,789
Will be chosen by your own votes.

2056
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,059
That's why it's even more nerve-racking.

2057
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:22,699
I felt that the votes would be very objective.

2058
01:29:22,829 --> 01:29:25,469
This will hurt my pride if I lose.

2059
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:27,228
Vote for the one crew you think should be eliminated...

2060
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:30,800
because they did not express the song well.

2061
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:33,269
Let them fight until they bleed.

2062
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,270
(Let them fight until they bleed.)

2063
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:37,340
Starting now, we will start the song battle for HYBE.

2064
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:39,680
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2065
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:41,978
- Good luck! - Go!

2066
01:29:41,979 --> 01:29:43,119
I'm looking forward to this.

2067
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,850
JAM REPUBLIC, please come to the stage.

2068
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:47,519
Let's do this.

2069
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,589
This is incredible.

2070
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:49,960
- They must be so nervous. - I know. They must be.

2071
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,289
I think their dance will be scary.

2072
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,788
I'm sure it'll be fierce.

2073
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:54,889
We knew it was going to be a tough competition...

2074
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,559
because we didn't know what to expect, and again,

2075
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:01,069
this is our first time taking on this K-pop challenge.

2076
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:02,340
We were a bit worried.

2077
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:05,099
Maybe the other teams are going to think,

2078
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,810
"This is not K-pop."

2079
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,379
(The JAM REPUBLIC hideout, the day before)

2080
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,209
Well, it would also kind of stink if we created all 30 seconds,

2081
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:15,379
and then weren't able to use what we already choreographed.

2082
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,649
Yes, true.

2083
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,318
It worries us a bit...

2084
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:20,249
because we're not Korean,

2085
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,460
and we're not used to dancing to K-pop songs.

2086
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:26,828
That feels crew-like.

2087
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:28,529
Maybe just like, anything you want.

2088
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,100
Can I?

2089
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,500
We don't want to look like a crew.

2090
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:34,399
We want to look like we're in K-pop.

2091
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,099
(JAM REPUBLIC created a dance that gives off a K-pop vibe.)

2092
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,499
I was worried...

2093
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,039
that ours didn't look to K-pop compared to the others.

2094
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:42,409
Yes, I was really worried.

2095
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:45,079
We really wanted to keep the song...

2096
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:48,710
and not have to change to another song and remake the choreography.

2097
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:52,189
(Their dance practice continues through the morning.)

2098
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,560
Go straight away. Don't wait for her.

2099
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:58,590
This is a new world for JAM REPUBLIC.

2100
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,689
I put my 100 percent into it.

2101
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,259
We're going to echo that through the movement,

2102
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,699
and we are ready to bring it.

2103
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:06,769
Okay, should we just go for it?

2104
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:08,630
- Yes. - Yes, let's go.

2105
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:10,239
- They're going. - I'm nervous.

2106
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:12,068
- HYBE. - HYBE.

2107
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:14,010
(What dance did JAM REPUBLIC create for HYBE with a K-pop vibe?)

2108
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:21,649
(Focused)

2109
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,720
(The ending fairy, Audrey)

2110
01:32:03,319 --> 01:32:04,459
(Clucking)

2111
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:05,488
They're good.

2112
01:32:05,489 --> 01:32:07,090
- That was insane. - That was so cool.

2113
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:09,630
- How did they come up with this? - That was great.

2114
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,000
Although I don't want to admit it,

2115
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:12,329
they created a clean, good dance.

2116
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:14,100
That just went whoosh.

2117
01:32:14,899 --> 01:32:16,170
I don't know how that went.

2118
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:18,909
It would be a little bit annoying to be eliminated.

2119
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:22,908
Next, MANNEQUEEN, please come to the stage.

2120
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:25,139
- All right. - Let's go.

2121
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,210
(MANNEQUEEN is up next in the song battle.)

2122
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,019
Let's go.

2123
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,349
I think they'll have created something very polished.

2124
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:33,289
I think MANNEQUEEN will do well.

2125
01:32:33,319 --> 01:32:36,890
We got a ton of bad votes in the previous rounds.

2126
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:41,788
(There were 2 MANNEQUEEN dancers chosen as the Worst Dancers.)

2127
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,359
Why are they picking on us?

2128
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:46,469
What if people think of us as competition in this round...

2129
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,369
and vote for us to kick us out again?

2130
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,539
I was worried about that.

2131
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,399
- Should we go? You okay? - Yes, okay.

2132
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:53,169
I'm really looking forward to this.

2133
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,568
It's a totally different kind of anticipation than for JAM REPUBLIC.

2134
01:32:55,569 --> 01:32:57,939
(What will it look like?)

2135
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,549
We have to do this song and only this song.

2136
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:01,949
We have to get it no matter what.

2137
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:27,770
- Okay. - Okay.

2138
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:29,239
- Yes. - Okay.

2139
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:31,539
They're very feminine.

2140
01:33:41,789 --> 01:33:42,989
That was insane.

2141
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,220
This is so scary.

2142
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,489
Both of the choreographies were really strong.

2143
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:47,390
It was very K-pop-ish.

2144
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:49,528
- Yes, so different. - Yes.

2145
01:33:49,529 --> 01:33:53,068
MANNEQUEEN's 30-second piece. It was strong and powerful.

2146
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:55,329
It's a good competition.

2147
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,840
We did well, right?

2148
01:33:57,069 --> 01:33:58,539
I don't know. It just flew by.

2149
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:01,839
Next, we have Deep N Dap. Please come to the stage.

2150
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,938
(Deep N Dap is last to perform in the fight zone.)

2151
01:34:03,939 --> 01:34:06,510
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2152
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:08,249
Let's go.

2153
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,648
Everyone's so nervous.

2154
01:34:09,649 --> 01:34:11,149
Everyone looks like they're struggling.

2155
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,119
They all look like they're in bad shape.

2156
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:14,789
(What happened to Deep N Dap that they look so glum?)

2157
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,119
(The night before, at the fight club)

2158
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,989
(The other crews are focused on practicing for the song battle.)

2159
01:34:21,229 --> 01:34:23,898
Deep N Dap was next to us.

2160
01:34:23,899 --> 01:34:26,629
But we noticed they weren't practicing.

2161
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,828
We were wondering what happened. Did they give up?

2162
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,640
We heard...

2163
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:33,140
that their leader was sleeping.

2164
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:37,408
From the start,

2165
01:34:37,409 --> 01:34:40,009
we faced problems because of that.

2166
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:41,108
I'm going crazy here.

2167
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:42,850
(Deep N Dap has trouble practicing without a leader to guide them.)

2168
01:34:43,619 --> 01:34:44,619
(Peeking over)

2169
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,188
(MANNEQUEEN, on the other hand, is sharing opinions and practicing.)

2170
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:47,420
Is that right?

2171
01:34:47,619 --> 01:34:49,420
Why am I so jealous of that?

2172
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:51,318
- It was upsetting. - You can't break down here.

2173
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:52,960
I know. We can do it.

2174
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:56,460
Mina? We need to make choreo now.

2175
01:34:56,529 --> 01:34:58,760
I feel so sick.

2176
01:34:58,829 --> 01:35:00,429
- Really? - She said she's feeling very sick.

2177
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:02,899
I'll come back later. Rest a bit.

2178
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,639
Then we can...

2179
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,810
- Let's start on our own. - We can start without Mina.

2180
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:09,139
(The crew members divide up parts...)

2181
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,739
(and start to come up with the choreography.)

2182
01:35:11,909 --> 01:35:13,948
Do you want to see it from the start, Mina?

2183
01:35:13,949 --> 01:35:16,180
(Deep N Dap is all together, including their leader, Mina.)

2184
01:35:16,619 --> 01:35:19,750
(Mina Myoung watches the moves they've made up until now.)

2185
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:23,619
There's no eye-catching move.

2186
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:27,759
We need to make sure they pick us no matter what.

2187
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,760
(The mood freezes over at their leader's cold feedback.)

2188
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:32,100
We're in trouble. We have so little time left.

2189
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,369
- Let's go. - We can do it.

2190
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,599
(Deep N Dap creates choreography under Mina Myoung's guidance.)

2191
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,639
That's it.

2192
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,140
I was feeling so unwell,

2193
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,578
so I felt bad to my crew members.

2194
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:44,238
It made me really worried,

2195
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,538
and I felt very disappointed.

2196
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,710
We practiced hard, staying up all night.

2197
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:50,618
Let's focus and do this.

2198
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:53,289
I worked hard for the time that I was there.

2199
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,059
(Their hearts and bodies grow rushed as the time draws near.)

2200
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,119
Again.

2201
01:35:57,319 --> 01:35:58,988
Move. Move right away.

2202
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:00,329
I am worried, but...

2203
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:02,499
"We know how to do this kind of dancing too."

2204
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,100
We're going to show off a new side of ourselves.

2205
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:17,340
Let's go.

2206
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:19,180
Okay!

2207
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,810
Okay!

2208
01:36:34,489 --> 01:36:36,960
- Yes. - Okay.

2209
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:42,299
Starting now, we will start voting for the HYBE song battle.

2210
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,199
Excluding Deep N Dap, JAM REPUBLIC, and MANNEQUEEN,

2211
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,970
the other five crews will vote.

2212
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:49,509
You don't know what'll happen.

2213
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,608
This is so hard.

2214
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:54,148
We can vote strategically to break down a team mentally too.

2215
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:57,079
The ones who join our group will have to make a new dance.

2216
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,419
What does the weakest crew do after that?

2217
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,749
We just don't get the song.

2218
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,589
That means they don't think we deserve it.

2219
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:04,689
Maybe they will vote us out.

2220
01:37:04,859 --> 01:37:06,988
Are they going to target us...

2221
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:10,059
because we are currently ranked first?

2222
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:13,198
Will they vote us out to make it more difficult?

2223
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:14,800
I have no idea.

2224
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:16,938
I couldn't see a definitive style for this crew.

2225
01:37:16,939 --> 01:37:18,969
That's one strategy.

2226
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:20,239
This makes my flesh crawl.

2227
01:37:20,409 --> 01:37:21,640
I was nervous.

2228
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,738
I didn't want to get voted out.

2229
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:25,709
We practiced all night without sleeping,

2230
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:27,448
so if we're not chosen,

2231
01:37:27,449 --> 01:37:29,779
our crew wouldn't know what to do. It could never happen.

2232
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:31,818
The results are in.

2233
01:37:31,819 --> 01:37:33,019
(The votes for the HYBE song battle are in.)

2234
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,089
I can't watch.

2235
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:36,459
Of Deep N Dap, JAM REPUBLIC, and MANNEQUEEN,

2236
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:39,529
which two crews will face off with a HYBE song?

2237
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:41,389
If we have to make new choreography, I'm going to cry.

2238
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,630
Here are the results of the vote.

2239
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,599
(The votes clustered around one crew.)

2240
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,328
- Gosh. - My goodness.

2241
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:49,438
Really?

2242
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:50,939
So one team got that many votes?

2243
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,969
Those must be the votes for the crew to be eliminated.

2244
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,038
- The one with more votes is cut. - Yes, the one with the most votes.

2245
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:57,479
- I doubt we got 24 votes. - Please.

2246
01:37:57,710 --> 01:37:59,609
I think that's going to be us.

2247
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,449
(Which crew will be cut from HYBE with the greatest number of votes?)

2248
01:38:02,979 --> 01:38:04,420
(Deep N Dap)

2249
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:06,850
What?

2250
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:08,420
- What? - Oh, what?

2251
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,019
We got eliminated? This is so harsh.

2252
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,130
We were eliminated.

2253
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,189
Now I just want to go home.

2254
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:16,629
I thought we were going to be cut.

2255
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:18,500
I thought they were going to come for us.

2256
01:38:20,029 --> 01:38:23,239
The HYBE match will be between JAM REPUBLIC MANNEQUEEN.

2257
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,170
(HYBE Match: JAM REPUBLIC versus MANNEQUEEN)

2258
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:28,608
We're just going head to head with MANNEQUEEN all the time.

2259
01:38:28,609 --> 01:38:29,909
Not again?

2260
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:34,609
Yes, we meet again. MANNEQUEEN.

2261
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:37,078
(MANNEQUEEN's Yoonji versus JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten)

2262
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:39,219
(JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten versus MANNEQUEEN'S Waackxxxy)

2263
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,049
(JAM REPUBLIC's Ling versus MANNEQUEEN's Cera)

2264
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:42,188
(The sub-leader class matchup...)

2265
01:38:42,189 --> 01:38:43,390
(between JAM REPUBLIC's LaTrice and MANNEQUEEN's Redlic)

2266
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:45,459
Honestly, I want to face off against them more.

2267
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,759
In Korea, the powerhouse of K-pop,

2268
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,858
we'll show them.

2269
01:38:48,859 --> 01:38:52,499
I truly believe that JAM REPUBLIC is the queens of everything.

2270
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,630
We're ready.

2271
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:57,299
We will now begin the song battle for the JYP match.

2272
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,510
(The 3 crews to fight in the JYP song battle)

2273
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:03,578
- This is a really tough fight. - It's going to be so tough.

2274
01:39:03,579 --> 01:39:04,840
They're all so different.

2275
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:07,309
Please come to the stage, 1MILLION.

2276
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:09,779
(The first crew up is 1MILLION.)

2277
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:11,849
I'm looking forward to this.

2278
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:13,520
Her hair is so straight.

2279
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:15,420
I'm curious to see what they came up with.

2280
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:17,389
(Previous night at the fight club)

2281
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:19,289
(1MILLION began practice for the song battle.)

2282
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,529
(Lia Kim cut the flow of practice short.)

2283
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,800
(Her head started turning half a beat too early.)

2284
01:39:27,029 --> 01:39:30,739
(She kept making mistakes after that.)

2285
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,538
(Even during the choreo selection, Lia Kim kept making mistakes.)

2286
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:38,340
I'm very slow at memorizing choreographies.

2287
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:41,608
She already has it memorized.

2288
01:39:41,609 --> 01:39:43,719
But she's feeling the pressure of having to perform it,

2289
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,419
and knowing we have to perform it even better...

2290
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:47,549
because we're not doing well right now adds more pressure.

2291
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:49,359
I'll have to support her a lot.

2292
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:52,260
This is so hard to pull off.

2293
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,828
I can't pull off this move well.

2294
01:39:53,829 --> 01:39:55,459
- That's not true. - It looks fine.

2295
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,060
- You can just go by feel. - No, it's not coming out right.

2296
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,970
(She's still unsatisfied.)

2297
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:01,898
- Shall we try it? - Let's try it out.

2298
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:03,300
- Yes. - Let's go!

2299
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,909
(1MILLION keeps practicing.)

2300
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:09,709
Honestly, they don't need practice. They can go in and rest...

2301
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:10,809
because they already know it all.

2302
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,608
They're practicing because of me.

2303
01:40:12,609 --> 01:40:14,648
They're doing it over and over because I don't know it yet.

2304
01:40:14,649 --> 01:40:16,250
I felt apologetic about that.

2305
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:22,350
(Lia Kim doesn't stop practicing.)

2306
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:24,059
(Sighing)

2307
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,929
This is very hard for me,

2308
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:28,659
but we have to do it regardless.

2309
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,460
We'll start now.

2310
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,529
- Good luck. - Let's go!

2311
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,970
- I'm looking forward to this. - I'm nervous.

2312
01:40:48,779 --> 01:40:50,250
(Gulping. focused)

2313
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,960
(Impressed)

2314
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:03,430
(Focused)

2315
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:15,970
(Exclaiming)

2316
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:17,239
That was powerful.

2317
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,550
1MILLION is definitely very crew-like.

2318
01:41:20,609 --> 01:41:22,149
They created such a strong choreography for "Not Shy."

2319
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:23,880
It was weaker than I expected.

2320
01:41:23,979 --> 01:41:25,549
I think it's because "MANIAC" was weaker...

2321
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:26,850
even though "Not Shy" was good.

2322
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,459
- That went by in a flash. - I feel so out of it.

2323
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,989
- That went by so quickly. - It was like a rollercoaster.

2324
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:35,329
I think we did well, though, with no mistakes.

2325
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,629
TSUBA KILL, please come to the stage.

2326
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:40,430
(The second crew up is TSUBA KILL.)

2327
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:41,699
Let's go.

2328
01:41:41,899 --> 01:41:43,169
I can't wait.

2329
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:45,238
I'm already looking forward to this.

2330
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:46,438
Don't you think they'll do well?

2331
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:47,510
Yes.

2332
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,608
On Yumeri's social media,

2333
01:41:51,609 --> 01:41:53,550
you can see she's made a ton of dances to K-pop.

2334
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:54,979
She's very good at that too.

2335
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:58,419
I think going like this here would be better.

2336
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,449
(TSUBA KILL made choreography under Yumeri's direction.)

2337
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,420
I wish there were some kind of super move.

2338
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:06,390
(Suddenly, the vibe changed to a horror movie?)

2339
01:42:06,689 --> 01:42:07,929
I'm sorry.

2340
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:09,390
My foot was off.

2341
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,459
It's a K-pop mission,

2342
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:15,300
so Yumeri added in some acrobatics for impact.

2343
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:19,270
- Amazing. - Amazing.

2344
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:23,109
(TSUBA KILL starts putting it all together in earnest.)

2345
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:25,978
Practice went smoothly.

2346
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:29,408
TSUBA KILL is a crew that's good at choreography,

2347
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:31,019
so I'm confident we can win.

2348
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,020
TSUBA KILL is perfect.

2349
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:35,689
(What is TSUBA KILL's JYP dance, which focuses on power moves?)

2350
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,659
It's so clean.

2351
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,029
(Focused)

2352
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,310
(Jaws dropping)

2353
01:43:00,949 --> 01:43:01,949
(Exclaiming)

2354
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:03,149
She didn't even use her hands.

2355
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:22,800
That's so cool.

2356
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,239
That was insane.

2357
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:27,039
Yumeri's so good.

2358
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:28,670
That was really good.

2359
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:31,039
We felt threatened.

2360
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:32,909
We did well.

2361
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:36,949
Next, BEBE, please come to the stage.

2362
01:43:37,149 --> 01:43:38,520
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2363
01:43:39,149 --> 01:43:40,319
Let's go.

2364
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:42,688
BEBE must be feeling the competition now.

2365
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:45,019
If their style is too similar to TSUBA KILL's, they could lose.

2366
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:46,658
I don't think they'll be able to win against TSUBA KILL.

2367
01:43:46,659 --> 01:43:48,329
Honestly, I think BEBE will totally flop in the JYP match.

2368
01:43:48,489 --> 01:43:49,829
BEBE will experience its first crisis.

2369
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:53,129
Let's make the signature dance move before Bada gets here.

2370
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:54,198
Okay.

2371
01:43:54,199 --> 01:43:56,698
(BEBE works on the choreography without the leader, Bada.)

2372
01:43:56,699 --> 01:43:57,869
Since Bada was missing,

2373
01:43:59,069 --> 01:44:00,840
we didn't know what to do.

2374
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,779
How far did you go?

2375
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:06,349
We simply collected ideas.

2376
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,449
That means you didn't do anything.

2377
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:11,850
(The atmosphere turns frigid in the waiting room.)

2378
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,749
I am not in this competition alone.

2379
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:17,118
The members need to show their abilities too.

2380
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,389
Since they hadn't done anything,

2381
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,529
I felt like I needed to be stern.

2382
01:44:20,689 --> 01:44:21,789
- Let's hurry up. - Okay.

2383
01:44:22,029 --> 01:44:26,698
(BEBE begins practicing in earnest.)

2384
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:28,670
Go down more, Cheche.

2385
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:30,970
(Messing up)

2386
01:44:30,971 --> 01:44:33,640
(Lusher messed up while moving to a different spot.)

2387
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,609
Why is Lusher in the way?

2388
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:38,809
Everyone was pressured to win in the JYP match,

2389
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,379
so the teamwork was often bad.

2390
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:44,220
(They practice until the next morning.)

2391
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:46,318
Minah, you need to make it stronger.

2392
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:47,390
Put strength into it.

2393
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:49,219
Put more strength into it, the two of you.

2394
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:51,818
Older members danced strongly, but you danced weakly.

2395
01:44:51,819 --> 01:44:52,890
- Okay. - You shouldn't do that, right?

2396
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:55,328
Go further, guys.

2397
01:44:55,329 --> 01:44:56,728
(But they continue to make mistakes.)

2398
01:44:56,729 --> 01:44:57,959
(Messing up)

2399
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,100
I knew that would happen.

2400
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:04,670
(Lusher makes another mistake.)

2401
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:08,738
The more we practiced, the messier the dance became.

2402
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:10,079
I was having a mental breakdown.

2403
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:12,908
Guys, it has to be this song.

2404
01:45:12,909 --> 01:45:14,049
- Okay? - Okay.

2405
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:15,709
- Let's go. - I will get going.

2406
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:18,250
Don't make any mistakes. We can't let them take it.

2407
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:21,688
(Will BEBE be able to win in the JYP match?)

2408
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:23,060
Why am I nervous?

2409
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:48,108
Hey.

2410
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:49,278
(That's it.)

2411
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:50,350
(Cheering)

2412
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,579
Hey.

2413
01:46:03,329 --> 01:46:04,358
(It was cool.)

2414
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:05,560
(The performance had a key point.)

2415
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,929
They are definitely good at coming up with a choreography.

2416
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:09,229
They made it well in BEBE's style.

2417
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:11,368
Okay. Well done.

2418
01:46:11,369 --> 01:46:12,969
- Well done. - Well done.

2419
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:14,669
We did well with our own colours.

2420
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:16,009
- We had a short amount of time. - Yes.

2421
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,639
We did really well.

2422
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:18,679
(The voting begins.)

2423
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,448
The voting begins now.

2424
01:46:20,449 --> 01:46:24,448
(Five crews excluding 1MILLION, TSUBA KILL, and BEBE vote.)

2425
01:46:24,449 --> 01:46:26,379
I think the strong crews should go against each other.

2426
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,920
- Like us. - Yes.

2427
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:31,759
- All three crews are different. - They are so different.

2428
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,658
- TSUBA KILL made the best dance. - They are strong.

2429
01:46:34,659 --> 01:46:36,228
BEBE will be strong among the public.

2430
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:38,028
The same goes for 1MILLION.

2431
01:46:38,029 --> 01:46:41,028
What would happen if 1MILLION gets eliminated...

2432
01:46:41,029 --> 01:46:43,368
and neither 1MILLION nor Deep N Dap gets the song?

2433
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:45,339
They are like the K-pop crews.

2434
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,710
Someone new will come into the scene.

2435
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,238
There are so many possibilities.

2436
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,109
This isn't Street Women Fighter 2 but a math class.

2437
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:54,250
All the votes are in.

2438
01:46:54,779 --> 01:46:56,920
I will now reveal the result.

2439
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:00,249
I think we were the most perfect...

2440
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,619
among the three crews.

2441
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:04,319
We did well in the past, so I was confident.

2442
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,430
I think it was a cool performance.

2443
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:10,459
(26 votes, 3 votes, 0 votes)

2444
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,929
(Shocked)

2445
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:13,500
(I can't believe it.)

2446
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,069
Zero votes. My goodness.

2447
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:17,669
What do zero votes mean?

2448
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:20,068
It's like, "This song is yours."

2449
01:47:20,069 --> 01:47:22,340
We didn't get 26 votes, did we?

2450
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:26,478
(Which crew will be expelled from the JYP match with 26 votes?)

2451
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:27,979
(26 votes, 3 votes, 0 votes)

2452
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:30,220
(With 26 votes, 1MILLION is expelled from the JYP match.)

2453
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:32,648
(With 3 votes, BEBE secured a place in the JYP match.)

2454
01:47:32,649 --> 01:47:34,618
(With 0 votes, TSUBA KILL secured a place in the JYP match.)

2455
01:47:34,619 --> 01:47:38,589
(1MILLION got expelled from the JYP match.)

2456
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:39,619
Okay.

2457
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,560
It hurt my pride.

2458
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:47,099
(Sighing)

2459
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,898
Don't you feel bad for them now?

2460
01:47:49,899 --> 01:47:51,139
(It's funny but sad.)

2461
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:52,698
They are sitting across from us too.

2462
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:54,010
What are we doing?

2463
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:57,578
The expelled crews are Deep N Dap and 1MILLION.

2464
01:47:57,579 --> 01:48:00,109
The two crews must reselect the match.

2465
01:48:00,279 --> 01:48:04,148
Between the two crews, the crew that received fewer votes,

2466
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:07,289
Deep N Dap will select an agency with an opening.

2467
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,020
Deep N Dap will select the SM match.

2468
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:13,929
(The SM match, LADYBOUNCE versus Deep N Dap)

2469
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:16,229
(The YG match, Wolf'Lo versus 1MILLION)

2470
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,799
I will give you the final list of matches...

2471
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,630
for the K-pop Death match Mission.

2472
01:48:19,829 --> 01:48:22,829
The YG match, Wolf'Lo versus 1MILLION.

2473
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:26,339
Have 1MILLION members done anything so far?

2474
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:27,908
They haven't even done one person's worth.

2475
01:48:27,909 --> 01:48:30,010
We are good at dance battles at the very least.

2476
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:31,479
(Sighing)

2477
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,908
Lia is really angry.

2478
01:48:32,909 --> 01:48:34,850
I will make you go home after this match.

2479
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:37,720
Go home and get a good rest.

2480
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:40,219
(The YG match, Wolf'Lo versus 1MILLION)

2481
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,590
The SM match, LADYBOUNCE versus Deep N Dap.

2482
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:47,129
We will show you why LADYBOUNCE is the one and only dance crew,

2483
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,789
so stand and watch.

2484
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,729
You placed last when we had the first battle.

2485
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,199
We will destroy you this time as well.

2486
01:48:57,399 --> 01:48:59,339
(The SM match, LADYBOUNCE versus Deep N Dap)

2487
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:02,670
The JYP match, BEBE versus TSUBA KILL.

2488
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:06,379
We have no reason to lose...

2489
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:07,849
against TSUBA KILL.

2490
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:10,520
I think you can get on the plane and go home after this mission.

2491
01:49:11,949 --> 01:49:13,118
(The plane?)

2492
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,289
She told them to get on the plane and go home.

2493
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:16,089
As we showed you,

2494
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:19,188
we received zero votes during the battle.

2495
01:49:19,189 --> 01:49:22,430
I don't think the match is necessary because the result is out already.

2496
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:25,029
(The JYP match, BEBE versus TSUBA KILL)

2497
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:28,399
(The last match for the K-pop Death match Mission)

2498
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:31,868
They will have the most intense war of nerves.

2499
01:49:31,869 --> 01:49:33,510
They keep contending against JAM REPUBLIC.

2500
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:37,409
The HYBE match, JAM REPUBLIC versus MANNEQUEEN.

2501
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,879
MANNEQUEEN, we meet again.

2502
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,750
Let us show you why we are number one.

2503
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:47,020
We will show you who the queen of K-pop is.

2504
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:48,250
(What?)

2505
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,659
We will show you...

2506
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,859
who is going to be the real queen in the K-pop scene.

2507
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:55,130
Did you hear that?

2508
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:56,559
Oh, we could hear you.

2509
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,659
We just wanted to see if she could say it again.

2510
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:02,528
(The HYBE match, JAM REPUBLIC versus MANNEQUEEN)

2511
01:50:02,529 --> 01:50:04,269
The dancers of Street Women Fighter 2,

2512
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:06,139
the K-pop Death match Mission...

2513
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:07,908
will involve audience members.

2514
01:50:07,909 --> 01:50:09,509
(Cheering)

2515
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:11,139
(Oh, my goodness)

2516
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:13,209
You dance the best in front of audience members...

2517
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:16,549
because they exude incredible energy.

2518
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,719
I am so excited.

2519
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,519
Since there will be audience members,

2520
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,988
the order will be important as it commands the atmosphere.

2521
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:24,419
The order will be decided...

2522
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:25,658
(How will the order be decided?)

2523
01:50:25,659 --> 01:50:28,059
by the performance director of each entertainment agency...

2524
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,629
and the artists.

2525
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,000
(Surprised)

2526
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:34,669
- Hello, we are LE SSERAFIM. - Hello, we are LE SSERAFIM.

2527
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,738
- The JYP match. - The JYP match.

2528
01:50:36,739 --> 01:50:38,999
Gosh, the scale is insane.

2529
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,969
Each song has two dance copy challenge sections.

2530
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,538
Since this mission is a 1-on-1 match...

2531
01:50:44,539 --> 01:50:46,809
in which one crew will win and the other will lose,

2532
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:48,478
it's important to make a dance...

2533
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:50,179
that contains the crew's specialty.

2534
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,578
So if some of them did the windmill...

2535
01:50:51,579 --> 01:50:52,849
- Yes. - Then the other team...

2536
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:54,049
has to do the windmill.

2537
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:55,288
They have to copy it.

2538
01:50:55,289 --> 01:50:56,759
We will win.

2539
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,619
No one will be able to copy Yumeri's move.

2540
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:04,198
(Yumeri showed incredible techniques.)

2541
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:06,059
Now, please discuss...

2542
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,270
and decide on the part you want.

2543
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:11,238
(The HYBE match, MANNEQUEEN versus JAM REPUBLIC)

2544
01:51:11,239 --> 01:51:12,939
Which part do you have in mind?

2545
01:51:13,239 --> 01:51:14,710
We want to do "Dope."

2546
01:51:16,369 --> 01:51:17,879
(Averting her eyes)

2547
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,278
You as well?

2548
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:20,279
Yes.

2549
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,679
(It's destiny.)

2550
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,849
(Both crews want "Dope" by BTS.)

2551
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:24,849
- All right. - I think it's destiny.

2552
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:26,379
At this point, it's destiny.

2553
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,419
We chose "Dope" because of...

2554
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:33,188
the fun swag and the groove of it.

2555
01:51:33,189 --> 01:51:36,158
And we thought you would pick the first part.

2556
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:37,999
Your "Boom, boom, boom" part.

2557
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,899
You played it around really nicely with the formation and partner work.

2558
01:51:42,369 --> 01:51:44,698
If I were, you know, audience...

2559
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:45,769
You know, audience...

2560
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:46,770
(Audience?)

2561
01:51:46,771 --> 01:51:48,139
Maybe they already expect,

2562
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:49,469
"Oh, MANNEQUEEN is going to do LE SSERAFIM."

2563
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:50,509
That's right.

2564
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:51,679
"Oh, MANNEQUEEN is going to do LE SSERAFIM."

2565
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:52,738
(Is that so?)

2566
01:51:52,739 --> 01:51:55,408
So maybe it's time to switch and show people.

2567
01:51:55,409 --> 01:51:57,648
Of course, BTS is super famous.

2568
01:51:57,649 --> 01:51:59,249
But I feel like when you guys perform to LE SSERAFIM's song...

2569
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,818
in front of the audience...

2570
01:52:00,819 --> 01:52:02,689
Maybe they will feel more interested.

2571
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,988
This was hard.

2572
01:52:04,989 --> 01:52:07,528
I thought, "They will yield if I push a bit more."

2573
01:52:07,529 --> 01:52:10,129
I actually thought you guys did a really good job...

2574
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:12,659
with paying homage to LE SSERAFIM.

2575
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,868
You had the LE SSERAFIM top on,

2576
01:52:16,869 --> 01:52:20,438
and you were doing this choreography which was like the signature move.

2577
01:52:20,439 --> 01:52:23,510
I realized that this crew really wanted "Dope" too.

2578
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:26,710
They did a good job of saying no with a smile.

2579
01:52:26,909 --> 01:52:28,350
They aren't backing down.

2580
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:30,719
My feelings are the exact same.

2581
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,850
So not budging?

2582
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:34,019
Not budging. Okay.

2583
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:35,288
It's like they're expecting us...

2584
01:52:35,289 --> 01:52:36,549
- to budge too. - Yes.

2585
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:40,129
We are going to put in some breaking moves.

2586
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:41,429
(Like this?)

2587
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:44,728
I don't think MANNEQUEEN has...

2588
01:52:44,729 --> 01:52:47,299
any breakers from what I remember.

2589
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,670
Maybe that's something we can throw in there.

2590
01:52:51,399 --> 01:52:53,510
(The thought makes her excited.)

2591
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,809
I can't let them take "Dope..."

2592
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:57,879
because I know exactly what they will do.

2593
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,009
We need to stop them.

2594
01:52:59,010 --> 01:53:02,409
We will be in trouble if we fail to take "Dope."

2595
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:04,478
If we fail to take the part,

2596
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:05,679
we will lose no matter what.

2597
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,449
We had no intention to yield.

2598
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:12,358
- So we are stuck on "Dope." - So...

2599
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:13,760
- Okay. - Their decision is the same.

2600
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:16,189
We don't want to change.

2601
01:53:16,829 --> 01:53:19,260
To be honest, I didn't want to go that far.

2602
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:22,299
- Just this once. - There you go.

2603
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,939
- Please. We love you guys. - Come on.

2604
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,799
(I give up.)

2605
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,609
Just lie down and refuse to budge.

2606
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,510
We put our pride down and begged.

2607
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,180
Kirsten, please.

2608
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:36,778
They can't change us like that.

2609
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:39,448
To be honest, we were the main dancers.

2610
01:53:39,449 --> 01:53:42,549
- I was going to do Audrey's part. - We gave it to you.

2611
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:44,488
To be honest, I gave it to you.

2612
01:53:44,489 --> 01:53:47,429
I know. I am sorry.

2613
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:50,629
I think she was right. I did feel bad.

2614
01:53:50,630 --> 01:53:52,899
I didn't want to give it to her in that moment.

2615
01:53:53,229 --> 01:53:55,198
Okay, but you guys are cooler, so...

2616
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,100
But we lost in the end.

2617
01:53:57,899 --> 01:54:00,469
(Time passes endlessly.)

2618
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:02,339
(The two crews don't back down.)

2619
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,179
Please go back to the hideout.

2620
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,608
The two crews are repeating the same words.

2621
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:06,779
Shall we block the door?

2622
01:54:06,909 --> 01:54:09,510
- Please. - Come on.

2623
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,920
Just hold out. What should we say?

2624
01:54:11,319 --> 01:54:13,818
- Let's prepare the comments. - That's right.

2625
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:16,049
It's just a matter of pride.

2626
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:17,119
At this point, I am just like...

2627
01:54:17,489 --> 01:54:18,988
We meet again.

2628
01:54:18,989 --> 01:54:20,359
Did you change your mind by any chance?

2629
01:54:20,529 --> 01:54:21,659
- No. - No.

2630
01:54:21,829 --> 01:54:22,929
Have you?

2631
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:23,999
Actually,

2632
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,529
we are super ready to wait.

2633
01:54:25,729 --> 01:54:27,769
- We are too. - Perfect.

2634
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:29,169
(The two crews have a war of nerves without backing down.)

2635
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:30,470
Let's see who wins.

2636
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:31,669
Oh, my gosh.

2637
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:33,140
We met three times.

2638
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:34,608
(Please stop!)

2639
01:54:34,609 --> 01:54:35,809
Wasn't it the first time...

2640
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:37,339
the crews decided through this?

2641
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:38,978
Seriously. This is insane.

2642
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:41,179
Please help us, higher power.

2643
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,680
Oh, my goodness.

2644
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:44,649
Just let us do it!

2645
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:47,149
There was a lot of tension in the air.

2646
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:48,520
Yoonji even cried.

2647
01:54:48,619 --> 01:54:51,220
We almost needed Han Moon Chul, the lawyer.

2648
01:54:51,659 --> 01:54:54,359
So you might as well grab your popcorn.

2649
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:57,100
(It will be revealed soon.)

2650
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:00,300
It was really pushing us with time as well,

2651
01:55:00,529 --> 01:55:03,329
but we still couldn't come to a decision.

2652
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:05,239
It's time to...

2653
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:06,739
- Pick. - Okay.

2654
01:55:07,239 --> 01:55:08,439
For the first time ever,

2655
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:09,810
it was decided by picking a card.

2656
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:11,038
Which one?

2657
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:12,709
(The crew behind the picked card will take "Dope.")

2658
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:13,880
I am going to go with...

2659
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,608
- Right. - Right?

2660
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:17,219
I think whatever we get,

2661
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:18,649
- we are going to kill it. - We will be fine.

2662
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:20,050
- Gosh. - I can't watch this.

2663
01:55:20,449 --> 01:55:22,619
- I can't watch this. - Me neither.

2664
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:24,260
Okay.

2665
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:25,819
Please let us get it.

2666
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,060
Oh, my goodness. Please just let us go.

2667
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:29,389
(Never.)

2668
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:31,658
Please help us, higher power.

2669
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:33,670
(Everything depends on one card!)

2670
01:55:33,899 --> 01:55:35,529
One, two, three.

2671
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:37,840
- Two, three. - Pink.

2672
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:39,800
Please let it be yellow.

2673
01:55:40,539 --> 01:55:41,970
One, two, three.

2674
01:55:44,579 --> 01:55:46,979
(MANNEQUEEN wins.)

2675
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:49,749
(MANNEQUEEN succeeds in getting "Dope" by BTS.)

2676
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:51,478
We ran out.

2677
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:52,880
The higher power helped us.

2678
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,249
There were tears in my eyes.

2679
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:56,288
Oh, my goodness.

2680
01:55:56,289 --> 01:55:57,289
(Joking)

2681
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,859
As soon as I saw yellow,

2682
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,459
I was a little bit disappointed.

2683
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:03,859
But we weren't so destroyed.

2684
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:08,898
Even if MANNEQUEEN pulls out some craziness with "Dope,"

2685
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:11,800
we are confident that we can do it anyway. So it's okay.

2686
01:56:11,899 --> 01:56:12,938
Thank you.

2687
01:56:12,939 --> 01:56:14,408
(The negotiation ends for the dance copy section.)

2688
01:56:14,409 --> 01:56:16,209
(Let's go and come up with the choreography.)

2689
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:18,278
We aren't excited at all about LADYBOUNCE's version...

2690
01:56:18,279 --> 01:56:19,380
of "Next Level."

2691
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:21,179
We feel the same about your version too,

2692
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:22,948
so there is no need to bring us down like that.

2693
01:56:22,949 --> 01:56:24,250
They didn't back down.

2694
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:26,419
Just as you are confident,

2695
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:27,948
we are confident.

2696
01:56:27,949 --> 01:56:29,020
Of course.

2697
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,488
It just makes no sense.

2698
01:56:30,489 --> 01:56:31,818
(What will become of the negotiation for the SM match?)

2699
01:56:31,819 --> 01:56:34,130
(To be continued)

2700
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:36,430
You need to copy the rivalling crew's dance.

2701
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:38,760
We had to make a dance they couldn't copy.

2702
01:56:38,859 --> 01:56:40,198
We pushed our bodies...

2703
01:56:40,199 --> 01:56:41,770
to shake them up.

2704
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:43,899
Does the dance suit the song?

2705
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:46,599
They just made something we couldn't copy easily.

2706
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,710
We choreographed the dance they couldn't pull off.

2707
01:56:48,739 --> 01:56:49,869
You wouldn't be able to do it.

2708
01:56:50,739 --> 01:56:52,140
We yielded and gave them what they wanted.

2709
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:53,779
- We aren't exactly proud. - Seriously.

2710
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:56,149
Their dance style is completely different.

2711
01:56:56,479 --> 01:56:58,720
They would struggle with this kind of dance.

2712
01:56:59,449 --> 01:57:02,420
(1MILLION practices Wolf'Lo's dance copy section.)

2713
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,720
(Staggering)

2714
01:57:03,721 --> 01:57:04,959
Where is the groove?

2715
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,119
This is so hard.

2716
01:57:07,789 --> 01:57:09,260
Gosh, I can't do this.

2717
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,630
Gosh, how is this possible?

2718
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:14,769
- Lia. - Lia.

2719
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:17,000
It seemed like Lia's soul had left her body.

2720
01:57:17,069 --> 01:57:19,470
I was angry with myself.

2721
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:22,270
I was at my limit.

2722
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:25,908
I was worried about the team.

2723
01:57:25,909 --> 01:57:27,179
What do we do now?

2724
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:28,250
Will we be able to do it?

2725
01:57:29,149 --> 01:57:31,419
(MANNEQUEEN and JAM REPUBLIC continue to meet in a bad way.)

2726
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:34,050
We added techniques in order to win.

2727
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,988
(Unbelievable.)

2728
01:57:36,989 --> 01:57:38,359
How are we going to do this?

2729
01:57:38,989 --> 01:57:40,590
(Recording the performance)

2730
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:50,229
(During the rehearsal, LaTrice gets injured.)

2731
01:57:54,939 --> 01:57:58,010
Is there an option for us to forfeit?

2732
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:00,609
I can't wait to go home.

2733
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:03,350
It's done.

2734
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,049
(Next week, the first crew will get eliminated.)

2735
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:10,090
The first crew that will sadly leave the fight zone is...

2736
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:14,289
(Which crew will get eliminated 1st on Street Woman Fighter 2?)

2737
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:18,600
They lost by a small margin.
