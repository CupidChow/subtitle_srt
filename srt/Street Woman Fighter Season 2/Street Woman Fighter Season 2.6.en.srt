1
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,058
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,859
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,960
The members of 1MILLION...

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,370
thought that I'd lead and guide them...

5
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,198
as a leader should...

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,299
when I first entered the fight zone.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,740
But...

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,840
Don't feel too burdened by it. It's all right.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,009
Instead, they gave me courage and power to fight.

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,850
They were the ones who guided me.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,490
What do I want to say to them?

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,560
Yoonji.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,530
I'm thankful yet apologetic.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,859
One could even call her the second leader.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,500
She's tenacious,

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,229
and she meticulously checks everything.

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,199
That's good.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,669
I believe that she helps me in many ways.

19
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,280
But I rarely got to tell her,

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,139
"Thank you,"

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,208
and "You did great," which makes me feel sorry.

22
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,849
(I'm sorry that I didn't express much.)

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,819
(Funky Y thanked the crew members in writing.)

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,030
I usually have a hard time when things get emotional.

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,890
Why are you crying?

26
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,858
But Vessi is always there to pat me on the back.

27
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,929
What's wrong?

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,329
She comforts me too. I'm always grateful.

29
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,839
From the moment I started Wolf'Lo, all the members...

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,739
glow in my eyes.

31
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,139
I'm grateful for them, and they're lovely...

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,680
Maybe not lovely.

33
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,049
Before...

34
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,718
I was on Street Woman Fighter 2...

35
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,089
Don't cover your face.

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,389
I didn't nag at them this much.

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,590
You need to go harder!

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,590
But I nagged at them more as I was eager.

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,359
I just want them to know that it was out of love.

40
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,729
You can't nag at someone unless you love them.

41
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,000
So, I hope they understand.

42
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,939
(Please know my sincerity!)

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,840
I love being around the girls.

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,979
It makes more sense, the more we work together.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,219
I'm thankful for every mission,

46
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,250
every minute that we're together.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,719
So, I love you, girls.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,090
I'm extremely proud...

49
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,159
of every single one of you.

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,430
Now, I have hope that we can continue to do better.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,110
You've gone through so much...

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,269
because of this short-tempered leader.

53
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,739
And I want to thank you.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,639
(I want to thank you.)

55
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,209
(What's the final result of the Mega Crew Mission, )

56
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,579
(where two crews will be eliminated?)

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,689
(Which crews will be eliminated?)

58
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,020
(Hwasa has come to meet the dancers.)

59
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,489
(The fifth mission is to make a draft for Hwasa's new song.)

60
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,629
This has to be mine.

61
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,729
(Benefits for the champion)

62
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,669
(A 50,000-dollar prize)

63
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:19,568
(Diamond rings for the champions from amondz)

64
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,209
Here are two ways to take part...

65
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,710
in voting for the crew performances.

66
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,809
One,

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,348
you can go to the app or homepage for Mnet Plus...

68
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,849
to vote for the best crew.

69
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,878
Of eight crews that performed with their songs,

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,020
vote for the crew that you think performed best.

71
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,319
You can vote once a day...

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,989
every day until October 31, at 6 p.m.,

73
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,929
which is the live broadcast of the final round.

74
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,229
And you can vote for multiple teams.

75
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Two,

76
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:48,029
go to the official channel for Street Woman Fighter 2,

77
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,339
click like on the video of your favourite performance,

78
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,840
and watch the video to the end.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,269
Vote for the crew that will be number one in the global rank.

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,409
(To be continued shortly)

81
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,649
The signature mission of Mnet's original dance series,

82
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,878
the Mega Crew Mission.

83
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,749
Deep N Dap and JAM REPUBLIC have chosen the outdoor theme,

84
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,589
and JAM REPUBLIC won the extra points.

85
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,519
Between 1MILLION and MANNEQUEEN that chose the structure theme,

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,330
1MILLION won the extra points.

87
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,860
Next, the crews that chose the all-gender theme.

88
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,429
Among LADYBOUNCE, BEBE, and Wolf'Lo,

89
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,370
I will announce LADYBOUNCE's score from the fight judges.

90
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,670
(Feeling very nervous)

91
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,768
Hello!

92
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:27,838
(LADYBOUNCE's first practice)

93
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,378
I know you're all very talented and busy.

94
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,078
Thank you so much for coming.

95
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,679
- Thank you so much! - Thank you.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,649
This is our first attempt at a mega crew performance.

97
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,079
We've only performed in small groups,

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,018
and I believe...

99
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,990
that one of our strengths is perfect teamwork.

100
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,028
But I want even those 50 male dancers...

101
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,160
to look like the crew members of LADYBOUNCE.

102
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,429
I wanted to create a performance...

103
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,670
that could bring all these people together as one.

104
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,869
But LADYBOUNCE is only good when there are five people.

105
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,068
If there are other dancers...

106
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,879
We might not be in sync and look a little off.

107
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,310
The dancers in the back, can you go higher?

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,708
Boom.

109
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,849
Boom, chikita.

110
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,250
Boom, chikita.

111
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,449
Turn.

112
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,449
This looks kind of funny.

113
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,519
Not exactly 90 degrees. Go lower.

114
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,889
Go lower.

115
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,490
Excuse me.

116
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,529
One more time. Boom.

117
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:22,759
Start.

118
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,060
(They practice the part again.)

119
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,000
Why does this look funny?

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,069
(Contemplating)

121
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,539
(The overall director was watching.)

122
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,970
- Going from here looks cooler. - Okay.

123
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,708
I think we can slightly adjust the lines.

124
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,679
Let's move on, then.

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,750
- Seven, eight. - Just a second.

126
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,648
The ones in the front row look very different.

127
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:47,948
You should give them feedback.

128
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,350
Let's run that again.

129
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,318
Should they go like this or that?

130
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,489
You need to decide.

131
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,789
The ones on the floor...

132
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,698
Though we have part directors,

133
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,499
the quality of the performance is based on my confirmation.

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,539
I guess I was pressured to place first...

135
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,268
with that performance.

136
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,409
- The b-boys should be here soon. - You're right.

137
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,269
They're coming. When we sing.

138
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,778
Did they teach you your parts?

139
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,479
- They did. - Let's practice that as we wait.

140
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,309
Yes, I should.

141
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,508
Seven, eight.

142
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,148
Your foot should be here on eight.

143
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,278
Can you do that?

144
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,448
I'm a little slow, but let me try it again.

145
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,750
Let's run it again.

146
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,489
As I'm the overall director,

147
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,290
I was burdened by the fact that I had to lead 51 people.

148
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,999
It must have weighed heavy on NOB.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,829
She wasn't originally the leader, so...

150
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,100
We had a leader back then.

151
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,939
(NOB, Vessi, the leader, and Biggy)

152
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,809
She left,

153
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,278
and we were in chaos.

154
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,909
What we decided to do was do it without a leader.

155
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,778
We divided our work...

156
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,018
and tried it that way.

157
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,648
It took some time to find what was right for each one...

158
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,518
and what type of person should be the leader.

159
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,119
I've always been the performance director.

160
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,990
- Right. - So, it was natural.

161
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,388
"I have to be a good leader. I must lead them!"

162
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,759
I was obsessed by that thought.

163
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,629
Can we start the third part?

164
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:07,929
A little closer.

165
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,999
(They practice Biggy's part.)

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,470
(I'm watching.)

167
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,899
There.

168
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,810
No. What's wrong?

169
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,469
How long do I stay there?

170
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,008
(She steps up to pick the timing as the overall director.)

171
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,438
"On fire," at the end.

172
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,279
But that's way too long.

173
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,349
That was the part I told you about.

174
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,220
Then, what are we doing as we wait?

175
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,019
Like this. It's not that long.

176
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,188
You want to spend two more hits?

177
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,490
It should be three hits after.

178
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,458
We need to have them leave in the middle.

179
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,789
Right. Let's check it out.

180
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,229
(They can't come to an agreement.)

181
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,698
What I had in mind...

182
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,139
and what she had in mind were a bit different.

183
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,870
What kind of attitude should it be?

184
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,609
I want you to come forward after dancing.

185
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,179
Let me think about that.

186
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,378
- I thought of it today. - But...

187
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,508
- I thought of it today. - But...

188
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,949
I doubt that we'll have time for that.

189
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,519
(Looking)

190
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,420
Time to dance, I mean.

191
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,859
I normally have a lot of opinions.

192
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,388
So, NOB and I have a slight war of nerve...

193
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,129
whenever we practice.

194
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,869
We can't really see it as it's on the first count.

195
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,439
(The two have always had conflicts of opinions.)

196
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,110
(But can they do it when they're not used to it?)

197
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,180
(Even when they were practicing with the helpers, )

198
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,750
(they had different opinions.)

199
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,750
Do you get what I mean?

200
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,018
When I suggested something as a leader,

201
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,628
I wanted them to trust me and follow my lead.

202
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,599
When she was negative and had different opinions,

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,029
I was disappointed.

204
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,199
(In the studio with the helpers gone)

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,039
I thought it'd be fun.

206
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,209
I thought it'd be physically tough...

207
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,768
for practicing all night.

208
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,178
I didn't expect it to be emotionally challenging.

209
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,908
It was tough for me.

210
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,080
I had a hard time.

211
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,509
What was tough?

212
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,019
It was just a lot of pressure.

213
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,019
The performance is completed based on my confirmation.

214
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,289
What I confirm should look cool.

215
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,360
I guess that put pressure on me.

216
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,399
I could sense the heavy weight.

217
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,729
And our attitude should have changed when we had a leader,

218
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,639
but it didn't, so I felt sorry.

219
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,109
Can you see it from there?

220
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,470
Should I make it straight?

221
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,878
- I relied on her a lot as well. - Or we can...

222
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,279
It lessened the burden to be able to ask.

223
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,048
I decided to support her better.

224
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:42,849
(Biggy understood the pressure and responsibility of NOB.)

225
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,959
- I'll take a look. - Can you count them in?

226
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,459
Five, six, seven, eight.

227
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,028
My head hurts.

228
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,628
- Maybe we should step back. - What?

229
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,500
Can we all take a couple of steps back?

230
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,369
Glucose candy.

231
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,470
(The members of LADYBOUNCE help each other out.)

232
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,798
It's necessary to our theme.

233
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,340
This is the first draft.

234
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,109
We cut them so that it's easier to dance.

235
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,609
Does it look cool? Does it suit the theme?

236
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,610
(Warrior Vessi)

237
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,809
We on fire!

238
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,179
Let's take a look.

239
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,950
Every part of the performance was created by us.

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,289
It was handmade from head to toe.

241
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,990
We put our hearts into this performance.

242
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,360
Valkyrie is what LADYBOUNCE represents.

243
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,798
"For Valhalla."

244
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,969
That means to fight to the death.

245
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,699
We put everything down in every performance,

246
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,740
and that seems similar to Valkyrie's will.

247
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,469
We were able to get through it...

248
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,610
as all these people worked together.

249
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,950
So, I'm very thankful for the helpers.

250
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,079
We were a crew that was capable of showing people...

251
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,518
from 100 to 1,000 percent of our skills...

252
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,490
whatever situation we were in.

253
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,730
I'm glad that we took a step forward as a team.

254
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,500
I think it'll be more distinctive than any other crew.

255
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,428
Let's watch the video of LADYBOUNCE's...

256
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,928
Mega Crew Mission.

257
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,168
- Let's go. - Let's go, LADYBOUNCE.

258
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,638
Let's go!

259
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,440
(Screaming)

260
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,378
Let's go!

261
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,379
(Petting)

262
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:17,080
(Mega Crew Mission, LADYBOUNCE)

263
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,729
Female warriors.

264
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,029
That's so cool.

265
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,798
(Self-produced music, "Immigrant,")

266
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,839
(self-produced voice, and "Welcome to the Party")

267
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,969
(Using the theme of Valkyrie, the female warrior...)

268
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,168
(that fights for Odin to death, they portrayed, "For Valhalla,")

269
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,408
(which also means to fight to the death, )

270
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,740
(and they showed their identity of dancing their hearts out.)

271
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,699
The details.

272
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,759
(It's so detailed.)

273
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,128
- The angles are perfect. - They have amazing teamwork.

274
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,830
It's what they're good at.

275
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,919
Scary!

276
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,690
I like this part.

277
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,039
Let's go, NOB.

278
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,779
They're so cool.

279
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,768
I love this angle.

280
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,869
A flying kick.

281
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,509
They look like video game characters.

282
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,808
(Ta-Da)

283
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,580
Capri!

284
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,148
- So cute. - Adorable!

285
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,750
The baby warrior, Capri.

286
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,619
She's so cute.

287
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,419
Adorable!

288
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,418
It was supposed to be cool.

289
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,690
(Disappointed)

290
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,658
Biggy!

291
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,929
Let's go, Biggy.

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,398
This part is so cool.

293
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,529
I absolutely love this part.

294
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,860
- They're perfectly in sync. - And perfectly aligned.

295
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,490
I like this part.

296
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,388
- Great. - That was cool.

297
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,689
Yes, it was cool.

298
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,830
- Good job. - Nice!

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,129
Great work.

300
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,730
That was great.

301
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,029
That was cool. I liked it.

302
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,799
How do you dance so perfectly in sync?

303
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:09,039
- They're warriors. - They're true warriors.

304
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,638
- We did well! - We did well!

305
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,610
- Great work, guys. - Well done.

306
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,450
Look at their outfits. Where did they get it?

307
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Hey.

308
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,350
- That's a clear theme. - Right.

309
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,819
Let's go!

310
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,219
Simple is best.

311
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,720
Certainly.

312
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,629
- Gosh. - That's interesting.

313
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,888
- Valkyrie! - Interesting.

314
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,158
Interesting.

315
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,899
"I'm the hero."

316
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,669
That's like a proper human wave attack.

317
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,369
LADYBOUNCE.

318
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,610
That was so interesting.

319
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,969
- They are Korean, right? - They are.

320
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,439
The directors of LADYBOUNCE are NOB, Vessi, and Biggy.

321
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,950
Let's now find out how the fight judges scored them.

322
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,720
Gosh, please.

323
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,019
I feel sick.

324
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,789
I just want to get it over with.

325
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,888
It's not our score,

326
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,128
- so why am I so nervous? - I know.

327
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,159
I think the scores are going to be pretty high.

328
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,159
- For who? - All of them.

329
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,029
The one who did the intro would get a high score.

330
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,999
(Nervous)

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,699
(NOB: 368 points, Vessi: 377 points, Bigg: 370 points)

332
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,538
(NOB: 368 points, Vessi: 377 points, Bigg: 370 points)

333
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:17,809
That's good.

334
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,709
Great work, guys.

335
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,909
(They seem satisfied.)

336
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,109
Nice job!

337
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,749
That's high.

338
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,880
They got high scores.

339
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,419
That's really high.

340
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
(Wolf'Lo is surprised.)

341
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,219
(Gasping)

342
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,960
Vessi who directed the intro got a really high score.

343
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,258
But their leader got the lowest score.

344
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,359
She must be upset.

345
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,929
Vessi got the highest score of 377 points,

346
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,440
and NOB got the lowest score of 368 points.

347
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,710
They didn't change the formation even once here.

348
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,838
- They stuck to it... - Right.

349
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,538
- which was satisfying. - Yes.

350
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,379
It was well-balanced.

351
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,749
I didn't find the genre difficult to understand...

352
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,250
or their performance awkward.

353
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,589
It's like they were dancing to complete one choreography.

354
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,159
About NOB's part. Do you know roll-offs?

355
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,159
- Dancing at different times. - I see.

356
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,659
If you do that multiple times,

357
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,629
you end up dancing less.

358
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,598
You shouldn't do a lot of roll-offs just for the choreography.

359
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,969
There's no reason.

360
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,640
There has to be a reason to do that.

361
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,108
Honestly, it's a little disappointing.

362
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:26,038
But what I consider the most important...

363
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,778
in a dance performance...

364
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,709
is the beginning and the end.

365
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,319
We got high scores for that, and I'm glad.

366
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,989
Our scores were high overall,

367
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,220
and that's satisfactory enough.

368
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,189
However, this isn't over yet.

369
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,389
Wolf'Lo and BEBE also chose the same theme,

370
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,429
and their performances will be compared.

371
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,430
Which crew will win the extra 100 points?

372
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,700
- Exactly. Who will it be? - I can't wait.

373
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,038
The competition is fierce.

374
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,240
Seriously.

375
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,109
(Sighing)

376
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,180
Next, let's see how the fight judges scored BEBE.

377
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,348
BEBE is up.

378
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,379
(Nervous)

379
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,919
This crew reminds me of my own.

380
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,690
We don't have much information about each member.

381
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,159
BEBE's directors are Bada, Tatter, and Lusher.

382
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Tatter and Lusher must've been under a lot of pressure.

383
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:24,268
They had to get out of Bada's shadow.

384
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,569
(Holding hands)

385
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,699
I based my decision on...

386
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,108
your originality and choreographic skills.

387
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,079
And I chose Lusher and Tatter.

388
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,179
I've worked with them the longest,

389
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,548
and they're the ones I can rely on.

390
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,348
- They're the core members of BEBE. - Exactly.

391
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,920
The older ones.

392
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,989
It's about time BEBE did something new.

393
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,229
Lusher and Tatter have to prove themselves here.

394
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,189
First of all, our theme is a nightmare.

395
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,930
My dance piece...

396
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,328
(Screaming)

397
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,130
includes a lot of technical moves, which is its strong point.

398
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,139
I tried so many different things.

399
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,439
The story is that we start having a nightmare.

400
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,640
I wanted to express an abrupt change.

401
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,680
I'm in charge of the last part, and we decided to use a prop.

402
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,618
It's like a bedsheet.

403
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,818
You have nightmares when you're asleep.

404
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,490
Can we try the original hand move one more time?

405
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,389
I've never used a sheet for a choreography before.

406
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,390
This is my first time,

407
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,889
and I put a lot of thought into it.

408
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,230
I wanted to do it well...

409
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,299
so everyone would be like, "How did they come up with that?"

410
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,029
(Crawling)

411
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,900
(Comfortable)

412
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,999
Slowly. In 5, 6, 7, 8.

413
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,069
Should we just go in?

414
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,808
Hello!

415
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:38,839
(Stunned)

416
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,409
- Hello! - Stop for a minute.

417
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,509
Young J!

418
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,479
(The crew that wrote a new chapter in the Mega Crew Mission history)

419
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,189
(Just Jerk: 2,384 points, 1st place)

420
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,489
(Just Jerk, the master of the Mega Crew Mission)

421
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,220
What? What are you doing here?

422
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,758
- We're all here. - What are you guys doing here?

423
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,429
For about 5 or 6 years,

424
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,058
I've been working as an instructor at Just Jerk's dance academy.

425
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,298
They let my crew use their studio to practice...

426
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,999
our Mega Crew Mission performance.

427
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,669
So we were practicing, and they just showed up.

428
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,640
(A special performance for their boss and landlord)

429
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,508
(Enjoying the show as an audience)

430
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:16,049
I only saw a small part of it, but it was cool.

431
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,349
Bada's facial expressions and acting are always so good.

432
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,088
(Applauding)

433
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,220
This is going to be great.

434
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,659
(Young J and HOWL seem to be satisfied with the performance.)

435
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,689
It was cool.

436
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,190
When you did this, I got goosebumps.

437
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,759
I'm glad.

438
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,358
Young J won the Mega Crew Mission, and I got some energy from him.

439
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,460
It was a big help.

440
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,069
It made me feel more confident.

441
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,499
(It's the day when they showcase their performance.)

442
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,269
Everyone, let me catch you up with the changes.

443
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,209
You can't control me.

444
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,838
Your hands should be over your forehead.

445
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,650
What else did we change?

446
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,609
Have we covered all the changes?

447
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,118
I wasn't even sure if we were doing the right thing.

448
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,619
I was just all over the place.

449
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,289
- Did you get some sleep? - No.

450
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,389
- You didn't? - I can barely keep my eyes open.

451
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,390
(What happened to BEBE?)

452
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,258
Is this the number of votes we got?

453
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,328
We got six of them. Does that mean they all think we'll lose?

454
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:05,899
All the other crews think we'll lose?

455
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,028
(All the other crews picked BEBE as the one they expect to lose.)

456
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:10,768
(BEBE has been chosen by 6 crews as the crew they expect to lose.)

457
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,139
Because BEBE won the last mission,

458
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,268
- I think they lowered their guard. - Did they get complacent?

459
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,909
- My expectations were really high. - Yes.

460
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,379
Because they got all-gender and they're already so swaggy.

461
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,509
So I thought it'd be really good.

462
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,720
I wonder if INGYOO was happy with this choreography.

463
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,048
I know, right?

464
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,889
- It's K-pop. It has to be better. - Exactly.

465
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,588
If it was something that goes beyond their achievements so far,

466
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,319
I'd have nothing but respect for them.

467
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,329
This is a lot.

468
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
(All the other crews criticized BEBE's performance.)

469
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,799
All the other crews picked us as the one they expect to lose.

470
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,039
This is quite serious.

471
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,169
The way I see it, the one who's responsible...

472
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,139
is Bada, the overall director.

473
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,578
- Yes, she's responsible. - Yes.

474
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,839
Apparently, this was out of her depth.

475
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:55,848
For some reason, we're always harsh on BEBE.

476
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,578
No, we complimented them a lot when they did well.

477
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,219
We praised Bada then.

478
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,119
I never thought Bada would be the worst director.

479
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,818
I wonder what happened. Maybe the job was too hard for her.

480
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,319
(Bada got the most votes as the worst director.)

481
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,630
It crushed my self-esteem.

482
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,559
Everyone was saying it was bad.

483
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,559
I was no longer sure what I wanted to show people through this mission.

484
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,199
We were never cocky,

485
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,039
but it was looking like we were.

486
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:22,009
This is so upsetting.

487
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,609
I'm sorry to you all.

488
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,608
We did what we wanted to do,

489
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,379
but this is the result we got after all...

490
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,210
along with such bad feedback.

491
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:35,250
(They can't help crying because of the unexpected result.)

492
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,720
Get it together.

493
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,588
(Bada was the most shocked.)

494
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,318
I was really worried about her.

495
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,390
Bada cried so much.

496
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,329
Her eyes got all puffy.

497
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,528
I was on the verge of breaking down.

498
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,029
I tried so hard to pull myself together.

499
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,929
We only had a day to change the choreography...

500
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,199
we'd practiced for a month,

501
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,170
and it wasn't even a whole day. We only had several hours.

502
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm not sure. This is too risky.

503
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:01,548
It's not easy to schedule a practice session...

504
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,049
just a few hours before.

505
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,179
We couldn't get everyone.

506
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,048
We had to change the choreography the best way we could.

507
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,749
I didn't even get a wink of sleep.

508
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,160
(They kept practicing until until the shoot.)

509
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,319
Everyone, get to your places.

510
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,689
What's the number, Lusher?

511
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,028
- It's 2.5. - Let's make it 2.

512
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,029
- Okay. - What about you?

513
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,769
Hang on. Give me ten seconds to think.

514
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,538
(Bada, the overall director, seems to have a troubled mind.)

515
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,839
What are you most confused about?

516
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,839
No, it's not that.

517
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,049
I was so anxious. I was anxious and scared thinking,

518
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,079
"Can I do this? Is this the right way?"

519
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,619
(Her uncertainty of her own choreography grows deeper.)

520
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,160
Did you fall in the same direction?

521
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,828
Please make sure you don't fall in the same direction.

522
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,190
I wanted to help her in any way I could,

523
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,500
and I knew I had to pull myself together.

524
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:55,299
After all, this is BEBE's performance,

525
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,799
and we're the directors.

526
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:00,369
We should share the responsibility.

527
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,439
When the second verse begins,

528
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,240
could you change the colours of the lights?

529
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,808
You're doing great, guys. Let's just watch the angle.

530
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,048
Thank you again.

531
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,579
(She does her job as the director and covers for Bada.)

532
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,149
We've got to protect our leader.

533
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,220
It's our job to protect her.

534
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,220
I'm really sorry to say this,

535
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,890
but I feel so insecure right now.

536
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,089
Come on.

537
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,318
What do we do?

538
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,589
- No, Bada. - Hey.

539
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,230
Bada.

540
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,099
Bada Lee.

541
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,459
Believe in yourself.

542
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,730
You really should. Okay?

543
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,798
I was losing my mind,

544
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,609
but then I realized my teammates were standing by me.

545
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,779
We just did our jobs quietly.

546
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,249
Bada always says,

547
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,019
"If I fall apart, you'll all fall apart."

548
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,119
But the way I see it, we're much stronger than she thinks.

549
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,359
I realized it.

550
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,789
I would've been lost without the girls.

551
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,429
I was able to push through only because they were.

552
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,000
Now, even if I fall apart,

553
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,930
they won't fall apart.

554
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,440
You should move more quickly.

555
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,608
(Thanks to her teammates, Bada picked herself up.)

556
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,670
Thanks.

557
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,078
Guys, the third verse is the climax.

558
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,349
I know your legs will be tired, but please do your best.

559
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,210
Tap your legs a little.

560
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:18,818
I was so grateful to them.

561
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:22,420
This isn't something I can do by myself,

562
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,389
and I shouldn't have tried to do it by myself.

563
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,059
That's what I realized.

564
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,390
If your hands start to shake,

565
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,390
put some chocolate in your mouth.

566
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,559
The other dancers encouraged us as well.

567
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,369
Come on, don't be like that.

568
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,700
They helped us get through it.

569
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,400
You guys are much better off.

570
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,539
If it was Vata, he would've tortured everyone.

571
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:46,680
To all 23 of the gentlemen who have helped us.

572
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,909
I know we didn't do a very good job as directors.

573
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,980
Thank you for your patience...

574
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,848
and being with us throughout this journey.

575
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:57,249
I know it must've been hard. Thank you so much!

576
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,559
Thank you!

577
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:00,660
We gave it our all.

578
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,029
Our identity is reflected in this performance.

579
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,659
This is our work.

580
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,858
Let's wait and see what happens.

581
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:07,859
Okay.

582
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:15,309
Now, let's watch BEBE's Mega Crew performance.

583
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
(Nervous)

584
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,509
It's okay.

585
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,680
Wait, what?

586
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,539
They collaborated with WeDemBoyz.

587
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,880
- You've worked with them too. - I have.

588
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,909
(WeDemBoyz and HOOK performed together...)

589
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,750
(for the Muse of Street Man Fighter.)

590
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,349
I'm a little jealous.

591
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:29,949
What?

592
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,018
They chose a song by an EXO member.

593
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:34,490
- A song by BAEKHYUN. - Bada picked this song?

594
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,529
They danced to only one song?

595
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:37,929
(That's exciting.)

596
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,930
I'm excited.

597
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:43,000
(Mega Crew Mission, BEBE)

598
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,250
(What's going on?)

599
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,920
I wonder what that means.

600
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,818
- Nightmare. - It's their theme.

601
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:02,249
("Psycho" by BAEKHYUN)

602
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,588
(They depict a struggle...)

603
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:04,989
(where you can't tell if it's a nightmare or reality.)

604
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,759
- Wake up. - Wake up.

605
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,109
They're hugging.

606
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,690
Are they WeDemBoyz?

607
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,618
They're the only crew...

608
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,289
who did a pair dance with male dancers.

609
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,369
(Impressed)

610
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,039
Nice teamwork.

611
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,359
I like that move.

612
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,859
That's cool.

613
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
Their dance is incredibly clean.

614
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,069
It's so clean.

615
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,589
I love this part.

616
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,689
- I really like this part. - Me too.

617
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,359
I think Tatter will get a high score.

618
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,059
They used the lights well.

619
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:40,539
That's too close.

620
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,449
What are they doing?

621
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,680
INGYOO and Tatter.

622
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,619
They're acting.

623
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,758
(Copying the move)

624
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,000
How do they come up with iconic moves like that?

625
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,269
I want to get up on her back too.

626
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,210
Here we go!

627
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,508
There.

628
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,750
When did she get there?

629
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,519
How are they doing it?

630
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,799
That's great, Kyma.

631
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,429
They all have expressive faces.

632
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,599
Fantastic facial expressions.

633
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,230
Let's go.

634
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,249
It's really absorbing.

635
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,049
- They're perfectly in sync. - Yes.

636
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,599
- That was amazing. - All right.

637
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,440
I got goosebumps.

638
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,308
That was cool.

639
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,740
It's very sentimental.

640
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,578
Great work, guys.

641
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:24,579
(We all did well.)

642
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,419
BEBE, thank you for your performance.

643
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,819
Let's now find out the directors' scores now.

644
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,390
It's their scores I'm interested in more than anyone else's.

645
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,029
They tried something so new.

646
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,758
I'm not sure.

647
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,299
I can't predict their scores.

648
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,430
Bada will probably get the highest score, right?

649
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,000
I liked Lusher's work.

650
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,470
- The last part. - The last part.

651
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:48,769
I've been clenching my jaw so hard that it hurts.

652
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:50,940
They're acting.

653
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,440
- They went for something deep. - Gosh.

654
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,349
(Surprised)

655
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,609
That's interesting.

656
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,380
I love the facial expressions too.

657
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,220
It's like their expressions are part of the choreography.

658
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,849
- Like they're lost in the dream. - You're right.

659
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,059
I think it's terrific.

660
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,459
But when I see...

661
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,359
a brilliant idea like this, it's important how they finish it.

662
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,990
I wasn't entirely happy with the finish.

663
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,730
I mean, did they have to pull away the sheet?

664
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,429
I was absolutely captivated at the beginning,

665
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,868
but they lost me later on.

666
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:20,268
The ending needed to be stronger.

667
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,739
The blows had to get more and more powerful...

668
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,038
as they went.

669
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,008
They could've torn the sheet or shined a light through it.

670
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,750
They could've burned it or held onto it and climbed it.

671
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,250
- It was a bit disappointing. - More aggressive.

672
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,019
Let's see the scores of BEBE's directors.

673
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:41,059
LADYBOUNCE is in the lead.

674
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,229
(Bada: 360, Tatter: 360, Lusher: 367)

675
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,259
From the fight judges, BEBE's directors earned...

676
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,529
a total of 1,087 points.

677
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,430
Good job.

678
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,369
- Good job. - Good job.

679
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,439
Of the three directors,

680
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,769
Tatter got the highest score of 367 points.

681
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,039
Bada and Lusher got the lowest score of 360 points.

682
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:03,649
Tatter's choreography was the cleanest.

683
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,348
It looked like Bada gave up some of her ideas...

684
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:08,749
to make their theme easier to understand.

685
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,388
She opened the door to a better understanding of the story.

686
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,119
I think she sacrificed herself as the director.

687
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,989
First of all,

688
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,929
I actually...

689
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,440
(Looking at the score, she feels a surge of emotions again.)

690
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,839
Everyone worked so hard.

691
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,110
They all worked so hard.

692
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,639
Yes.

693
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,610
(Bada feels a wave of emotions as she remembers what happened.)

694
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,679
I feel bad about my score,

695
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:45,050
but I realized I have a long way to go as a director.

696
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,118
Also, I'd like to thank the members...

697
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,630
that worked hard together.

698
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,090
Let's see.

699
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,969
That's it.

700
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,738
(Knowing the meaning of her tears, they root for her wholeheartedly.)

701
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:01,940
This is heartwarming.

702
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,939
- Now it's the last team. - It's our turn.

703
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,379
We will now reveal the fight judges' scores...

704
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,550
of Wolf'Lo's Mega Crew Mission.

705
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,449
- I'm curious. - I wonder what they thought.

706
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,348
I expect Wolf'Lo to show strong characteristics.

707
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,288
I wonder if they'll perform the way I expect them to,

708
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:20,288
or if they will try something new and unexpected.

709
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,460
I can't wait to see it.

710
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,928
I believe preparing for the Mega Crew Mission...

711
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,400
was the toughest out of all the missions so far.

712
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,969
(What happened to Wolf'Lo?)

713
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,670
(During the Mega Crew Mission)

714
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,698
- The directors? - Yes.

715
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,209
The directors are all sitting on the sofa.

716
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,709
How did that happen?

717
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,178
I'm not worried.

718
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,379
I believed the members with more experience...

719
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,280
should be the directors.

720
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:47,719
I don't doubt our directors at all.

721
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:48,948
(During the first practice for the Mega Crew Mission)

722
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,848
The hip-hop dancers are here!

723
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,018
- Let's go, hip-hop! - Let's go!

724
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,658
Let's go!

725
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:59,198
Meeting so many dancers for the first time in a while,

726
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,598
it feels like we're at an event.

727
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,629
I'm so happy.

728
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,268
Our helper dancers...

729
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,670
are the families we danced hip-hop with.

730
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,440
Uptown Family, A Million Rockface, Mini Fam,

731
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,078
SOLSOW, and RIVERS CREW are here.

732
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,309
(All the hot hip-hop dancers are here.)

733
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,779
Hip-hop dancer DROP is also here.

734
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,509
(Hip-hop dancer DROP is also here.)

735
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,710
Come on out here.

736
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,019
(Baby Sleek looks shy for some reason.)

737
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,619
It's Baby Sleek's husband.

738
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,618
He's the man I live with.

739
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,230
I really live with him.

740
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,489
(Baby Sleek, DROP)

741
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,429
Will you marry me?

742
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,069
(Baby Sleek and DROP got married in 2015.)

743
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,598
(A real family within the hip-hop families)

744
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,999
I am so grateful for you all.

745
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,639
I was once a helper dancer.

746
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:49,808
I realized the importance of helpers as I performed as one.

747
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,049
We'll have to use our time...

748
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,980
trying to work together to create perfection.

749
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,189
The theme of our performance is thesis-antithesis-synthesis.

750
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,158
Thesis, the status quo,

751
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,030
antithesis, the conflict,

752
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,199
and synthesis, the harmony we find through the conflict.

753
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,300
We will show you a performance no other crew can.

754
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,368
Please continue your hard work today.

755
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,198
Since we put together a lot of the first song yesterday,

756
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,908
we'll go through that,

757
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:20,379
and learn the routing for the second song.

758
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,908
Imagine you are crossing a rope and move your body weight.

759
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,848
We were supposed to finish the 1st song by 2 p.m.

760
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,849
What time is it now? Okay, got it.

761
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,888
We were too tight on time.

762
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:35,459
We only have the dancers for a certain amount of time.

763
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,329
We have to divide that time.

764
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,558
Did we move to the left?

765
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,698
What did we do?

766
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:42,368
- This is what we did yesterday. - Like that?

767
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:43,829
I'd like to change that.

768
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,300
I want to change that.

769
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,098
Let's start with our right foot. One.

770
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,169
(Baby Sleek ends up changing the choreography.)

771
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,869
Two. The people in the back will do the same thing.

772
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,908
They learned that yesterday, right?

773
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:53,940
Yes.

774
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,480
(Practice for Baby Sleek's part runs longer because of the change.)

775
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,909
Let's try that one more time.

776
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,678
(Looking serious)

777
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,489
You two will leave the stage without moving.

778
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,959
Everyone in Bobby's line,

779
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,860
don't move forward. You're in the second row.

780
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,229
We still aren't done practicing the first song?

781
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,399
It isn't over.

782
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,599
What are we going to do?

783
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,129
This is driving me crazy.

784
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,829
We haven't practiced the 2nd and 3rd songs.

785
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,439
The problem is she keeps changing the choreography.

786
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,169
She also tried to make changes early this morning.

787
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,210
She keeps making modifications.

788
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,479
Guys, Baby Sleek says she's changing the choreography.

789
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,980
Yes, I am.

790
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,049
It isn't very tricky.

791
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,009
I reassigned everyone,

792
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,118
so there is no one entering or leaving the stage.

793
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,119
Think of it as starting over today.

794
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,760
She's taking up other people's time slots to perfect her part.

795
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,888
It's driving me nuts right now.

796
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,129
The first song isn't our whole performance.

797
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,159
I know.

798
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,259
(Wolf'Lo plans the practice during break time.)

799
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,658
- Monday. - This is the practice schedule.

800
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,598
Finish the 1st song within 30 minutes or an hour.

801
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,499
I can't finish all the details within 30 minutes.

802
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,868
- We can't worry about that now. - No.

803
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,739
We haven't even started the 2nd and 3rd songs.

804
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:59,738
So you have to stop changing the moves.

805
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,638
- It's fixed. - Yes, it is.

806
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,779
You tried to make changes this morning.

807
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,049
I'm not going to change anything. It's set.

808
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,518
I'm talking about what happened yesterday.

809
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,448
What are you talking about? Anyway, it's set.

810
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,260
- I'm telling you can't change it. - Okay.

811
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,089
I won't make changes.

812
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,230
Okay, then it's all good.

813
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,429
Then...

814
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,300
Everyone was so sensitive.

815
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,670
They'd be judged for their parts.

816
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,598
They all felt the responsibility.

817
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,269
The weight must've been heavy.

818
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:35,110
I'm not trying to be uncooperative.

819
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,348
I was giving them time...

820
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:38,908
for the 2nd and 3rd songs.

821
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,050
They're hurt and sick.

822
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,989
(Halo hurt her foot during the practice period.)

823
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:47,259
(Chocol was getting treated for shingles.)

824
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,589
Chocol isn't feeling very well.

825
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,928
Please be understanding.

826
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:53,328
(They didn't have enough time to practice due to injuries.)

827
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:58,670
I was waiting for Halo and Chocol to get their choreography organized.

828
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,538
You kept seeing parts you needed to work on.

829
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,868
It happened every day.

830
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:08,238
You kept noticing parts that needed modification.

831
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,908
We didn't understand what you were thinking.

832
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:16,820
So we kept trying to tell you about the time we had.

833
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:21,718
It wasn't easy meeting halfway.

834
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,859
What was more important than talking was the mission.

835
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,198
I finally felt like we came to an understanding today.

836
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,399
We discussed it in length.

837
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,669
I believe we had issues...

838
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,399
because we all truly want to do our best...

839
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,739
in the Mega Crew Mission.

840
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,839
After putting this performance together,

841
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,138
I believe we will become better at working together,

842
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,280
rather than just dancing together.

843
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,419
I was sick,

844
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,078
but I could think with my head...

845
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,819
as long as I didn't overdo myself.

846
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,820
We practiced intensely.

847
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:58,158
I am confident...

848
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,630
we can show you a performance with depth that is one-of-a-kind.

849
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,670
I want to show the viewers what real street vibes are.

850
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,279
We will reveal the score of 1 of the 3 directors.

851
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,750
- Let's see. - I bet it's high.

852
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,178
- Get together. - It's the score of all six of us.

853
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,919
- You know that, right? - We all worked together.

854
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,718
(What is the first score of Wolf'Lo's to be revealed?)

855
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,848
(Baby Sleek: 375 points)

856
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:27,718
(Baby Sleek's fight judge score is 375 points.)

857
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,860
Is that mine?

858
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,260
Baby Sleek's fight judge score is 375 points.

859
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,928
Why did they show us mine?

860
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,169
Why was mine first?

861
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,069
Is that the highest score?

862
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,840
The tension is killing me.

863
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,109
We will now check out...

864
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,369
the Mega Crew Performance video of Wolf'Lo.

865
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,309
(Howling)

866
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,780
My eyes are already tearing up.

867
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,249
Are you choking up?

868
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,449
(Nodding)

869
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,449
(Mega Crew Mission, Wolf'Lo)

870
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,629
They're so cool.

871
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,960
They are hip-hop warriors.

872
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,029
The intro ends with K-pop.

873
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,230
It's connected.

874
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,840
(It continues from the ending of the K-pop Death match Mission.)

875
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,440
(The intro of Wolf'Lo's Mega Crew Mission)

876
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,089
(Choreography by Wolf'Lo)

877
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,788
(Wolf'Lo's Mega Crew Concept, A performance depicting...)

878
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,459
(thesis, the status quo, antithesis, the conflict, )

879
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,159
(and synthesis, the better status after overcoming the conflict)

880
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,388
This part.

881
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:10,629
I love this part.

882
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,928
- Look at their groove. - It's insane.

883
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:14,199
They look like a wave.

884
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:41,989
I like this part.

885
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,260
- She looks so cool running. - I know.

886
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,059
Haechi Wang!

887
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,590
(Gasping)

888
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,190
That's so cool.

889
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,698
(Gasping)

890
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,428
Nice.

891
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:56,630
I got goosebumps.

892
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:18,948
Fly, Yeni Cho.

893
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,059
B-boy Cho.

894
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,019
She's so light on her feet.

895
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,859
- That was so good. - It was cool.

896
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,158
- I loved it. - They were amazing.

897
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,759
- So cool. - It was so good.

898
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,959
- They killed it. - It was amazing.

899
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,030
So cool.

900
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,968
We all did great.

901
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:04,969
We're the best.

902
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:06,599
It was so cool.

903
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:08,599
You guys are cool.

904
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,840
- I actually liked it. - Yes, I really liked it.

905
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,839
I love this beginning.

906
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,880
It's so good.

907
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,179
It's so cool. Look at that.

908
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,749
You can't say someone has the wrong angle,

909
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,018
or someone was wrong.

910
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:22,888
It just looks cool that way.

911
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:24,848
I like how rough it is.

912
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,558
They blend it so well.

913
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,658
This part was well-structured.

914
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,988
It's so simple,

915
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,589
but it shows that simple is the best.

916
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,098
- It shows their strengths. - Yes, it does.

917
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:36,828
They aren't thinking about what the viewers want to see,

918
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:39,500
but showed us the best in what the team can do.

919
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,109
We will now reveal the fight judge scores...

920
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,110
of Halo and Chocol, directors of Wolf'Lo.

921
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,638
Pray, please.

922
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,379
- For what? - A high score.

923
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,809
Please.

924
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,779
I think Wolf'Lo will have the highest score.

925
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,549
I agree with you.

926
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,579
They were able to express their moves the best.

927
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,420
(What are Halo and Chocol's fight judge scores?)

928
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,359
(Halo: 346 points, Chocol: 367 points)

929
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,089
(Halo: 346, Baby Sleek: 375, Chocol: 367)

930
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,629
Gosh, it's so low.

931
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,760
I know, it's so low.

932
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,230
Halo's score is so low.

933
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,629
(Halo received the lowest score of the directors.)

934
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,468
When it switched to Halo's part and they started breakdancing,

935
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,669
they should've been more in sync.

936
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,238
They didn't get enough practice.

937
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,308
The rough vibe just got chaotic.

938
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:23,050
There is a fine line between the two.

939
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,408
It's like the dance isn't organized into one performance.

940
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,919
We can see Yeni Cho getting ready in the back.

941
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,718
They should've cleaned this up.

942
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,288
I was disappointed with the ending.

943
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:33,488
The concept was "thesis-antithesis-synthesis."

944
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,888
They're supposed to overcome conflict and create harmony.

945
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:38,359
However, only six people are standing.

946
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,558
It would've been better if they didn't fall at the end.

947
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,499
It looks like the men lost, right?

948
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,340
- That was disappointing. - Yes.

949
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:52,468
We came up with the concept "thesis-antithesis-synthesis."

950
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,939
We were hoping to create...

951
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,379
a perfect flow from beginning to end,

952
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,079
so we have no regrets.

953
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,519
That's right. You all did a great job.

954
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,119
Good job.

955
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,618
With this,

956
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,928
the total scores of the three crews with the all-gender theme...

957
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,229
are 1115 points for LADYBOUNCE,

958
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,529
and 1087 points for BEBE,

959
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,530
and 1088 points for Wolf'Lo.

960
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,939
Lastly, which crew will be taking...

961
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,869
the additional concept points of 100 points?

962
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,909
Anyone can win if they get the 100 points.

963
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,880
(The difference in the scores of the three teams isn't big.)

964
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,050
- I think it'll be LADYBOUNCE. - LADYBOUNCE?

965
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
It'll be us. Don't worry.

966
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:35,719
Didn't BEBE's concept best fit the all-gender theme?

967
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,619
We can win if we get those points.

968
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,889
I think Wolf'Lo has a chance.

969
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,558
(Please!)

970
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,500
(Which crew will get the extra points?)

971
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:52,900
(Extra points: 100)

972
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,169
That scared me.

973
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,198
(LADYBOUNCE gets the 100 extra points.)

974
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,369
Good job, everyone.

975
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,238
(Admitting it)

976
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,979
With the 100 extra points,

977
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,349
LADYBOUNCE's final fight judge score is 1215 points.

978
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,018
Only five of them were female,

979
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:10,919
but I couldn't sense that...

980
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,419
because they were just as strong.

981
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,558
I thought that was impressive.

982
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,759
They looked like warriors,

983
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,959
and there were five female warriors within them.

984
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,598
They created that combination.

985
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,429
- I thought that was well-organized. - Right.

986
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,569
First, I'd like to thank you.

987
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,439
We were serious about our performance,

988
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,138
and even the helper dancers seem to have sensed that.

989
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:39,209
They did their best to make this good result possible.

990
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:42,619
I'd like to truly thank our helper dancers.

991
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,428
(Revealing the crews in 6th and 7th places for the Elimination Battle)

992
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:52,459
(Please let us be in 5th place.)

993
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,759
(We really tried hard.)

994
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,069
(The 7 crews that await the result with desperate hearts)

995
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,530
(I didn't want to let people see the weak side of me.)

996
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:06,439
(Which 2 crews will compete in the Elimination Battle?)

997
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,279
With this, all fight judge scores and extra points...

998
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,750
have been revealed.

999
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,819
For the Mega Crew Mission, the destiny of the seven crews...

1000
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,518
will be determined through 500 points of fight judge scores,

1001
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,848
and 500 points of online public points.

1002
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,059
It will add up to a total of 1,000 points.

1003
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,089
We will now reveal the points...

1004
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,429
that commensurate with the rank of each crew.

1005
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,098
(Mega Crew Mission Current Ranking)

1006
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,530
- The difference is 50 points. - That's a big difference.

1007
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,268
This is insane.

1008
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:36,098
LADYBOUNCE's score suddenly went up.

1009
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,768
There is quite a difference in the scores.

1010
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,939
However, the online public points haven't been added yet.

1011
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,839
With the 500 online public points,

1012
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,849
the final result can easily be changed.

1013
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,319
It will change.

1014
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,880
Right? It'll change.

1015
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,519
Please let us survive this.

1016
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,219
I will start by announcing the most-anticipated first place.

1017
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,090
I think it'll be 1MILLION.

1018
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,590
1MILLION.

1019
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,029
Please. I really want to win first place.

1020
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,170
Let us win first place.

1021
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,069
In the K-pop Death match Mission, we got the most views,

1022
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,469
but we were in second place because of the number of likes.

1023
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:11,209
(1MILLION got the most views, but were in 2nd place...)

1024
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,078
(due to the number of likes and votes.)

1025
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,649
I think the rankings can change.

1026
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,780
Maybe JAM REPUBLIC will win first place.

1027
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,750
No way. Because of the number of likes?

1028
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,479
My heart is pounding.

1029
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,678
(Current ranking, Fight judge score: 3rd, Views: 2nd)

1030
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,719
So bad.

1031
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,149
The crew in first place...

1032
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,860
(Which crew won 1st place in the Mega Crew Mission?)

1033
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,029
is 1MILLION.

1034
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,499
(The final 1st place winner of the Mega Crew Mission is 1MILLION.)

1035
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,759
We did it.

1036
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,999
- I love 1MILLION. - I love 1MILLION.

1037
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,539
(The crews congratulate 1MILLION with a genuine heart.)

1038
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,839
They even got 500 online public points.

1039
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,809
Gosh, they got 1,000 points.

1040
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:45,869
They got all the points.

1041
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:50,308
1MILLION received 6,797,517 views,

1042
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,449
and 60,049 votes.

1043
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,948
It was the best dance recognized by both the judges and the public.

1044
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:57,988
Of course.

1045
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,349
I admit it.

1046
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:00,689
(Genuinely congratulating them)

1047
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,919
Leader Lia Kim of 1MILLION,

1048
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,130
how do you feel?

1049
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:10,329
I'm very grateful to the members of the crew...

1050
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,840
that always believed in me...

1051
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:17,440
and came with me this far...

1052
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:21,679
despite the fact that I am not good enough as a leader.

1053
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,179
You did a good job.

1054
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:31,650
I will announce the crew in second place next.

1055
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,859
Second place? Who could it be?

1056
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,018
JAM REPUBLIC or MANNEQUEEN.

1057
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:37,230
I'd be grateful to be in second place now.

1058
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,960
JAM REPUBLIC got almost two million more views than we did.

1059
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:41,599
(Sighing)

1060
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,468
I believe we are in third place regarding the number of views.

1061
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:49,268
I could see the public loved our performance.

1062
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,709
So I think our ranking might go up.

1063
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,908
I think the audience response was very positive.

1064
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:56,409
So I'm hoping for the best for our crew.

1065
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,348
The crew that won second place in the Mega Crew Mission...

1066
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:02,879
(2nd place of the Mega Crew Mission)

1067
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,218
(JAM REPUBLIC)

1068
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:05,488
is JAM REPUBLIC.

1069
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,190
My gosh.

1070
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:10,360
We did great.

1071
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,529
They got 850 points.

1072
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,800
They won second place in the online public evaluation.

1073
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,928
JAM REPUBLIC did a good job.

1074
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:20,538
JAM REPUBLIC received 5,233,393 views...

1075
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:23,509
with 464,943 likes,

1076
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:27,110
and 116,285 votes.

1077
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,609
They got over 110,000 votes.

1078
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,679
That's hard to beat.

1079
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:33,419
Even though this was very challenging for us,

1080
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,848
we're just really grateful for the love and support...

1081
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,018
from the audience and those that are watching.

1082
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:39,050
We appreciate it.

1083
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,288
(Applauding)

1084
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:43,360
Jammies.

1085
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,089
- We love you, Jammies. - Thank you, Jammies.

1086
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,959
Thank you for the love.

1087
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,259
(Thank you, Jammies.)

1088
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,869
I will announce the crew in third place.

1089
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,929
MANNEQUEEN? MANNEQUEEN.

1090
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,468
- MANNEQUEEN? - I think so.

1091
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,440
I'd be grateful to be third place. Please let it be us.

1092
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,369
Please.

1093
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,578
Can't we hope for third place?

1094
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:03,110
Don't expect it.

1095
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,448
(Comforting her)

1096
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:07,519
Third place...

1097
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,749
is a tie.

1098
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,049
(2 crews are tied for 3rd place in the Mega Crew Mission.)

1099
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,050
(Her eyes grow bigger.)

1100
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:14,159
There are two crews.

1101
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:15,920
In third place...

1102
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,729
are two crews...

1103
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,629
that had different concepts in the Mega Crew Mission.

1104
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,229
It must be BEBE and MANNEQUEEN.

1105
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,230
MANNEQUEEN and BEBE?

1106
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,499
- I'm nervous. - Me too.

1107
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,669
It'd be unbelievable if we are in third place.

1108
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,139
- That means the public loved us. - But I hope it's us.

1109
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:34,639
It'd be insane if it were us.

1110
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,579
- It can't be us. - Life is a drama.

1111
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:38,150
I'm so nervous.

1112
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,319
(Praying)

1113
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,049
The third-place crew of the Mega Crew Mission...

1114
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,218
(Which crew placed 3rd?)

1115
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:45,349
is...

1116
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:46,919
MANNEQUEEN.

1117
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,860
(MANNEQUEEN placed 3rd.)

1118
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,729
(MANNEQUEEN, tied for 3rd place)

1119
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,928
With 3,995,574 views,

1120
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,840
plus 337,294 likes,

1121
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,308
and 50,522 votes,

1122
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:06,339
- You guys are the best. - MANNEQUEEN has won third place.

1123
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,440
You did great.

1124
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:09,710
They had the best combination.

1125
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,050
(Nodding)

1126
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,050
I'm jealous.

1127
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,050
(Jealous)

1128
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:14,449
I was thinking the same thing.

1129
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,949
I wasn't expecting much.

1130
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,389
I had lowered my expectations,

1131
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,229
but I'm glad that we placed pretty high.

1132
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,658
For all the love the people have shown us,

1133
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:31,000
I want to reciprocate it with better performances.

1134
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,900
Next, I will announce...

1135
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,839
another team that also placed third.

1136
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,440
Among the crews of the outdoor and all-gender themes,

1137
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,879
the third-place crew received completely different scores...

1138
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,750
from the fight judges and online voting.

1139
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:47,349
LADYBOUNCE or BEBE?

1140
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,619
This crew placed third...

1141
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,788
because it either won a high score from the fight judges...

1142
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:53,289
or a high online score.

1143
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,590
It's BEBE.

1144
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,718
BEBE.

1145
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,058
I think it might be LADYBOUNCE.

1146
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:58,529
Because LADYBOUNCE was second.

1147
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,129
Oh, you're right.

1148
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:03,569
But who's more popular with the public?

1149
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,670
That's huge.

1150
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,039
But I don't know how big the gap is.

1151
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,739
The next third-place crew of the Mega Crew Mission is...

1152
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,968
LADYBOUNCE.

1153
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:15,039
(Which team is tied for 3rd place in the Mega Crew Mission?)

1154
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,578
LADYBOUNCE.

1155
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:19,749
(LADYBOUNCE is tied for 3rd place.)

1156
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,880
LADYBOUNCE.

1157
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:25,949
Awesome. I can't believe it.

1158
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:27,658
Congratulations.

1159
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:29,360
Good work, girls.

1160
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,459
- They've gone through so much. - They got a low online score,

1161
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,099
but they got a lot of points from the fight judges.

1162
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,729
I can't believe it.

1163
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,929
- I can't stop crying. - They're tears of joy.

1164
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,198
With 2,180,358 views,

1165
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:45,170
plus 187,949 likes,

1166
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,079
and 33,061 votes, LADYBOUNCE placed 3rd.

1167
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,480
Great job, everyone.

1168
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,079
This is unbelievable.

1169
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:56,280
We placed sixth in views.

1170
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:57,989
This was...

1171
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:02,760
actually our first time presenting ourselves in front of the public.

1172
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,889
The online score could have changed the rankings,

1173
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,360
so we were considering going to the Elimination Battle.

1174
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,230
But I'm glad that we placed third.

1175
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:15,039
- Thank you very much. - We appreciate it.

1176
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,499
Congrats.

1177
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,709
(The other crews applaud them.)

1178
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,110
Let's repay the love.

1179
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,309
Now, we have...

1180
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:25,479
the 5th, 6th, and 7th places remaining.

1181
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,780
The crews that weren't called are Wolf'Lo, BEBE, and Deep N Dap.

1182
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:33,559
The 6th and 7th places go straight to the Elimination Battle.

1183
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,559
Who will it be? I really have no clue.

1184
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,190
JJ keeps crying.

1185
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,359
(Deep N Dap's current rank)

1186
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,928
(7th in fight judge score, 5th in views)

1187
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,229
- But we worked so hard. - Yes,

1188
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,900
we did work hard.

1189
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,138
Stop crying.

1190
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:49,499
I wished that we had placed fifth.

1191
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,639
I wanted to avoid the Elimination Battle.

1192
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:53,539
Is Soweon crying?

1193
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,638
Why are you crying?

1194
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,948
(BEBE, 6th in fight judge score, 4th in views)

1195
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:58,550
Don't cry. It's okay.

1196
00:57:58,849 --> 00:57:59,849
Please.

1197
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,948
Please let us place fifth.

1198
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:06,319
We didn't get such a high score in the interim check.

1199
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,218
The public didn't exactly like our performance,

1200
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,489
so I wasn't sure.

1201
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,360
We did the first Elimination Battle, right?

1202
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,359
If we were to do it again...

1203
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,730
I just never want to go through that again.

1204
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,098
It's not exactly for the people.

1205
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,099
They might find it too complicated.

1206
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,710
I think we're also at risk.

1207
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:28,439
We'll have to brace ourselves for whatever comes next...

1208
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,840
and prepare to win.

1209
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,849
I personally think that we'll go to the Elimination Battle.

1210
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:36,018
A lot of people said that they found it odd...

1211
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:37,989
that we only had one song in the performance.

1212
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,948
The fifth-place crew is...

1213
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,718
(Please!)

1214
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,759
(Which crew will place 5th...)

1215
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,489
(in the Mega Crew Mission to barely survive?)

1216
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,300
It's...

1217
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,299
BEBE.

1218
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,099
(Mega Crew Mission, 5th place, BEBE)

1219
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:57,769
(The members of BEBE show tears that they've been holding back.)

1220
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,110
(Congratulating)

1221
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,480
We got 400 points.

1222
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:07,249
With 3,605,276 views,

1223
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,388
plus 324,521 likes,

1224
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:14,889
and 122,415 votes, BEBE won 5th place.

1225
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,230
Bada of BEBE, how do you feel right now?

1226
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,599
(Getting emotional)

1227
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,070
This microphone must trigger your tears.

1228
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,599
Holding it makes you cry.

1229
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,940
It's because everyone is so serious about this.

1230
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:34,538
I was glad to get safe scores in every mission.

1231
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:37,079
And that weighed pretty heavily on me.

1232
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:42,250
But I want to thank the members for following my lead nonetheless.

1233
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,449
You saved us from the edge of the cliff,

1234
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:49,960
so we'll keep making good performances to prove...

1235
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,389
that we're a better team with better dancers. Thank you.

1236
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,799
Well done.

1237
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,269
Good for you.

1238
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:01,139
So, the Elimination Battle will be...

1239
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,900
between Wolf'Lo and Deep N Dap.

1240
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,639
I'm so scared of Wolf'Lo.

1241
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:06,768
In the Mega Crew Mission,

1242
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,509
you're tied for sixth place.

1243
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,579
We got the same score.

1244
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:12,979
With 2,020,900 views,

1245
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,879
plus 153,288 likes,

1246
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,920
and 27,327 votes, Wolf'Lo placed 6th.

1247
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,218
(Wolf'Lo, tied for 6th place)

1248
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,929
Baby Sleek of Wolf'Lo.

1249
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:27,260
You'll be in the Elimination Battle once again.

1250
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:28,559
Tell me about it.

1251
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,159
Exactly.

1252
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,929
We're going back.

1253
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,308
I kind of predicted it when we saw the views.

1254
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,940
Even if we go to the Elimination Battle,

1255
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,339
we want to show people everything we can...

1256
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,579
before we're eliminated.

1257
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:47,219
We did our best to prepare for it.

1258
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,279
Today, there will be...

1259
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,420
a battle between Deep N Dap and us,

1260
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:55,288
so I hope you enjoy the show.

1261
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:56,819
- All right! - Let's go!

1262
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,829
Good luck!

1263
01:00:57,889 --> 01:00:59,389
- I bet they'll look good. - Good luck!

1264
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,899
Deep N Dap got 2,857,734 views,

1265
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,499
had 202,997 likes,

1266
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,440
- and won 19,855 votes. - That's a lot.

1267
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,538
(Deep N Dap, tied for 6th place)

1268
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,480
- It's the opposite of us. - Right.

1269
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:17,210
JJ of Deep N Dap.

1270
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:18,879
- She's in trouble. - Why?

1271
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,949
JJ's in trouble.

1272
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:21,980
She's like a pickle right now.

1273
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:23,149
Don't cry!

1274
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,018
(I feel bad for her.)

1275
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:27,389
She's crying again.

1276
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,960
Yes.

1277
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,760
Wear these.

1278
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:34,929
I had a lot of fun, preparing for the battle.

1279
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:38,000
And I had a feeling that we'd win.

1280
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,130
That's right!

1281
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,230
That kid.

1282
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,599
No need to be afraid.

1283
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,940
We'll do our best.

1284
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,968
- Wish us luck. - Good luck!

1285
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,879
(You can do it, Deep N Dap.)

1286
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,679
Fine. One of us survives.

1287
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,249
Deep N Dap and Wolf'Lo, please return to your hideout...

1288
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,919
and get ready for the Elimination Battle.

1289
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,050
(Elimination Battle: Wolf'Lo versus Deep N Dap)

1290
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:59,349
I don't think that we deserve seventh place.

1291
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:00,960
No pressure, guys.

1292
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:02,759
No pressure.

1293
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,030
Let's do our best.

1294
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:05,158
We do our best,

1295
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:06,328
- have fun, - Right.

1296
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:07,359
- find joy, - Yes.

1297
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,699
and be happy!

1298
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,729
We comforted each other,

1299
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,130
and we're determined to show you everything we've prepared.

1300
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:16,139
We've never performed in such a large group before,

1301
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,440
so I accept the evaluation.

1302
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,678
But if we lose the battle, that's far more...

1303
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:23,379
- It's offensive. - It hurts our pride.

1304
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,650
It could be more maddening.

1305
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,948
We've never danced half-heartedly before.

1306
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,789
We're just going to dance as we always did.

1307
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,960
I don't want to regret anything when it's over.

1308
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:35,460
And I don't want to lose.

1309
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:37,459
I'm a little worried...

1310
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,828
because Wolf'Lo has shown too many of their battle routines.

1311
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:41,759
And their previous battle was fantastic.

1312
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
It was too good.

1313
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,500
- It puts pressure on them. - Right.

1314
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,769
So, you don't know who will win today.

1315
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,900
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

1316
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:49,940
(Elimination Battle)

1317
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:52,839
(The second Elimination Battle on Street Woman Fighter 2)

1318
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,979
(The 500 people joined us once again.)

1319
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,379
(Monika, Aiki, and Shownu)

1320
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,808
Find the number-one dance crew in the world.

1321
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,679
You're watching Mnet's Street Woman Fighter 2.

1322
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,579
I'm your host, Kang Daniel. Nice to meet you.

1323
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:07,659
I'm so nervous.

1324
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,190
It feels different from dancing in the fight zone.

1325
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,960
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1326
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:14,729
TSUBA KILL was eliminated from the Class Mission,

1327
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,329
and we only have seven crews remaining.

1328
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:21,570
One more crew will leave Street Woman Fighter 2 tonight.

1329
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:24,610
(Don't go!)

1330
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,408
Let's get the Elimination Battle started...

1331
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:29,238
to determine who will be...

1332
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,780
eliminated second on Street Woman Fighter 2.

1333
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,779
The first elimination candidate,

1334
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,650
Wolf'Lo, please enter.

1335
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:42,659
- Wolf'Lo! - Wolf'Lo!

1336
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:44,089
- Wolf'Lo! - Wolf'Lo!

1337
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,459
- Wolf'Lo! - Wolf'Lo!

1338
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,198
(The dancers and audience welcome Wolf'Lo with loud chants.)

1339
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:52,929
(They enter the ring with their cheers.)

1340
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,699
(Wolf'Lo has entered.)

1341
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,940
The next crew is Deep N Dap.

1342
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,609
(It's Deep N Dap!)

1343
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:06,009
Deep N Dap!

1344
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,218
- Deep N Dap! - Deep N Dap!

1345
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,050
Let's go, Deep N Dap!

1346
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,118
(Well-mannered)

1347
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,159
(Thanks.)

1348
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:19,130
(Deep N Dap has entered.)

1349
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,529
Now, it's time to determine...

1350
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,760
who will leave Street Woman Fighter 2 second.

1351
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:26,598
We've practiced a lot for this.

1352
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:28,070
Not only will we dance well,

1353
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,610
but we'll also enjoy the battle.

1354
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:33,309
Okay!

1355
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,780
(Break a leg.)

1356
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,408
We'll say this because we have to win.

1357
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:42,750
You don't win a battle by practicing.

1358
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,618
(It goes hard.)

1359
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:46,819
I love this!

1360
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,190
It's terrifying.

1361
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,489
That's intense.

1362
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,189
Round One of the Elimination Battle is...

1363
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,558
the Hidden Battle.

1364
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:56,359
The Hidden Battle is a free battle...

1365
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,129
with no limits to the number of dancers and props...

1366
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,869
in going against your opponent.

1367
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,709
We'll decide who goes first by spinning the bottle.

1368
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,109
Deep N Dap will go first,

1369
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,009
and Wolf'Lo will go next.

1370
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,339
The battle where no crew will back down...

1371
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,709
as the lower will be eliminated starts now.

1372
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,710
You guys ready?

1373
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:17,488
We're going to show you everything that we've been unable to...

1374
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:18,549
and win the battle.

1375
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,888
People introduce us as the battle-winning crew.

1376
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,360
So we must win.

1377
01:05:23,389 --> 01:05:24,460
Fight!

1378
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:30,559
(Deep N Dap, let's go!)

1379
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,269
Oh, nunchucks!

1380
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:37,909
They're nunchucks!

1381
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,039
Our strategy in the Hidden Battle is the nunchucks.

1382
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,150
(Spinning)

1383
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,308
They brought nunchucks,

1384
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,320
but they weren't using them too well.

1385
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,218
(Screaming)

1386
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,260
(Getting excited)

1387
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:17,280
(Snap their necks!)

1388
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:19,849
(Staying calm)

1389
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:25,190
(Hey, girl)

1390
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,259
- Girl! - Girl!

1391
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,230
(Here we come.)

1392
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:34,598
(Girl!)

1393
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,059
(Squealing)

1394
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,869
Two, one.

1395
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:42,369
That's insane!

1396
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:44,909
Slay.

1397
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,579
Switch! Wolf'Lo, let's go.

1398
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,480
Whatever Deep N Dap pulls, we're going to win.

1399
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,650
What will they do?

1400
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:55,419
- Ribbons. - They're ribbons!

1401
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,980
Like Son Yeon Jae!

1402
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:05,589
(The coolest ribbons in the world)

1403
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,559
They used ribbons, right?

1404
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,530
I thought, "But why is she using it alone?"

1405
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,869
(Fancy)

1406
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,610
Hey!

1407
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:23,940
They're crazy.

1408
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,250
It wasn't as good.

1409
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,619
(Applauding)

1410
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:37,959
I love it.

1411
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,159
(Wolf'Lo's performance brings them together.)

1412
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:42,729
Okay!

1413
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,329
(Just enjoy it for now.)

1414
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,170
Three, two, one.

1415
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:51,940
Battle, over.

1416
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:57,509
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1417
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,679
(That was the best.)

1418
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,079
You're crazy!

1419
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,879
Both teams were great!

1420
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,788
- That was good. - That was fire.

1421
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,559
The judges are all up.

1422
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,219
That was out of this world.

1423
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,328
I never expected those props.

1424
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:12,988
The use of the props is great.

1425
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:14,658
The ribbon goes so well with hip-hop moves.

1426
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:15,960
That caught me off-guard.

1427
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:19,669
The audience cheered very loudly for us.

1428
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,469
I think that we have the upper hand in the Hidden Battle.

1429
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,408
It was surely our win.

1430
01:08:24,409 --> 01:08:26,538
I think Deep N Dap will win.

1431
01:08:26,539 --> 01:08:28,139
I thought, "We won."

1432
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,578
"Deep N Dap has finally done it."

1433
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:33,680
Judges, you must decide now.

1434
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,948
Please.

1435
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:38,488
Please give us a win.

1436
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,318
Who would you pick?

1437
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,989
It'll be decided by preference.

1438
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:45,129
Fight judges, open your cards.

1439
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,659
Three, two, one.

1440
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,158
(Wolf'Lo: 1, Deep N Dap: 1)

1441
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:51,970
(To which crew will the last vote go?)

1442
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,899
(Wolf'Lo: 1, Deep N Dap: 2)

1443
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:01,009
With a score of 2 to 1, the first round...

1444
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:04,009
goes to Deep N Dap.

1445
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,210
(The members of Deep N Dap burst into tears.)

1446
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,209
- It's all right. - All good.

1447
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,850
I knew that we could lose the Hidden Battle.

1448
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:11,648
Deep N Dap showed all the preparations...

1449
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:13,488
with powerful energy.

1450
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:16,188
You also made great use of the props.

1451
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:18,929
I personally like the members of Wolf'Lo,

1452
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:21,828
but Deep N Dap had such good teamwork.

1453
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:25,629
I believe that was a huge factor.

1454
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:30,339
I thought that Deep N Dap was more in sync.

1455
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,340
That's why I voted for you.

1456
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:35,608
It meant a lot to me that we worked together...

1457
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:37,849
as a team and had a win.

1458
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,849
Next, the second round is...

1459
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,919
the 1-on-1 Battle.

1460
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,549
(- It's 1 on 1. - Awesome.)

1461
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,089
- Good luck. - The leader of Deep N Dap,

1462
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,389
Mina Myoung, who won the first round,

1463
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,219
who will dance from Deep N Dap?

1464
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:54,158
The dancer for the 1-on-1 Battle in Round 2...

1465
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:57,029
is the locking princess,

1466
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:59,769
- Princess. - Locker Zee.

1467
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:00,799
(The locking princess, Locker Zee)

1468
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,698
- Locker Zee! - Locker Zee.

1469
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,198
- Yes! - Go!

1470
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:05,309
You've got this!

1471
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:08,478
Halo from Wolf'Lo, the loser of Round One.

1472
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:10,339
Who's the dancer from Wolf'Lo?

1473
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,750
The dancer of Wolf'Lo is...

1474
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,108
(Pricking their ears)

1475
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:15,219
Chocol.

1476
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,379
(Wolf'Lo's secret weapon, Chocol)

1477
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:19,719
Round 2 of the Elimination Battle, the 1-on-1 Battle.

1478
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,559
Chocol from Wolf'Lo versus Locker Zee from Deep N Dap.

1479
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,328
The battle has been decided.

1480
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:26,488
It's locking against hip-hop?

1481
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,699
That ought to be fun.

1482
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,358
That's so new.

1483
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:30,560
Who should I choose?

1484
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,698
- Show us, Chocol. - Let's go.

1485
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:35,069
- Chocol. - Chocol.

1486
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,099
There's only one woman who can battle freestyle,

1487
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,038
and that's Locker Zee.

1488
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:42,009
I want to play fair and square to show them how good we are.

1489
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,709
Let's go. Don't hurt yourself.

1490
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,549
- Okay. - Don't get hurt.

1491
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:48,478
Chocol hasn't been in battles that often,

1492
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:51,219
so I had a feeling that she'd show us this time.

1493
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:54,390
So, we started planning and using our heads.

1494
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,059
- They must be so nervous. - Right.

1495
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,889
Oh, no. I'm shaking.

1496
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:01,358
The two dancers' fierce battle begins now.

1497
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:02,999
- You guys ready? - Hey!

1498
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,328
Okay!

1499
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:05,329
Fight!

1500
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,699
(Locker Zee goes first.)

1501
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,239
It was the right song too.

1502
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:12,038
They usually play this song at locking events.

1503
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:13,939
I was convinced that I could pull it off.

1504
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,319
Shake it!

1505
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,890
(Dancing)

1506
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,159
(Dancing with the guitar)

1507
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,260
(Intrigued)

1508
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,100
Locker Zee!

1509
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:43,699
She's way too good.

1510
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,609
- Run! - Let's go!

1511
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,880
Let's go!

1512
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:05,659
Four, three, two, one.

1513
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:06,989
(Amazed)

1514
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:07,999
(In love with the locking moves)

1515
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Switch.

1516
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:11,569
Chocol from Wolf'Lo.

1517
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,898
The fun part is over.

1518
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:17,270
It's going to get wild, starting from me.

1519
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:19,970
(Excited)

1520
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:25,579
(Reacting automatically)

1521
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:28,420
Okay.

1522
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:34,460
She's certainly a hip-hop dancer.

1523
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,760
(Amy falls for Chocol.)

1524
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,760
(Impressed)

1525
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,529
Hey!

1526
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,039
Good.

1527
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:57,180
Good.

1528
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,250
(Fantastic)

1529
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:10,959
I was like, "Okay, girl."

1530
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,960
Yes! She plays along well.

1531
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:16,460
(Locker Zee dances along with Chocol's moves.)

1532
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,699
Yes.

1533
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:23,470
Four, three, two, one.

1534
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,038
Battle, over.

1535
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:28,839
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1536
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,079
- Nice! - Great job.

1537
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,309
You did so well. That was awesome.

1538
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,019
I can't predict the winner. We'll have to see.

1539
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,618
- This is tricky. - Who do you think will win?

1540
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:38,720
No one knows.

1541
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:40,049
They were both so cool.

1542
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,719
The battle between Chocol from Wolf'Lo...

1543
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,459
and Locker Zee from Deep N Dap has ended.

1544
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:49,260
Judges, please take your time and select the winner.

1545
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:50,560
This is crazy.

1546
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:53,000
It's all right. Their responses weren't bad.

1547
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:54,669
They're contemplating.

1548
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,439
I didn't know you could use the ring like that.

1549
01:13:56,869 --> 01:13:58,408
(Copying Locker Zee's guitar move)

1550
01:13:58,409 --> 01:14:00,408
She has a really nice movement quality.

1551
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:02,279
- That was really good. - Really good.

1552
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,309
I personally think...

1553
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,709
that Chocol did a better job of grabbing...

1554
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,379
- my attention. - Really?

1555
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:11,448
Though we lost the first round of the battle,

1556
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:14,818
I was determined to win the 1-on-1 Battle.

1557
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:17,890
I knew that it had to be a win by a landslide to motivate the crew.

1558
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:20,959
I thought that I had the crowd.

1559
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,959
I was the first one to use the ring,

1560
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,368
so I expected to get a higher score.

1561
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:29,000
We will now see who won the round.

1562
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:30,499
Fight judges, open your cards.

1563
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,238
Three, two, one.

1564
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:34,738
(What's the result of this great battle?)

1565
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:35,739
One.

1566
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,309
(The result of Round 2, Wolf'Lo: 3, Deep N Dap: 0)

1567
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,809
With a score of 3 to 0,

1568
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:42,520
Chocol of Wolf'Lo earned her crew's first victory.

1569
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:44,449
Good job.

1570
01:14:44,619 --> 01:14:45,889
(You got my respect!)

1571
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,818
- Well done. - You were great!

1572
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:50,019
Actually, their styles were different.

1573
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,059
So picking the winner was especially hard for this battle.

1574
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,358
During Locker Zee's turn...

1575
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,868
when I was watching her dance, I wondered what she would do next.

1576
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:00,099
I watched her while trying to guess the next moves.

1577
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,038
But with Chocol, I didn't wonder.

1578
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,909
She definitely drew me in and immersed me in her battle.

1579
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:10,210
(With this win, the current score is 1 to 1.)

1580
01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:11,850
That was good feedback.

1581
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,719
Toward the middle and end of my turn,

1582
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,089
Locker Zee danced along to my moves and joined me.

1583
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,519
I love it when other dancers do that.

1584
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,459
Dancing along to my freestyle dance...

1585
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,720
made me quite happy.

1586
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:24,989
You were great, Locker Zee!

1587
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:26,759
- That was so cool. - You were great, Locker Zee!

1588
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,829
Well done.

1589
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,158
Wolf'Lo earned their 1st win in Round 2.

1590
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,429
The score of the battle between Wolf'Lo and Deep N Dap...

1591
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:33,499
is 1 to 1 now.

1592
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,099
The battle is back to square one now.

1593
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,669
Let's continue with Round Three.

1594
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,710
It's the 1-on-1 Battle once again.

1595
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:40,169
(They must be so nervous.)

1596
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:41,779
- I wonder who will be next. - Right?

1597
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:44,578
Halo, Wolf'Lo won the previous round.

1598
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:47,049
Which dancer will be competing in this round?

1599
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:50,250
The dancer to participate in this round...

1600
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:51,488
- is Mini. - Hey!

1601
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:52,648
(Pink Mascot of Wolf'Lo, Mini)

1602
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:53,889
Okay!

1603
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,519
(I'm ready to face anyone. Come at me.)

1604
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,920
Pink Mini!

1605
01:15:58,289 --> 01:16:02,099
I think Locker Zee is the only battler in the crew.

1606
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,629
So I'm feeling confident.

1607
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,898
(I should stay calm.)

1608
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:06,099
We can do this.

1609
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,238
Actually, it doesn't matter who our opponent is.

1610
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,068
We don't have a strategy to win this battle either.

1611
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:12,609
We're just going for it. That's it.

1612
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:16,739
The dancer to participate in this round is...

1613
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,078
- JJ. - Yes!

1614
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,209
(The queen of Memes, JJ)

1615
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,648
JJ!

1616
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:21,719
- JJ. - Yes!

1617
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,379
(I'll win this battle with my confidence.)

1618
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,919
(She's pretty good.)

1619
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,948
(I love this battle!)

1620
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,919
I love her. Oh, my gosh.

1621
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,920
I love it.

1622
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:31,858
(The atmosphere gets heated even before the round begins.)

1623
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:32,859
(Plagiarism Patrol is on the move.)

1624
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,889
Okay.

1625
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,328
(Calm down, girls.)

1626
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,969
Round 3 of the Elimination Battle, the 1-on-1 Battle.

1627
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,299
Mini of Wolf'Lo versus JJ of Deep N Dap.

1628
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,899
Their battle has been set.

1629
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:43,839
Hey, this round looks interesting.

1630
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,439
- JJ versus Mini? - Yellow...

1631
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,869
I thought this was a battle of two distinct characters.

1632
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,209
The thing is I have an expressive face when I dance.

1633
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:52,309
JJ has an expressive face when she dances too.

1634
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:53,948
So I just decided to have fun.

1635
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:56,549
The dancer who has the most fun on the stage...

1636
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:57,849
will end up winning, anyway.

1637
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,389
Don't get too worked up. Stay calm.

1638
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:02,089
- Just do what you've been doing. - Just do what you practiced.

1639
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,688
Gosh. I can't believe I'll watch JJ freestyle.

1640
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:05,658
- She's going to kill it. - Yes, that's right.

1641
01:17:05,659 --> 01:17:08,130
Oh, no. I have no idea. Seriously.

1642
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:10,358
As everyone knows, I don't do freestyle battles.

1643
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,068
But I can neither avoid this nor run away from it.

1644
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:15,299
I think showing them my style of dancing...

1645
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,068
is respecting the battle.

1646
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:18,470
So I'll do my best.

1647
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,538
Wolf'Lo won the previous round.

1648
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:22,608
Will Wolf'Lo win consecutively and continue with the momentum?

1649
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:25,209
Or will Deep N Dap win this round after losing the previous round?

1650
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,249
The intense battle between the two dancers will begin now.

1651
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,419
Are you guys ready?

1652
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:31,149
- Fight! Let's go! - Fight!

1653
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:32,488
(Mini of Wolf'Lo will go first.)

1654
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:34,550
I'm going to win this. I'll win with three votes.

1655
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,288
Gosh. Her facial expression is changing!

1656
01:17:36,289 --> 01:17:38,229
- There she is. - There she is. Oh, my!

1657
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:40,930
Yes.

1658
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:47,698
Wait. That's what she's starting with again?

1659
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:48,939
Is that her signature move?

1660
01:17:53,109 --> 01:17:54,139
(Mesmerized)

1661
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,140
(Mini is the best indeed.)

1662
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,289
Yes.

1663
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:10,859
(Mini!)

1664
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:11,859
She's on fire.

1665
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,930
To be honest, she scares me a bit.

1666
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:23,770
(No, I'm not scary.)

1667
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,938
(Elimination Battle: Wolf'Lo versus Deep N Dap)

1668
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:26,969
Oh, my gosh.

1669
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,009
(Spinning)

1670
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,010
(Check out her crazy move!)

1671
01:18:29,011 --> 01:18:30,738
What's she doing?

1672
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:33,949
(What do you think? She's DJ Mini.)

1673
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:43,590
Five, four, three, two, one.

1674
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:46,159
It's your turn now. Show me what you got.

1675
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:47,930
Switch!

1676
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,930
- Let's go, JJ. - JJ from Deep N Dap.

1677
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,368
I wanted to start strong.

1678
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:55,140
- Let's go, JJ. - JJ!

1679
01:19:06,979 --> 01:19:08,079
What? What's that?

1680
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:15,658
(Look at that.)

1681
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:17,159
She was better than I expected.

1682
01:19:18,989 --> 01:19:20,029
I see.

1683
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,859
I'm not going to get nervous. I'm just going to have fun.

1684
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,038
(This is what I'm talking about!)

1685
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:30,239
(Totally focused)

1686
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,010
(I'm a DJ too.)

1687
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:38,149
(You can't copy me.)

1688
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:46,219
Four, three, two, one.

1689
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,619
The battle is over.

1690
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:50,289
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1691
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,659
- Yes. - You were great.

1692
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,689
They both did well.

1693
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:56,398
(In trouble)

1694
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:57,799
This is going to get so difficult.

1695
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,368
Hey, JJ. That was insane!

1696
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:01,868
Well done.

1697
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:02,899
She's good.

1698
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,869
She did well given she was up against Mini.

1699
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:08,139
I was really surprised.

1700
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,179
The thing is, she's not a battler.

1701
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,509
- She's a choreographer. - Well done.

1702
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,578
So I thought she would be easy to beat.

1703
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:16,478
Gosh. Can I be completely honest here?

1704
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,519
Mini used the entire stage during her turn.

1705
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,658
Then it would be hard for JJ to win just with dancing.

1706
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,359
But as if she knew that, she used the entire stage too.

1707
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:26,188
I thought, "Are we going to lose?"

1708
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:28,899
I had a sense of insecurity during this round.

1709
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,059
I just learned it from her in that moment.

1710
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:34,368
She showed me that it was possible to use the space that freely.

1711
01:20:34,369 --> 01:20:35,698
I don't know.

1712
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:37,999
- Yes. - It's different.

1713
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,710
How will the judges decide?

1714
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,509
The current score is 1 to 1, right?

1715
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:43,278
- It's 1 to 1. - It's 1 to 1.

1716
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:45,879
We will now check the results of the battle.

1717
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,519
A single vote might decide the winner and loser for this one.

1718
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,978
- Right. - Or they might want a rematch.

1719
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,948
Fight judges, open your cards.

1720
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:55,619
Three, two, one.

1721
01:20:56,289 --> 01:20:58,390
One.

1722
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,799
Mini of Wolf'Lo won the round with a score of 3 to 0...

1723
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,868
and managed to earn another win for her crew.

1724
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:10,600
- Well done. - Great job.

1725
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:12,309
To be honest,

1726
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:15,538
style-wise, I preferred JJ's dancing.

1727
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:18,179
But I watched this round from a different perspective.

1728
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:21,648
I tried to evaluate which one of you showed...

1729
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:23,978
a stronger style of dancing during the battle.

1730
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:26,019
When I paid attention to that,

1731
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:29,020
for the first time, I decided against my preference.

1732
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:31,419
- You can go first. - Thank you.

1733
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,459
I want to clear up a misunderstanding.

1734
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,828
As for this round, I voted for Mini because she won by 0.1 points.

1735
01:21:36,829 --> 01:21:37,899
She said, "0.1 points."

1736
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:40,099
You were great!

1737
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,939
As for your showmanship, it's what I expected from you.

1738
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:44,299
Throughout the round,

1739
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,769
you added in various key dance moves to show your skills.

1740
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,509
But JJ used one style of dancing throughout the round.

1741
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,608
So I thought, "Mini is..."

1742
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:53,078
"going to win this round for sure."

1743
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:55,019
But you were very interactive.

1744
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,549
You made good use of this battle component.

1745
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,020
So that's why we could have one of the best battles this round.

1746
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,760
JJ, you were great.

1747
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:03,489
- Great job! - Thank you for the great feedback.

1748
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,228
Don't cry.

1749
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:08,229
(JJ stops competing for a moment and shares her emotions with her.)

1750
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:11,130
- You were amazing. - I want to give JJ a hug too.

1751
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,129
- Let's bury her in compliments. - Well done.

1752
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,728
Why is she crying?

1753
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,799
No!

1754
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,569
Hey, don't cry!

1755
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,169
Don't cry!

1756
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,510
It was a great battle.

1757
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,408
With Mini's victory, Wolf'Lo earned another win...

1758
01:22:24,409 --> 01:22:26,278
and got a step closer to surviving this battle.

1759
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:29,249
The battle between Wolf'Lo and Deep N Dap is neck and neck...

1760
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,818
even until Round Three.

1761
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:32,488
As for Round Four,

1762
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,488
it will be the 5-on-5 Group Battle.

1763
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:35,489
(Round Four, Group Battle)

1764
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,090
Let's go!

1765
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:40,089
What's going on? A lot of them changed their outfits.

1766
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,559
- Hey. - Let's go!

1767
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,499
Let's go!

1768
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,659
Let's go!

1769
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,130
- I'm getting nervous again. - Right.

1770
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,539
It's a rollercoaster ride. It's fun and nervous.

1771
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:51,038
They must be so nervous.

1772
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:52,140
Which crew will win this round?

1773
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,868
Downy seems determined.

1774
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,810
- Downy. - She took off her shoes.

1775
01:22:56,909 --> 01:22:59,709
I had never mixed my techniques into our routine before.

1776
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:01,509
I'm the turning princess...

1777
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,349
because I'm good at making turns.

1778
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,988
We included a lot of wow factors,

1779
01:23:05,989 --> 01:23:08,219
so we could dominate the battle.

1780
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,858
You guys looked down on us, right? We'll show you now.

1781
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:13,288
Gosh, it looks like they gave their all to prepare for this.

1782
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:15,198
But when it comes to battles, Wolf'Lo rarely loses.

1783
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,799
They lost the Hidden Battle as a group from earlier.

1784
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,999
- So they must be more determined. - Yes.

1785
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,599
We lost with the routine we prepared for an earlier round.

1786
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,639
(Elimination Battle: Wolf'Lo versus Deep N Dap)

1787
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,209
I suddenly felt some pressure.

1788
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,809
However, we have the 5-on-5 Battle.

1789
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:29,309
We were determined to win that battle.

1790
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:30,509
Let's get pumped up and have fun.

1791
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:31,578
- Okay. - Okay.

1792
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:32,749
I'm so nervous.

1793
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:33,979
Let's go.

1794
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:37,879
All right. Deep N Dap versus Wolf'Lo.

1795
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,049
The two crews are battling it out intensely...

1796
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:41,648
as there's only one spot to continue in this competition.

1797
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:42,759
Are you guys ready?

1798
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,688
- Yes. - Let's fight.

1799
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:45,728
(Elimination Battle: Wolf'Lo versus Deep N Dap)

1800
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,899
(Wolf'Lo will go first.)

1801
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,399
(Let's go, Wolf'Lo!)

1802
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,499
We don't know how the result will come out.

1803
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,000
But we'll just focus on our routine.

1804
01:23:59,069 --> 01:24:00,409
(Getting nervous again)

1805
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:09,818
(Becoming one with the dance moves)

1806
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:11,180
Yes.

1807
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,760
Yes.

1808
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:20,989
Gosh, how are we going to beat this?

1809
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,500
(Wolf'Lo tears up the beat.)

1810
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,649
(Ta-Da)

1811
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,920
We're in trouble.

1812
01:24:55,529 --> 01:24:56,659
(Impressed)

1813
01:24:56,899 --> 01:24:58,158
They dominated with quality.

1814
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,430
They were really good.

1815
01:24:59,699 --> 01:25:01,170
Let's dominate them with energy.

1816
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:05,069
Now it's Deep N Dap's turn.

1817
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,438
(Let's go!)

1818
01:25:06,439 --> 01:25:08,039
Let's go!

1819
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,310
Let's destroy them completely.

1820
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,319
(Surprised)

1821
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:23,159
(These girls are committed to winning.)

1822
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:27,829
(Sticking out their tongues)

1823
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,829
That's insane!

1824
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:36,069
(Power to the Max)

1825
01:25:38,069 --> 01:25:39,108
Energy.

1826
01:25:39,109 --> 01:25:40,210
(Screaming)

1827
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,979
We can win this.

1828
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:49,779
(Air horning)

1829
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,289
(Spin, spinning princess!)

1830
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:57,520
These girls are insane.

1831
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:58,930
(Yes, we're insane.)

1832
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,430
We survived.

1833
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:05,399
How did they prepare so hard?

1834
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:15,739
(A kiss in return)

1835
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:21,109
(They're very into it.)

1836
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,349
That's insane!

1837
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,149
You did great.

1838
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:28,219
Both sides...

1839
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,520
- must have no teeth left by now. - Exactly.

1840
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:33,559
That was a battle between Wolf'Lo and Deep N Dap.

1841
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,028
After pondering carefully,

1842
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:39,229
the judges will choose one crew to win the battle.

1843
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,799
Deep N Dap is strong as a crew.

1844
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,238
- They need to be together. - They did so well.

1845
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,198
- Deep N Dap gritted their teeth. - They did really well.

1846
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,438
- Deep N Dap felt really new. - They won't lose.

1847
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:47,810
That's how you do a battle.

1848
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,509
We can't lose this.

1849
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,680
It'll be a tie again.

1850
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:54,750
Something feels extraordinary.

1851
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,318
Deep N Dap prepared so thoroughly for this.

1852
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:59,688
But honestly,

1853
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:00,890
to me, their dance didn't seem very strong.

1854
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,159
Let's confirm the results of this battle.

1855
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,060
Fight judges, open your cards.

1856
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,699
In 3, 2, 1.

1857
01:27:09,699 --> 01:27:11,500
(Shocked)

1858
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,340
(Deep N Dap 2, Wolf'Lo 1)

1859
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,340
(They did it!)

1860
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,340
(Acknowledging the win)

1861
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,578
Deep N Dap wins the round again...

1862
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:26,078
- with a score of 2 to 1. - You did great!

1863
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:29,479
The current score for the battle is 2 to 2.

1864
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,550
They keep winning the ones involving routines.

1865
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,090
You guys are amazing!

1866
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:37,358
(Satisfied grunting)

1867
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:39,089
I was so happy, seriously.

1868
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,229
So happy.

1869
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,898
All of our hard work paid off.

1870
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:44,898
When you think about it,

1871
01:27:44,899 --> 01:27:48,568
you know it's hard to beat Wolf'Lo easily.

1872
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:51,568
But Deep N Dap won, despite being looked down on.

1873
01:27:51,569 --> 01:27:53,010
I felt so great about it.

1874
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:56,408
This was also a win by a hair,

1875
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:58,908
but I felt that the moves and routine by Deep N Dap...

1876
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:01,778
were a little more daring,

1877
01:28:01,779 --> 01:28:04,220
which is why I gave the point to Deep N Dap. Thank you.

1878
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,819
Thank you.

1879
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,389
You went first,

1880
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:12,390
and your music choice was funky, so you should've done something fun.

1881
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,929
I believe the start of your routine was less captivating.

1882
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:19,698
Actually, it seemed many members were shaky after, while syncing up.

1883
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:22,738
Deep N Dap's performance was much more captivating,

1884
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:25,300
and the way they expressed the music was great.

1885
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:27,840
Thank you.

1886
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:30,210
They did well.

1887
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,579
This is so intense.

1888
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,380
As this fierce battle continues,

1889
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,578
with neither side giving an inch,

1890
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:37,978
we have a score of 2 to 2.

1891
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,350
The teams are tied again.

1892
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:42,760
So it keeps getting tied like this.

1893
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,760
From now on,

1894
01:28:44,761 --> 01:28:48,629
each win for the remaining rounds will be critical.

1895
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:52,169
Which crew will win in Round Five?

1896
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:53,698
The next round is Round Five,

1897
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:55,899
with the 1-on-1 battles.

1898
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,669
(Let's go again!)

1899
01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:00,439
Mina Myoung, leader of the victorious Deep N Dap,

1900
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:03,180
which battler will enter this round first?

1901
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:06,409
This time, we have Locker Zee,

1902
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,310
who will bring us victory again.

1903
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:10,278
(Deep N Dap's queen of locking, Locker Zee)

1904
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:11,380
It's Locker Zee.

1905
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,189
(Oh, my gosh)

1906
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,288
Locker Zee is going out again?

1907
01:29:15,289 --> 01:29:16,989
Locker Zee!

1908
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,158
So that's allowed?

1909
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,759
- It must be. - For one person to go repeatedly?

1910
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,059
Actually, Soll was supposed to enter the 1-on-1 battle.

1911
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,669
But her neck wasn't doing well,

1912
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,898
so after a lot of debate,

1913
01:29:28,899 --> 01:29:30,869
I decided to bite the bullet and go out myself.

1914
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:33,769
I felt like I ended up putting a lot of pressure on her,

1915
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,640
so I feel bad about that.

1916
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:38,339
I just hope Locker Zee dances well,

1917
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,109
and returns without any injuries.

1918
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:43,179
In that case, Halo of Wolf'Lo,

1919
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,448
which battler will enter from Wolf'Lo?

1920
01:29:45,449 --> 01:29:48,549
The battler from Wolf'Lo will beat Locker Zee.

1921
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,818
It could be Baby Sleek.

1922
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:51,119
- Then it must be Baby Sleek. - From Wolf'Lo,

1923
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:52,260
we have Baby Sleek.

1924
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:54,358
It's Baby Sleek.

1925
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:56,229
(So the time has come.)

1926
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,630
(This is great for us, but...)

1927
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,568
- Locker Zee must be feeling bad. - I know.

1928
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:06,509
The Elimination Battle, Round Five.

1929
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:08,139
It's Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek...

1930
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,109
versus Deep N Dap's Locker Zee.

1931
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,109
You know the feedback you got? You just have to address that well.

1932
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:16,680
It wouldn't have been surprising no matter who came out,

1933
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:19,188
because they're all so strong.

1934
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:22,019
But I think that's what made me even more ambitious.

1935
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,720
I wanted to win no matter what.

1936
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:24,890
She put her hat on.

1937
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:26,960
So it's come to this.

1938
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,459
We had been winning the solo rounds,

1939
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,500
so I felt I had to win.

1940
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,698
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1941
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:37,469
Let's go, Locker Zee!

1942
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,409
Locker Zee, let's go!

1943
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:42,238
The desperate battle between these two dancers,

1944
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,709
who each need to win, begins now.

1945
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,879
Are you guys ready?

1946
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,309
(The 1-on-1 battle for Round 5 begins now.)

1947
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:48,609
- Let's go! - Fight!

1948
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,278
(Locker Zee from Deep N Dap goes first.)

1949
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,390
Let's go, Locker Zee!

1950
01:30:52,819 --> 01:30:54,149
I have to stay calm no matter what.

1951
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,939
(Whooping)

1952
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:14,710
This is so funky.

1953
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,100
She's so good!

1954
01:31:39,699 --> 01:31:41,698
- She's great! - In 5, 4, 3...

1955
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:43,568
- and 2, 1. - Let's go!

1956
01:31:43,569 --> 01:31:47,239
- In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Let's go!

1957
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:48,539
Switch!

1958
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:51,840
This time, I showed off my personality well.

1959
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,310
Switch!

1960
01:31:53,579 --> 01:31:54,909
Baby Sleek...

1961
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:56,880
from Wolf'Lo.

1962
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:00,319
It was funky, but it didn't feel threatening to me at all.

1963
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,729
(This is incredible.)

1964
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:20,010
(Here I come.)

1965
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,328
She looks so great!

1966
01:32:39,329 --> 01:32:40,460
This is ridiculous.

1967
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,239
(I love this.)

1968
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:04,148
In 5, 4...

1969
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:06,749
and 3, 2, 1.

1970
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,920
The battle is over.

1971
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:11,889
Give it up.

1972
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:12,989
You did so great.

1973
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,630
(It was a great battle!)

1974
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:16,630
My pants are all wet now.

1975
01:33:17,329 --> 01:33:19,430
She is crazy.

1976
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,630
What a nice flow.

1977
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:25,369
That was Deep N Dap's Locker Zee and Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek's battle.

1978
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,840
You channelled your dancing great.

1979
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:30,310
But Baby Sleek really put her life on the line.

1980
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:31,640
Seriously.

1981
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,849
She threw her whole body into it.

1982
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,380
I was really shocked.

1983
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,319
How does she keep moving like that?

1984
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,550
She's older than I am.

1985
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:41,649
I really did my best.

1986
01:33:41,689 --> 01:33:44,389
I have to do all I can,

1987
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:48,528
and I had to win and bring home the victory in that situation.

1988
01:33:48,529 --> 01:33:49,999
I felt a lot of pressure,

1989
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,329
so I went in thinking I had to take it seriously.

1990
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,999
We will now reveal the results of the battle.

1991
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,839
Fight judges, open your cards.

1992
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,068
In 3, 2, 1.

1993
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:02,310
(Baby Sleek versus Locker Zee's big matchup! What's the result?)

1994
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:04,510
One!

1995
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:06,050
(Wolf'Lo 3, Deep N Dap 0)

1996
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:13,889
With a score of 3 to 0, Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek wins.

1997
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:15,289
Locker Zee, you did well.

1998
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:17,289
We're proud of you, Locker Zee.

1999
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:18,419
You did a great job.

2000
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,989
(The dancers give Locker Zee a heartfelt round of applause.)

2001
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:25,930
No, don't do that. You did a great job.

2002
01:34:26,029 --> 01:34:28,629
No, Locker Zee's crying. Don't cry!

2003
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:30,300
She must've felt so much pressure.

2004
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:32,269
Why are you crying? You did a great job!

2005
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:33,909
- That's right! - That's right!

2006
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:35,669
(Don't cry.)

2007
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,908
Yes, don't cry. You did a great job.

2008
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:39,148
Locker Zee, you did great!

2009
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:40,209
Don't cry!

2010
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:42,309
- You did great! - You did great!

2011
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,479
You did great.

2012
01:34:43,949 --> 01:34:47,349
I felt like I was crumbling.

2013
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:50,688
I went out as the ace of my crew, but did I fail to live up to that?

2014
01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:54,090
Everything I'd held back came up and made me tear up.

2015
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,000
Oh, no.

2016
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,499
Gosh.

2017
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,269
To come out twice representing your team,

2018
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:03,799
even though winning is important,

2019
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,639
it must've been even harder to win over your own self.

2020
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,709
But your dancing now seemed more enjoyable and impressive...

2021
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:11,908
than even your dancing earlier.

2022
01:35:11,909 --> 01:35:14,449
That was really impressive, and great to see.

2023
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:18,778
Honestly, when Locker Zee started dancing to the beat,

2024
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:20,549
I was shocked by how good you were and thought your body would rip.

2025
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:23,090
But I didn't know Baby Sleek would put so much effort in.

2026
01:35:24,489 --> 01:35:26,488
She was really fighting hard...

2027
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:29,129
to beat a younger dancer.

2028
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:31,759
I felt that this passion of an older dancer was amazing.

2029
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,398
As a colleague in dance, I feel grateful to Baby Sleek.

2030
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:36,799
(I'm the one who's grateful.)

2031
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,339
Thank you for your kind words.

2032
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,669
Street Woman Fighter 2.

2033
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,239
The current score is 3 to 2.

2034
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:45,339
It Wolf'Lo, which won three times, wins this round again,

2035
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,509
they will be confirmed as surviving and the Elimination Battle will end.

2036
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:52,278
On the other hand, Deep N Dap needs to win this round...

2037
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,249
to tie the score again...

2038
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:56,759
and earn the chance to battle again to avoid elimination.

2039
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,759
Both crews definitely need this win.

2040
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,788
Which members will be the stars of this round?

2041
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,499
The next round is Round Six,

2042
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,670
the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

2043
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,568
Let's go!

2044
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:11,538
Who are the strongest duet battlers from Deep N Dap?

2045
01:36:11,539 --> 01:36:12,938
Minny Park will come out.

2046
01:36:12,939 --> 01:36:14,408
Leader of Deep N Dap, Mina Myoung, who are your best duet battlers?

2047
01:36:14,409 --> 01:36:15,770
They're holding hands.

2048
01:36:16,539 --> 01:36:19,409
Deep N Dap's 2-on-2 battlers...

2049
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:23,019
are JJ and Locker Zee.

2050
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:26,989
(Deep N Dap's Duet Battle Combo, Locker Zee and JJ)

2051
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:28,849
Locker Zee's entering again?

2052
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:30,818
Those two are the battlers.

2053
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:32,529
They're frontline soldiers.

2054
01:36:32,859 --> 01:36:34,959
In that case, who are Wolf'Lo's strongest battlers,

2055
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,399
who will take the victory from Deep N Dap in battle?

2056
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:41,770
Wolf'Lo's 2-on-2 battlers...

2057
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,368
are Haechi Wang and Yeni Cho.

2058
01:36:45,369 --> 01:36:46,908
(Wolf'Lo's Duet Battle Combo, Yeni Cho and Haechi Wang)

2059
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:48,670
(This is going to be a fun one.)

2060
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:52,309
This combination is so fresh.

2061
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:54,078
I felt very nervous,

2062
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:57,219
because we'd never seen those two paired together before.

2063
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:58,778
(JJ secretly prepares something.)

2064
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:00,019
(Looking around)

2065
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,249
She's wearing a matching outfit.

2066
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,389
She looks good!

2067
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,019
(JJ was wearing her battle outfit inside her outer layer of clothes.)

2068
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,688
What's this? Will she be locking?

2069
01:37:06,689 --> 01:37:08,260
They must be locking.

2070
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:10,429
The genres we dance are different,

2071
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,829
so it's a fight between who's able to show off their style better.

2072
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:15,528
If we lose here, Deep N Dap is finished.

2073
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,738
We have to win this no matter what.

2074
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:20,868
If they win, Wolf'Lo will be confirmed as survivors,

2075
01:37:20,869 --> 01:37:23,679
and Deep N Dap will only get their final chance at an upset...

2076
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,908
if they win this round.

2077
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:26,350
I'm so nervous.

2078
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,549
Locker Zee and JJ from Deep N Dap...

2079
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:30,778
go up against Yeni Cho and Haechi Wang from Wolf'Lo.

2080
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:32,749
We are starting the Duet Battle between the strongest dancers now.

2081
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:35,089
Are you guys ready? Fight!

2082
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,859
Let's go!

2083
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,288
(Yeni Cho and Haechi Wang from Wolf'Lo go first.)

2084
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:42,630
Let's show off the hip-hop that we dance really impressively.

2085
01:37:44,529 --> 01:37:45,930
Show us what you got!

2086
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:55,170
Yes!

2087
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:56,479
(Impressed)

2088
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:08,050
It didn't feel very threatening.

2089
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:23,800
They both feel very weighty.

2090
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:28,340
In 3, 2, 1.

2091
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,010
Switch!

2092
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:32,340
Deep N Dap's JJ and...

2093
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:37,118
Switch! Deep N Dap's JJ and Locker Zee.

2094
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,219
Get it!

2095
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,350
What? MJ?

2096
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:43,759
(Automatically reacting)

2097
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,988
Look at the song they chose.

2098
01:38:44,989 --> 01:38:46,788
Let's go, Locker Zee!

2099
01:38:46,789 --> 01:38:48,259
We'll really win this one.

2100
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:49,500
Let's get the mood in our favour.

2101
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:55,029
(Holler!)

2102
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:06,210
Rock it.

2103
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:07,979
Yes.

2104
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:10,649
(We're jamming too.)

2105
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:21,289
Hey!

2106
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,930
Let's go!

2107
01:39:23,859 --> 01:39:25,130
Let's go!

2108
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,399
- Let's go! - They're strong.

2109
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:33,169
(Impressed)

2110
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,510
(This is insane.)

2111
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,109
They're really in this to win.

2112
01:39:41,449 --> 01:39:46,250
- In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Let's go!

2113
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,659
The battle is over.

2114
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:54,129
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2115
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:56,828
That's insane!

2116
01:39:56,829 --> 01:39:58,500
That was insane! You tore it up!

2117
01:39:59,829 --> 01:40:02,129
- That was so great! - You did so great.

2118
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:04,339
You did so great.

2119
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:07,009
We were 100 percent satisfied with our performance.

2120
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:09,738
I know we totally dominated for this one.

2121
01:40:09,739 --> 01:40:10,909
That was lit.

2122
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,108
They really gritted their teeth.

2123
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:14,148
They did well.

2124
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:16,619
If Deep N Dap wins this one, it'll be a battle of the leaders.

2125
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,979
The final round.

2126
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:19,520
We won't know till the very end.

2127
01:40:19,689 --> 01:40:22,519
(To prevent spoilers, the audience left before Round 6 results.)

2128
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,089
It was a lot more fun than watching it on TV.

2129
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:27,488
- It was insane. - Everyone tore it up.

2130
01:40:27,489 --> 01:40:29,698
I can't predict who's going to win at all right now.

2131
01:40:29,699 --> 01:40:31,559
- My vote's for Wolf'Lo. - Mine's for Deep N Dap.

2132
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,769
- Wolf'Lo. - Deep N Dap.

2133
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,029
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2134
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,099
Street Woman Fighter 2.

2135
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,799
We have the Elimination Battle between Wolf'Lo and Deep N Dap...

2136
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,769
to determine the second crew to be eliminated.

2137
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,938
Which crew will be eliminated,

2138
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:45,309
marking the end of their journey on Street Woman Fighter 2?

2139
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:48,879
Let's see the results of the battle.

2140
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,818
Fight judges, open your cards.

2141
01:40:50,819 --> 01:40:53,420
In 3, 2, 1.

2142
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:59,728
(Happy)

2143
01:40:59,729 --> 01:41:01,459
(Unhappy)

2144
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:03,759
- We got a perfect score. - We did a great job!

2145
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,868
With a score of 3 to 0, it's Deep N Dap's victory.

2146
01:41:06,869 --> 01:41:08,199
(Elimination Battle: Wolf'Lo, Lose versus Deep N Dap, Win)

2147
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:10,738
- I agree. - The duo matched well.

2148
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:13,108
- They did well. - I'm so proud of them.

2149
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:15,068
- They're going to Round Seven. - It's really happening.

2150
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,238
Oh, no.

2151
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:17,679
I felt sorry,

2152
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,809
and I felt that we could lose and end up going home.

2153
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:21,010
I felt anxious.

2154
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:25,449
You chose a great song for a locking performance.

2155
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,818
You even mixed in Michael Jackson's signature move,

2156
01:41:27,819 --> 01:41:29,488
and tore up all the beats.

2157
01:41:29,489 --> 01:41:31,089
The refreshing nature of your dance couldn't be beat.

2158
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,688
Wolf'Lo performed very well too,

2159
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:36,429
but in terms of energy, Deep N Dap was the clear winner.

2160
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:40,229
I think Locker Zee is amazing.

2161
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:42,398
- Gosh. - You're amazing!

2162
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:43,500
Seriously.

2163
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,738
I think she finally feels a bit relieved, right?

2164
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:48,009
- Yes. - Right.

2165
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:50,608
I think Deep N Dap survives only as a group.

2166
01:41:50,609 --> 01:41:54,078
They need a team and a crew.

2167
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:57,379
Your performances keep showing us that, over and over.

2168
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:59,250
That really makes me emotional.

2169
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:02,449
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2170
01:42:02,819 --> 01:42:04,959
Deep N Dap's Locker Zee and JJ...

2171
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,688
brought home the victory,

2172
01:42:06,689 --> 01:42:09,898
making the score tied once again.

2173
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:11,929
(Elimination Battle Current Score, Wolf'Lo: 3, Deep N Dap: 3)

2174
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:14,430
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2175
01:42:14,569 --> 01:42:16,438
The Elimination Battle between Deep N Dap and Wolf'Lo...

2176
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:17,669
stands at a score of 3 to 3,

2177
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:20,269
bringing us to the final round, Round Seven.

2178
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:22,068
The final round of the Elimination Battle...

2179
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:24,579
is a 1-on-1 Leader Battle.

2180
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,908
(Wolf'Lo's Halo versus Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung)

2181
01:42:25,909 --> 01:42:27,709
- Let's go! - Get it!

2182
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:29,549
Mina Myoung!

2183
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:30,648
Halo!

2184
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:33,349
It's crazy that it'll be decided with this.

2185
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:35,188
Why are you doing this to the leaders?

2186
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:38,419
To think that whether or not the crew goes on depends on me...

2187
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:39,728
- I don't even want to consider it. - Seriously.

2188
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:41,188
Putting this at the end is cruel.

2189
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:43,459
- Good luck, leaders! - Good luck, leaders.

2190
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,328
Don't feel pressured. Enjoy yourself.

2191
01:42:45,329 --> 01:42:48,198
Because I feel the pressure and a sense of responsibility,

2192
01:42:48,199 --> 01:42:49,739
I have to win no matter what.

2193
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:51,899
No pressure.

2194
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:53,039
(Okay!)

2195
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,539
I'll do my best to ensure my crew isn't eliminated.

2196
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,679
With the victory from this, the final round,

2197
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:01,049
one of these crews will definitely be eliminated.

2198
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:03,179
We will now begin the final battle between the leaders.

2199
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:05,278
- Are you guys ready? - Let's go!

2200
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:07,988
- Good luck! - Let's go!

2201
01:43:07,989 --> 01:43:09,250
Let's go! Fight!

2202
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:12,560
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2203
01:43:13,789 --> 01:43:15,760
Let me focus on the music and concentrate.

2204
01:43:24,739 --> 01:43:27,010
(They're also concentrating 200 percent on the battle.)

2205
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:28,140
(Whooping)

2206
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,779
Was Halo always this good?

2207
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:50,930
(That was amazing.)

2208
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:56,500
You're doing great, Halo!

2209
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,569
(Totally focused)

2210
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:08,810
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2211
01:44:08,979 --> 01:44:10,020
Switch!

2212
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,118
(Halo did a great job.)

2213
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:14,219
She did so great. She was amazing.

2214
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:17,188
Switch! It's Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung.

2215
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:18,720
Mina Myoung, let's go!

2216
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:20,159
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2217
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:22,828
I'll have to do well so I don't ruin it all.

2218
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:23,829
I have to stay calm.

2219
01:44:32,069 --> 01:44:35,539
That's it! You are good!

2220
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,679
- Okay. - She is really good.

2221
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:39,710
Let's go.

2222
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:47,350
What?

2223
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:49,920
Go!

2224
01:44:52,489 --> 01:44:53,858
What's up with Mina Myoung?

2225
01:44:53,859 --> 01:44:55,359
She pulls off the dance so well.

2226
01:44:55,859 --> 01:44:58,059
Mina, let's go!

2227
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:00,470
- Mina Myoung, let's go! - Come on!

2228
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:04,438
(Going wild)

2229
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:05,469
She is doing much better.

2230
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:07,569
- Mina Myoung, let's go. - Come on.

2231
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:11,380
Come on.

2232
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:14,809
Let's go. That's it.

2233
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:17,519
- Come on. - You got this.

2234
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,349
Three, two, one.

2235
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:21,449
The battle is over.

2236
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:23,659
- All right. - Yes.

2237
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,559
Oh, my goodness.

2238
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,960
- Well done. - It was cool.

2239
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:28,829
- Both of them did well. - They did well.

2240
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,759
- Well done. - Well done.

2241
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,000
- You did well. - Well done.

2242
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:35,769
- All right. - You did well.

2243
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:38,238
You are so cool!

2244
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,568
(The dancers give them cheers and applause.)

2245
01:45:40,569 --> 01:45:41,770
You are cool.

2246
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:44,779
There is strength that comes from desperation.

2247
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,408
I think desperation and fierceness help you grow.

2248
01:45:48,409 --> 01:45:51,148
I could see that from their dance.

2249
01:45:51,149 --> 01:45:52,818
Deep N Dap and Wolf'Lo's...

2250
01:45:52,819 --> 01:45:54,949
Leader Battle came to an end.

2251
01:45:55,149 --> 01:45:57,389
Fight judges, please give it some thought...

2252
01:45:57,390 --> 01:45:59,960
and vote for the winner of the battle.

2253
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:01,728
(Sighing)

2254
01:46:01,729 --> 01:46:02,759
This is hard.

2255
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,858
This is hard.

2256
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:05,499
I don't know.

2257
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,029
No matter who wins, it was a good fight.

2258
01:46:07,399 --> 01:46:09,100
Both teams seem desperate.

2259
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:12,769
Let's check the result of the battle.

2260
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,639
There is so much we haven't shown yet,

2261
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,010
so we can't get eliminated like this.

2262
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:20,380
I want to give victory to the team members.

2263
01:46:20,649 --> 01:46:22,778
Fight judges, open your cards.

2264
01:46:22,779 --> 01:46:24,680
Three, two, one.

2265
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,288
My goodness.

2266
01:46:30,289 --> 01:46:31,920
Thank goodness.

2267
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:35,028
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

2268
01:46:35,029 --> 01:46:36,329
It's okay.

2269
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,670
(To be continued shortly)

2270
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:44,999
Fight judges, open your cards.

2271
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,310
Three, two, one.

2272
01:46:51,909 --> 01:46:52,939
One.

2273
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:56,149
(Wolf'Lo: 3, Deep N Dap: 0)

2274
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:58,448
We won.

2275
01:46:58,449 --> 01:47:00,049
(Feeling conflicted, Halo begins to cry.)

2276
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,090
Don't cry.

2277
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:04,219
You did really well.

2278
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:07,488
With a score of 3 to 0, Halo of Wolf'Lo...

2279
01:47:07,489 --> 01:47:10,560
won the last battle.

2280
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,299
(Wolf'Lo: 4, Deep N Dap: 3)

2281
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,699
You worked hard.

2282
01:47:15,329 --> 01:47:17,100
- Don't cry. - You worked really hard.

2283
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:21,810
Why do we do this every time?

2284
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:26,979
(Wolf'Lo survived the Elimination Battle once more.)

2285
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:29,350
We did really well. The crew did really well.

2286
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:31,948
- I am sorry. - The crew did really well.

2287
01:47:31,949 --> 01:47:33,078
Don't be sorry.

2288
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:34,149
(Don't say that.)

2289
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,988
- We did really well. - I am sorry.

2290
01:47:35,989 --> 01:47:37,189
I am so sorry.

2291
01:47:37,989 --> 01:47:40,859
We did really well.

2292
01:47:40,989 --> 01:47:42,028
(Emotional)

2293
01:47:42,029 --> 01:47:43,460
This is so...

2294
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,999
It's too bad. Mina Myoung did really well.

2295
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,738
Firstly, it was very cool.

2296
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:55,438
Being the leader of a crew,

2297
01:47:55,439 --> 01:48:00,379
I know how hard it can be to bear that weight.

2298
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:02,179
It was hard to choose because I could relate...

2299
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:04,948
to how the leaders bottled up the pressure...

2300
01:48:04,949 --> 01:48:07,148
and proved themselves with dance.

2301
01:48:07,149 --> 01:48:11,118
But I Halo showed the moves that were a bit more relaxed.

2302
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:14,688
They helped us watch the dance with more ease.

2303
01:48:14,689 --> 01:48:19,198
I want to tell Mina Myoung that she is a good leader.

2304
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,328
You worked hard.

2305
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:22,569
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2306
01:48:24,569 --> 01:48:26,938
You are so cool, Deep N Dap!

2307
01:48:26,939 --> 01:48:29,640
- You are so cool! - Deep N Dap, we love you!

2308
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:33,209
(Everyone worked hard.)

2309
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:35,710
They poured out their energy for the final battle.

2310
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:38,379
The second crew that will unfortunately leave...

2311
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,649
Street Woman Fighter 2 is Deep N Dap.

2312
01:48:44,289 --> 01:48:46,829
(The eliminated crew: Deep N Dap)

2313
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:49,688
When will I get another chance to take the stage...

2314
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:52,299
with such incredible dancers?

2315
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:54,898
I am really thankful that I was given that chance.

2316
01:48:54,899 --> 01:48:56,769
It's an experience I would never forget.

2317
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:58,970
Members, I love you guys so much.

2318
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:02,109
I shed tears continuously...

2319
01:49:02,539 --> 01:49:06,209
because Deep N Dap wasn't able to get good results.

2320
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:09,349
I felt like our work was getting disregarded.

2321
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:10,920
It was really hard.

2322
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:14,618
But after the battle against Wolf'Lo,

2323
01:49:14,619 --> 01:49:17,618
I will be able to leave with the thought, "We danced well."

2324
01:49:17,619 --> 01:49:18,759
Thank you.

2325
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,890
I ask for good reactions.

2326
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:26,099
- She is incredible. - Who will give reactions like JJ?

2327
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,430
I know. Who will do it once JJ leaves?

2328
01:49:28,869 --> 01:49:32,269
Firstly, I want to tell...

2329
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:36,210
the Wolf'Lo members...

2330
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:39,609
that it was an honour to have a battle against them.

2331
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:45,550
Where would I get a chance to have a dance battle against Halo?

2332
01:49:45,979 --> 01:49:49,049
I was very scared until I came up the stage.

2333
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:51,819
But once I came up the stage, I had so much fun.

2334
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:57,158
I learned why people love dance battles so much...

2335
01:49:57,159 --> 01:49:59,500
through this experience.

2336
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:04,599
Members, I love you so much. Thank you.

2337
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,469
We lost in all of the individual battles,

2338
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:08,209
but we won in all of the team battles.

2339
01:50:08,210 --> 01:50:09,769
(But we won in all of the team battles.)

2340
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,239
- You did well. - We acknowledge that.

2341
01:50:11,579 --> 01:50:12,938
They did really well.

2342
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:16,079
(Deep N Dap always gave their all for the best performance.)

2343
01:50:17,949 --> 01:50:21,250
And as for the crew in which I spent my fierce 20s,

2344
01:50:23,489 --> 01:50:24,789
1MILLION,

2345
01:50:26,289 --> 01:50:28,789
I will finally be able to let it go.

2346
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:35,569
(Mina Myoung collects herself and delivers her sincerity.)

2347
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:40,840
(At this moment, they remember their past.)

2348
01:50:44,939 --> 01:50:49,479
Lia told me that I did well,

2349
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:51,220
so I was very happy.

2350
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:55,648
(Right after the Leader Battle)

2351
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:56,818
My goodness.

2352
01:50:56,819 --> 01:50:57,960
You did well.

2353
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:01,629
- You cried first. - No, I didn't.

2354
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:02,688
Come on.

2355
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:03,999
(Lia Kim's compliment made Mina Myoung cry.)

2356
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,129
- Don't cry. - It's okay.

2357
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:09,669
Lia doesn't give compliments easily.

2358
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:10,699
I am the same.

2359
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:12,199
Don't cry just yet.

2360
01:51:12,539 --> 01:51:16,069
No. Lia told me that I did well.

2361
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:19,109
It made me emotional.

2362
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:24,520
I want to use this opportunity...

2363
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:30,619
to thank her for the past ten years.

2364
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:32,988
(Her sincerity moves the hearts and makes the dancers cry.)

2365
01:51:32,989 --> 01:51:34,329
My goodness.

2366
01:51:35,329 --> 01:51:38,859
You did well. You worked really hard.

2367
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,630
You did really well.

2368
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:44,799
The second crew to be eliminated, Deep N Dap...

2369
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,600
may leave the fight club.

2370
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,310
Thank you for your hard work.

2371
01:51:48,569 --> 01:51:50,578
- Thank you for your hard work! - Thank you for your hard work!

2372
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:52,809
(Deep N Dap lets go of their sadness and says goodbye in a cheerful way.)

2373
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:54,278
You did well.

2374
01:51:54,279 --> 01:51:56,710
You are so cool, Deep N Dap!

2375
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:01,090
(It's time to say goodbye to everyone.)

2376
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:05,819
(It's the last moment before the colleagues leave.)

2377
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:08,158
You did really well.

2378
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:11,129
(They shared tears, pain, laughter, and growth.)

2379
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:12,130
Don't go.

2380
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,969
You should be proud of yourselves.

2381
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:15,228
- Oh, no. - Yes.

2382
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:16,529
- Yes. - Yes.

2383
01:52:16,670 --> 01:52:18,339
- You did amazing. - Yes.

2384
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:20,068
- No. - Yes.

2385
01:52:20,069 --> 01:52:23,039
How will you live without me, Bada?

2386
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,778
You were really cool.

2387
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:30,680
Hey, Kirsten. Thank you so much.

2388
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,118
Thank you for the competition.

2389
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:35,419
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2390
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:38,358
- Thank you. - Good timing.

2391
01:52:38,359 --> 01:52:39,559
(She watches Mina Myoung as she says goodbye.)

2392
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,589
- Emma, thank you. - Thank you.

2393
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:44,029
- It was nice meeting you. - Yes.

2394
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,829
Thank you for your hard work.

2395
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,898
- It was legendary. - Thank you.

2396
01:52:48,899 --> 01:52:50,500
(She finally spots Lia Kim.)

2397
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:55,038
(Mina Myoung spotted Lia Kim who was waiting for her.)

2398
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:57,779
You did well. You worked hard.

2399
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:02,249
You were amazing.

2400
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:03,719
(They clear their misunderstandings and hug each other warmly.)

2401
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:06,380
It was incredible. Seriously.

2402
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:11,089
- All right. - Thank you for your hard work.

2403
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:12,159
You worked really hard.

2404
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:16,288
I was emotional and thankful.

2405
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:19,299
Looking at her face brought back old memories.

2406
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:21,898
There aren't only bad memories between us.

2407
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:24,398
There are many good memories too.

2408
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:25,999
During the first round,

2409
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,069
she came to me as she chanted, "Big sister."

2410
01:53:28,909 --> 01:53:32,038
(The lyrics contained "Big sister" during Round 1.)

2411
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:33,578
(Mina Myoung shouted, "Big sister.")

2412
01:53:33,579 --> 01:53:35,879
- Big sister! - Big sister!

2413
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:38,920
(She wanted to say "Big sister Lia" during Round 1.)

2414
01:53:39,149 --> 01:53:42,250
She called you, "Big sister."

2415
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:45,259
That brought back memories...

2416
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,789
of the way we joked around and hung out together.

2417
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,929
Back in the day, we danced in the same studio...

2418
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:53,398
and cheered each other on.

2419
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:56,729
I was reminded of that time.

2420
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,210
I am very disappointed.

2421
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:05,309
- You were really cool. - You were really cool at the end.

2422
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:06,409
You did an amazing job.

2423
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,010
I didn't want...

2424
01:54:08,609 --> 01:54:09,680
It was incredible.

2425
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:13,118
I didn't want to embarrass you.

2426
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,519
Gosh, why would you embarrass me?

2427
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:17,090
You never embarrass me.

2428
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:20,759
You were really cool.

2429
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,359
I don't think I would have been able to do as well as you.

2430
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:24,999
Don't lie.

2431
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,060
I am serious.

2432
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:27,799
Don't lie.

2433
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,238
I wouldn't have been able to do as well as you.

2434
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:31,569
You were under a lot of pressure.

2435
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:33,169
- You worked hard. - Thank you.

2436
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:35,369
Let's make up now.

2437
01:54:37,409 --> 01:54:39,009
There was no bad blood between us.

2438
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:40,880
We didn't need to make up.

2439
01:54:40,949 --> 01:54:44,849
We just needed to talk.

2440
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:48,149
It was a really good time.

2441
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:50,960
She completely took off the title of 1MILLION.

2442
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:53,389
As Mina Myoung of Deep N Dap...

2443
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,430
and the leader of a new dance crew, I hope she will do well.

2444
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,858
Deep N Dap and 1MILLION, come together.

2445
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:01,198
What's the hand signal for Deep N Dap?

2446
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,329
There isn't one.

2447
01:55:02,369 --> 01:55:04,799
- Let's go! - I love it.

2448
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,170
(Deep N Dap and 1MILLION record the end and the new beginning.)

2449
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,908
- You worked hard. - JJ, you did well.

2450
01:55:08,909 --> 01:55:10,578
I am proud of you. Seriously.

2451
01:55:10,579 --> 01:55:12,340
(Deep N Dap leaves the fight club after a fierce competition.)

2452
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,349
It was so cool.

2453
01:55:14,350 --> 01:55:15,749
- Seriously. - Seriously.

2454
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:17,978
(Their journey comes to an end at Street Woman Fighter 2.)

2455
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:19,249
(The Deep N Dap members give each other a hug.)

2456
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,350
You were really cool.

2457
01:55:21,649 --> 01:55:23,049
We came this far thanks to you.

2458
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:25,220
Don't say that. Gooseul, you worked so hard.

2459
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:27,228
Let's hold hands.

2460
01:55:27,229 --> 01:55:29,328
- Thank you for your hard work. - To be honest, my heart is light.

2461
01:55:29,329 --> 01:55:30,930
- My heart is light. - Seriously.

2462
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,800
- We showed what we could do. - That's right.

2463
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:36,069
What did you gain through Street Woman Fighter 2?

2464
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:37,199
Deep N Dap.

2465
01:55:37,539 --> 01:55:38,739
I gained my team.

2466
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:40,270
Two, three.

2467
01:55:40,271 --> 01:55:43,108
- Hello, we are Deep N Dap. - Hello, we are Deep N Dap.

2468
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:45,339
(Their first moment was a bit awkward.)

2469
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:48,908
I experienced many things as a member of Deep N Dap.

2470
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:52,149
We thought hard together and prepared for performances.

2471
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:54,989
Although the process was hard, everything was fun.

2472
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:57,318
I am the youngest member of the crew.

2473
01:55:57,319 --> 01:56:00,759
The older members looked after me well,

2474
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,260
so I could be happy throughout the show.

2475
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:06,759
We comforted each other throughout the competition.

2476
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,329
I was really thankful for that.

2477
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:09,999
Let's trust each other, okay?

2478
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,340
- I totally do. - Seriously.

2479
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:12,499
One, two, three.

2480
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,310
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2481
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:18,010
Thanks for the members' trust, we could make this possible.

2482
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:21,309
I think it's a miracle that dancers of different genres...

2483
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:24,649
joined forces and came this far.

2484
01:56:24,850 --> 01:56:29,250
I am so thankful that the members performed as a team in the end.

2485
01:56:29,319 --> 01:56:32,420
This isn't the end, but a beginning for us.

2486
01:56:32,659 --> 01:56:34,228
We are...

2487
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:36,788
- Deep N Dap! - Deep N Dap!

2488
01:56:36,789 --> 01:56:37,929
Thank you!

2489
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:40,770
- We love you! - We love you! Thank you!

2490
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,038
(We root for Deep N Dap's step toward the new beginning.)

2491
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:48,010
(The crew that gave the best moment, Deep N Dap, goodbye.)

2492
01:56:48,170 --> 01:56:50,640
(Revealing the next mission)

2493
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:52,979
What is this? I am scared.

2494
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:55,349
Guys, what do you think is happening?

2495
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:57,519
I don't know. Why are we here again?

2496
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,050
- I think something big will happen. - I know.

2497
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:01,554
They won't make us do a dance battle, right?

2498
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:02,920
Don't even talk about battles.

2499
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:05,119
Maybe we will get presents.

2500
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:06,618
For our hard work.

2501
01:57:06,619 --> 01:57:09,260
I think they are going to invite us to a pool party.

2502
01:57:09,489 --> 01:57:12,000
A pool party? Again?

2503
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:15,669
(They forgot about the competition and had a hot pool party.)

2504
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:17,028
I can't think of anything.

2505
01:57:17,029 --> 01:57:19,140
They always surprise us.

2506
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:20,340
Maybe something will be decided.

2507
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:22,609
- What? - What?

2508
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:25,538
(I know this song!)

2509
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:26,710
Hold on.

2510
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,380
(Hwasa's music video gets played on the screen.)

2511
01:57:28,381 --> 01:57:29,408
- What? - What?

2512
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:30,649
- What? - It's Hwasa.

2513
01:57:31,149 --> 01:57:32,379
Why is Hwasa on the screen?

2514
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:33,449
What?

2515
01:57:33,579 --> 01:57:34,789
What's going on?

2516
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:36,449
- What? - What?

2517
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:39,189
Hwasa walked out...

2518
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:40,589
and I was like, "Am I still asleep?"

2519
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:42,689
Oh, my goodness. It's actually her.

2520
01:57:43,159 --> 01:57:44,229
Hwasa showed up.

2521
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:45,359
I had no words.

2522
01:57:45,529 --> 01:57:46,858
Hello.

2523
01:57:46,859 --> 01:57:48,399
(It's nice to meet you.)

2524
01:57:50,029 --> 01:57:54,608
(She is behind the mega-hit songs such as "Maria" and "Twit.")

2525
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:57,778
(She shows fancy performances with her explosive energy.)

2526
01:57:57,779 --> 01:57:59,538
(She is the queen of performances with daring charms!)

2527
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:01,310
(The solo artist, Hwasa)

2528
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,278
(Hwasa came to Street Woman Fighter 2.)

2529
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:07,788
She is a current female idol singer and the icon of the era.

2530
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:09,648
I am a huge fan of her. I was just like,

2531
01:58:09,649 --> 01:58:10,818
"Am I dreaming?"

2532
01:58:10,819 --> 01:58:13,930
I was honoured to be there at the moment.

2533
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,930
I really loved it. Seriously.

2534
01:58:16,729 --> 01:58:19,659
"Unrivalled" is the word that suits her.

2535
01:58:19,699 --> 01:58:21,130
She is a diva. She is the epitome of a diva.

2536
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,770
She is so pretty.

2537
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:26,239
This is so sudden.

2538
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:30,409
As a regular viewer of Street Woman Fighter 2,

2539
01:58:30,439 --> 01:58:32,538
- I am so honoured... - Is it a dream or a reality?

2540
01:58:32,539 --> 01:58:35,649
to be a part of the show.

2541
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:38,779
You survived,

2542
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:41,149
so I want to congratulate you.

2543
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:44,019
(Thank you.)

2544
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:45,489
I am here...

2545
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:49,090
A new mission!

2546
01:58:49,829 --> 01:58:52,760
To reveal the next mission.

2547
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:55,829
The next mission is...

2548
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:59,239
the choreography proposal for my new song.

2549
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:00,840
(Getting up)

2550
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:03,470
- That's incredible. - I love it.

2551
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:06,340
My teammates have an advantage.

2552
01:59:06,409 --> 01:59:09,309
Vessi and I were in Team Hwasa...

2553
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:10,919
for a year and a half to two years and a half.

2554
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:14,049
It wasn't for any other singer, but Hwasa.

2555
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:15,688
So I was more determined to win.

2556
01:59:15,689 --> 01:59:17,288
You choreographed "Maria."

2557
01:59:17,289 --> 01:59:18,420
This is mine.

2558
01:59:18,489 --> 01:59:20,219
- This is mine. - It's ours.

2559
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:22,560
I created many dances for Hwasa and MAMAMOO.

2560
01:59:22,729 --> 01:59:25,430
"Hip" was the first one.

2561
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,729
Then came "Maria."

2562
01:59:26,899 --> 01:59:31,069
Then there were "I'm a B" and "Aya."

2563
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:33,699
How would I let another choreographer take this?

2564
01:59:33,909 --> 01:59:35,469
I can't imagine such a thing.

2565
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:38,108
I will reveal my new song...

2566
01:59:38,109 --> 01:59:40,880
for which you will choreograph a dance.

2567
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:42,908
(We can't wait.)

2568
01:59:42,909 --> 01:59:43,920
Open up your ears.

2569
01:59:44,149 --> 01:59:46,279
(Listening intently)

2570
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:51,419
("Chilli" is a hot, sour, and sweet song like chilli...)

2571
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:52,919
(with the minimal instrumental, daring variations, )

2572
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,228
(and Hwasa's sharp tone that pierces the ears.)

2573
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:57,029
As soon as the music began, the members grooved to the rhythm.

2574
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,130
We were like, "What? It's so good."

2575
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:04,738
Each part has a different vibe.

2576
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:06,800
I took an instant liking to the song.

2577
02:00:07,739 --> 02:00:09,670
- It can cover all genres. - Yes.

2578
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:12,640
The song was made for dancing.

2579
02:00:12,739 --> 02:00:14,050
It will be so much fun.

2580
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:17,519
(Spicy taste)

2581
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:18,779
It's so nice.

2582
02:00:20,989 --> 02:00:23,489
(They move their bodies to the rhythm.)

2583
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:26,759
It kind of has the international feeling.

2584
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:30,260
It was something I knew we would be able to work with.

2585
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:32,199
The rhythm is really nice.

2586
02:00:35,829 --> 02:00:36,930
This is incredible.

2587
02:00:39,369 --> 02:00:41,170
(The dancers are obsessed with Hwasa's new song, "Chilli.")

2588
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:42,670
It was insane.

2589
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:44,978
I bet she put a lot of work into it.

2590
02:00:44,979 --> 02:00:47,810
I knew that you would like it.

2591
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:49,448
(Of course, we like it.)

2592
02:00:49,449 --> 02:00:51,549
I made this song as I thought about...

2593
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:54,050
the way you pour out your passion in your life.

2594
02:00:54,149 --> 02:00:57,560
So you just need to show your spicy taste.

2595
02:00:57,590 --> 02:01:00,489
I will focus on the energy the most.

2596
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:02,788
Her style, in my mind, is...

2597
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:04,328
a really fierce woman.

2598
02:01:04,329 --> 02:01:07,159
And I feel like I could bring that to life.

2599
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:12,738
The fierce charms of a woman suit MANNEQUEEN's colours.

2600
02:01:12,739 --> 02:01:16,810
At this point, the usual choreography is boring.

2601
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:21,209
Our charismatic style will be new.

2602
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:24,449
1MILLION worked with Hwasa many times, right?

2603
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,020
(Will the leader of Wolf'Lo, Halo provoke them?)

2604
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:29,648
If you aren't careful,

2605
02:01:29,649 --> 02:01:32,618
your dance will seem clichéd and boring.

2606
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:34,229
You should watch out for that.

2607
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:38,460
Our dance has never been clichéd or boring.

2608
02:01:38,729 --> 02:01:43,399
This is a mission that was designed to make me win.

2609
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:46,600
That's what I think.

2610
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:48,368
I will make sure it happens.

2611
02:01:48,369 --> 02:01:51,179
This is how 1MILLION makes a living.

2612
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:54,350
If we lose, it will be really embarrassing.

2613
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:57,210
For this mission,

2614
02:01:57,302 --> 02:02:00,172
there will be bonus points for a challenge.

2615
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:01,689
Bonus points for a challenge?

2616
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:04,259
Making a signature dance move anyone can do...

2617
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:05,988
for a dance challenge...

2618
02:02:05,989 --> 02:02:09,560
would be the best way to win the challenge bonus points.

2619
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,228
Street Woman Fighter 2.

2620
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:13,698
Please participate in the "Chilli" Challenge...

2621
02:02:13,699 --> 02:02:15,329
of the Choreography Proposal Mission for Hwasa's new song.

2622
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:18,100
Turn on the filter of the dance crew you are rooting for,

2623
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:20,000
film a dance challenge, and upload it.

2624
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:23,569
Only the videos with the filter will be counted for the result.

2625
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,310
Root for the six crews with your dance challenge videos.

2626
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:28,680
We need to make it very easy.

2627
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,010
It just needs to go well with the song.

2628
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:33,750
It will be perfect for short forms that are trendy these days.

2629
02:02:33,779 --> 02:02:36,449
There are so many K-pop trends on TikTok right now.

2630
02:02:36,489 --> 02:02:38,259
So I know that it's going to have to be...

2631
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:40,389
the eye-catching part of the chorus...

2632
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:42,929
and trendy enough that it makes people want to do it as well.

2633
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:45,929
I realized that we live in an era where the dancers' skills shine.

2634
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:50,839
You need to be a seasoned dancer to win these bonus points.

2635
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:52,839
I bet we will get an insane number of views.

2636
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:53,899
I have a big of confidence.

2637
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:58,109
These crews were focused on hip-hop and waacking.

2638
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:00,978
Do they even know what TikTok and reels are?

2639
02:03:00,979 --> 02:03:02,680
I think everyone will be weak except for me.

2640
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:04,009
It's Bada's specialty.

2641
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:05,149
That's right.

2642
02:03:05,779 --> 02:03:07,448
There was "Rover."

2643
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:08,889
("Rover" by KAI began a dance challenge craze.)

2644
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:10,049
(The Digeut dance of "Next Level" by aespa...)

2645
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:11,459
(went beyond a dance challenge and became a meme.)

2646
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:13,059
(Even the "Smoke" challenge...)

2647
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:16,158
(got V, Jungkook, Jay Park, and TAEYONG to participate.)

2648
02:03:16,159 --> 02:03:17,959
People have to like it in three seconds.

2649
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:21,269
When it comes to dance challenges, I am second to none.

2650
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:22,770
(To be continued shortly)

2651
02:03:22,869 --> 02:03:24,669
Mnet's Street Woman Fighter 2.

2652
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:26,299
We will now begin the vote for the Choreography Proposal Mission...

2653
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,539
for Hwasa's new song.

2654
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:29,509
Korea's queen of performances,

2655
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:31,810
Hwasa's new song will bring incredible performances.

2656
02:03:31,939 --> 02:03:34,609
Vote for the crew that showed the best performance.

2657
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:37,978
Hwasa's selection bonus points,

2658
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:40,148
"Chilli" challenge bonus points, and the public votes...

2659
02:03:40,149 --> 02:03:41,318
will determine the rankings.

2660
02:03:41,319 --> 02:03:42,550
(Hwasa's selection, challenge, and public evaluation)

2661
02:03:42,689 --> 02:03:47,858
(Challenge bonus points using the signature dance move)

2662
02:03:47,859 --> 02:03:50,559
(The song feels like...)

2663
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,300
(it was literally made for us.)

2664
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:55,369
(Lia Kim will choreograph the dance for Hwasa's solo song.)

2665
02:03:55,699 --> 02:03:57,538
(The 6 crews begin the discussion for the signature dance move.)

2666
02:03:57,539 --> 02:03:58,999
(The "Chilli" challenge!)

2667
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,938
(We are creating this for dance challenges.)

2668
02:04:01,939 --> 02:04:04,140
(Let's put all of our energy into the signature dance move!)

2669
02:04:04,210 --> 02:04:07,680
(People should be able to copy it as soon as they see it.)

2670
02:04:07,949 --> 02:04:12,118
(What's each crew's strategy?)

2671
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:13,119
(Midway Evaluation for the Choreography Proposal)

2672
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:14,589
(The day of the Midway Evaluation for the mission)

2673
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:18,020
(We mixed in the hip-hop moves that suit "Chilli.")

2674
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:20,589
(Let's make sure we don't embarrass ourselves.)

2675
02:04:20,590 --> 02:04:21,959
(First of all, )

2676
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,389
(I really liked it.)

2677
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,999
(I saw your eyes go crazy.)

2678
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,028
(In overall, )

2679
02:04:27,029 --> 02:04:28,630
(I am very excited about what Wolf'Lo will show.)

2680
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,329
(The Midway Evaluation begins for BEBE.)

2681
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:35,509
(I think my expectations were too high.)

2682
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:39,278
(Finding a choreography the artist can be satisfied with...)

2683
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:41,380
(can be hard.)

2684
02:04:41,449 --> 02:04:42,449
(What will be the result for BEBE?)

2685
02:04:42,609 --> 02:04:45,149
(Finally, it's the day of the Choreography Proposal Mission.)

2686
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:46,180
(Isn't it insane?)

2687
02:04:46,579 --> 02:04:48,089
(They show the textbook example!)

2688
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:49,249
(They command the stage.)

2689
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,288
(They gave a good performance without losing their colours.)

2690
02:04:51,289 --> 02:04:52,889
(Their strengths shined on the stage.)

2691
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:54,560
(What? It's Hwasa!)

2692
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:56,430
(I like it! It's "Chilli!")

2693
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:00,499
(But here is the thing about 1MILLION's choreography.)

2694
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,999
(The dance moves for the verses...)

2695
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,599
(are too weak.)

2696
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:06,199
(I want to see various dance moves.)

2697
02:05:06,869 --> 02:05:09,309
(The crew members don't come together as one.)

2698
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:11,340
(I feel like they are doing different things.)

2699
02:05:11,409 --> 02:05:13,879
(It looks like they are struggling.)

2700
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:17,408
(We had a hard time together.)

2701
02:05:17,409 --> 02:05:22,488
(If we don't go over this, it might happen again.)

2702
02:05:22,489 --> 02:05:25,789
(I want to apologize.)

2703
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:28,060
(I couldn't allow it.)

2704
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:31,960
(Something like that had never happened in my life.)

2705
02:05:33,093 --> 02:05:36,893
(The atmosphere is heavy. What happened to MANNEQUEEN?)
