1
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,089
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,899
Let's take a break.

3
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,030
It's tough, isn't it?

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,500
It's so tricky.

5
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,230
(The newcomer and a 3rd-year host look very different.)

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,370
(The new judge has been sighing for the 100th time.)

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,140
I'm very angry.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,740
(He had no idea...)

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,909
(that watching dance-offs on the spot could be intense.)

10
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,450
(Shownu can't choose the winner as soon as it ends.)

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,549
(Deliberating)

12
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,979
(He does his best to hold up the card as he's a judge.)

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,689
(Shownu has never...)

14
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,689
(picked a tie.)

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,560
(Shownu is a judge that has some backbone.)

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,960
(Exhaling)

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,829
(Mike Song expresses his pain.)

18
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:57,899
(Headache)

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,630
Judging this fight was too difficult.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,130
It was super difficult.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,939
(But his commentary is on point.)

22
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:10,109
(He expresses how moved he is with his face.)

23
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,510
His way of speaking is growing on me.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,180
(Monika is starting to like his commentary.)

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,780
(The battle brings out his American side.)

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,650
(They fall for his vibe.)

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,650
(This is America.)

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,090
(The host of Street Woman Fighter 2 that can speak 3 languages)

29
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,120
(That's scary.)

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,260
(Battle together.)

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,790
(He speaks English and Japanese for the global crews.)

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,299
(And he looks after the dancers.)

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,329
(How do you say, "Good luck," in Japanese?)

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:40,239
(Monika is a judge that wants the best for the dancers.)

35
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,310
(I hope you find your lessons.)

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,810
(Agreeing)

37
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,310
(Monika judges them rationally from a dancer's perspective.)

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,450
She's so cool-headed.

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,680
It's accurate.

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,719
(Acknowledging her)

41
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,849
This is fun.

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,989
I should work harder.

43
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:58,790
It's the K-pop Death match Mission with a live audience.

44
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,790
You're scared, aren't you?

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,590
I'll enjoy watching your Elimination Battle.

46
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,629
We can't just let them copy it.

47
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,659
(What happened when they exchanged copy sections?)

48
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,069
(The first crew to be eliminated on Street Woman Fighter 2)

49
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,699
(Vote for the performance to determine the winner!)

50
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,069
(To be continued shortly)

51
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,210
(The winning crew's benefits)

52
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,180
(A 50,000-dollar prize)

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,050
(Diamond rings for the champions from amondz)

54
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,819
(D-day of the K-pop Death match Mission)

55
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,060
(CJ ENM Ilsan Production Center)

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,729
(The crowd has come to the hall to support the dancers.)

57
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,099
Hello, everyone.

58
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,229
Have a seat here.

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,699
The colours are gorgeous.

60
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,430
(The dancers doll up for the performance.)

61
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,569
It's up to you, but brighter colours work.

62
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,710
Here we go.

63
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,639
It's so distinctive.

64
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,139
So, the overall theme for your makeup is...

65
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,750
getting darkened.

66
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,819
We want to be proper monsters and show them our performance.

67
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,620
- So, you want to rip it. - Yes.

68
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:04,259
As you perform more fiercely,

69
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,659
- you sweat, and it gets dry, right? - Yes.

70
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,259
It should stay unchanged for a long time, then.

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,500
It must be comfortable and feel raw.

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,030
- It's really natural, though. - Right.

73
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,300
- You can see the whole texture. - Yes.

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,439
(The crews get makeup according their performances.)

75
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,039
I don't think this makeup will come off even after the performance.

76
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,610
Yes, it's pretty strong.

77
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,979
(Their makeup is completed by the expert artists.)

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,490
(All 8 crews are ready for their performances.)

79
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,889
(K-pop Death match Mission begins at last.)

80
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,490
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

81
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,960
We determine the number-one crew of the whole world...

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,530
on Street Woman Fighter 2.

83
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,569
I'm the host, Kang Daniel. Nice to meet you.

84
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,969
(It's good to see you!)

85
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,139
(It's our audience!)

86
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,340
Hi!

87
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,710
I can't believe I'm part of this.

88
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,539
- It's like I'm watching TV. - Right?

89
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,979
For the first time on Street Woman Fighter 2,

90
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,909
the audience has joined the shoot. This time, the mission is...

91
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,210
the K-pop Death match Mission.

92
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,719
(It's a death match?)

93
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,479
The K-pop Death match Mission.

94
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,750
Of the two crews that compete in the same entertainment agency,

95
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,590
you can vote for 1 crew, so 4 crews in total.

96
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,060
After all the eight performances,

97
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,100
insert your ballot into the ballot box.

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,129
The extra points from the live audience...

99
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,699
go to the crew that earned more votes today.

100
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,709
The scores of the K-pop Death match Mission...

101
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,670
will consist of the points...

102
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,139
from the fight judges, live audience,

103
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,779
and the global public evaluation.

104
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,480
I give you the judges who will evaluate the performances with you.

105
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,519
(Cheering)

106
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,689
The last judge is...

107
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,490
a special judge.

108
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,120
Who will sit in the middle?

109
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,459
Who do you think it will be?

110
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,490
Mr. Choi Young Jun?

111
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,329
The empress of artists that is acknowledged...

112
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,199
beyond eras and generations of K-pop.

113
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,000
It's the choreographer, Bae Yoon Jung!

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,199
(Bae Yoon Jung)

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,600
(KARA's songs)

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
(Brown Eyed Girls' songs)

117
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,199
(T-ARA's songs)

118
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,339
(Girl's Day's songs)

119
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,540
(Bae Yoon Jung, the hitmaker, was sensational in Korea.)

120
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,480
She's here as a judge?

121
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,110
She's finally here.

122
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,850
It's the perfect judge for this mission.

123
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,879
Definitely.

124
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,779
- She's known to be cold, right? - Yes.

125
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,250
Let me introduce myself. I'm Bae Yoon Jung, a choreographer.

126
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,850
Welcome.

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,990
What would be your judging criteria today?

128
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,959
Teamwork, the choreography, style, and ideas.

129
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,829
I'll take all of them into account.

130
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,060
The K-pop Death match Mission begins now.

131
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,129
- Ready? Fight! - Fight!

132
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,439
(The votes have been counted with observers in attendance.)

133
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,970
Are you guys ready to win?

134
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,439
Deep N Dap, you're dead.

135
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,740
I'm going to make a deep bow if I make a mistake today.

136
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,639
Mini, please be crazy tonight.

137
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,740
Okay. I'll be a crazy lady.

138
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,079
Please let us win the hearts of the audience.

139
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,680
The first two crews...

140
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,980
of the K-pop Death match Mission are...

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,420
LADYBOUNCE and Deep N Dap performing SM songs.

142
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,620
(Deep N Dap versus LADYBOUNCE)

143
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,589
(The two crews appear on stage.)

144
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,430
(Tense)

145
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,529
(Screaming)

146
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,870
- Mina Myoung of Deep N Dap. - Yes.

147
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,740
Do you have anything to say to LADYBOUNCE?

148
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,810
It's a crew with history, right?

149
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:11,310
And I believe it's time for Deep N Dap, the new crew,

150
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,939
to show them.

151
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,610
This will be your last mission. We'll send you home.

152
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:18,879
(Bowing in advance)

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
(Not so fast.)

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,620
Be honest. You're scared, aren't you?

155
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,660
Me? Scared?

156
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,360
It's going to be very difficult to beat us, performance-wise.

157
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,600
So, do your best.

158
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,730
(Air horns)

159
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,500
I see some sparks between Deep N Dap and LADYBOUNCE.

160
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,540
Which of these two teams will stand as a victor,

161
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,740
and which team will be on its knees?

162
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,769
(The two crews met to exchange choreographies.)

163
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,310
We thought...

164
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,149
that Deep N Dap would do something normal,

165
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,149
so we didn't feel threatened at all.

166
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,480
(Deep N Dap's dance copy section)

167
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,920
That's not too hard.

168
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,930
(Locker Zee shows her locking moves.)

169
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,230
It was as expected.

170
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,160
It was the knee drop that I knew would be in it.

171
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,399
We could definitely pull it off.

172
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,569
It was served on a silver platter,

173
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,470
so thanks for the easy dance.

174
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,639
"New," and go up.

175
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,810
Capri is pretty good at copying choreographies,

176
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,579
- so she was a huge help. - And then...

177
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,949
It's a completely different angle.

178
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,750
What kind of angle do you think this is?

179
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,920
We watched them, and they were disorganized.

180
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,860
It's so messy.

181
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,519
It's not my type.

182
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,660
She goes like this.

183
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,329
These two and these two are making different moves.

184
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,860
We just have to do it similarly.

185
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,029
I think they'll change the angle again.

186
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,269
Let's come up with a better angle for ourselves.

187
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,300
Can we just make it ours? Let's make it new, then.

188
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,600
I think we should turn it into our style...

189
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,170
and show them how it's done.

190
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,639
"This part looks better when you dance it like this."

191
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,339
(Their practice goes smoothly.)

192
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,879
- It repeats. - We're better.

193
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,209
You bet.

194
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:57,949
Our choreography is way neater.

195
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,290
Our crew is the oldest, and we have the best teamwork.

196
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,959
So, we meant to finish them...

197
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,560
with our uniformity.

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Start.

199
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,860
(LADYBOUNCE practices the timing and details.)

200
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,100
Put the fists outward, not inward.

201
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,600
When we do this, we'll put it on your shoulder.

202
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,870
You can't disregard one's experience.

203
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,000
They'll have to practice very hard to beat us.

204
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,970
- Let's do this, guys. - Let's go!

205
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,069
In 1, 2, 3!

206
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,939
- Let's go! - Let's go!

207
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,240
(Hydrating themselves before practice)

208
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,079
- It's tasty. - I love it.

209
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,480
- I feel energized. - So delicious.

210
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,919
I like how light it is.

211
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,950
It's good.

212
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,649
(They start practicing after hydration.)

213
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,289
(Looking closely)

214
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,090
Stop.

215
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,830
Zee, you look too girlish in this part.

216
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,500
- We'll have to match their vibe. - Okay.

217
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,470
You don't go like this.

218
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,500
(Mina gets their details straight.)

219
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,970
Hold on. You have very different vibes.

220
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,340
Girls, why aren't you in sync?

221
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,409
It's so bad.

222
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,440
(Flustered)

223
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,179
It's our biggest flaw. We're out of sync.

224
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:01,080
Every member of the crew is too characteristic...

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,779
that we all look different.

226
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,149
I was worried that we might be too out of sync.

227
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,320
(LADYBOUNCE practices the copy section.)

228
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,059
(Perfect teamwork)

229
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,559
(Peeking)

230
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,429
Wait, they finished it.

231
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,230
I looked because we were practicing in the same room,

232
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,759
and they copied it pretty well.

233
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,370
I'd have to give them credit for what they deserve.

234
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,769
LADYBOUNCE certainly has good teamwork.

235
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,740
That's why we focused on matching our angles...

236
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,809
and dancing in sync when we practiced.

237
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,980
Let's give it a try. Five...

238
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,610
(Deep N Dap practices LADYBOUNCE's copy section.)

239
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,649
Hang on.

240
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,950
(When they exchanged the dance copy sections)

241
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,879
(Looking up)

242
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,649
(Cheering)

243
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,929
(LADYBOUNCE did a lift, which is a tricky move.)

244
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,929
(Eyes wide open)

245
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,299
How did they do that?

246
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,029
I thought, "How should we do that?"

247
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,970
I knew that they added that to stop us.

248
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,269
They were very determined.

249
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,639
We can't pull back anymore. We have to do this.

250
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,870
Here it goes.

251
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,210
In 1, 2, 3.

252
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,639
We added a move that required teamwork...

253
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,509
because we thought that they wouldn't pull it off.

254
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,809
Great.

255
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,120
We already used this move.

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,649
I had no idea that we'd use it for this mission.

257
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,320
We have to be sincere in every mission.

258
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,320
Poor Deep N Dap.

259
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,659
I feel a little apologetic now for doing that.

260
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,629
So what? They have to overcome it.

261
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,799
- This is survival. - That's right.

262
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,029
I don't think they can do it.

263
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:27,570
I doubt they have the guts.

264
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,730
(Deep N Dap practices the lift.)

265
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,100
(The first attempt is a failure.)

266
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
- You're going too fast. - Okay.

267
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,669
I'll break you in the end

268
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:38,909
Next...

269
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,240
You have to stay.

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,610
(Gooseul landed riskily due to bad teamwork.)

271
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,750
You have to stay.

272
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
(She's out of it.)

273
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,750
Are you all right?

274
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,019
Like, "Did LADYBOUNCE do that to kill us?"

275
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,889
I resented them a little...

276
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,559
because the move was way too risky.

277
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,159
(They practice as hard as they can.)

278
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,259
(Hesitant)

279
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,289
- I grabbed it wrong, didn't I? - Yes.

280
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,429
(My chest hurts.)

281
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm fine.

282
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,830
(The members of Deep N Dap grow tired of the continuous failures.)

283
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm usually not scared, but I started getting scared.

284
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,539
I wasn't sure that it'd work.

285
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,340
It was a very important part,

286
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,879
and it was my part.

287
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,779
I thought, "This will be a total failure if I fall."

288
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,049
"What if I can't make it on stage?"

289
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,279
(The recording day of the performance)

290
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,049
(Deep N Dap starts rehearsing.)

291
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,279
Technique!

292
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,950
(Looking closely)

293
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,419
(Swaying)

294
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,129
(Gooseul failed to pull off the move.)

295
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,500
She got weak.

296
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,960
Everyone got weak.

297
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,299
I thought, "We're done for."

298
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,429
(Distressed)

299
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,669
I'm so worried.

300
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,440
I honestly can't think of anything else.

301
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,370
(And another emergency)

302
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,610
(Soll feels that something is wrong during the shoot.)

303
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:52,250
She had injured her neck,

304
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,649
then she started hyperventilating,

305
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,950
so we almost had to end the shoot.

306
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,690
Don't hurt yourself.

307
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,330
Soll was very determined to show people her skills...

308
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,129
in this mission.

309
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:07,799
I could tell that she was tolerating the pain.

310
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,529
Good work, everyone.

311
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,799
- Good work. - Thank you.

312
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,039
Thanks.

313
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
(She's proud of Soll for powering through.)

314
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,139
Great work.

315
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,580
(Soll burst into tears in the leader's arms.)

316
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,279
I kept making mistakes because of my neck.

317
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,049
Like, "What am I even doing for the team?"

318
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,690
I hate that I was causing harm to the team.

319
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,690
(Soll often made mistakes due to her neck injury.)

320
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,159
I was mad at myself for hurting.

321
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,759
Even if we lose, you're the best.

322
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,200
That's all right.

323
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,600
You were amazing.

324
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,769
I know how it feels when you want to prove yourself.

325
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,669
It was a lot of pressure, wasn't it?

326
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,139
I was also upset that I couldn't do my part.

327
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,580
And I was upset that Soll was in pain.

328
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,649
- Let's trust each other. All right? - Totally.

329
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:57,679
In 1, 2, 3.

330
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,350
- Let's go! - Let's go!

331
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,490
Deep N Dap is showing itself to the public for the first time.

332
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,960
I meant to make a strong impression.

333
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,090
We need to do well.

334
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,230
We have to make this happen.

335
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,929
(It finally begins.)

336
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,200
(Sitting in the front row, ready to watch the performance)

337
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,940
Gosh, they must be so nervous.

338
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,610
- Oh, my. - Gosh. Here they go.

339
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,269
Gooseul has to fall backward for this performance.

340
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,710
I just hope they don't get injured.

341
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,580
("Next Level" by aespa, "Kick It" by NCT 127)

342
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,820
(Performed by Deep N Dap)

343
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,720
- This part is really nice. - Hey.

344
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,320
(LADYBOUNCE's choreography section)

345
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,960
(You're killing it!)

346
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,139
There it is.

347
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,370
(Please!)

348
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,110
(Wolf'Lo is genuinely happy for the crew.)

349
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,149
Well done.

350
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,649
This is making me tear up.

351
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:42,889
(LADYBOUNCE's choreography section)

352
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,620
(Deep N Dap's choreography section)

353
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,139
Gosh, their teamwork is crazy.

354
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,639
They drilled down to every detail.

355
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,549
(Impressed)

356
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,759
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

357
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,690
Well done.

358
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,389
They improved a lot compared to the last time we saw them.

359
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,529
It's so touching.

360
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,000
They must've really wanted to win this mission.

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,700
- I can tell they practiced a lot. - Right.

362
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,100
- Gosh, their teamwork was amazing. - Yes.

363
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,669
That was crazy.

364
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,269
LADYBOUNCE must be nervous now.

365
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,070
The second crew to perform for the SM Match is...

366
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,039
LADYBOUNCE. Please get ready to perform.

367
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,840
Ready? Fight!

368
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,179
- Let's do what we've been doing. - Let's do what we've been doing.

369
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,480
Let's just stick to what we've been doing.

370
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,820
- Girls, have fun. That's it. - Let's have fun.

371
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,250
We're going to show you why our crew is...

372
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,419
the only female street dance crew in Korea...

373
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,330
through our performance.

374
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,860
You got this. LADYBOUNCE!

375
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,159
Kill it, LADYBOUNCE.

376
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,600
- I think they'll do well. - I'm looking forward to it.

377
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,000
("Next Level" by aespa, "Kick It" by NCT 127)

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,309
(Performed by LADYBOUNCE)

379
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,139
(Impressed)

380
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,309
(Covering her mouth)

381
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,369
They're good.

382
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,190
(LADYBOUNCE's choreography section)

383
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,660
(LADYBOUNCE's choreography section)

384
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,670
- I knew it. - That was so stable!

385
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,839
The creator can do better indeed.

386
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,980
- She got up right away and danced. - This is easy for her.

387
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,730
That was cool.

388
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,269
(Perfect teamwork)

389
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,849
They're definitely good.

390
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:30,880
- Right. - It's great...

391
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,950
to see their facial expressions too.

392
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,720
Look at their facial expressions.

393
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,160
(Deep N Dap's choreography section)

394
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:57,640
I love Deep N Dap's choreography.

395
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,680
- It looks like their choreography. - Their teamwork is indeed great.

396
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,180
- What? - What's she doing?

397
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,849
- She messed up. - Who messed up?

398
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,049
- Biggy. - Biggy didn't do it.

399
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,960
- Didn't she mess up just now? - Right?

400
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
But it wasn't noticeable.

401
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,490
(Deep N Dap's choreography section)

402
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,779
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

403
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,119
Their moves were so clean.

404
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,750
They played it to their strong suit.

405
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,089
Everyone was so perfect.

406
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,190
"We have 15 years of experience."

407
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:48,529
This was the SM Match of the K-pop Death match Mission.

408
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,430
Deep N Dap versus LADYBOUNCE.

409
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,660
We will now ask the audience to vote.

410
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,869
If you think Deep N Dap, who went first did better,

411
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,299
vote for number one.

412
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,470
If you think LADYBOUNCE, who went second did better,

413
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,910
vote for number two.

414
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,710
Please vote now.

415
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,680
(The audience finish voting.)

416
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,950
All right. We will now check the scores...

417
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,549
- from the fight judges. - Gosh.

418
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:12,650
(We're so curious.)

419
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,349
- Gosh. - Please.

420
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,319
I really have no idea.

421
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,019
- Both of them did so well. - I think it will be LADYBOUNCE.

422
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,589
They have completely different styles.

423
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,190
Fight judges, open your cards.

424
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,059
Gosh, come on.

425
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,329
I was nervous because I messed up the choreography.

426
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,670
I think we did a better job at executing the choreography.

427
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,900
I'm confident that we'll win.

428
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,670
I think we have a better chance at winning.

429
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,380
Three, two, one.

430
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:42,609
(Which crew did the fight judges choose as the winning crew?)

431
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,650
One.

432
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,720
(LADYBOUNCE has earned 150 points from the fight judges.)

433
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,490
With 3 to 0,

434
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,430
Deep N Dap has lost out to LADYBOUNCE.

435
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,829
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

436
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,940
I'm really disappointed about the results today.

437
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,900
But I'm grateful to my crew.

438
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,039
Through the global public evaluation, I want to show people...

439
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,940
that our hard work didn't go to waste.

440
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,079
As for the choreography sections,

441
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,279
I couldn't tell which crew created which sections.

442
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,380
Both of the crews did an amazing job.

443
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,619
LADYBOUNCE is outnumbered.

444
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,019
But despite the disadvantage regarding the size of the crew,

445
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,390
that didn't affect their performance at all.

446
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,529
Personally, I think...

447
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:30,730
facial expressions also make up the choreography.

448
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,259
Watching their facial expressions helped me get into their flow.

449
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,029
I loved both of your performances.

450
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,500
But I gave my vote to LADYBOUNCE.

451
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Good work.

452
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,940
- Thank you. - Thank you.

453
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,470
(The two crews get a round of applause for their performances.)

454
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,680
You were great!

455
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,009
- Thank you. - Thank you.

456
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,950
Girls, well done.

457
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,319
We did really well.

458
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,460
- This is so precious. - Yes. It's so precious.

459
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:02,089
All of us put our hearts into our performance.

460
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,960
Maybe that came through and moved them.

461
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
- In 1, 2, 3. I love you. - I love you.

462
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,329
It felt like getting recognized...

463
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,529
and rewarded...

464
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,029
for all the hard work we've done so far.

465
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,140
It was great.

466
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,869
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

467
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,579
Here are the crews...

468
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,680
for the JYP Match. TSUBA KILL and BEBE.

469
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,680
(This is already getting fun.)

470
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,089
(TSUBA KILL and BEBE come up to the stage.)

471
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,750
(Cheering)

472
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,920
(They enter as the audience intensely cheers for them.)

473
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,960
Gosh, this is Korea versus Japan.

474
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,430
This will be fun.

475
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,099
You'll find out today...

476
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,829
which crew is the best in Asia.

477
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,059
(Smirking)

478
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,200
(Surprised)

479
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,539
- That was bold. - I love it.

480
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,440
To be honest, I don't have high expectations...

481
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,069
because we'll do better.

482
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,240
You can check out our crazy teamwork...

483
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,109
which we will show you...

484
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,509
and evaluate our performances.

485
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,279
(Exchange of choreography to copy)

486
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,019
(The two crews gather to exchange the choreography.)

487
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,160
(They are in the same place, but their moods are different.)

488
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,720
We were all focused.

489
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,089
But I don't think that was the case with TSUBA KILL.

490
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,200
I didn't think we were facing a crisis or anything...

491
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,630
Because we got zero elimination votes.

492
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,170
(TSUBA KILL did an exceptional job in the Song Battle.)

493
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,509
(BEBE: 3 elimination votes, TSUBA KILL: 0 elimination votes)

494
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,839
- Yes! - We did it!

495
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,109
I finally feel motivated.

496
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:31,349
- I was sure we'd get it. - That's right.

497
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,180
BEBE got three votes.

498
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,549
It's like we don't have to compete to know we're better.

499
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,819
(Thrilled by getting 0 votes)

500
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,930
("MANIAC" by Stray Kids, BEBE's dance copy section)

501
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,630
We tried to show our style...

502
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,759
and make the dance hard to cover.

503
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,670
(Tatter does a difficult acrobatic move.)

504
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,099
(Snorting)

505
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,670
It's not hard.

506
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,910
It looked like they had forced those acrobatic moves into it.

507
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,240
(Confident)

508
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,849
(First, we'll applaud you.)

509
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,279
- That was cool. - That was cool.

510
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,950
I was thinking...

511
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,819
that it'd be even cooler when we cover it,

512
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,589
and I couldn't help smiling.

513
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,730
We have...

514
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,299
a cyborg named Yumeri on our team,

515
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,599
so we have nothing to worry about.

516
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,529
(One-handed front handspring)

517
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,369
(Aerial cartwheel)

518
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,309
(Two handsprings in a row)

519
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,809
They could never do that.

520
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,910
I don't think there's anyone here...

521
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:38,650
who can do Yumeri's acrobatic moves.

522
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,920
- Watch carefully. - Okay.

523
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,990
Watch carefully.

524
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:45,089
I thought our dance was definitely hard to cover.

525
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,960
(TSUBA KILL added two springs in a row to make it even harder.)

526
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,529
(Impressed)

527
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,730
Their first acrobatic move was the same as ours.

528
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,970
Both of them can do tumbling.

529
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,470
She flipped over using her head.

530
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,269
(Yumeri did a headspring which is even more difficult.)

531
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,180
I wonder if Tatter can pull that off.

532
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,579
First of all,

533
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,079
we only had a short period of time,

534
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,849
but I guess we're both really ambitious.

535
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,349
It's well-reflected in our dance pieces.

536
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,690
But I think we'll have no problem covering yours.

537
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,990
Thank you.

538
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,990
The more I think about it, the more serious I get.

539
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,799
Losing...

540
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,230
is not an option for us.

541
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,930
Because our pride is at stake here.

542
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,200
I won the main dancer title by myself,

543
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,500
but we're doing this as a team.

544
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:35,410
I didn't choreograph the piece alone this time.

545
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,170
If we lose as a team,

546
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,039
I'm sure people will say this again.

547
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,410
"They're nothing without Bada."

548
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,009
I really don't want to hear that.

549
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,579
- You guys have to prove them wrong. - Yes.

550
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,680
That really put a lot of pressure on me,

551
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,289
and it felt like my responsibility to make sure we win this one.

552
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,390
I've never tried a headspring before.

553
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,859
I'm supposed to kick as I flip over, right?

554
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,759
I noticed that she paused for a bit.

555
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,329
I wasn't really sure if I could do it in one day.

556
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,869
(Tatter struggles to learn how to do it.)

557
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,509
(Meanwhile, things are going well with TSUBA KILL.)

558
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:11,710
This is awesome.

559
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,180
The structure is out of this world!

560
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,380
(TSUBA KILL is clearly making fast progress.)

561
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,890
They had already finished learning our dance.

562
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,089
This is crazy.

563
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,259
(This is crazy!)

564
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,430
(TSUBA KILL has finished practicing.)

565
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,900
Good night.

566
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,259
I wondered if that was enough practice for them.

567
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,869
The more you practice, the better your performance gets.

568
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,569
We focused on the details.

569
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,640
We worked really hard to even align the angle of our faces.

570
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,410
I really want to do well tomorrow.

571
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,940
Better than TSUBA KILL.

572
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,210
Are you okay, by the way?

573
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,279
(Asking Tatter)

574
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,410
- Your part is the most important. - Yes.

575
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:55,150
I wanted to pull it off even if I had to over strain my body.

576
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,289
I wanted to pull it off so badly.

577
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,519
- Just keep trying. - Let's try it without the video.

578
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,430
(They pulled an all-nighter for the evaluation video.)

579
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,200
Hello. We're TSUBA KILL from Japan.

580
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,759
Our strength is...

581
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,400
each member's distinctive character and great dance skills.

582
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,339
As for the section choreographed by Bada,

583
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,509
it was really easy for all of us to cover.

584
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,940
And we also think...

585
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,880
our choreography for "Not Shy" expresses the song better.

586
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:28,250
(TSUBA KILL's dance copy section)

587
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,720
(Screaming)

588
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,150
(Applauding)

589
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,589
(They're truly impressed.)

590
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,460
Is that the section BEBE needs to cover?

591
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,430
- Yes, I think so. - It's crazy.

592
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,559
(BEBE's dance copy section)

593
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,000
How many handsprings are there?

594
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,400
BEBE added acrobatic moves too?

595
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,700
Yes, both crews did.

596
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,140
- That was great. - It was so cool.

597
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,470
Did Yumeri go to a sports college or something?

598
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,039
That was amazing. It was the best.

599
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,710
- It was the best. - We did it.

600
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:57,680
Gosh, can they do this kind of technique?

601
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,250
I wonder what BEBE will do to beat them.

602
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,819
I was a bit worried.

603
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,390
I was under a lot of pressure to do well,

604
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,960
and I was worried I might mess up.

605
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,700
I tried to stay calm.

606
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,000
(Tatter's acrobatic move went badly.)

607
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:21,769
- Gosh. - Oh, boy.

608
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,140
No.

609
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,809
- Let's go! - You can do it!

610
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,049
(She also fails her own move.)

611
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,180
Oh, boy.

612
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,450
(She even hit Lusher in the process.)

613
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,589
I was panicking, to be honest.

614
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:38,559
No, you have to keep going.

615
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,789
You can do it!

616
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:40,920
Let's go!

617
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,460
- You got this! - Go!

618
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,789
Yes!

619
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,059
You got it.

620
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,160
Let's go, Tatter.

621
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,470
(The other crews cheered them on through their performance.)

622
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,710
She did a lot of difficult moves like those handsprings.

623
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,410
She didn't hurt herself, right?

624
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,509
Gosh.

625
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,680
No, I feel like I'm going to cry.

626
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,380
My goodness.

627
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,819
That's a tough job.

628
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,990
- I want to cry. - Yes.

629
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,420
I'm crying too.

630
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,960
People are crying because...

631
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,519
they know how hard it must've been.

632
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,930
Don't cry. It's okay.

633
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,329
You didn't do a bad job. It was just a mistake.

634
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,130
You did well. Hold your head high.

635
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,869
(It was just a mistake. Hold your head high.)

636
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,440
This is our first performance as a team,

637
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,299
and more than anyone, I wanted to do well.

638
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,140
(Tears well up as she thinks about what happened.)

639
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,579
I felt terrible for my crew,

640
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,410
and I was so angry at myself.

641
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,220
I seem to be out of my depth here,

642
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,049
and I just can't accept it.

643
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:45,990
Don't dwell on it.

644
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,289
You get what I'm saying, right?

645
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't brood over it for too long.

646
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,460
Okay? I know you're good.

647
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,460
You're a good dancer.

648
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,400
You have to show the world...

649
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,529
how good you are.

650
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,700
So you need to be stronger than this.

651
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,069
Don't dwell on it,

652
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,670
and don't let people see it.

653
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,539
Except us. It's okay with us.

654
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,210
(The day of the shoot for the K-pop Death match Mission)

655
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,920
We're going to find out now?

656
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,349
(The crew that will decide who will go first)

657
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,019
- TSUBA KILL and BEBE. - Wait, gosh.

658
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,990
- No way. - JYP Match.

659
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,890
Over another dancer?

660
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,730
(Stray Kids is impressed by Yumeri's acrobatic moves.)

661
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:25,859
Did BEBE make a mistake here?

662
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,099
I wouldn't call it a mistake. It's her landing.

663
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,940
Her landing wasn't good.

664
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,200
We're going to choose...

665
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,039
TSUBA KILL.

666
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,210
Well,

667
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,049
it was just a second during the important part.

668
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,950
They made a little mistake, and it had a big impact.

669
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,880
That's right. If I had done those moves right,

670
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,089
it could've been us who get to choose who goes first.

671
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,789
It's too bad.

672
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,559
So we'll go first.

673
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,589
(For the JYP Match, TSUBA KILL will perform first.)

674
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,329
(BEBE will perform second.)

675
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,759
We can still do better!

676
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,500
They'll be dancing...

677
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,799
to "Not Shy" by ITZY and "MANIAC" by Stray Kids.

678
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,240
Let's watch TSUBA KILL's performance first.

679
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,339
Ready?

680
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,440
Fight.

681
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:14,180
(For the JYP Match, TSUBA KILL will perform first.)

682
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,750
TSUBA KILL. Let's get it.

683
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:18,180
Let's go, TSUBA KILL.

684
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,480
It's been a long journey up to this point.

685
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,190
I wanted to show people the strength of Japanese dancers.

686
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,319
("Not Shy" by ITZY, "MANIAC" by Stray Kids)

687
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,049
(TSUBA KILL's choreography section)

688
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,420
Yumeri!

689
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,559
She's amazing.

690
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,640
They're so energetic.

691
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,390
Rena's strength is shown really well.

692
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,980
(Screaming)

693
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,119
Let's go!

694
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,420
You can see through it as well. Smart.

695
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,039
(BEBE's choreography section)

696
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,259
Let's go!

697
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,559
Yumeri is showing everyone all of her skills today.

698
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,160
She just keeps dancing after that.

699
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,309
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

700
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:09,789
(TSUBA KILL's performance for the JYP Match is over.)

701
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,489
Slayed.

702
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,320
TSUBA KILL!

703
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,460
- They really killed it. - They killed it.

704
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,130
Their choreography is really tight.

705
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,599
It's full from start to finish.

706
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,099
There were so many different components.

707
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,599
I kept taking deep breaths...

708
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,739
and tried to keep the energy up in my body.

709
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,840
Tatter, stay composed.

710
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,780
And the chest pops here shouldn't look weak.

711
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,110
They should be powerful like this.

712
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,780
I'll point to someone in the audience.

713
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,179
- "You're mine." - Okay.

714
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,309
"You're mine."

715
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,050
The K-pop Death match Mission, the JYP Match.

716
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,219
BEBE's performance will now follow.

717
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,119
Ready? Fight.

718
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,360
- I can't wait. - Gosh, it's BEBE.

719
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,960
Why am I nervous?

720
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,300
I just hope Tatter doesn't hurt herself.

721
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,000
She couldn't pull it off before.

722
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,840
On a big stage like this, I'm sure the memory will haunt her.

723
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,269
- I get it. - I get it too. That's why...

724
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,940
This was our first performance as a team,

725
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,980
and we wanted to be perfectly in sync like we're one.

726
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,280
I wanted to give it my best so I wouldn't have any regrets.

727
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,579
("Not Shy" by ITZY, "MANIAC" by Stray Kids)

728
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:12,679
(Performed by BEBE)

729
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,269
- It's like an actual K-pop dance. - It's so clean.

730
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,110
(Clean)

731
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,710
Here it comes.

732
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,280
- Let's go. - Let's go.

733
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
I really hope she makes it.

734
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,050
(TSUBA KILL's choreography section)

735
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,230
(She did it!)

736
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,789
Yes, Tatter!

737
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:01,030
(Eyes wide open)

738
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,000
Did you see how she only used her head?

739
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,369
How did she manage to do that in just a few days?

740
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm proud of you!

741
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,030
They're going to break the floor.

742
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,949
Way to go!

743
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,460
She's stealing the girls' hearts.

744
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,500
Nice.

745
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,940
(She killed it.)

746
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
(Impressed)

747
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,409
(Cheering)

748
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,389
They went gradually strong!

749
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:36,860
Everyone has their turn to shine.

750
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,329
Bada doesn't stand out as much as I thought.

751
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,730
- You're right. - They're all good.

752
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,170
(BEBE's choreography section)

753
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,489
They're doing great today!

754
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,920
They're doing their best work today.

755
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,469
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

756
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,710
You killed it!

757
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,849
That was good. They did well.

758
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,949
I think BEBE might actually win.

759
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,079
They might turn things around.

760
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,820
They all killed it. They all looked so good together.

761
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,059
I can't wait to see the judges' decisions.

762
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,719
They have different styles.

763
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,690
This is bad. They have different styles too.

764
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,260
This is hard.

765
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,659
This is a really tough one.

766
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,860
We'll begin the live audience voting now.

767
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,030
If you think TSUBA KILL did better, vote for number one.

768
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,769
If you think BEBE, who went second, did better,

769
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:57,070
vote for number two.

770
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,269
The JYP Match,

771
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,309
TSUBA KILL versus BEBE. We'll close the voting now.

772
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:03,280
Let's find out...

773
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,949
who the judges think is the winner.

774
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,289
We showed everything we had worked for,

775
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:10,820
so I have no regrets.

776
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,260
I thought we were going to win for sure.

777
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,159
I think we got much better responses from the audience,

778
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,389
so I feel confident.

779
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,960
Fight judges, open your cards.

780
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,400
Three, two, one!

781
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,139
(Screaming)

782
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,210
(Choking up)

783
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,079
Seriously? I don't get it.

784
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:42,550
BEBE wins with a score of 3 to 0.

785
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,920
Those were happy tears.

786
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
It had been so taxing both mentally...

787
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,659
and physically.

788
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,329
I felt like it was all paying off.

789
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,929
Thank you!

790
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,030
Great work.

791
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,929
From my point of view, both crews were equally good.

792
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,539
You just had different kinds of energy and vibes.

793
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:05,210
The reason why I chose BEBE...

794
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,480
is because of their teamwork.

795
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,949
TSUBA KILL is like the Avengers. They have amazing energy.

796
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,110
Bada's leadership made it possible for BEBE to compete with that,

797
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,019
as well as the other members' skills.

798
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:17,650
That's what I thought should be valued more.

799
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,219
As an artist, BEBE's performance made me feel grateful...

800
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,530
for the existence of such a dance crew.

801
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,630
The girls did such a great job.

802
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,000
I think people will now stop referring to us "Bada and the rest."

803
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,239
I'm really proud.

804
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,639
First of all, you have to know that TSUBA KILL and BEBE...

805
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,480
are in different situations to begin with.

806
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,210
Anyone could dance better in their own country.

807
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,050
Also, this is a K-pop dance battle.

808
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,019
Despite all that, TSUBA KILL is doing their best...

809
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:51,690
through this competition, and I'm truly grateful for that.

810
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,329
All those people who didn't know who we were...

811
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:05,269
cheered for us so loudly. It made me really happy.

812
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,300
I got a lot of good energy from the audience,

813
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,010
so I'm going to pull myself together and make sure we win next time.

814
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,110
Next up is the YG Match.

815
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:18,409
1MILLION versus Wolf'Lo.

816
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,420
- I love you! - 1MILLION!

817
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,480
- Let's win! - 1MILLION!

818
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,219
- Whether we win or lose, let's go! - Whether we win or lose, let's go!

819
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,690
Let's launch a coup.

820
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,860
(Full of spirits)

821
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,119
Wolf!

822
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,400
(The crews met to exchange the dance.)

823
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,500
Frankly, I think we might have gone overboard.

824
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,869
I apologize in advance.

825
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,699
Maybe they made the dance really sexy.

826
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,139
- You mean, something like this? - Yes.

827
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:48,039
(1MILLION presents their dance copy section.)

828
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:54,780
(Dangerously sexy)

829
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,090
It's funny how they're falling silent.

830
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,760
It's been years since we tried something sexy.

831
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,260
Let's go, Yeni!

832
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,090
- Yeni, show them! - Let's go!

833
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,690
- Show them what you've got! - Show them.

834
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,559
Let's go, Yeni Cho! Don't get intimidated.

835
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,300
I shook my bottom just yesterday.

836
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
(Nightmare)

837
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,130
(She reluctantly does a split.)

838
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,539
We made the dance we thought they wouldn't be able to cover.

839
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:17,670
It's going to make them feel ashamed.

840
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,880
This is going to be fun. Wolf'Lo's sexy dance.

841
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,110
I can't wait to see it.

842
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,110
Bend your leg. Your foot should touch your thigh.

843
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,880
(Wolf'Lo has started practicing 1MILLION's dance.)

844
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,280
I can't go any further. How did you do it?

845
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,619
Do it like Chocol.

846
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,820
- Yes, like that. - Try it.

847
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:32,719
Does anyone have a camera?

848
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,559
I want to record this.

849
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,190
Her body is broken right now.

850
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,190
It hurts.

851
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,030
1MILLION really got us.

852
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,159
We can do this.

853
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,570
Hey.

854
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,170
I feel like a fool.

855
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,769
I don't get the concept of sexy dance.

856
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,110
I have no idea how you do it.

857
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,110
(Serious)

858
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,179
There's 1MILLION.

859
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,579
Shall we take a look?

860
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:55,610
(1MILLION is also practicing.)

861
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,610
- They are so in sync. - You're right.

862
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm a little worried.

863
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,480
We might be eliminated. I don't know if we're doing enough.

864
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,219
Their dance is really clean.

865
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,159
Let's make it clean, not so flashy.

866
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,690
I'm sorry.

867
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,289
Our heights should be more precise when we strike our poses.

868
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,829
Either get down low or get up high.

869
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,099
We aren't in sync.

870
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,530
Let's continue practicing.

871
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,539
There are some parts that need clean moves.

872
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:24,110
It was a bit difficult dancing in sync with everyone.

873
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,670
I'm so tired.

874
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,710
This isn't easy.

875
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,079
We can do this. We really can.

876
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,510
During the Class Mission,

877
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,050
I was constantly frazzled.

878
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:36,750
I realized some dance moves I thought were easy...

879
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,519
might actually not have been that easy.

880
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,989
- Yeni is crying. - She's crying.

881
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,530
We have to overcome this...

882
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,559
- to show everyone our dance. - That's right.

883
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,900
- We can do this. - Let's go.

884
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,670
I don't even know where to put my hands.

885
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,769
This is something I eventually have to overcome by myself.

886
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,710
(Day before the K-pop Death match Mission)

887
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,539
If we do our best,

888
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,409
but the result isn't very good,

889
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,949
I'm worried people would think...

890
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:09,150
street dancers can't do any better than this.

891
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,889
We can add a touch of our style in the K-pop Death match Mission.

892
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:16,260
I know we can do much better, so I'm not worried.

893
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:17,690
We just have to do well.

894
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,199
(K-pop Death match Mission, Day of the video shoot)

895
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,030
(The two crews are here to check the performance director evaluation.)

896
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,300
(Dance copy section created by Wolf'Lo)

897
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,469
(Harimu kicks one foot in the air.)

898
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:30,969
(Mini gets down and kicks both feet.)

899
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:34,039
- Before you evaluate it, - Yes?

900
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,909
you should know that Mini made a mistake...

901
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,179
in the copy section she created.

902
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:40,880
Was she dancing freestyle when she kicked both her feet?

903
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,019
I made a mistake in the copy section.

904
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,019
I felt so bad, and my heart was heavy.

905
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:49,260
I'm so sorry I caused harm to the team.

906
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:53,030
We exchanged dances for that part in the mission.

907
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,860
So we shouldn't have gotten it wrong.

908
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,500
We broke the rule.

909
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,800
Yes, you're right.

910
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,070
I'm truly sorry.

911
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,070
You don't have to hang your head, Mini.

912
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:03,409
Don't cry, Mini.

913
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,309
- I feel so bad. - It's okay.

914
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:09,210
I also made a mistake during the Class Mission.

915
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,250
(During the Class Mission Main Dancer Audition)

916
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,409
(I practiced...)

917
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,449
(really hard.)

918
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:15,980
I wanted to be of help to my team,

919
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,550
but felt bad I wasn't able to show them what I could do.

920
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,119
I'm sorry.

921
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,530
The pressure the members feel of having to achieve our goals...

922
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,929
seems to be constantly growing.

923
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,400
We all know...

924
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,969
how important it is right now.

925
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:33,570
We desperately want this...

926
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,570
and want to challenge ourselves to the end.

927
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,849
How will they express sexiness?

928
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,780
- They have to show us their charm. - You're right.

929
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,349
(Performed by Wolf'Lo)

930
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,800
- They must've practiced so hard. - I know.

931
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,860
They're perfectly in sync.

932
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,130
They're so cool.

933
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,670
(Nervous)

934
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,610
(Exclaiming)

935
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,730
Here they go.

936
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,599
Now it's sexy Wolf'Lo.

937
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,639
(1MILLION’s choreography section)

938
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:47,880
(Wolf'Lo killed it!)

939
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:49,179
(Marvelling)

940
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:50,210
(Feeling shy for some reason)

941
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,679
It's shocking they're so good.

942
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,340
This is the good part.

943
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,710
- Let's go! "Coup D'Etat!" - Come on!

944
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,409
They're so cool.

945
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,610
(Wolf'Lo's choreography section)

946
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,599
Chocol.

947
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,099
It's G-DRAGON's style.

948
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:18,900
The choreography for this part is so good.

949
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,719
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

950
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,820
Gosh.

951
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,389
I got goosebumps.

952
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,690
(That was cool.)

953
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,929
It's several times better when they're performing on stage.

954
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:50,329
- She's like a wolf. - She's like an alpha.

955
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,530
That was cool.

956
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,869
(Amazing)

957
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,739
I think this was the first time I enjoyed...

958
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:57,139
- a hip-hop dance performance. - Really?

959
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,139
Good job.

960
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,840
I have no regrets.

961
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,010
I don't want to admit it, but that was impressive.

962
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,010
We will now begin the second performance...

963
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,420
of the K-pop Death match Mission YG Match by 1MILLION.

964
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,420
Ready?

965
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,989
- Fight. - Fight.

966
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:14,159
They are mysterious to me. I have no information about them.

967
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,289
I'm curious to see how 1MILLION will do.

968
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,090
Me too. We haven't seen them dance.

969
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,960
(During the evaluation video shoot for the directors)

970
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,099
(1MILLION's seat is empty.)

971
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,659
- Why isn't 1MILLION here? - I don't know.

972
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,000
Where is 1MILLION?

973
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,429
Something must have happened to them.

974
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:25,800
- Could they have... - Quit?

975
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,900
(Gasping)

976
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,570
They were sitting in their room when I walked past.

977
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,570
(1MILLION's room)

978
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,940
(Sighing)

979
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,880
(Lia Kim is nowhere to be seen.)

980
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,610
I felt like all our practice was for nothing.

981
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,949
What are we to do now?

982
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:42,719
(What happened to 1MILLION?)

983
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,650
(During the exchange of choreography to copy)

984
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,559
(Wolf'Lo showed off fancy techniques and groovy moves.)

985
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,829
That's a cool dance.

986
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,659
I can't believe they're giving this to us as the dance copy section.

987
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,699
- I love it. - Me too. Thank you.

988
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:59,230
This will actually help our performance.

989
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,570
- Nice. - Thank you.

990
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,039
- Thank you. - Thank you for the great dance.

991
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,070
- It'll be easy to copy. - You're right.

992
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,539
- But it's hard to get it right. - Getting the vibe right is tough.

993
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,039
No, that will be really hard.

994
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,650
- It's really hard. - It's really hard.

995
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,250
It's like LaTrice's dance moves.

996
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,079
If we break it down into parts, we can do it in ten minutes.

997
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,119
Amy and I did hip-hop, so I'm confident we can do this.

998
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,889
Go for it.

999
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,219
(1MILLION is dazed.)

1000
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,489
It seems simple but is difficult.

1001
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,059
(1MILLION starts practicing the dance copy section.)

1002
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:27,030
(The groovy moves are difficult.)

1003
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,130
Is this it?

1004
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,130
(Wolf'Lo is practicing in the same space.)

1005
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,170
Where is the groove?

1006
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,030
They can't get it right.

1007
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,340
(The choreographer is totally satisfied.)

1008
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,099
How are you supposed to create this vibe?

1009
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,340
After trying to copy the dance,

1010
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,139
I realized how difficult it was.

1011
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,809
- Let's try counting the beat again. - Okay.

1012
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:45,050
"Lock the door." Get together.

1013
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,519
- And out. - Okay.

1014
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,690
- Wait a second. - Are you okay?

1015
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,090
(Lia Kim can't get up.)

1016
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,429
I often get muscle cramps when I exhausted.

1017
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:01,059
(She seems to be in great pain.)

1018
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,369
(Lia Kim suddenly cries.)

1019
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:04,869
I felt like...

1020
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,000
I didn't show people anything while I was here.

1021
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,840
(Lia Kim was the first to lose the Battle with the Weakest Dancer.)

1022
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,480
(Sadly, Lia Kim didn't become the main dancer.)

1023
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,050
(1MILLION lost with 26 votes.)

1024
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,480
I came as the leader of 1MILLION,

1025
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,050
but I couldn't memorize the moves, and the results were bad.

1026
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:29,190
I was upset with myself.

1027
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,059
It was painful that I couldn't prove myself.

1028
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:38,070
(1MILLION goes back to practicing without Lia Kim.)

1029
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,269
We thought Lia needed to pull herself together...

1030
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:43,340
and clear her head.

1031
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:46,110
We were determined to stand firm...

1032
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,840
even if Lia stumbled,

1033
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,679
so we could help her get back up.

1034
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,579
(However...)

1035
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,980
I don't know what to do. I'm so dizzy.

1036
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:58,289
(Lia Kim ends up in the hospital.)

1037
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,619
I felt so bad for my crew.

1038
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,130
(She repeatedly watches the practice video.)

1039
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,699
I didn't want to lose my energy even though I was in that situation,

1040
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:11,630
so I watched how big of an effort the crew was making.

1041
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,440
The members were actually...

1042
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,269
able to give me courage.

1043
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:18,139
What is it, Lia? Why are you sad?

1044
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,940
We can show them by ourselves.

1045
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,880
I don't know.

1046
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,119
(1MILLION came this far comforting one another during tough times.)

1047
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,789
By hitting rock bottom,

1048
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,789
I realized the precious things in life.

1049
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,789
Let's hurry up and go practice.

1050
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,630
- Let's go! - You surprised me.

1051
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,030
One, two, three, four.

1052
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,000
Let's stretch our arms forward instead of up.

1053
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,329
It will look nice if we get the angle right.

1054
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,670
Instead of wasting time blaming myself,

1055
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,570
I can gain better things learning through my experience.

1056
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,579
I will try harder during the time left.

1057
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,550
(1MILLION filmed the evaluation video separately.)

1058
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,920
(YG Match order selection, Performance director Kim Byung Gon)

1059
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:04,449
Looking at the overall performance, I think the team...

1060
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:05,590
with higher quality is 1MILLION.

1061
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,389
(That's a relief.)

1062
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:09,960
1MILLION had a better narrative arc...

1063
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,590
and details in their dance moves.

1064
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,329
The crew I chose...

1065
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,030
is 1MILLION.

1066
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,230
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1067
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,000
(1MILLION gets to decide who performs first.)

1068
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:23,139
- Why do I feel like crying? - Don't cry.

1069
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:24,309
(Leader Lia Kim cries easily.)

1070
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,340
You can't cry. We have to go on stage now.

1071
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,280
It was the first time we received positive feedback...

1072
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,179
on the show.

1073
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,550
That small positive sign...

1074
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,949
gave me so much courage.

1075
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,590
- I love you, 1MILLION. - I love you, 1MILLION.

1076
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,690
- Let's win, 1MILLION. - Let's win, 1MILLION.

1077
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,289
- Whether we win or lose, let's go! - Whether we win or lose, let's go!

1078
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:43,429
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1079
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,599
(1MILLION's determination rings through the studio.)

1080
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,769
I will give this performance everything I have.

1081
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,070
We have to show them how powerful we are.

1082
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,699
They look like idol stars.

1083
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,210
They must've tried so hard to prepare this.

1084
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,409
This will be interesting.

1085
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:00,480
(Performance by 1MILLION)

1086
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:07,949
(Gasping)

1087
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,079
Awesome.

1088
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:32,239
(Gasping)

1089
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,610
(Focusing with their guard up)

1090
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:52,690
They all have good facial expressions.

1091
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,260
(1MILLION's choreography section)

1092
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,480
(Swallowing hard)

1093
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,329
(Everyone is shouting.)

1094
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,460
We have to see them dance to "Coup D'Etat."

1095
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,530
- Here it comes. - Here it comes.

1096
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,739
Dohee!

1097
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,980
- Hey. - Let's go.

1098
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,309
(Truly marvelling)

1099
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,579
They're determined.

1100
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:46,750
I can sense it too.

1101
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,599
They're really good at organizing dance moves.

1102
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:04,570
This is Lia's style.

1103
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:18,909
(Wolf'Lo's choreography section)

1104
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:59,320
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1105
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,460
(Marvelling)

1106
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,289
- It was so cool at the end. - Seriously.

1107
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,889
It ended like this.

1108
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,329
I think they put the performance together well.

1109
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,599
We will now begin the audience voting.

1110
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,900
If you think Wolf'Lo, who went 1st, did better, vote for number 1.

1111
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,969
If you think 1MILLION, who went 2nd, did better, vote for number 2.

1112
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,909
Voting begins now.

1113
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:24,050
Let's check the result of the fight judges.

1114
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,579
Fight judges, open your cards.

1115
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:28,119
I believe our performance...

1116
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,590
was way cooler.

1117
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,949
I think it will be an overwhelming victory.

1118
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:33,150
I am confident.

1119
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:34,559
Three,

1120
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,590
two,

1121
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,590
one.

1122
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,730
(Bae Yoon Jung, 1MILLION, Shownu, Wolf'Lo)

1123
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,130
(They have one vote each.)

1124
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:43,030
(What will Monika's decision be?)

1125
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,300
(1MILLION)

1126
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:47,300
(1MILLION is in the lead with a score of 2 to 1.)

1127
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,099
(Feeling mixed emotions)

1128
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:54,340
(Wolf'Lo loses in the fight judges' voting.)

1129
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,480
What did you think, Monika?

1130
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,710
Both teams...

1131
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,480
brought what they are best at.

1132
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,019
I was biased and thought Wolf'Lo wouldn't be good at choreography.

1133
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:07,420
I knew I was wrong when I saw how well they did in the second half.

1134
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,590
I applaud them for using that as the dance copy section.

1135
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:16,030
In the case of 1MILLION,

1136
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,369
Lia Kim mentioned earlier that people are biased about them.

1137
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,300
There are many biased opinions about 1MILLION.

1138
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,210
(1MILLION prepared a stage to break the stereotype.)

1139
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:27,309
It leads to the phrase "commercial potential."

1140
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,440
I believe commercial potential is one of the things...

1141
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,679
most necessary to all dancers need nowadays.

1142
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,019
If people are biased against that,

1143
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:37,920
it's something we have to accept now,

1144
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,550
and it was wrong.

1145
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,289
I think it has to change now.

1146
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,690
The overall idea and choreography was put together beautifully.

1147
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,760
I thought 1MILLION did a better job...

1148
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,230
of catching people's attention...

1149
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,760
and helping them understand it.

1150
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,300
That is why I voted for 1MILLION.

1151
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,699
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1152
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:56,099
(Wolf'Lo and 1MILLION did a good job of expressing their genres.)

1153
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,510
We were able to do it thanks to my crew.

1154
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:02,380
Today, I was able to think I can do it.

1155
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:04,550
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

1156
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,710
The crews to battle next...

1157
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,750
are JAM REPUBLIC and MANNEQUEEN of the HYBE Match.

1158
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,289
(Screaming)

1159
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,460
(HYBE Match)

1160
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:18,690
The cheers are way louder.

1161
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,159
I love you.

1162
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,360
This is tough.

1163
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,929
I can already tell it is tough.

1164
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,039
We ended up...

1165
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:30,940
getting "Dope" by BTS,

1166
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,969
which we really wanted.

1167
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,909
(They selected the songs by choosing the cards of fate.)

1168
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:37,710
(The goddess of luck sided with MANNEQUEEN.)

1169
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,150
I already knew we won.

1170
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,420
I will win with this determination.

1171
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,150
We will be strategic...

1172
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,849
and add crazy fast waacking moves.

1173
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,090
We will use insanely difficult technique...

1174
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,690
to make sure they can't copy it.

1175
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:50,489
The difficulty level of our dance?

1176
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,489
Very hard.

1177
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,190
This will be tough even for waackers.

1178
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:55,699
It's exactly what we expected.

1179
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,699
We knew they were going to add so many tricks.

1180
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:00,800
- It's not that hard. - No.

1181
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,070
I don't think they will be able to do it at all.

1182
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,570
They might be able to copy it,

1183
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,010
but they won't do it with style.

1184
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,710
Little did they know.

1185
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,110
(We will show them!)

1186
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,320
Audrey is going to teach me some B-girl tricks.

1187
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,119
- Yes, and then go... - Hit it like this.

1188
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,820
And drop.

1189
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,820
- That's cool. - It's so cool.

1190
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,130
For our strategy, the tricks are mostly on the ground.

1191
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,929
It's because their power is up here.

1192
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,760
(Exchange of choreography to copy)

1193
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,260
(JAM REPUBLIC pushes forward.)

1194
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:32,969
What's this?

1195
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,900
It's a rhythm only they can pull off.

1196
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:40,409
(Take this!)

1197
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:42,110
That's challenging.

1198
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,050
It looks easy,

1199
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,079
but I don't think it will be.

1200
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,719
(MANNEQUEEN starts practicing the dance copy section.)

1201
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,920
(MANNEQUEEN easily succeeds in copying the high technique.)

1202
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:53,420
We can do this.

1203
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,559
When it's a technique,

1204
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,820
it's easy.

1205
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,889
But then we hit a wall.

1206
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,800
(They try copying the groovy move involving the lower body.)

1207
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,630
(Laughing)

1208
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,000
(Shaking)

1209
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,869
This could turn out to be the most challenging part for us.

1210
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:09,769
(Looking rusty)

1211
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:10,909
Boom, boom.

1212
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:12,510
(The six MANNEQUEENs are suddenly out of order.)

1213
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,510
Is this how you do it?

1214
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,110
It suddenly looked like the "National Singing Contest."

1215
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,409
We were moving our shoulders up and down.

1216
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:18,880
I looked in the mirror,

1217
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:23,550
and we looked like people dancing for the first time.

1218
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,250
It was so humiliating.

1219
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:26,550
(Totally frazzled)

1220
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,389
- Wake up. We can do this. - This is unbelievable.

1221
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:29,860
How do you do it?

1222
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,289
(This is how you do it.)

1223
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,030
(JAM REPUBLIC easily learns the dance copy section.)

1224
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,030
Nice.

1225
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:37,030
(Screaming)

1226
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,500
(What is it?)

1227
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,829
It must be going well for them.

1228
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:41,239
They must be done.

1229
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,000
Cool. Let's go.

1230
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,309
Let's go home.

1231
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,139
What?

1232
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,940
They're going home already?

1233
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,440
Was our choreography easy?

1234
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,809
(JAM REPUBLIC goes home to keep in good shape.)

1235
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,849
Is that possible? They're done?

1236
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:55,280
Practice until I drop dead.

1237
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,650
Don't go to sleep.

1238
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:59,949
(MANNEQUEEN practices without taking a break.)

1239
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,489
Push down.

1240
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:04,030
- Let's start from the beginning. - Show them how hard we practice.

1241
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,960
(MANNEQUEEN starts practicing early in the morning the next day.)

1242
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

1243
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,000
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1244
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,030
Hello.

1245
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,670
(JAM REPUBLIC went home early and shows up late the next day.)

1246
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,309
They must really be confident.

1247
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,239
It was impressive. We came early...

1248
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:23,239
and were practicing until sweat was dripping from our chins.

1249
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,449
Should we try to create an intro?

1250
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,880
Should we try to create an intro?

1251
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,550
I thought they were done choreographing,

1252
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,050
but they were doing it now.

1253
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,159
So we created this doll-style intro,

1254
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:36,860
kind of like a mannequin.

1255
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,699
We tried to express the meaning of the Korean word.

1256
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,599
I didn't know much of the lyrics.

1257
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,199
I'm just going off what I'm hearing and feeling.

1258
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,539
We don't want to have that problem again.

1259
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:51,170
(JAM REPUBLIC checks the translated lyrics first.)

1260
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,139
(They create a dance to fit the lyrics.)

1261
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:54,239
That was really cool.

1262
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,309
- The doll thing? - Yes.

1263
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,079
"FEARLESS" is a popular song of theirs.

1264
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,179
- We could reference that. - Cool.

1265
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:05,019
("FEARLESS" created a buzz with an eye-catching dance move.)

1266
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,320
(They try reinterpreting it in JAM REPUBLIC's style.)

1267
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,119
That kind of works.

1268
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,789
- That was very clean. - It was very clean.

1269
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:15,000
They are like the top students.

1270
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,400
She says, "I didn't study," and she's at the top of the class.

1271
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,869
And I'm here studying all night.

1272
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:21,440
Nice.

1273
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,869
That's perfect.

1274
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:26,309
I am very confident that we can...

1275
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:29,139
JAM REPUBLIC, please come out for the HYBE Match.

1276
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,880
(Focused)

1277
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,449
Their choreography is so cool.

1278
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:41,519
They caught my eye from the introduction.

1279
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,989
(JAM REPUBLIC's choreography...)

1280
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:46,760
(brings out reactions from everywhere.)

1281
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,460
Only JAM REPUBLIC could have pulled that off.

1282
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,500
- Absolutely. - I know.

1283
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,699
(MANNEQUEEN's choreography follows.)

1284
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:54,869
(Tilting her head)

1285
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,269
It wasn't as good as I had expected.

1286
01:03:58,409 --> 01:03:59,739
It was a bummer.

1287
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,880
I didn't find it too interesting.

1288
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,110
- JAM REPUBLIC was far better. - Well done.

1289
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:06,650
JAM REPUBLIC was far better.

1290
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,050
Theirs isn't so good.

1291
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,920
JAM REPUBLIC's sequence was too impressive.

1292
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,989
- Great job, guys. We did it. - Well done.

1293
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,550
- We did it. - Come here.

1294
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,219
One hundred percent. I think we definitely did it better.

1295
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,559
Good work, guys. It's over now.

1296
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,159
- That was good. - Yes.

1297
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:26,329
(Can MANNEQUEEN overcome this crisis?)

1298
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,369
(The recording day of the performance)

1299
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:30,710
(JAM REPUBLIC and MANNEQUEEN are on standby for the rehearsal.)

1300
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:34,380
- In 2, 3. Hi. - Hi.

1301
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,079
- We're LE SSERAFIM. - We're LE SSERAFIM.

1302
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,050
(It's LE SSERAFIM!)

1303
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:41,880
(LE SSERAFIM will decide who goes first.)

1304
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,619
It must be a mannequin theme.

1305
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:47,590
(Admiring)

1306
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:49,059
(Pleased)

1307
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,360
We've decided.

1308
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,590
The crew that we choose is...

1309
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,030
- JAM REPUBLIC. - JAM REPUBLIC.

1310
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,070
Oh, thank you.

1311
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:03,670
(That's okay.)

1312
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,239
We have decided that we're going to go second.

1313
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:08,510
- Okay. - We'll go second.

1314
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,679
- Okay. - Okay.

1315
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:11,710
We don't care whether we go first or second.

1316
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,050
Because we'll win.

1317
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,820
I have a feeling that we'll win.

1318
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,519
I know that we're going to win.

1319
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,920
(What makes MANNEQUEEN so confident?)

1320
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,719
Gosh, they changed it a lot.

1321
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,289
They changed the whole thing.

1322
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:25,860
(Compared to the original choreography,)

1323
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,030
(there's a stark difference.)

1324
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,699
JAM REPUBLIC's choreography...

1325
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:31,929
motivated us to do better.

1326
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,699
(When the choreographies were revealed)

1327
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,570
It stood out, and there were many wow factors.

1328
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,969
That's what JAM REPUBLIC is good at.

1329
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,210
I was shocked at the "stress" part.

1330
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,079
They portrayed it this way.

1331
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:47,150
(JAM REPUBLIC took the intuitive approach.)

1332
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,949
That left an impression.

1333
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,719
I think that we should change the whole thing.

1334
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:54,559
Our choreography is far more upgraded than before,

1335
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,760
so I know that we're going to win by a landslide.

1336
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:00,489
(MANNEQUEEN finished rehearsing their new choreo.)

1337
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,630
(But...)

1338
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,800
(Redlic doesn't seem so well.)

1339
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,030
(Her face darkens instantly.)

1340
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:10,469
(Suddenly, she plops down.)

1341
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:12,940
What's wrong?

1342
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,340
(She tears up in pain.)

1343
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,980
What is it? Where is it?

1344
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,110
- Your belly? - Your belly?

1345
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,250
(She ends up being moved to the hospital.)

1346
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:21,650
(Worried)

1347
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:24,320
(She's been in pain since practice.)

1348
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,389
- Oh, sorry. - Did you get a cramp?

1349
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,420
Let's practice in pairs while she gets some rest.

1350
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,690
But it's better to do it together.

1351
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,159
Can I just stay here and get the timing right?

1352
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,730
I want to do well.

1353
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:38,599
Redlic hates being a burden to the team.

1354
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:42,170
I guess that's why she tried so hard to hide her pain.

1355
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,539
- I hope she's okay. - Right.

1356
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:45,610
(MANNEQUEEN faces yet another crisis.)

1357
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,380
(JAM REPUBLIC begins rehearsing.)

1358
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,949
(It's going smoothly, and...)

1359
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:53,510
(Shouting)

1360
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,750
(LaTrice is on the floor out of the blue.)

1361
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,889
(As they were rehearsing,)

1362
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:03,559
(LaTrice twisted her ankle.)

1363
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,829
Can we get someone here, please?

1364
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,829
(She can't seem to stand up due to the pain.)

1365
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:11,000
Take a look.

1366
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,329
Sorry.

1367
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,000
- No. Don't be sorry. - Don't be sorry.

1368
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,099
It's okay.

1369
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,409
Your priority is your body.

1370
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,440
(LaTrice is moved to the hospital for a checkup.)

1371
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,179
I don't even know if she can walk again.

1372
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:23,409
- Right. - Right.

1373
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,250
No!

1374
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,320
(The members of JAM REPUBLIC are worried about her and show tears.)

1375
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:30,650
No.

1376
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,989
Is there an option that we can just forfeit?

1377
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,559
(JAM REPUBLIC also faces a crisis.)

1378
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,960
Sorry.

1379
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,460
- Poor thing. Come here. - Hi.

1380
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,460
(Redlic and LaTrice return from the hospital.)

1381
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:43,960
Oh, my gosh. You're walking.

1382
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,230
Yes, it's okay.

1383
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:47,300
Guess who I saw at the hospital.

1384
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,340
Redlic.

1385
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,769
- Are you serious? - What?

1386
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:52,670
I came to my senses, and LaTrice was next to me.

1387
01:07:53,909 --> 01:07:57,079
(Redlic and LaTrice met at the hospital.)

1388
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,820
(They fought fiercely in a battle.)

1389
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,849
(Now, they're both lying in hospital beds.)

1390
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,349
I felt sympathy.

1391
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,760
We were both pitiful.

1392
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:12,889
(Though they're still competing, they hold hands for the first time.)

1393
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:15,460
I feel quite mellow right now.

1394
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,000
We were injured on the same day...

1395
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,729
and were moved to the hospital on the same day.

1396
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,000
It's like we're actually soulmates, not rivals.

1397
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,409
We just wanted to come and tell you guys that obviously...

1398
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:28,310
We don't want to push her injury.

1399
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,680
We don't want to cause it to be even worse.

1400
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,250
(Kirsten wants to revise the moves for LaTrice.)

1401
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,920
(MANNEQUEEN finds out about how Kirsten feels.)

1402
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,619
That's all right.

1403
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:38,989
We don't have a choice.

1404
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,159
(MANNEQUEEN accepts it without hesitation.)

1405
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,960
- No! - Don't cry.

1406
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,090
It's all right.

1407
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,289
We have a lot of drama, actually.

1408
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:49,600
We always fight and cry together.

1409
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,029
And we went to the hospital together.

1410
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,600
- We were both lying there. - Were you?

1411
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,369
I really appreciated them.

1412
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:58,439
It was a really sweet moment.

1413
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,409
Although it's a competition, we're all dancers.

1414
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:03,779
Our bodies are assets and obviously important.

1415
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,180
I think we should play fair.

1416
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,880
That way, we can feel like we deserve it when we win.

1417
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,890
MANNEQUEEN's performance of the HYBE Match begins now.

1418
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:15,960
I can't wait.

1419
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,060
In 1, 2, 3.

1420
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,159
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1421
01:09:20,829 --> 01:09:22,529
(Let's go, MANNEQUEEN!)

1422
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,760
("Eve, Psyche and the Bluebeard's Wife")

1423
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,829
(Performed by MANNEQUEEN)

1424
01:09:26,699 --> 01:09:27,770
It's starting.

1425
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,000
I'm so excited.

1426
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:51,029
I think they changed it a bit.

1427
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:52,729
They completely changed it.

1428
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:18,390
It's neat.

1429
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,590
The moves suit the song.

1430
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,100
Here comes the copy section.

1431
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:33,170
Okay, Redlic. Let's go.

1432
01:10:35,069 --> 01:10:36,270
(JAM REPUBLIC's choreography section)

1433
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,510
(Amazed)

1434
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,939
They have great teamwork.

1435
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,340
(Their eyes open widely.)

1436
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,210
This is the part!

1437
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,869
(MANNEQUEEN's choreography section)

1438
01:11:47,109 --> 01:11:48,909
(Gratifying)

1439
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:50,710
She's more powerful than a krumper.

1440
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:23,609
(They nailed it.)

1441
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:25,109
You killed it!

1442
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,310
- You killed it! - MANNEQUEEN!

1443
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,979
- Amazing! - MANNEQUEEN!

1444
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:31,989
- MANNEQUEEN! - MANNEQUEEN!

1445
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:33,819
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1446
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,789
(MANNEQUEEN with the energy)

1447
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,829
- MANNEQUEEN did as expected. - Totally.

1448
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,560
The revised version was excellent.

1449
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,630
Yes, it was so neat.

1450
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,500
They have such good teamwork,

1451
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,960
- Right? - and it shows.

1452
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,130
I got choked up when they chanted, "MANNEQUEEN."

1453
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:48,500
- Good work, Redlic. - Thanks.

1454
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:50,899
The K-pop Death match Mission.

1455
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,210
JAM REPUBLIC's performance begins now.

1456
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,010
(Looking forward to it)

1457
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:57,180
Oh, I'm so excited about this.

1458
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,350
Here they go.

1459
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,710
("Eve, Psyche and the Bluebeard's Wife")

1460
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,010
(Performed by JAM REPUBLIC)

1461
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,270
Gosh.

1462
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,510
Kirsten is so cool.

1463
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:30,210
She's so groovy.

1464
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,859
Audrey!

1465
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:46,189
Audrey is such a sharp knife.

1466
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:00,869
(JAM REPUBLIC's choreography section)

1467
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:05,109
(Hearts pounding hard)

1468
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:06,850
(Dancing internally)

1469
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,750
This part is insane!

1470
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,250
I love this choreo.

1471
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,010
She's too good!

1472
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:11,039
(Screaming)

1473
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,079
She gestured a heart.

1474
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:13,949
Her facial expressions are fantastic.

1475
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,119
(MANNEQUEEN's choreography section)

1476
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,350
(Cheering loudly)

1477
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:58,130
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1478
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:00,829
They were fabulous.

1479
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,770
LaTrice powered through.

1480
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,170
That's admirable.

1481
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,800
(Speechless)

1482
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,739
That was insane. That was fire.

1483
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:11,909
It was groovy, and it had wow factors.

1484
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:13,609
JAM REPUBLIC just did what they were good at.

1485
01:16:13,609 --> 01:16:16,880
The HYBE match, MANNEQUEEN versus JAM REPUBLIC.

1486
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,250
The live audience voting will begin.

1487
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,250
(I can't decide.)

1488
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,220
(They vote discreetly to determine the winner.)

1489
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,649
The voting of the HYBE Match ends now.

1490
01:16:24,949 --> 01:16:27,319
Fight judges, open your cards.

1491
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,359
(Deliberating)

1492
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,930
This is hard.

1493
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,060
Who do you think will win?

1494
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,500
- It's so hard to decide. - It's a tough decision.

1495
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,470
- It's tough to choose between them. - Right.

1496
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:40,630
You never know.

1497
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,140
Street Woman Fighter is such an entertaining show!

1498
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:45,710
Fight judges, open your cards.

1499
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,779
Three, two, one.

1500
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:50,479
(Monika chooses JAM REPUBLIC.)

1501
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:51,779
One!

1502
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:53,609
(Shownu and Yoon Jung also choose JAM REPUBLIC.)

1503
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,720
(JAM REPUBLIC wins with a score of 3 to 0.)

1504
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,680
(Surprised)

1505
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,850
Thank you.

1506
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:03,090
With a score of 3 to 0, JAM REPUBLIC...

1507
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,289
has defeated MANNEQUEEN.

1508
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,670
It's safe to say that this was the toughest matchup today.

1509
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:12,829
JAM REPUBLIC's choreo...

1510
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:16,500
perfectly suited K-pop songs.

1511
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,500
(Made with profound research and effort)

1512
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,939
I thought, "How do they know so well what Korean people like?"

1513
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,539
In terms of K-pop formation. choreography.

1514
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:25,149
(Proud Audrey)

1515
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,779
JAM REPUBLIC's composure and moves were...

1516
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:30,880
what set you apart, I think.

1517
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,090
Good work, everyone.

1518
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,420
(Props to both the crews)

1519
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:35,590
(Great job, MANNEQUEEN and JAM REPUBLIC!)

1520
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,090
(You're both great!)

1521
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,630
Come here.

1522
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:41,829
(The dancers hug each other for all the hard work.)

1523
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,500
Good job.

1524
01:17:43,829 --> 01:17:46,100
Are you okay? Oh, my gosh.

1525
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,369
(They gave us yet another amazing competition.)

1526
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:49,000
Don't cry!

1527
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,039
(The performances of MANNEQUEEN and JAM REPUBLIC end.)

1528
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:54,640
(Which crew is the first crew to be eliminated?)

1529
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,479
(The result is completely different...)

1530
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:58,510
(from the number of views.)

1531
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,510
(Deep N Dap is at risk.)

1532
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,119
(It's only a 40-point difference.)

1533
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:07,989
(Which crew will go straight to the Elimination Battle?)

1534
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,930
All dancers, great job...

1535
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,729
on the K-pop Death match Mission.

1536
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:16,760
As we had announced, a crew will be eliminated...

1537
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,500
for the first time on Street Woman Fighter 2.

1538
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,529
(Sighing)

1539
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,539
(Sighing deeply)

1540
01:18:21,539 --> 01:18:22,770
Oh, my gosh.

1541
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:25,640
That crew must leave the fight club with the humiliating title...

1542
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,210
of the first eliminated crew.

1543
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,210
"Humiliating."

1544
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,479
(No!)

1545
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:31,550
Two hundred points from the Class Mission,

1546
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,310
a hundred and fifty points from the fight judges,

1547
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,149
fifty points from the live audience voting,

1548
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:37,420
and six hundred points from the global public evaluation.

1549
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,250
It will be a total of 1,000 points.

1550
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,449
The winner of the Class Mission...

1551
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,390
gets 200 points.

1552
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:46,090
From 2nd to 8th places, your points will vary.

1553
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:49,859
The 3 fight judges get 50 points each, making a total of 150 points.

1554
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:51,729
Fifty points from the live audience voting.

1555
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:55,640
The 50 points from the live audience are only given...

1556
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,310
to the winning crew of the two crews.

1557
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,439
The global public evaluation...

1558
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:02,210
was counted from the afternoon of June 23...

1559
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,310
to the noon of June 26.

1560
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:08,279
The number of views plus 100 times the number of likes,

1561
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:11,489
plus 100 times the number of votes on Mnet Plus...

1562
01:19:11,489 --> 01:19:13,520
determine the winner of the global public evaluation,

1563
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,989
giving the crew 600 points.

1564
01:19:14,989 --> 01:19:16,859
From 2nd to 8th places,

1565
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:19,359
your points will vary depending on your place.

1566
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:21,699
The total number of views of the eight crews...

1567
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,600
was 5,265,543.

1568
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,539
The total of likes and votes on Mnet Plus was 356,090.

1569
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:31,640
Amazing.

1570
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,609
That's a lot.

1571
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:35,109
The crew that had...

1572
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:37,210
an overwhelming number of views...

1573
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:40,979
recorded 1,070,237 views, which was 1MILLION.

1574
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:42,319
(1MILLION with 1,070,237 views)

1575
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:44,680
As expected.

1576
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:46,720
(Clapping in acceptance)

1577
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:49,489
I was very glad when he called our crew's name.

1578
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:51,319
I'm glad that we were able to show them...

1579
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,460
why 1MILLION is the best.

1580
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,659
While 1MILLION had the most number of views,

1581
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:59,670
you failed to receive the most number of likes.

1582
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:02,399
It's so unpredictable.

1583
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:03,439
(Surprised)

1584
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,810
- No way. - It's so unexpected.

1585
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,909
So, the number of likes will be...

1586
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:11,380
the most significant variable in the global public score.

1587
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:14,149
You can't expect anything because it's the number of likes.

1588
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,119
I will now announce the final result...

1589
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:19,289
of the K-pop Death match Mission of each match.

1590
01:20:19,289 --> 01:20:20,890
(It's the moment of truth.)

1591
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,260
No!

1592
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:24,689
Don't say it.

1593
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,029
I don't want to see it. No.

1594
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,060
The K-pop Death match Mission with the first elimination on the line.

1595
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,199
Here's the result of Deep N Dap and LADYBOUNCE...

1596
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:33,970
from the SM Match.

1597
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,739
Fourth place, LADYBOUNCE. Seventh place, Deep N Dap.

1598
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,039
With a score of 3 to 0...

1599
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,710
(LADYBOUNCE is ahead for now.)

1600
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:42,880
(Which crew will take the live audience points?)

1601
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,680
(Can someone help LADYBOUNCE?)

1602
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,779
It's so scary that I feel like crying.

1603
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:48,050
I can't watch this.

1604
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:49,420
It's hard to watch, isn't it?

1605
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,920
Yes. I can't bear to watch it, although it's not our score.

1606
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,420
Here's the score.

1607
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,060
What is it?

1608
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,829
(Focused)

1609
01:20:58,829 --> 01:20:59,930
That's how it turned out?

1610
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:02,399
(Live audience: LADYBOUNCE)

1611
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,630
The result of the live audience vote was 52 to 227.

1612
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,699
- LADYBOUNCE. - LADYBOUNCE.

1613
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:09,770
I loved it.

1614
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:13,510
LADYBOUNCE has received 50 points from the live audience voting.

1615
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:15,210
(Frustrated)

1616
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,140
There was a circle, denoting zero.

1617
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,550
It hurt my pride badly.

1618
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,579
Deep N Dap is in trouble.

1619
01:21:21,579 --> 01:21:22,819
It's a huge difference.

1620
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:24,680
But they could turn it around with the global evaluation.

1621
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,250
But they got a lot of views.

1622
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,689
From the global public evaluation,

1623
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:30,420
Deep N Dap had more views.

1624
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,890
Let's see how many likes they got.

1625
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,630
Here are the final results of the SM Match.

1626
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,859
Deep N Dap might have scored higher in the global evaluation.

1627
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:39,930
- It'd be amazing if they caught up. - I know, right?

1628
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,670
Deep N Dap had so many views,

1629
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:42,939
- so they might do it. - Right.

1630
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:45,439
I'm confident. My teammates, including myself,

1631
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,140
were more famous than them.

1632
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,340
We had 100,000 more views than them.

1633
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,010
I'm thinking of turning the tables with the global evaluation.

1634
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,319
- Please. - We still have a lot to do.

1635
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:58,850
We only showed you one performance.

1636
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,350
We can't afford to be eliminated just yet.

1637
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,489
I badly want to win.

1638
01:22:03,489 --> 01:22:04,590
(Global public evaluation)

1639
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:07,489
What?

1640
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:08,930
(Amazed)

1641
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,560
- Oh, my gosh. - That's a huge difference.

1642
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,170
(Deep N Dap loses, and LADYBOUNCE wins.)

1643
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:16,600
(LADYBOUNCE wins by a 330-point difference.)

1644
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,039
I was in my element.

1645
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,279
I thought, "This is bad."

1646
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,479
"We might be the first crew to be eliminated."

1647
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:27,750
The result is completely different from the views.

1648
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,520
Deep N Dap had way more views, right?

1649
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,520
How many likes did they get?

1650
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,420
Maybe they got a lot of votes on Mnet Plus.

1651
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,119
LADYBOUNCE wins the SM Match...

1652
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,960
and survives.

1653
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,260
(LADYBOUNCE wins the SM Match of the K-pop Death match Mission.)

1654
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:43,729
They're crying. Oh, no.

1655
01:22:43,729 --> 01:22:47,170
To be honest, we were hoping...

1656
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:50,340
that we could turn it around with the global evaluation.

1657
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,210
I'm exhilarated that it turned out well.

1658
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,939
It felt like a dream.

1659
01:22:54,939 --> 01:22:56,939
And I was so touched.

1660
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:59,750
It felt like people were finally recognizing...

1661
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,750
our 15 years of hard work.

1662
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,520
I was so grateful.

1663
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,819
You had the third-most views among eight crews.

1664
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:08,689
And you became a candidate for elimination.

1665
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:11,590
We humbly accept the result,

1666
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,590
and we'll now prepare for the battle.

1667
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:14,859
Congratulations.

1668
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,170
I think we had high expectations...

1669
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,729
just because we had a lot of views.

1670
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,470
We were really mistaken.

1671
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,569
We might end up in the Elimination Battle.

1672
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,270
Next, we will reveal the results...

1673
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:29,310
of the YG Match between Wolf'Lo and 1MILLION.

1674
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:31,810
Right now, 1MILLION has double the number of votes...

1675
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,380
as Wolf'Lo from the global public evaluation.

1676
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,920
But how many likes did they get?

1677
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,819
We will now reveal the results.

1678
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:39,390
I can't watch.

1679
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,159
All the effort put in by 1MILLION...

1680
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:45,890
can get its due recognition now. I hope that's the case.

1681
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,100
(They started off in the lower ranks from the Weakest Dancer Battles.)

1682
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,699
(Even in the Class Mission, 1MILLION stayed ranking low.)

1683
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,300
(This result matters even more because of past mission regrets.)

1684
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,300
Is the difference too big?

1685
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,939
Are you nervous? I'm not.

1686
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,039
I was already expecting this.

1687
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:01,270
(What is the final result of the YG Match?)

1688
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,180
(K-pop Death match Mission YG Match)

1689
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:07,710
1MILLION received 213 live audience votes, winning 50 points.

1690
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:12,220
They received 65,363 likes in the global public evaluation.

1691
01:24:12,489 --> 01:24:14,449
- We did better than I thought. - We did pretty well.

1692
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:19,460
We can clearly see what viewers are interested in.

1693
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:21,859
We'll have to accept this and move on.

1694
01:24:21,859 --> 01:24:25,600
1MILLION has emerged as the victor and have safely survived.

1695
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:28,439
I felt that we were recognized for the first time,

1696
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:29,699
and I felt great about winning.

1697
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,210
I'm so grateful to my team, who have worked so hard.

1698
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:37,609
On one hand, I'm also sorry to the Wolf'Lo crew.

1699
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,710
- It's all right. - It's all right.

1700
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:40,979
What we said amongst ourselves...

1701
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:44,920
was "when else would we ever get 460,000 views for our video?"

1702
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,289
"Let's think about this positively."

1703
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,390
To Halo of Wolf'Lo,

1704
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,789
now your best chance at survival is winning the Elimination Battle.

1705
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:53,930
Even in this Elimination Battle, I'll show you a great performance.

1706
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,529
My personal ambition...

1707
01:24:55,529 --> 01:24:58,569
is to show you a legendary, never-before-seen performance.

1708
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:00,470
(You girls are so cool.)

1709
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,500
(Sending you respect)

1710
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,369
I'm scared.

1711
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:05,069
Next, we will reveal the results of the JYP Match...

1712
01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:08,170
between TSUBA KILL and BEBE.

1713
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,210
I'm curious about this result too.

1714
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:11,850
Please.

1715
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:16,050
I think ours will be overwhelmingly higher.

1716
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,819
We had the second largest number of views.

1717
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:19,689
I think we pinned our hopes on that.

1718
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:21,319
Because we don't know how many likes either of us got,

1719
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:25,960
I think we have a chance to come back and win this.

1720
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,260
In any case, we need enough points to get out of last place.

1721
01:25:30,329 --> 01:25:33,100
We will now reveal the results of the JYP Match.

1722
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,270
(Surprised and shocked)

1723
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,170
(Gosh, that's surprising.)

1724
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,609
How does that make sense?

1725
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,979
(TSUBA KILL, 440, Lose)

1726
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:47,409
(BEBE wins with a huge point difference of 540 points.)

1727
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:52,619
(This is crazy.)

1728
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,949
Is this for real?

1729
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,829
We were very disappointed.

1730
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,260
TSUBA KILL won the points from the Class Mission,

1731
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:05,100
but BEBE won the points from the fight judges.

1732
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:08,899
BEBE is the final victor in the JYP Match...

1733
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:10,699
between TSUBA KILL and BEBE, and their survival is confirmed.

1734
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:13,710
I can't believe their final score is nearly double the other crew's.

1735
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:15,739
That's wild.

1736
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,909
This is Bada's crew, and she's known for being hot and trendy.

1737
01:26:19,909 --> 01:26:24,180
I think her result shows how much she appeals to the public.

1738
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:27,750
With an overwhelming point difference of 540 points,

1739
01:26:27,819 --> 01:26:31,260
BEBE has confirmed their survival. Bada, how do you feel?

1740
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,960
I'm so grateful,

1741
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,500
and while we were preparing for this mission,

1742
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,300
we encountered a lot of obstacles.

1743
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,869
To the members, who overcame those obstacles...

1744
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:44,199
and overcame our hardships, I want to say thank you.

1745
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:49,439
And to TSUBA KILL, which was great competition,

1746
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:51,710
thank you very much.

1747
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,079
(You worked very hard.)

1748
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:59,649
On the other hand, TSUBA KILL is now at risk of elimination.

1749
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,689
Honestly,

1750
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:03,520
we did everything we could.

1751
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,659
We did our best, and this was the result,

1752
01:27:05,729 --> 01:27:08,359
so we will put our all into preparing for the battle.

1753
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,359
I think we're really in danger now.

1754
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:14,869
Still, at least we have the battle.

1755
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:16,239
In the end,

1756
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,170
we ended up having to battle.

1757
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,840
I felt like a mess.

1758
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:24,210
We will now reveal the results of the HYBE Match...

1759
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:26,649
between MANNEQUEEN and JAM REPUBLIC.

1760
01:27:26,649 --> 01:27:28,550
(K-pop Death match Mission HYBE Match)

1761
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,090
JAM REPUBLIC won more points from both the Class Mission...

1762
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,020
and the fight judges.

1763
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,920
We're very nervous right now...

1764
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:37,590
since there's not much of a difference between us.

1765
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:38,960
I don't know, guys.

1766
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:42,930
I think it's just a stat. We still have to see...

1767
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:47,100
what the result of the results is. Yes, we can just wait and see.

1768
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,039
This is really a mystery.

1769
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:50,439
I have no idea about this one.

1770
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,439
Let's reveal the scores...

1771
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:53,810
to see how they did with live audience voting.

1772
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:55,779
I think MANNEQUEEN will take the 50 points.

1773
01:27:55,939 --> 01:27:57,979
I think JAM REPUBLIC will get it.

1774
01:27:57,979 --> 01:27:59,109
The crowd reacted well to them.

1775
01:27:59,109 --> 01:28:00,550
We really need this one.

1776
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:03,550
We thought we did better live,

1777
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:04,979
so we had high expectations.

1778
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:06,689
I'm shaking.

1779
01:28:07,689 --> 01:28:08,819
I don't know.

1780
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:10,890
I'm not sure what will happen.

1781
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,590
(What is the result of the live audience voting?)

1782
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,100
With 161 to 118 votes,

1783
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,329
MANNEQUEEN won the 50 points for live audience voting.

1784
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,699
- Yes. - That startled me.

1785
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:23,869
I was so surprised.

1786
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,210
- We did it. - I was so surprised by that.

1787
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:31,510
I didn't know what to expect for the next points. I was scared.

1788
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:33,109
I don't know what will happen.

1789
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,010
I'm more nervous than they are.

1790
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:36,380
The HYBE Match was fierce.

1791
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,850
I think there could be an upset.

1792
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:40,520
I did want to win no matter what and was confident we could,

1793
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,060
but it was so close, I wasn't sure.

1794
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:45,159
We had more views,

1795
01:28:45,289 --> 01:28:49,859
but it was really by a hair. That made us so nervous now.

1796
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,100
I was very nervous,

1797
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,170
and I knew it could go one way or the other,

1798
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:57,239
so I wasn't confident we would win. I was scared.

1799
01:28:57,270 --> 01:29:01,609
I'm praying that the global votes will be in JAM REPUBLIC's favour.

1800
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:02,840
- Please. - Please.

1801
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,680
(What is the HYBE Match result, which was fiercer than ever?)

1802
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,050
(Live audience voting, MANNEQUEEN 50, JAM REPUBLIC 0)

1803
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,409
(Gasping for breath)

1804
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:08,850
(Is this for real?)

1805
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:09,880
Wait a minute.

1806
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,449
(Is this for real?)

1807
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,649
(Live audience voting, MANNEQUEEN 50, JAM REPUBLIC 0)

1808
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,960
(Final scores, MANNEQUEEN 710, Lose, JAM REPUBLIC 750, Win)

1809
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,989
(Global public evaluation 601,819 views, 37,752 likes)

1810
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:23,529
- Oh, my goodness. - Gosh.

1811
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:26,100
That was close. Gosh.

1812
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,899
(Everyone is shocked.)

1813
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:34,170
(Global public evaluation 605,076 views, 45,511 likes)

1814
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:36,239
There was only a 40-point difference.

1815
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,979
That was insane.

1816
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:40,010
The live audience voting was big.

1817
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,710
They're not a crew that should be eliminated.

1818
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:43,180
Why do I feel so much regret?

1819
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,449
JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten,

1820
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,520
how does it feel to have survived?

1821
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,460
Obviously, I'm very happy that we did win,

1822
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,159
but it was such a short gap.

1823
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:57,029
Again, thank you MANNEQUEEN for putting up such a great battle.

1824
01:29:57,029 --> 01:29:59,270
(Respect for our match)

1825
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:02,439
The global public evaluation number of views and likes...

1826
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:05,569
were both higher for MANNEQUEEN than for JAM REPUBLIC,

1827
01:30:05,869 --> 01:30:07,609
but you were unable to achieve an upset.

1828
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:12,680
In this mission, both Jam REPUBLIC and MANNEQUEEN...

1829
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,050
completed the mission despite having a lot of pain, which is a relief.

1830
01:30:20,489 --> 01:30:21,789
That was so close.

1831
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:24,020
I was wondering if this is just how reality is.

1832
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,630
We'll go into the Elimination Battle putting our lives on the line.

1833
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,460
We're going to struggle as hard as we can to overcome this.

1834
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,829
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1835
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:35,369
We've announced the results of all K-pop Death match Missions.

1836
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:39,039
Deep N Dap, Wolf'Lo, TSUBA KILL, and MANNEQUEEN...

1837
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:41,109
lost their Death matches,

1838
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:43,279
so they are all equally at risk of being eliminated.

1839
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:44,880
Of these four losing crews,

1840
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,609
only two will go face to face in an Elimination Battle.

1841
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,779
Only two?

1842
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:49,949
How will they choose?

1843
01:30:49,949 --> 01:30:54,090
Which crews will face off in the Elimination Battle?

1844
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,350
(Please)

1845
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,819
(Nervous and anxious)

1846
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:58,859
(Pleading)

1847
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:01,130
The two crews heading to the Elimination Battle are...

1848
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,260
(The two crews heading to the Elimination Battle are...)

1849
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,359
these crews.

1850
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:09,539
Which crews will face off in the Elimination Battle?

1851
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,800
(Sinking her head)

1852
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,069
The two crews heading to the Elimination Battle are...

1853
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:16,039
(Which two crews will head to the Elimination Battle?)

1854
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:17,510
the ones in 7th and 8th place.

1855
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:19,350
(Wolf'Lo, 7th place, TSUBA KILL, 8th place)

1856
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,850
The crews heading to the Elimination Battle...

1857
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,550
are Wolf'Lo and TSUBA KILL.

1858
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:25,920
They're the ones I wanted to face the least.

1859
01:31:26,789 --> 01:31:28,020
Oh, no.

1860
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:29,859
We're saved.

1861
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,819
I'm tearing up. Really.

1862
01:31:32,189 --> 01:31:33,729
(MANNEQUEEN and Deep N Dap avoided the Elimination Battle.)

1863
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:34,859
What a relief.

1864
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:36,460
Both crews are so good at battling.

1865
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,930
We're ready.

1866
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:40,930
It looks like TSUBA KILL is also ready,

1867
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,500
so I really want to show people a great battle.

1868
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,869
I want to create a performance that is truly stunning.

1869
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,479
(Let's go, TSUBA KILL! Let's go, Wolf'Lo!)

1870
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:50,739
Let's go!

1871
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,140
She's so cool.

1872
01:31:52,449 --> 01:31:53,510
As Halo said,

1873
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,850
let's have a battle that will become legendary.

1874
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:57,720
(Let's create a legendary battle together.)

1875
01:31:58,989 --> 01:32:01,289
Here are the rules for the Elimination Battle.

1876
01:32:01,289 --> 01:32:05,119
Whoever wins 3 rounds out of 5 will win the battle.

1877
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:07,529
If a crew gets three wins first,

1878
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:09,430
the battle will end immediately.

1879
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,369
The crew that does not get three wins first...

1880
01:32:12,369 --> 01:32:14,600
must leave the fight club immediately.

1881
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:19,170
Today's Elimination Battle will be with an audience.

1882
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,409
(Audience members have gathered to watch the Elimination Battle.)

1883
01:32:21,409 --> 01:32:22,810
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1884
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:26,409
Now that it's come to this, we have no choice but to fight.

1885
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:28,609
- Yes. - Let's win and join the pool party!

1886
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:29,979
(We can do it!)

1887
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:31,680
(Absolutely!)

1888
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,619
(We will win no matter what.)

1889
01:32:33,789 --> 01:32:37,020
We believe we definitely won't be eliminated here.

1890
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,189
- Here we go. - All right.

1891
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:40,289
- Hey. - Hey.

1892
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:42,300
- TSUBA KILL. - Kill!

1893
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,500
We're confident about battling.

1894
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,970
I think TSUBA KILL will be eliminated.

1895
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:48,369
We're all battlers, so I'm not worried.

1896
01:32:48,369 --> 01:32:49,699
We can win easily.

1897
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,500
In 1, 2, 3.

1898
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,539
- Hey! - Hey!

1899
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,539
- Let's go! - I'm excited.

1900
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:57,840
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

1901
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:01,779
(The Elimination Battle will be with a live audience for the first time!)

1902
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,720
(Which crew will be the first to be eliminated?)

1903
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:05,819
(Monika, Bae Yoon Jung, Shownu)

1904
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:06,989
I'm so nervous.

1905
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:10,060
Same. My heart keeps pounding.

1906
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,289
Today, we will eliminate a crew for the first time...

1907
01:33:12,289 --> 01:33:15,699
on Street Woman Fighter 2.

1908
01:33:15,699 --> 01:33:17,460
The two crews to battle...

1909
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,529
are Wolf'Lo...

1910
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,630
and TSUBA KILL.

1911
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:22,539
Can the two crews please enter?

1912
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:34,510
(The two crews enter the fight zone amidst cheers of support.)

1913
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:38,550
I'm nervous.

1914
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:40,119
(Nervous)

1915
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:41,649
Which crew will have the dishonour...

1916
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:43,659
of being the first to be eliminated...

1917
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:46,329
from Street Woman Fighter 2?

1918
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,130
Either Wolf'Lo will be eliminated,

1919
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:49,560
or TSUBA KILL will be eliminated.

1920
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,060
Only one of these crews is destined to survive.

1921
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,899
The first round of the Elimination Battle...

1922
01:33:53,899 --> 01:33:56,069
is a 5-on-5 group battle.

1923
01:33:56,069 --> 01:33:58,739
Each crew will designate a group consisting of five members,

1924
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:00,710
and face off in a routine battle.

1925
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:02,779
Who will go first?

1926
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:06,510
Wolf'Lo will go first,

1927
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,949
and TSUBA KILL will go second.

1928
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:09,380
They must be so nervous.

1929
01:34:09,619 --> 01:34:10,680
Gosh.

1930
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:12,850
(Wolf'Lo changes to a team costume to intimidate their opponent.)

1931
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:13,920
That's amazing.

1932
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,520
- Oh, my gosh, I'm nervous. - You look great!

1933
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:19,430
I'm going to dance today even if my wrists and ankles break.

1934
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,829
We definitely won't lose.

1935
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,130
We'll show you the power of our crew, the Wolf'Lo energy.

1936
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,460
- In 1, 2, 3. - Let's go!

1937
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,529
- Wolf! - Wolf!

1938
01:34:26,729 --> 01:34:30,170
The Japanese crew will not be the first to be eliminated.

1939
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:33,539
TSUBA KILL will crush Wolf'Lo.

1940
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,210
Street Woman Fighter 2's first crew to be eliminated.

1941
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,810
We will now start that fiery battle now.

1942
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,149
You guys ready?

1943
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,079
Win!

1944
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:43,250
Let's go. Fight!

1945
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,250
Let's show them, plain and clear.

1946
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,590
Let's win in a way where there's no doubt.

1947
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,859
(Let's go!)

1948
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:19,619
(Holler)

1949
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,189
(Amazed)

1950
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:32,000
Yes.

1951
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:35,069
It was cool, but it was a bit weak.

1952
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:48,979
(All 200 percent focused on the battle)

1953
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,119
Switch!

1954
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:53,489
It's TSUBA KILL's turn.

1955
01:35:53,489 --> 01:35:54,590
(TSUBA KILL's battle begins.)

1956
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:57,989
I'm confident. We definitely will not lose this.

1957
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,729
It's TSUBA KILL's turn.

1958
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:01,090
Let's go.

1959
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,300
(Could this song be?)

1960
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,729
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1961
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,699
(They chose a great song.)

1962
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:10,039
(Interest piqued)

1963
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:11,739
TSUBA KILL chose "New Thing?"

1964
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,970
They chose an insane song.

1965
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:16,539
We've already won this thing.

1966
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:23,119
(Excited to the Max)

1967
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,850
(You can't dance the same choreography.)

1968
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:35,930
(Impressed)

1969
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:55,409
(Everyone's super excited at TSUBA KILL's wit.)

1970
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,130
In 5, 4...

1971
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:15,970
and 3, 2, 1.

1972
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,770
Battle set.

1973
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,369
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1974
01:37:19,369 --> 01:37:20,409
That was insane.

1975
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:22,069
(This is what we came to see.)

1976
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,409
- They're good. - That was fun.

1977
01:37:25,409 --> 01:37:26,750
They were so cool.

1978
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,880
They were both flawless.

1979
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,380
Their song selection totally set the mood in their favour.

1980
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,720
Their song selection was insane.

1981
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:33,949
Was that a motorcycle?

1982
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:35,289
Yes, a motorcycle.

1983
01:37:35,289 --> 01:37:36,420
(TSUBA KILL expressed a motorcycle, in line with the original theme.)

1984
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,020
I think Wolf'Lo will get it...

1985
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,460
because they were so coordinated.

1986
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:40,890
I liked that...

1987
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:42,859
- foundational hip-hop flavour. - Yes.

1988
01:37:42,859 --> 01:37:46,729
And the creativeness of the theme as well, plus the energy.

1989
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,329
The first battle is really fierce.

1990
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:49,600
That was really insane.

1991
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,869
It's time for the judges to decide.

1992
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:55,569
Please choose the victor of the battle after thinking deeply.

1993
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:58,039
I can't choose.

1994
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,949
The reactions from the audience were really good.

1995
01:38:00,949 --> 01:38:03,119
We have a better chance of winning.

1996
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,180
The first battle is very important.

1997
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:06,619
I'm totally confident we can win.

1998
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:10,090
Now we will reveal the results of the battle.

1999
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,819
Fight judges, open your cards.

2000
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:14,430
In 3, 2, 1.

2001
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,060
One!

2002
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:18,430
(Surprised)

2003
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,130
(Who won Round 1's 5-on-5 group battle?)

2004
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:29,069
The first round was won by TSUBA KILL.

2005
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,239
(TSUBA KILL won Round 1 in a 5-on-5 group battle.)

2006
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,579
Because it was the first battle,

2007
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:35,949
winning this one gave us a good start.

2008
01:38:35,949 --> 01:38:37,680
I'm scared.

2009
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:41,590
I didn't know it would be this savage.

2010
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:43,819
It's hard for dancers of traditional, older hip-hop...

2011
01:38:43,819 --> 01:38:45,260
to dance with this much energy.

2012
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,960
I was very moved by that.

2013
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:51,460
But in terms of visuals and the performance aspect,

2014
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,500
I thought TSUBA KILL was better, and I ultimately chose them.

2015
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,170
We were a bit taken aback.

2016
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:58,970
We had thought we could never lose this one,

2017
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:01,840
but TSUBA KILL is a really strong opponent.

2018
01:39:01,909 --> 01:39:03,380
It made us start to feel nervous.

2019
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:07,210
This might not go the way I thought it would.

2020
01:39:07,779 --> 01:39:10,220
The next round...

2021
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:12,180
is a 1-on-1 Ace Battle.

2022
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:15,220
Who is the ace dancer of Wolf'Lo?

2023
01:39:15,319 --> 01:39:17,220
The ace dancer of Wolf'Lo...

2024
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,789
is obviously Baby Sleek.

2025
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:25,399
Wolf'Lo's battler is Baby Sleek.

2026
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:29,399
Baby Sleek. We were expecting that.

2027
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:32,600
In that case, who is the ace dancer of TSUBA KILL?

2028
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:34,409
Our ace dancer...

2029
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:37,380
is Yumeri.

2030
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:39,479
- Okay. - Let's go!

2031
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,949
Yumeri's really good. She did contemporary dance.

2032
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:42,979
I see.

2033
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:44,779
- Her technique is incredible. - That's why she took her shoes off.

2034
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:48,390
It's not that I felt overconfident,

2035
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:49,989
but I was overflowing with the desire to win.

2036
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:53,390
The second round of the Elimination Battle...

2037
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:56,699
is Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek versus TSUBA KILL's Yumeri.

2038
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:59,600
This round provides 40 seconds each to the first and second dancers,

2039
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,470
then another 40 seconds for both dancers to dance.

2040
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:03,939
You just have to show them what you have.

2041
01:40:03,939 --> 01:40:05,640
- We can't lose this. - That's right.

2042
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:07,409
Let's go.

2043
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,640
You can do whatever you want.

2044
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,710
All right.

2045
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:14,010
If I lose here, we'll be down 2 to 0.

2046
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:16,550
It will become almost impossible to come back from that,

2047
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,880
so I felt something bubbling up inside of me.

2048
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:20,890
She has both the experience and the technique.

2049
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:23,489
She's on a totally different level.

2050
01:40:23,489 --> 01:40:26,989
Let's go!

2051
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,399
Starting now, the Ace Battle will begin.

2052
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:30,500
You guys ready?

2053
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:32,659
- Fight! - Let's go!

2054
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:37,239
(Yumeri from TSUBA KILL goes first.)

2055
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:41,470
Try dancing then.

2056
01:40:49,479 --> 01:40:50,720
Yes!

2057
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:55,750
Why did she do that?

2058
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:58,319
She's doing the same thing she did last time.

2059
01:41:05,029 --> 01:41:06,029
Hey.

2060
01:41:06,029 --> 01:41:07,069
(Impressed)

2061
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,840
Don't touch. No touching.

2062
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:21,649
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2063
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:23,750
Switch! Baby Sleek.

2064
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:25,449
(Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek's turn)

2065
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:27,550
I won't go easy on you anymore.

2066
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,619
I'll show you my skills properly.

2067
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:31,390
Baby Sleek!

2068
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:32,689
(Let's go, Wolf'Lo!)

2069
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,039
(Amazed)

2070
01:41:46,069 --> 01:41:48,270
I thought she was indeed amazing.

2071
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:03,960
(What? She's going down again? I don't know. This is scary.)

2072
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:20,069
Four, three, two, one.

2073
01:42:20,569 --> 01:42:22,039
(The Simultaneous 40-Second Move starts!)

2074
01:42:22,039 --> 01:42:24,039
I will show them what I can do.

2075
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:25,909
I am confident.

2076
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:28,350
Let's go.

2077
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:36,359
(Be careful.)

2078
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,300
Watch out.

2079
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:52,470
Watch out.

2080
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,880
Watch out.

2081
01:43:04,649 --> 01:43:05,649
(Shocked)

2082
01:43:05,649 --> 01:43:07,350
Back up!

2083
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,720
(- Oh, no! - Be careful!)

2084
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:21,869
Four, three, two, one.

2085
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:23,340
Battle set.

2086
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:24,399
(Elimination Battle, Round 2 The Ace Battle ends)

2087
01:43:26,369 --> 01:43:29,170
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2088
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:30,710
- Are you okay? You are cool! - I am okay.

2089
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:31,710
(You are cool!)

2090
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:33,180
It was cool. You did really well.

2091
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,949
It was insane.

2092
01:43:35,079 --> 01:43:38,649
I am in tears. I am seriously in tears.

2093
01:43:38,649 --> 01:43:40,350
Both of them did great.

2094
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:44,260
Let's check the result of the battle.

2095
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:45,689
It was my first time...

2096
01:43:45,689 --> 01:43:48,359
being so desperate about a dance battle.

2097
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:52,229
I wanted to win at all costs and help out my crew.

2098
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,729
Fight judges, open your cards.

2099
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:57,270
Three, two, one.

2100
01:43:57,739 --> 01:44:01,340
(Who is the winner of Round 2 of Ace Battle?)

2101
01:44:04,409 --> 01:44:08,279
(In Round 2 of Ace Battle, Baby Sleek of Wolf'Lo won.)

2102
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:12,050
With a score of 3 to 0, Baby Sleep of Wolf'Lo won...

2103
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:15,619
against Yumeri of TSUBA KILL.

2104
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:17,859
Firstly, I could tell...

2105
01:44:17,859 --> 01:44:20,630
that both dancers truly wanted to win.

2106
01:44:20,859 --> 01:44:23,930
It was hard to choose the winner from the last battle.

2107
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:26,569
But when they had a 1-on-1 in the 1st battle,

2108
01:44:26,569 --> 01:44:29,899
Yumeri didn't use a broader area...

2109
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:31,439
than the usual.

2110
01:44:31,539 --> 01:44:33,710
So I picked Baby Sleek...

2111
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:36,069
as she used more energy...

2112
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:38,510
and had a higher number of successful techniques.

2113
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:40,649
It was a dance with depth...

2114
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:43,119
that came from her experience.

2115
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,149
That was why I chose Baby Sleek.

2116
01:44:45,149 --> 01:44:47,850
I don't have anything else to say. It was freakishly cool.

2117
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:51,489
(She nailed it.)

2118
01:44:51,489 --> 01:44:52,920
(I admit it.)

2119
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,890
I won,

2120
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:56,659
but I guess I felt pressured.

2121
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:59,600
I thought, "Losing isn't an option."

2122
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,770
I bumped into her while dancing.

2123
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:05,600
I was desperate. Yumeri was desperate too.

2124
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,340
Both of us were agitated...

2125
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,369
due to desperation.

2126
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:13,550
I felt bad after the battle ended.

2127
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:16,949
- I am sorry. - You were cool.

2128
01:45:16,949 --> 01:45:20,250
Both of them were serious about the battle.

2129
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,350
It was really cool.

2130
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:25,020
Wolf'Lo took a win in Round Two.

2131
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,189
Wolf'Lo versus TSUBA KILL. The score is now 1 to 1.

2132
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:30,800
Until the end, you can't predict the Elimination Battle result.

2133
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,430
Round Three is the Leader Battle.

2134
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:35,899
(Round 3, Leader Battle Halo versus Akanen)

2135
01:45:35,899 --> 01:45:37,100
Let's go!

2136
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,539
(We waited for the Leader Battle!)

2137
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:40,670
They must be under so much pressure.

2138
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:43,479
It's a matter of pride.

2139
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:46,279
As a battler, I will show what I can do.

2140
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:48,550
I was nervous.

2141
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:51,880
But I knew that losing the battle would make me lose face.

2142
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:55,520
I was determined to win the Leader Battle no matter what.

2143
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,359
With the crews' pride on the line,

2144
01:45:57,359 --> 01:45:59,489
the leaders will compete in this life-or-death battle.

2145
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:01,560
The Leader Battle starts now.

2146
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,590
Are you guys ready?

2147
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:04,329
Fight!

2148
01:46:04,699 --> 01:46:05,859
(Akanen of TSUBA KILL goes first.)

2149
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,399
(Let's go.)

2150
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:20,909
Let's go.

2151
01:46:23,949 --> 01:46:25,020
What?

2152
01:46:26,789 --> 01:46:28,989
I will bet my everything on this.

2153
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,840
(Leader, show her!)

2154
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:50,779
Five, four, three, two, one.

2155
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:52,609
Halo's turn.

2156
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:55,779
One. Halo's turn.

2157
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,220
It wasn't threatening at all.

2158
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,850
The scale was too small.

2159
01:47:00,949 --> 01:47:03,119
I thought that I would be able to show a difference in our levels.

2160
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,119
Halo!

2161
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:07,289
Let's go!

2162
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:15,000
Oh, my goodness.

2163
01:47:21,739 --> 01:47:23,840
(That's incredible.)

2164
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:28,510
Okay. That's good.

2165
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:30,880
Her body is all warmed up.

2166
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:41,989
(Yes.)

2167
01:47:47,729 --> 01:47:50,239
Halo, I am dying over here. What are you doing?

2168
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:51,270
You are so good.

2169
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,810
Four, three, two, one.

2170
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,510
Let's go.

2171
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,609
(Bring it on.)

2172
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:00,649
One.

2173
01:48:00,649 --> 01:48:01,979
(Her facial expression changes.)

2174
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,079
(The Simultaneous 40-Second Move starts!)

2175
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:08,420
I will have everyone focus on me.

2176
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:09,590
I will show them my moves with confidence.

2177
01:48:10,119 --> 01:48:11,619
I will win no matter what.

2178
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,109
(Her eyes go wide.)

2179
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:40,989
(That's incredible.)

2180
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:54,000
Move forward.

2181
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,069
Watch out.

2182
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,869
Oh, no!

2183
01:48:58,869 --> 01:49:00,039
(Oh, no.)

2184
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:17,159
Five, four, three, two, one.

2185
01:49:17,159 --> 01:49:18,220
Battle set.

2186
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,890
(Round 3, Leader Battle ends.)

2187
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:24,630
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2188
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:26,029
Wolf'Lo did well.

2189
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:28,270
TSUBA KILL did well too.

2190
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:31,270
- We totally won. - Well done.

2191
01:49:31,539 --> 01:49:34,439
- It was cool. - Well done.

2192
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:35,970
(The leaders represented the crews and gave the best battle.)

2193
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:38,380
My goodness!

2194
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:40,279
What are we going to do?

2195
01:49:40,279 --> 01:49:42,210
I am glad I joined Street Woman Fighter 2.

2196
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,880
They burned up their energy.

2197
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,319
That's how a battle should go.

2198
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:47,550
You have to do whatever you can.

2199
01:49:48,489 --> 01:49:51,060
- It's so hard. - This is driving me crazy.

2200
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:52,659
- What should we do? - It's hard.

2201
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:54,930
(Sighing)

2202
01:49:55,329 --> 01:49:56,729
(To avoid spoilers, all audience members exited...)

2203
01:49:56,729 --> 01:49:58,229
(before announcing the result of Round 3.)

2204
01:49:58,229 --> 01:49:59,460
- You watched the performance today. - Yes.

2205
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:01,729
- What did you think? - It was so cool.

2206
01:50:01,729 --> 01:50:03,100
I had so much fun.

2207
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,840
I am rooting for both teams,

2208
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,810
so I can't possibly pick one.

2209
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:07,970
I am rooting for both teams.

2210
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:09,409
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2211
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:12,880
The Elimination Battle between Wolf'Lo and TSUBA KILL...

2212
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,210
will determine the first crew to be eliminated.

2213
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:19,149
Let's check the result of the Leader Battle.

2214
01:50:19,149 --> 01:50:20,949
Fight judges, open your cards.

2215
01:50:20,949 --> 01:50:23,420
Three, two, one.

2216
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,590
One.

2217
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,060
One.

2218
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:31,500
(In Round 3, Leader Battle, Akanen of TSUBA KILL won.)

2219
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,729
With a score of 2 to 1, Akanen TSUBA KILL won...

2220
01:50:34,729 --> 01:50:37,239
against Halo of Wolf'Lo.

2221
01:50:40,069 --> 01:50:41,210
You did well.

2222
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:46,479
When I saw the result, tears welled up in my eyes.

2223
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:47,850
I felt so bad.

2224
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:50,479
I saw her cry. As soon as I saw it, I looked to the front.

2225
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:51,979
The battle wasn't over.

2226
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:53,649
The final result wasn't out.

2227
01:50:53,649 --> 01:50:55,020
"I need to stay alert."

2228
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,560
That thought filled my head.

2229
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,789
During the 1-on-1 solo performance,

2230
01:51:00,789 --> 01:51:04,100
I thought Halo's moves were more stable.

2231
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,359
So I wanted to vote for Halo.

2232
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:08,199
But in the second part of the battle,

2233
01:51:08,199 --> 01:51:10,239
Akanen grabbed my attention so much...

2234
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,970
that I couldn't watch Halo's dance.

2235
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:16,109
I based my judgement on my honest reaction...

2236
01:51:16,109 --> 01:51:19,909
and voted for Akanen although the difference was slight.

2237
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:23,149
Akanen of TSUBA KILL brought a precious win to the crew.

2238
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:25,520
The current score is 2 to 1.

2239
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,850
If the crew with two wins, TSUBA KILL,

2240
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:29,819
wins in this round, their survival will be finalized...

2241
01:51:29,819 --> 01:51:32,220
and the Elimination Battle will immediately end.

2242
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:35,430
Stay strong. We got this.

2243
01:51:35,859 --> 01:51:38,529
What will be the fate of the two crews?

2244
01:51:38,659 --> 01:51:42,569
Round 4 is the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

2245
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,300
- Good luck. - Let's go.

2246
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,439
Who is the best duo in TSUBA KILL?

2247
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:51,409
The members who will participate in the 2-on-2 Duet Battle are...

2248
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:53,340
(Momo...)

2249
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:54,510
(and Akanen)

2250
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:56,050
(That's incredible.)

2251
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:58,579
The strongest dancers will come forward.

2252
01:51:58,579 --> 01:52:01,619
The best duo in Wolf'Lo is...

2253
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:09,329
Mini and Baby Sleek.

2254
01:52:09,529 --> 01:52:11,560
Baby Sleek.

2255
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:15,069
That's insane.

2256
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:16,970
It's a new combination.

2257
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,239
It's the nuclear bomb of a combination.

2258
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:20,569
It's the very best move.

2259
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:21,810
It's a strong duo.

2260
01:52:21,869 --> 01:52:24,510
I was surprised to see Baby Sleek come out.

2261
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:26,909
The combination wasn't what I had expected,

2262
01:52:26,979 --> 01:52:29,550
but I wasn't very afraid.

2263
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:31,520
This is the important time.

2264
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,850
Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek and Mini versus...

2265
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:35,750
TSUBA KILL's Akanen and Momo.

2266
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,560
The Duet Battle starts now.

2267
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,689
Are you guys ready?

2268
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,159
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2269
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:42,260
Fight!

2270
01:52:43,899 --> 01:52:45,500
(Akanen and Momo of TSUBA KILL go first.)

2271
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:16,899
TSUBA KILL is a strong opponent.

2272
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:24,300
(That's it!)

2273
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,439
That's insane.

2274
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,779
(Cheering)

2275
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:43,250
Five, four, three, two, one.

2276
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:44,520
Switch.

2277
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:47,590
Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek and Mini, let's go.

2278
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:51,529
We will lose unless we really show them.

2279
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:54,000
Baby Sleek and Mini, let's go.

2280
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,100
Let's go.

2281
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,770
(Screaming)

2282
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:00,869
(My goodness)

2283
01:54:02,909 --> 01:54:04,010
(Screaming)

2284
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:09,079
Let's go, Mini!

2285
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:31,600
(We love it.)

2286
01:54:41,449 --> 01:54:42,609
(Going wild)

2287
01:54:51,989 --> 01:54:56,060
Five, four, three, two...

2288
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:59,960
Three, two, one.

2289
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:02,069
Battle set.

2290
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:04,199
(Elimination Battle, Round 4 The Duet Battle ends.)

2291
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:06,000
(Did you see that?)

2292
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,670
(Yes, we saw that!)

2293
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:09,239
That was insane.

2294
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,680
That was a really hot one.

2295
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:14,010
The battle between Wolf'Lo's Baby Sleek and Mini...

2296
01:55:14,010 --> 01:55:17,220
and TSUBA KILL's Akanen and Momo came to an end.

2297
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:18,680
Wolf'Lo members...

2298
01:55:18,949 --> 01:55:21,250
showed us a different colour, so I was very surprised.

2299
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:23,050
As for TSUBA KILL members,

2300
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:26,560
they were really cool when they didn't miss a single beat.

2301
01:55:27,159 --> 01:55:29,460
I based my judgement on my taste.

2302
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:32,960
Let's check out the result of the battle.

2303
01:55:33,229 --> 01:55:34,729
Which duo will win?

2304
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:36,500
Both duos were so refreshing.

2305
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:39,569
We had moves that definitely deserved a win,

2306
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:42,039
so we were quite confident.

2307
01:55:42,039 --> 01:55:44,010
I thought that it would be impossible to lose.

2308
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,340
I thought that we would win.

2309
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:48,010
Seriously.

2310
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:49,949
Of course, we were worried.

2311
01:55:49,949 --> 01:55:51,479
I was very startled when I saw TSUBA KILL's routine.

2312
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:54,090
It was unique, and the formation was refreshing.

2313
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:56,890
Fight judges, open your cards.

2314
01:55:57,090 --> 01:56:00,060
Three, two, one.

2315
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,560
(The current score is 2 to 1.)

2316
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,199
(If Wolf'Lo loses, they will be eliminated.)

2317
01:56:08,029 --> 01:56:09,170
I am so annoyed.

2318
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:10,340
Don't cry.

2319
01:56:10,739 --> 01:56:12,539
"Gosh, it's over."

2320
01:56:13,369 --> 01:56:14,770
"I can't believe our tactic didn't work."

2321
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:17,909
"Did we lose? Do we need to go home now?"

2322
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,140
- I am so annoyed. - It isn't over yet.

2323
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:21,210
That's right.

2324
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:22,310
Steel your heart.

2325
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:23,579
Steel your heart. It isn't over yet.

2326
01:56:23,579 --> 01:56:26,180
That was when I came to my senses.

2327
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:28,789
(Wolf'Lo: 2, TSUBA KILL: 1)

2328
01:56:28,789 --> 01:56:30,520
(In Round 4, Duet Battle, Baby Sleek and Mini of Wolf'Lo won.)

2329
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,060
My goodness.

2330
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:35,789
With a score of 2 to 1, Wolf'Lo won.

2331
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:37,199
(Wolf'Lo brought on a tie of 2 to 2 and survived in a dramatic manner.)

2332
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:38,729
Thank goodness.

2333
01:56:38,729 --> 01:56:41,199
We received the last chance.

2334
01:56:41,699 --> 01:56:43,229
So this is how it's going to be.

2335
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:47,239
I knew that they wouldn't go away so easily.

2336
01:56:47,369 --> 01:56:49,010
But oh, my goodness.

2337
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:52,210
We like it, but...

2338
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:53,779
They are taking this to the end.

2339
01:56:53,779 --> 01:56:55,949
Baby Sleek and Mini of Wolf'Lo...

2340
01:56:55,949 --> 01:56:57,520
took a win...

2341
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,750
and took the battle back to square one.

2342
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:02,789
(The current score is 2 to 2.)

2343
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:04,220
I am so nervous.

2344
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:06,119
Only the last round remains.

2345
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:09,159
The final battle will determine the survival and elimination.

2346
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:11,859
The final round of the Elimination Battle is...

2347
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,399
the Hidden Battle.

2348
01:57:13,899 --> 01:57:16,829
(Round 5, Hidden Battle Wolf'Lo versus TSUBA KILL)

2349
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:18,369
Here they come.

2350
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:20,369
(Wolf'Lo members enter in a new outfit...)

2351
01:57:20,369 --> 01:57:21,510
(for the Hidden Battle.)

2352
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:22,640
"Kingsman."

2353
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:24,439
They look so cool.

2354
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:25,739
Their styles look so different.

2355
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:27,949
Gosh, they look so cool.

2356
01:57:28,479 --> 01:57:30,649
Both crews prepared hard.

2357
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:33,119
I didn't think that they would use an umbrella.

2358
01:57:33,579 --> 01:57:35,689
I would be happy even if they stab me with it.

2359
01:57:35,689 --> 01:57:38,220
Our strategy for the Hidden Battle is...

2360
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,659
The Mafia members' bloody battle on a rainy day.

2361
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:42,729
We are experiencing a whirlpool of emotions.

2362
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:44,130
We need to stay strong.

2363
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:47,000
This is the last battle that will determine...

2364
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,229
which crew gets eliminated.

2365
01:57:49,399 --> 01:57:50,770
I will use all my might...

2366
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,199
and give the best performance.

2367
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:55,939
One crew will get eliminated without fail in this death match.

2368
01:57:55,939 --> 01:57:57,909
Wolf'Lo versus TSUBA KILL. TSUBA KILL versus Wolf'Lo.

2369
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:00,710
The life-or-death battle that will determine...

2370
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:03,680
Street Woman Fighter 2's first elimination begins now.

2371
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:04,779
Are you guys ready?

2372
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:06,220
- Yes, let's go. - Yes.

2373
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:07,949
- Akanen! - Let's go!

2374
01:58:08,189 --> 01:58:09,350
Fight!

2375
01:58:09,789 --> 01:58:11,460
(Elimination Battle)

2376
01:58:11,619 --> 01:58:12,689
What a song.

2377
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:20,060
Even when we are standing still, we will make them feel like...

2378
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:22,100
they lost in the battle.

2379
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:24,939
Let's go!

2380
01:58:40,819 --> 01:58:42,920
(They get goosebumps.)

2381
01:59:04,579 --> 01:59:05,939
They are so cool.

2382
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:09,050
Nice.

2383
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,399
(Screaming)

2384
01:59:28,069 --> 01:59:29,199
Switch.

2385
01:59:29,229 --> 01:59:30,539
TSUBA KILL's turn.

2386
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:36,739
Switch.

2387
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,109
TSUBA KILL's turn.

2388
01:59:38,109 --> 01:59:39,880
(TSUBA KILL goes second.)

2389
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:43,050
We showed a lot of hip-hop moves so far,

2390
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:47,750
so we decided to show our femininity for the first time.

2391
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,329
My goodness.

2392
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:01,970
My goodness.

2393
02:00:29,029 --> 02:00:30,060
They are sexy.

2394
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:31,100
(Teasing)

2395
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:36,300
Four, three, two,

2396
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:37,699
- one. - My goodness.

2397
02:00:37,699 --> 02:00:39,500
- The battle is over. - My goodness.

2398
02:00:40,710 --> 02:00:41,739
(Winking)

2399
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:43,069
(Smiling)

2400
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,949
Until the end...

2401
02:00:48,949 --> 02:00:51,050
They worked hard. They made preparations diligently.

2402
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:52,880
So that's how you use the props.

2403
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:55,250
Watching the battle motivates me a lot.

2404
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:56,689
- We shouldn't underestimate them. - No.

2405
02:00:57,390 --> 02:01:00,760
The battle between Wolf'Lo and TSUBA KILL came to an end.

2406
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:03,159
Fight judges, it's time for your decision.

2407
02:01:03,159 --> 02:01:04,729
After some thought,

2408
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,800
please pick the winner of the battle.

2409
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:10,000
They must be so nervous. Oh, no.

2410
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,199
Wolf'Lo's performance was too strong.

2411
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:12,239
Their idea was incredible.

2412
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:13,770
It was like a musical.

2413
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:14,970
- I know. - Right?

2414
02:01:15,069 --> 02:01:16,840
I didn't know TSUBA KILL had such charms.

2415
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,539
I didn't expect such a group dance.

2416
02:01:18,609 --> 02:01:19,939
It was completely different.

2417
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:21,810
They captivated my heart.

2418
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:24,119
(The 3 fight judges are torn.)

2419
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:25,550
Why can't there be a tie?

2420
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:28,649
Let's check out the result of the last battle...

2421
02:01:28,689 --> 02:01:30,520
that will determine the first eliminated crew...

2422
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,359
of Street Woman Fighter 2.

2423
02:01:32,789 --> 02:01:34,789
There are so many things...

2424
02:01:34,789 --> 02:01:36,229
we haven't shown yet.

2425
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,100
We can't become the first crew to be eliminated.

2426
02:01:40,329 --> 02:01:43,770
We proved that we were a strong crew,

2427
02:01:43,869 --> 02:01:46,739
so we won't get eliminated.

2428
02:01:46,739 --> 02:01:49,539
This is the last round. This is the last one point.

2429
02:01:49,569 --> 02:01:51,239
This is so scary.

2430
02:01:51,909 --> 02:01:54,279
Fight judges, open your cards.

2431
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:57,250
Three, two, one!

2432
02:01:59,619 --> 02:02:01,920
(To be continued)

2433
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:05,189
(What will be the result of the Elimination Battle?)

2434
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:07,689
Fight judges, open your cards.

2435
02:02:07,689 --> 02:02:10,699
Three, two, one!

2436
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:12,229
- Oh, gosh. - Yes!

2437
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:16,329
One!

2438
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:19,239
(Wolf'Lo won by a landslide with a score of 3 to 0.)

2439
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:21,640
(Relieved)

2440
02:02:24,109 --> 02:02:26,109
With a score of 3 to 0,

2441
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:29,210
Wolf'Lo took the win.

2442
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:31,119
(Wolf'Lo wins in the Elimination Battle.)

2443
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:33,979
(The final score, Wolf'Lo: 3, TSUBA KILL: 2)

2444
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:35,520
It's over.

2445
02:02:36,619 --> 02:02:37,659
It feels...

2446
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:39,859
I feel like crying.

2447
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:42,659
It was a relative evaluation.

2448
02:02:42,789 --> 02:02:44,329
So we had to find the flaws...

2449
02:02:44,329 --> 02:02:47,800
of the choreography rather than focusing on the good parts.

2450
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:49,130
In that sense,

2451
02:02:49,369 --> 02:02:51,699
Wolf'Lo was better at using props,

2452
02:02:51,699 --> 02:02:55,869
and their concept and the level of completion were better.

2453
02:02:56,010 --> 02:02:57,270
Thank you.

2454
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:00,340
At the crossroads of elimination and survival,

2455
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:02,279
both crews showed the fiercest...

2456
02:03:02,279 --> 02:03:05,050
and the best battles. As a result,

2457
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:08,149
the first crew to leave the fight zone...

2458
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:09,390
is TSUBA KILL.

2459
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:11,289
(The first crew to be eliminated is TSUBA KILL.)

2460
02:03:12,789 --> 02:03:16,960
(The dancers applaud TSUBA KILL for doing their best until the end.)

2461
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:20,359
I'm grateful to have participated in this show...

2462
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,869
and that we could be here representing Japan.

2463
02:03:22,869 --> 02:03:24,640
I'm grateful for everything.

2464
02:03:24,899 --> 02:03:27,739
We learned through our trials and errors.

2465
02:03:27,739 --> 02:03:31,239
Everyone did their best for this challenge,

2466
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,710
so it was the best experience for me.

2467
02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:34,109
Thank you so much.

2468
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:39,579
For us who came from Japan,

2469
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:42,750
you always cheered us on,

2470
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:45,090
and you always told us that it was okay.

2471
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:50,729
Thank you so much for being kind to us.

2472
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:54,770
It was...

2473
02:03:56,229 --> 02:03:57,539
the best experience of my life.

2474
02:03:57,970 --> 02:04:01,569
Being able to fight with everyone here...

2475
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:07,680
was the most precious time of my life.

2476
02:04:08,079 --> 02:04:10,710
So I have no regrets at all.

2477
02:04:10,949 --> 02:04:12,520
Thank you for everything.

2478
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:16,090
Regardless of our nationality,

2479
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:18,789
our looks, or genres,

2480
02:04:18,789 --> 02:04:20,560
we communicated with each other...

2481
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,289
through dance, which we all love.

2482
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:26,199
It was the most fun experience of my life. Thank you so much.

2483
02:04:26,529 --> 02:04:29,170
Please don't forget TSUBA KILL.

2484
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:35,710
I had mixed feelings.

2485
02:04:36,039 --> 02:04:39,439
I thought, "There's more we can show."

2486
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:41,979
I thought we could show more of our colour...

2487
02:04:41,979 --> 02:04:45,550
and our dance.

2488
02:04:45,550 --> 02:04:48,449
TSUBA KILL, you may leave the fight zone.

2489
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:55,090
(It's time to say goodbye one last time.)

2490
02:04:56,029 --> 02:04:58,529
Representing Japan,

2491
02:04:58,529 --> 02:05:04,199
we wanted to upgrade the stature of Japan's dance scene.

2492
02:05:04,199 --> 02:05:09,340
So we're really upset that we got eliminated at this stage.

2493
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:13,439
But we have no regrets...

2494
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:18,319
because we showed 200 percent in everything we did.

2495
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:19,819
We have no regrets.

2496
02:05:19,949 --> 02:05:21,720
We want to see you more and more.

2497
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:24,220
Yes, definitely. This is just the beginning.

2498
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:26,789
Thank you. Good luck.

2499
02:05:26,989 --> 02:05:29,529
- You were really amazing. - You were too.

2500
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:31,760
Oh, my gosh.

2501
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:34,699
Despite being a crew strong in choreographies,

2502
02:05:34,699 --> 02:05:37,029
we really respect their dance skills.

2503
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:40,869
If I were to participate in a survival show in another country,

2504
02:05:40,869 --> 02:05:42,770
I wouldn't have been able to do it, to be honest.

2505
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:43,869
I wouldn't have been able to survive.

2506
02:05:43,869 --> 02:05:45,510
It must've been really difficult for them...

2507
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:47,039
since they didn't speak the language.

2508
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:50,210
The audience will see how incredible you are as individuals...

2509
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:51,220
and as a crew,

2510
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:54,689
so I'm so proud and happy that I got to meet you guys.

2511
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:57,720
- Thank you! - Bye!

2512
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,220
Thank you so much!

2513
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:01,890
- We love you! - We love you!

2514
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:03,859
We love you!

2515
02:06:04,729 --> 02:06:08,500
- We love you! - We love you!

2516
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,600
(The eliminated crew, TSUBA KILL)

2517
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:14,770
(Today will be their last time in their hideout...)

2518
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:16,210
(that embraced them warmly.)

2519
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:18,239
I don't want us to be eliminated.

2520
02:06:18,579 --> 02:06:20,479
It's over.

2521
02:06:20,979 --> 02:06:23,350
I don't think we got to show our true skills.

2522
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:25,920
I really wanted to show our mega crew dance too.

2523
02:06:26,449 --> 02:06:28,989
(Wolf'Lo, their last opponent, came to TSUBA KILL's hideout.)

2524
02:06:28,989 --> 02:06:33,390
I really respect the Japanese dance scene culture.

2525
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:34,659
(Close to tears)

2526
02:06:34,659 --> 02:06:36,960
She's crying so much.

2527
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,560
This is so nice.

2528
02:06:38,729 --> 02:06:42,170
It was a really amazing battle.

2529
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:43,199
Thank you so much.

2530
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:44,840
- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

2531
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:46,569
Let's take photos.

2532
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:49,270
In 1, 2, 3.

2533
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:53,180
We rarely have a chance to make friends with dancers...

2534
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:57,180
from another country in a space like this.

2535
02:06:57,479 --> 02:07:00,479
I'm grateful to the show that we could communicate...

2536
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:01,920
with each other through dancing.

2537
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:04,050
It doesn't...

2538
02:07:04,359 --> 02:07:05,890
feel real yet.

2539
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:09,430
Our crew came together to make performances.

2540
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:14,100
And showing them in front of the audience was the most fun part.

2541
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:17,399
Without them, we wouldn't have made it this far,

2542
02:07:17,399 --> 02:07:20,500
so I'm happy that I made it this far with everyone.

2543
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,409
The days I spent with them after coming together...

2544
02:07:22,409 --> 02:07:24,170
and forming a crew...

2545
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:26,810
are the most amazing days I've ever had.

2546
02:07:26,909 --> 02:07:29,479
Even when I turn 80, 90, and 100,

2547
02:07:29,479 --> 02:07:34,079
I hope to make more performances as a member of TSUBA KILL.

2548
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,949
- KILL! - KILL!

2549
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:44,289
(What would you say to the remaining crews?)

2550
02:07:44,329 --> 02:07:48,170
We'll continue to root for you in Japan.

2551
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:50,630
We really love you guys.

2552
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:53,600
Thank you. Goodbye.

2553
02:07:54,710 --> 02:07:57,439
Should we write "thank you" here?

2554
02:07:57,439 --> 02:07:59,710
(Thank you.)

2555
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:01,579
It's over.

2556
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:04,079
Thank you so much.

2557
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:05,979
Thank you so much.

2558
02:08:06,119 --> 02:08:07,479
Bye, our hideout.

2559
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:10,890
I don't want to leave.

2560
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:12,489
I don't want to leave.

2561
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:14,430
We'll be back soon.

2562
02:08:14,430 --> 02:08:15,859
We will come back.

2563
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,130
(Goodbye to TSUBA KILL,)

2564
02:08:22,130 --> 02:08:23,630
(the crew that did their best in every moment.)

2565
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:25,199
(I don't want to go home.)

2566
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:26,399
(Take care of your body and mind!)

2567
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:27,600
(We'll be rooting for you in Japan.)

2568
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:28,840
(Thank you.)

2569
02:08:31,779 --> 02:08:33,380
(Next week, the unrevealed battles everyone's been waiting for...)

2570
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:34,449
(will be revealed.)

2571
02:08:34,449 --> 02:08:35,880
(No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer)

2572
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:43,890
(The unrevealed battles will be revealed!)

2573
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:48,329
(The aces of 8 crews)

2574
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:51,729
(The vibe from her years of experience)

2575
02:08:51,729 --> 02:08:53,359
(Shouldn't we pay to watch this?)

2576
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:54,800
(Surprised)

2577
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,229
(This is so fun!)

2578
02:08:56,369 --> 02:08:58,270
(Which Ace Battle shocked everyone?)

2579
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,039
(And the week after the next one, the Mega Crew Mission...)

2580
02:09:00,039 --> 02:09:01,539
(on the biggest scale will be revealed!)

2581
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:05,109
(A new mission for the dancers)

2582
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:07,239
(The Mega Crew Mission on a huge scale)

2583
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:08,479
(Is that Rie Hata?)

2584
02:09:08,609 --> 02:09:11,119
(What if BEBE brings NCT again?)

2585
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:13,850
I really want to do the Mega Crew Mission with you.

2586
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:15,020
(We'll bring them as our helpers.)

2587
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:17,960
(JAM REPUBLIC shouldn't bring Parris Goebel as their helper.)

2588
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:19,420
Our special guest...

2589
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:21,789
If he comes and finishes off in that power,

2590
02:09:21,789 --> 02:09:22,989
we'd be fire.

2591
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:24,659
(1MILLION created the Mega Crew Mission choreography...)

2592
02:09:24,659 --> 02:09:26,500
(with the most number of people in the history of Mega Crew Mission.)

2593
02:09:26,699 --> 02:09:29,569
(When you move out, only the first row should move out.)

2594
02:09:29,569 --> 02:09:31,100
(We decided to have two rows move out last time.)

2595
02:09:31,239 --> 02:09:33,500
- Five, six, and seven... - Seven...

2596
02:09:33,739 --> 02:09:35,109
I think that'd be too late.

2597
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:36,640
We organized everything,

2598
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:38,909
but she confirmed it way too late.

2599
02:09:39,539 --> 02:09:41,380
They weren't accepting...

2600
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:42,850
of the directions I gave them at all.

2601
02:09:42,949 --> 02:09:44,779
Let's run through a couple of times first.

2602
02:09:44,779 --> 02:09:46,220
Let's decide on this first.

2603
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,420
They did everything on their own,

2604
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:48,789
and they made decisions by themselves.

2605
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:50,319
Do they even need me?

2606
02:09:50,649 --> 02:09:53,319
The first director will be Downy.

2607
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,659
I had to lead a part for my crew.

2608
02:09:55,659 --> 02:09:57,060
It was a little too pressuring for me.

2609
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:58,829
If we don't move out during this part,

2610
02:09:58,829 --> 02:10:01,770
will it be a problem for the next part's formation?

2611
02:10:01,829 --> 02:10:04,229
How can you ask that to the dancers?

2612
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,140
Does it look okay to you?

2613
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:08,270
Well, I don't really like it.

2614
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:10,810
We couldn't move on, so I was frustrated.

2615
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:12,840
How do the dancers on both ends sit?

2616
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,649
Where must their knees face?

2617
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:16,210
They're not symmetric.

2618
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:17,350
When must they come in?

2619
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:21,489
How can you not know that?

2620
02:10:21,489 --> 02:10:23,390
You should've figured that out.

2621
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:25,420
I thought we couldn't go on like this.

2622
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:28,029
We had to change almost everything from the start.

2623
02:10:28,289 --> 02:10:31,159
I was so anxious because we were running out of time.

2624
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:34,199
It's driving me crazy. I feel like we haven't done anything.

2625
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:36,600
The weight of being the executive director..

2626
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:39,239
Can I step out for a moment?

2627
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:41,409
(Can I step out for a moment?)

2628
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:48,850
I don't want to do it anymore.

2629
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:51,920
(Why did Mina Myoung break down in the middle of a mission?)

2630
02:10:52,079 --> 02:10:54,689
(The voting for the Mega Crew Mission begins now.)

2631
02:10:54,689 --> 02:10:56,289
The feast of performances on a huge scale...

2632
02:10:56,289 --> 02:10:57,350
that the seven crews will present.

2633
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:01,829
Vote for the crew that showed the most impressive performance.

2634
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:04,630
The Mega Crew Mission voting will be counted through Mnet Plus.

2635
02:11:04,729 --> 02:11:07,500
You can vote until midnight of September 19.

2636
02:11:08,029 --> 02:11:10,500
Please participate in the Mega Crew Mission voting now.

2637
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:15,670
