(Street Woman Fighter 2, The birth of the winning crew)

2
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,890
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,198
(Street Woman Fighter 2 was as fierce as ever.)

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,499
(The original resolution)

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,499
(Which crew will win and take the trophy?)

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,599
(Which crew will it be?)

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,639
(The final winner, BEBE)

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,809
(The final winner, BEBE)

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,139
(It was the birth of the winning crew...)

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,579
(on Street Woman Fighter 2!)

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,020
(I am jealous!)

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,789
(Congratulations.)

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,589
(BEBE had the honour of placing 1st in the global dance scene.)

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,159
(Again, congratulations.)

15
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,798
(The behind-the-scenes stories that came before this moment...)

16
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,229
(will be revealed now.)

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,339
Hello.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,709
It's good to see you.

19
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,438
Hello.

20
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,579
(The 8 crews meet up for the 1st time in a while.)

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,249
(TSUBA KILL came to Korea for the special stage.)

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,779
(It's so good to see you again.)

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,849
- I missed you so much. - Same.

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,420
How do I say, "It has been a while?"

25
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,688
- "Long time no see." - How do I say it in Japanese?

26
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,889
- Japanese? - "Long time no see."

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,919
(Peeking)

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,889
What? It has been so long.

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,890
(The 8 crews are excited to be together after a long while.)

30
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,929
- Hello... - TSUBA...

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,298
- Hello, - Hello,

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,530
- we are TSUBA KILL. - we are TSUBA KILL.

33
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:37,269
(We are back!)

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,768
It has been a while.

35
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,569
We are happy.

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,510
(They wear their name tags and get ready for practice.)

37
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,739
(JAM REPUBLIC and MANNEQUEEN couldn't join.)

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,510
It's our song.

39
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,849
It's the rookie class song.

40
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,889
(The cute, cheerful, and charming rookie class'...)

41
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,519
(behind-the-scenes stories for "Twerk" will be revealed!)

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,519
(Laughing)

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,189
(The rookies are happy looking at each other.)

44
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,358
Let's have an interview for the rookies.

45
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,530
(She suddenly becomes a host.)

46
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,469
Take turns and reveal what you ate today.

47
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,699
Koreans get strength from rice. I had sundae soup.

48
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,339
(Bibimbap)

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Good job.

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,340
As for me,

51
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,509
I had the spicy pork soup...

52
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,949
and grilled mackerel.

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,619
All right.

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,878
So tasty.

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,918
Tasty.

56
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,718
The rookies will play the first impression game.

57
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,860
- In here... - Let's go.

58
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,559
In here, who will be number one...

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,159
- Number 1. - Number 1.

60
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:35,829
In here, who will be number one...

61
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,960
- Number 1. - Number 1.

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,400
In terms of scariness when she is angry?

63
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,530
How do I say it in Japanese?

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,139
(interpreting right away)

65
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,198
(Redy is a great host who is good at interpreting.)

66
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,669
In here.

67
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,978
(Serious)

68
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,210
Three, two, one.

69
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,848
(Everyone picked a member except for Rena of TSUBA KILL.)

70
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,919
(My goodness.)

71
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,719
- She picked Yeni Cho. - Me?

72
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,948
- Me? - It's 2 to 2.

73
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,649
- It's 2 to 2. - It's 2 to 2.

74
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,019
- It's 2 to 2. - Is it 2 to 2?

75
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,218
- Is it 2 to 2? - It's a tie.

76
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,519
- Is it 2 to 2? - Really?

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
As for me,

78
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,189
I have no respect for you.

79
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,490
I will end all of you.

80
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,128
I am not scary at all.

81
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,330
(Showing a heart)

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Round Two.

83
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,029
(The aspiring host moves on smoothly)

84
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,038
- Won't we reveal the reasons? - The reasons.

85
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,598
Things will get messy if we do that.

86
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,900
Okay.

87
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,639
- Next. - All right.

88
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,180
- In here, who is number 1... - Number 1.

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,478
in terms of not showering?

90
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,550
(In here, who is number one in terms of not showering?)

91
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,449
(What is this?)

92
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,378
- Three, - Right now?

93
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,619
two, one.

94
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,718
I can't do it.

95
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,389
(Rena doesn't know what to do.)

96
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,119
Look at me.

97
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,090
I am wise. I picked myself.

98
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,430
Hey.

99
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,698
Even if things get messy, I want to hear the reasons.

100
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,969
Even if things get messy, I want to hear the reasons.

101
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,500
(Truth lies beyond.)

102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,769
(The pouting mode is on)

103
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,968
- What? - She is angry.

104
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,039
- I see. - I feel victimized.

105
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,310
I feel victimized.

106
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,908
(The rookies are close as always.)

107
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,809
Shake your hips.

108
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,008
(The rookies are close as always.)

109
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,878
- Do we go out? - Out.

110
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,620
(The sub-leader class is busy practicing.)

111
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,758
(Dancing)

112
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,889
(It's an addictive dance that makes Akanen dance along.)

113
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,230
(Catching everyone's attention)

114
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,430
I got this.

115
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,629
(Glancing over)

116
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,699
(Absorbed)

117
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,699
My glasses are about to fall off.

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,639
I really like this dance.

119
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,970
LaTrice is the best.

120
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,909
(Camera zooms in on Biggy who is practicing diligently.)

121
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,350
What?

122
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,050
This is insane.

123
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,350
Don't film her. She is Busy.

124
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,250
She is Busy.

125
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,550
She isn't Biggy.

126
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,359
She isn't Biggy, but Busy.

127
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,490
- I am Busy. - Everyone wears heels.

128
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,188
(Many dancers shy away from the cameras.)

129
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,189
I came without wearing makeup...

130
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,360
because they said there wouldn't be cameras.

131
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,099
This is too much.

132
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,360
- Let's enjoy it. - Let's enjoy it.

133
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,669
Only Bada can do this move.

134
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,870
(Only Bada can do this move.)

135
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,100
(Hopping)

136
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,638
(The short members are jealous of Bada's height.)

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,709
I can never hit her.

138
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,540
That's right.>

139
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,479
(Their coolness explodes.)

140
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,980
My goodness.

141
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,920
(What caught the rookies' eyes?)

142
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,588
(Lia Kim and Mina Myoung dance as a duo.)

143
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,720
I am tearing up. What should I do?

144
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,859
My goodness.

145
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,120
What is going on?

146
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,088
(What caught the rookies' eyes?)

147
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,758
(Lia Kim and Mina Myoung dance as a duo.)

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,828
I am tearing up. What should I do?

149
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,258
(I am tearing up. What should I do?)

150
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,628
(This is so touching.)

151
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:28,669
What is going on?

152
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,769
This is too much.

153
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,938
You danced in sync with Lia Kim.

154
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,040
Of course.

155
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,739
- Even with my eyes closed... - You guys looked...

156
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
the same from the back.

157
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:36,910
Even with my eyes closed, I can dance in sync with her.

158
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,378
- Of course. - You guys were teammates.

159
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,909
- So I didn't practice in advance. - Really?

160
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,910
(Laughing)

161
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,920
(They practice the duet dance on site.)

162
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,519
(Years passed, but their bodies remember it.)

163
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,860
(We are all for this combination.)

164
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,730
(They wrap up with the decalcomania dance.)

165
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,759
- We have good teamwork. - How do we have such good teamwork?

166
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,259
(They find it funny.)

167
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,360
I danced with Mina earlier...

168
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,470
for the first time in a long while.

169
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,199
Both of us were surprised because we had good teamwork.

170
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:06,970
There she is.

171
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,870
- Go ahead. - I can copy you.

172
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,409
- Really? - From the back...

173
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,639
I will copy you.

174
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,208
(Funky Lia's dance move from the past)

175
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,509
- Let's see the original. - Here.

176
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,448
- The original dancer, let's go. - Let's go.

177
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,579
- Let's go. - Let's see it.

178
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,019
She remembers it.

179
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,160
(The dancing machine)

180
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,219
(The past memories make these oldies happy)

181
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,360
You make this facial expression when you do the robot dance.

182
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,560
(Her facial expression is as intense as her dance move.)

183
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,000
When you do the robot dance...

184
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,328
That's right.

185
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,370
She does that.

186
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,500
She does that.

187
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,369
- She does that. - That's right.

188
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,470
(Doesn't she look the same?)

189
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,439
- That's insane. - She does that.

190
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,938
When the two of you danced,

191
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,008
you were really in sync.

192
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,078
- Really? - Yes.

193
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
We need to film this.

194
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,480
- Mina, we need to film this. - What?

195
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,079
Why are you doing this?

196
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,850
It's yoga.

197
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,219
(Why are you doing this?)

198
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,388
It's like you are in the living room.

199
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,518
(Lia and Mina are similar in this way too.)

200
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,059
Excuse me, you will get sick if you sleep here.

201
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,258
- Please don't sleep here. - Gosh.

202
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,399
(The behind-the-scenes story ends with a drunk.)

203
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,299
- Another class. - Excuse me.

204
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,398
- We are a team. - We have a class.

205
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,698
Do you know who our leader is?

206
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,039
It's Baby Sleek.

207
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,909
- Are you jealous? - I suddenly feel reassured...

208
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,008
right now.

209
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,809
- Come on. - Our leader.

210
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,980
- Come here. - She is our leader.

211
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,378
Another class.

212
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,649
(The members with no class stick together.)

213
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,879
(While the classes are practicing)

214
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:26,350
I am cool too.

215
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,920
- Cool. - Cool.

216
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:32,359
(They are cool.)

217
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,129
We are like losers.

218
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,229
(A loser)

219
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,060
Let's make a cool dance.

220
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,999
- Let's make something. - Seriously.

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,100
Seriously.

222
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,099
- Hello, we are... - Hello, we are...

223
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,740
- New Class. - New Class.

224
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,639
Our leader.

225
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,778
(A new class appears.)

226
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,379
We are New Class.

227
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,949
- New Class. - New Class.

228
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,209
- We are... - We are in another class.

229
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,578
- We are a newbie group. - We are a newbie group.

230
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,448
We will make an Instagram account.

231
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,849
Please give us a lot of love.

232
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,419
- Please give us a lot of love. - Please give us a lot of love.

233
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,289
(Please look forward to New Class.)

234
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,388
Shall we take a selfie?

235
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,929
(A selfie time is a must even during practice.)

236
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,028
Let's go.

237
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,559
(More crew members join.)

238
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,199
- Seriously. - Ahem.

239
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,129
The male version of Capri and Redy.

240
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,139
- The middle-aged man version. - The middle-aged man version.

241
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,639
What do you think?

242
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,409
- Let's see. - What?

243
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,309
I want a photo of the whole group.

244
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,740
It looks like a solo photo of this person.

245
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,049
(Her sexiness captivates attention.)

246
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,649
- Look at her facial expression. - The Gen Z way...

247
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,678
is not looking at the camera.

248
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,149
That's right. They take a photo like this.

249
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,819
You looked at the camera, so you aren't a Gen Zer.

250
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,919
Next.

251
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,190
Since there are many people in here,

252
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,590
I receive energy even when I am standing still.

253
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,759
One, two, three.

254
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,999
Yes.

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,099
Hello.

256
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,099
I need to learn Japanese to talk to Akanen.

257
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,898
- I know. You can speak English. - I need to learn Japanese.

258
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,028
I lost my English skills.

259
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,569
(I lost my English skills.)

260
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,269
(The dancers are busy learning Japanese.)

261
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,909
It's a Japanese class.

262
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,239
(These dancers are determined to learn Japanese as well.)

263
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,278
Big sister.

264
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,549
- Big sister. - Big sister.

265
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,549
(Something isn't right.)

266
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:04,950
Obachan.

267
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,378
- Obachan. - Obachan.

268
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,490
It means "Aunty."

269
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,189
What was that?

270
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,590
(She got attacked in a foreign language.)

271
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,418
Don't do that.

272
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,990
This isn't a mission that comes with rankings,

273
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,259
so I am having fun practicing.

274
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,600
And other leaders...

275
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,069
are having fun practicing.

276
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,168
My goodness.

277
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,370
I think that's the case.

278
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,538
Step and push.

279
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,850
(What are they doing?)

280
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,418
(The slick back challenge is popular among the dancers.)

281
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,149
(The hip-hop style slick back challenge)

282
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,690
(Fancy)

283
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,719
(Everyone tries the slick back challenge.)

284
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,019
(She just runs.)

285
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,529
(The relay slick back)

286
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,399
(Awkward)

287
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,600
(What is this?)

288
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,369
(Baby Sleek's slick back dance)

289
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,370
She is good.

290
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,769
(Fancy footwork)

291
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,508
Everyone is insane!

292
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,009
(Everyone is insane about the slick back challenge!)

293
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,739
(Panting)

294
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,279
I am doing this more diligently than the leader class' performance.

295
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,909
(Here is the result of crazy practice!)

296
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,990
(Did they succeed in the slick back challenge?)

297
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,648
(They gather around and watch the challenge video.)

298
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,990
Seriously.

299
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,859
It's a big mess.

300
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,460
- It's a big mess. - The messy slick back dance.

301
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,128
Thank you for your hard work.

302
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,360
(The rehearsal ends on a happy note!)

303
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,599
(One day before the live finals, the day of pre-recording)

304
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,128
- Hello. - Hello.

305
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,769
HI, guys.

306
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
It's game day.

307
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,138
Mum mum mum mah

308
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,740
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please.

309
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,408
(Audrey Gaga gives a special performance.)

310
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,319
What is a roasted chestnut seller doing here?

311
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,419
(A roasted chestnut seller in BEBE's waiting room?)

312
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,989
My mom gave me roasted chestnuts.

313
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,120
(Roasted chestnuts delivery)

314
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,889
She really was a roasted chestnut seller.

315
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,229
And I will distribute this gift.

316
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,230
(Bada's 2nd gift, multivitamins)

317
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,490
(The baby birds cheer.)

318
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,200
(Bada is busy feeding the baby birds of BEBE.)

319
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,729
(It's tasty.)

320
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,499
(Thanks to Bada, they have a hearty breakfast!)

321
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,700
Go ahead and eat.

322
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,039
That's so funny.

323
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,710
- Seriously, Lia. - What?

324
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,740
You look like 23.

325
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,009
- I look like 23? - Yes.

326
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,809
I love it.

327
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,949
(Lia left behind 16 years.)

328
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,008
(Gazing at the camera)

329
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,479
I didn't know pink and glitter would enter my life.

330
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,549
It's awkward for you to see me like this too, right?

331
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,460
Please support my new attempt.

332
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,320
I am...

333
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,159
wearing a pink fuzzy outfit.

334
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,599
They're all laughing. You're giving them a hard time.

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,960
Don't hold your laughter.

336
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,729
Just laugh.

337
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,570
Life is about laughter.

338
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,870
Laughter brings you good luck.

339
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,779
(MANNEQUEEN is focused on practicing.)

340
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,379
- Should we try that again? - Yes.

341
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,220
(The heat of the queens make it look like a real stage.)

342
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,120
I saw this at Doota in Dongdaemun.

343
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,049
I saw a crew performing this at Doota.

344
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,220
(All 4 crews are ready for the rehearsal!)

345
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,529
BEBE, please get ready for the dry run.

346
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,399
- The floor is okay. - It's perfect.

347
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,100
(BEBE checks the floor first so they don't slip.)

348
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,399
I think we should try laying out the mat.

349
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,268
(They prepare the stage so they don't make any mistakes.)

350
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,638
Soweon and Kyma,

351
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,309
you will have to kneel with just your knees on the mat.

352
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,239
(They are ready.)

353
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,378
Let's go. Let's kills this.

354
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,679
Let's go.

355
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,990
(BEBE is on high power mode as soon as the rehearsal begins.)

356
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,759
(Cute)

357
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,329
(They finish the performance without missing a single look in the eyes.)

358
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,799
Okay, thank you.

359
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,599
(The youngest member brings the leader water.)

360
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,268
(But she fails in opening the lid.)

361
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,269
Thank you.

362
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,709
(BEBE monitors the rehearsal thoroughly.)

363
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,070
(Watching closely)

364
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,178
(Focused)

365
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,508
We should be more aware of our facial expressions.

366
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,148
I think Lusher should add something more...

367
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,109
instead of what you just did.

368
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,719
It looks too flat.

369
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,249
Soweon, you can't miss the beat.

370
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,649
You cannot do that. That's a huge mistake.

371
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,189
(Shaking)

372
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,059
(Today's ending fairy is Tatter, who is shaking.)

373
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,388
- Thank you. - Thank you.

374
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,258
- Thank you. - Good job, everyone.

375
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,798
We really put a lot of effort in this performance.

376
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,970
It's the long-awaited finals.

377
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,469
Yes, even in our outfits. We're cowgirls.

378
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,299
Our outfit piques your curiosity, doesn't it?

379
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,408
Guess what our concept is.

380
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,409
Cowgirls.

381
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,479
Next is MANNEQUEEN.

382
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,009
- Can you slightly move to the side? - Yes.

383
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,408
(Carefully)

384
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,250
I love it, Buckey.

385
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,719
One, two, three.

386
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,158
(They constantly practice for a perfect rehearsal.)

387
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,720
(Groaning)

388
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,058
(The queens are already exhausted from the strenuous practice.)

389
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,960
(Funky Y gets smaller.)

390
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,969
(They finally start their dry run after endless practicing.)

391
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,038
(Powerful)

392
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,370
(The energy of a queen explodes on MANNEQUEEN's stage.)

393
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,439
(Lady MANNEQUEEN)

394
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,679
Thank you.

395
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,279
- She passed out. - Thank you.

396
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,720
(The energy of MANNEQUEEN seems to penetrate the screen.)

397
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,320
We look like Science Ninja Team Gatchaman.

398
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,449
- We kind of do. - My hand is so chubby.

399
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,620
I think you should slightly bend it.

400
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,058
- Thank you for the hard work. - Thank you.

401
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,329
- Thank you. - Thank you.

402
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,859
- What if we do this? - Let's do this.

403
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,128
- Let's do this. - We can't show our faces.

404
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,230
This is our poker face.

405
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,528
Do you think you will win?

406
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,669
- Yes. - Yes.

407
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,439
We'll win first place if we get our faces ready.

408
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,200
- That's right. - We're the winners.

409
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
- Okay. - Let's win.

410
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,809
- Let's go, MANNEQUEEN. - Let's go.

411
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,840
Hey.

412
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,740
Hi, guys. Welcome to our channel.

413
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,950
Please like and subscribe.

414
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,309
This is JAM REPUBLIC's stage.

415
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,149
We're feeling very exhausted, but so excited...

416
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,888
and can't wait for our family, fans, friends, and supporters to see...

417
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,028
JAM-yonce's performance.

418
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,128
So stay tuned.

419
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,658
(Stay tuned.)

420
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,129
(Walking away)

421
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,298
The "W" is so cool.

422
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:58,070
(JAM REPUBLIC takes photos before the rehearsal.)

423
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,169
My gosh. We have to take a photo right here.

424
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,469
Just go like...

425
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,070
- you're... - Look fabulous.

426
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
There you go.

427
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,580
It's going to blow up.

428
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,749
Do you think you could...

429
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,220
Okay, legs.

430
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,980
LaTrice.

431
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,919
LaTrice.

432
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,620
(However, they become serious when the rehearsal begins.)

433
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,820
(The hat Beyonce is known for)

434
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,629
(Red fabric)

435
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,929
(JAM REPUBLIC did a good job preparing the props.)

436
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,899
(The energy of the five members fills the stage.)

437
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,740
(Powerful)

438
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,710
That's good. Thank you.

439
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,580
(Emma is still excited even after the rehearsal.)

440
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,989
We've been going through war.

441
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,789
And now we're here in the final war.

442
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,620
We're always winners.

443
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,960
It's cool to see 1MILLION on the screen.

444
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,529
We were...

445
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,230
in Yeoju just a while ago.

446
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,299
- Already... - Already...

447
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,039
- It's the Finals. - It's the Finals.

448
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,599
What happened to your pants?

449
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,769
I must've practiced too hard and burned a hole in them.

450
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,580
It's proof I worked hard.

451
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,109
Today's challenge...

452
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,879
is to make sure this rhinestone doesn't get caught in my hair.

453
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,049
That means I constantly need to control my fingers.

454
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,019
(Watch me.)

455
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:29,690
("7 Rings" with its alluring charm and restrained dance moves)

456
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:35,429
("Bang Bang" that shows an unexpected charm)

457
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,239
That's it for the rehearsals.

458
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,870
(It's over.)

459
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,269
What do you think?

460
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,379
How did the rehearsal go?

461
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,679
The rehearsal?

462
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,878
We monitored it,

463
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,479
and I love the outfits, hair, and makeup.

464
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,849
I love it.

465
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,589
It goes well with the songs.

466
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,018
I think our performance will go well with it.

467
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,719
- I'm looking forward to it. - Me too.

468
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,789
Let's go.

469
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,000
1MILLION.

470
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,199
Let's go.

471
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,328
(Cute heart)

472
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,199
(Fail!)

473
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,369
(They leave in a hurry.)

474
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,240
Do I look like a rookie?

475
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,339
I wanted to dress like I did in the music video,

476
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,909
but I couldn't find it.

477
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,910
So I modified the outfit.

478
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,479
(Why is Redy of 1MILLION dressed as a rookie?)

479
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,518
- Hello. - Hello.

480
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,890
(Very excited)

481
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,818
Why do all the members of BEBE look like Haechi Wang?

482
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:32,118
We're all Haechi Wang.

483
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,818
(Bechi Wang comes together with Dr. Wang's style.)

484
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,289
(I am Minchi Wang.)

485
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,829
What's with your hair?

486
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,899
- What do you have here? - You'll look cuter than I am.

487
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,970
What's this heart?

488
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,400
Excuse me. Why do you look shocked?

489
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,009
It's because you look cute.

490
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,210
- Are you going with the sexy look? - Yes, totally.

491
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,449
- Is this your sexy look? - Yes, I'm the queen.

492
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,450
You're the queen?

493
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,449
I think you need to take more clothes off.

494
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,179
(I think you need to take more clothes off.)

495
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,349
(Squealing)

496
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,319
Oh my gosh.

497
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,160
We're taking a photo. 1, 2, 3.

498
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,029
(They start practicing the special stage where they all become one.)

499
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:21,099
(They are perfectly in sync.)

500
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,579
Good job, everyone. Watch your step when you come down.

501
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,149
It's spectacular.

502
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,920
I was moved when I saw it.

503
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,519
It's special to end it with a performance together.

504
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,319
It will be a lasting memory.

505
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,130
I wasn't here for a while.

506
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,028
I'm happy that everyone looks like they're in pain.

507
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,059
(This is the relaxed attitude of the person that left.).

508
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,969
Everyone seemed jealous of us.

509
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,068
We're happy we were eliminated.

510
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:53,140
- It's just the beginning for us. - That's right.

511
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,669
Let's go. You really look tired,

512
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,838
so I hope it brings you that much of a good result.

513
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,879
- I love you. - I love you.

514
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,308
I am rooting for all the crews.

515
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,749
Anyone, win.

516
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,778
(It doesn't concern her.)

517
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,519
Show some love for Deep N Dap.

518
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,548
Let's go.

519
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,749
Go.

520
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,489
- One, two, three. - Let's go.

521
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,259
(The middle-class rule is to pull their hands out in the middle.)

522
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,329
(The performance begins with the cheers of the audience.)

523
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,298
(It starts with the 16 dancers in the middle class.)

524
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,399
(Sub-leaders)

525
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,199
(Rookies)

526
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,210
(Leaders)

527
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,640
(And the final highlight)

528
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,880
(The performance of "Smoke" by all 48 dancers)

529
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,950
(A special stage created as they all came together.)

530
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,068
(This is so exciting.)

531
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,430
(I love you.)

532
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,869
It's over.

533
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,099
That was so fun.

534
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,798
(Global Artist Mission performance, First crew is MANNEQUEEN)

535
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,869
Are you nervous?

536
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,640
I'm always nervous.

537
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,779
But... I'm nervous.

538
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,710
I'll do a good job.

539
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:10,608
(The queens constantly practice before going on stage.)

540
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,618
(They get excited.)

541
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,318
- This is the last performance. - Let's go.

542
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,019
(They encourage one another!)

543
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,459
- Let's have some fun. - Let's go.

544
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,519
It's the last performance.

545
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,690
(The first performers are nervous as the audience cheers for them.)

546
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,700
(It's time to show the anticipating crowd what they prepared.)

547
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:35,410
(MANNEQUEEN's reinterpretation of Lady Gaga begins.)

548
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:40,109
(Their intro pose captivates the audience.)

549
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,809
(MANNEQUEEN's performance adds excitement to the air.)

550
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:56,190
(MANNEQUEEN did what they always do!)

551
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,160
(MANNEQUEEN doesn't forget to thank the audience at the end.)

552
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,929
(1MILLION runs into MANNEQUEEN, who just finished performing.)

553
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,700
- Good job. - That was good.

554
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,000
That intro was insane.

555
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,500
Lady Gaga.

556
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,170
It was amazing.

557
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,868
(We did a good job, didn't we?)

558
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,980
The audience went totally crazy.

559
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:16,279
It was the perfect performance to bring out the best in us.

560
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,079
- Seriously. - They're the best.

561
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,250
Bye.

562
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,649
Seriously. This is the final stage. It's our last mission.

563
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,719
- Have fun. It's okay to mess it up. - It's okay to mess it up.

564
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,288
- So just have a blast. - Okay.

565
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,519
It's okay to make mistakes.

566
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,459
(Behind Lia Kim who's watching MANNEQUEEN's performance, )

567
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,199
(Harimu is already getting ready to have a blast.)

568
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,599
(Here's Lady Rimu.)

569
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,969
MANNE Gaga.

570
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,409
(Instead of getting nervous, 1MILLION is enjoying it.)

571
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,109
(Copying the ending pose)

572
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,409
(I'm not afraid of the final stage as long as there's music.)

573
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,008
- I, Lia Kim, am single! - I, Lia Kim, am single!

574
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,009
(Make some noise!)

575
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,019
(1MILLION can be a group of playful zoomers.)

576
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,720
(But they are professionals who become serious on stage.)

577
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,459
(They know when to have fun and work hard.)

578
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,000
(The almighty 1MILLION)

579
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,568
(They finish their performance on a cheerful note.)

580
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,569
(1MILLION)

581
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,970
- Good job. - Good luck.

582
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
It felt liberating,

583
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:17,439
and I was overwhelmed with this touching moment.

584
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,909
It was such a good experience. It was a good experience. Thank you.

585
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,980
What? Bye.

586
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,650
Good luck!

587
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,450
(Tapping)

588
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,348
(This is the sound of BEBE's practice backstage.)

589
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:31,889
(BEBE's routine before the stage, practicing endlessly)

590
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,558
But we have to burn it up.

591
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,359
Right. Then why don't you come with me for a second?

592
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,598
- Soweon and Kyma should go. - Okay.

593
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,200
- Cheche and I will go on this side. - Okay.

594
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,500
(What is this suspicious object BEBE prepared?)

595
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,769
(BEBE used the coloured powder as their props.)

596
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,439
(They go up to set the stage before their performance.)

597
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,608
(What are they doing?)

598
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:52,979
(Fidgeting)

599
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,649
(Setting it up thoroughly)

600
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,779
(We're so busy.)

601
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,449
- Hey. - Don't be nervous. Be yourself.

602
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,818
(They beat up their bodies to loosen up.)

603
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,219
This is our final stage. Let's do it. In 1, 2, 3.

604
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,990
- Let's go! - Let's go!

605
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,489
(With their thorough preparation, )

606
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,329
(BEBE delivered a flawless performance.)

607
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:16,899
(Meanwhile, they enter backstage with an unusual look.)

608
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,970
(They turn the other crew's song into their entrance song.)

609
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:26,710
(JAM REPUBLIC seems at ease.)

610
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,149
(Although they're performing Beyonce's song today, )

611
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,480
(they're enjoying Rihanna's song as well.)

612
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,349
(Exploding with excitement backstage)

613
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,758
Last time. Love you, girls.

614
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,219
Live your life. Three, two, one.

615
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,989
- Beyonce. - Beyonce.

616
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,489
- Crazy. - Crazy.

617
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,959
We're about to bring it to you.

618
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,358
(They get ready to perform after chanting a diva spell.)

619
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,999
- You ready to go? - No.

620
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,298
- Right now. - Let's go.

621
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,338
- Let's go. - Let's go.

622
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,669
- Love you, girls. Let's go. - Let's go.

623
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,640
- Love you all. - Come on.

624
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,140
(Let's do this.)

625
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,109
(As they're the last to go, they give the audience a festival.)

626
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,778
(With their explosive energy, )

627
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,249
(They finish their performance.)

628
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,618
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

629
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,150
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

630
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,789
That's a wrap, baby. JAM-yonce.

631
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,319
I can cry now.

632
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,959
Stay tuned.

633
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,190
(The 4 crews finish recording the performances.)

634
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,129
- Jammies! - They're all from Jammies.

635
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,199
(Making a heart for their fans)

636
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,429
- Thank you. - Thank you.

637
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,899
- It's okay. - Korean Jammies. Love you.

638
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,470
I love donuts.

639
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,079
- Is that my favourite? Tteokgalbi? - Let me see.

640
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,508
(The food has been delivered for the three crews.)

641
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,749
- Thank you. - Thank you.

642
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,578
- Thank you. - Thank you.

643
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,179
(Thanks for the food, it's a festival for everyone.)

644
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,689
- Cheers! Let's go! - Cheers! Let's go!

645
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,788
(Harimu's mother and aunt show up.)

646
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,618
You get why I'm so loud, right?

647
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,258
I'm not loud. I just have a booming voice.

648
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,729
I was born with healthy vocal cords.

649
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,899
- You don't have to worry... - Now I know...

650
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,368
- because... - where she gets her booming voice.

651
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,429
(She has her mom to thank for the DNA.)

652
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,700
(They suddenly start competing who has the most booming voice.)

653
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,868
(Rebecca)

654
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:01,910
(Amy's brother)

655
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,979
I support all the crews.

656
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,039
Good luck!

657
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,578
- Yes! - Go!

658
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,009
Last one!

659
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,749
Good job, everyone.

660
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,249
- You were the best, ma'am. - Thank you.

661
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,490
(Their long day before the final stage comes to an end.)

662
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,088
It's 10:27am now.

663
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,259
It's the day of our final mission. How do you feel?

664
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,159
I'm suddenly doing an interview.

665
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,669
I can't wait until midnight.

666
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,838
(Desperate)

667
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,869
I want to transport through time, so everything would be over.

668
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,669
We've been working hard for the past six months for this.

669
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,480
To think that there's only one day left,

670
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,450
it feels surreal.

671
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,649
Regardless of that, I must do my best...

672
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,819
because we want to win first place.

673
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,750
- We'll win 1st place. - We'll win 1st place.

674
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,589
I wonder if the other dancers are on their way.

675
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,930
Hello.

676
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:56,929
I'm Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN.

677
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,358
It's the morning...

678
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,059
of the live show for Street Woman Fighter 2.

679
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,339
You know, live broadcasts come with a certain type of pressure.

680
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,139
There will only be one live broadcast.

681
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,008
So it's very nerve-racking.

682
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:12,380
Let me give you a small spoiler...

683
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:16,750
regarding our crew's outfit on my way to the TV station.

684
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,518
Take a look. We have rhinestones on our outfit.

685
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,119
And this too. We have more decorations on our outfit.

686
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,990
(She was showing us these pants and this top.)

687
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,059
So our outfit is ready now.

688
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,058
Today is the day of our final mission.

689
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,499
(It's a sunny day too.)

690
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,669
- We have a coffee truck. - It looks good.

691
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,729
They sent us a coffee truck.

692
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,199
Thank you so much.

693
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,369
We really needed coffee. This is the best.

694
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,868
(What else do the dancers need before their final mission?)

695
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,210
(A warm bowl of ramyeon in the morning)

696
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,509
The morning ramyeon.

697
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:51,919
MR.

698
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,048
(MR means morning ramyeon.)

699
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,349
MR. That's it.

700
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,419
- Has Dohee arrived? - I think so.

701
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,849
Gosh. She's already here.

702
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,890
- Are we leaving now? - Yes.

703
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,729
Just like this?

704
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,288
(Dohee? We're not done yet.)

705
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm Dohee.

706
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,799
The members of my crew are sleeping soundly.

707
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,170
I'm going to rest up until we arrive too.

708
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,940
(Bye.)

709
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,778
(How is it going at the studio before the final rehearsal?)

710
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,919
(Kirsten's version of "The Final Countdown" by Europe)

711
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,919
(This is how Playful Kirsten prepares for the final mission.)

712
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,088
Hi, guys.

713
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,390
Today is the Finals.

714
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,460
And I'm feeling excited and mixed emotions.

715
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,358
But it's going to be great...

716
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,528
because we're going to dance for our family, our friends,

717
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,469
our Jammies, and our supporters.

718
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,939
So thank you for being with us on this journey.

719
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,640
And we hope to make you proud.

720
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,679
(Kirsten is excited.)

721
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,720
(Meanwhile, Audrey is trying to style her hair.)

722
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,018
(Shy)

723
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,619
(Step 1: Fix her bangs with a hairpin for a second.)

724
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,028
(She's a bit clumsy.)

725
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,229
(Step 2: Gather her back hair and tie it up neatly.)

726
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,558
(Not leaving a strand of hair behind is the key point.)

727
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,559
(Looking neat)

728
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,439
(Audrey ties up her hair neatly.)

729
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,699
(Step 3: Curve her bangs across her forehead.)

730
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,039
(Step 4: Is she done once she fixes her hair with hairpins?)

731
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:28,779
Why is it so hard?

732
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,390
(Will her hair stay fixed?)

733
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:37,848
(Messy)

734
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,389
(Emma fails to hold back her laughter.)

735
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,160
(I will start again.)

736
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,029
Does anyone have hair spray?

737
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,900
(Super focused)

738
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,069
How hard is it to do this simple piece?

739
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,039
It's taking me forever.

740
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,710
(Is she finally done?)

741
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,680
(No! This isn't what I want.)

742
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,450
(She's never satisfied with her hairstyle.)

743
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,249
(Inhaling sharply)

744
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,789
(It's time for the endless battle against the rubber band.)

745
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,220
(It's finally starting to look better.)

746
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,059
(Fixing the wig that she will attach on the back of her head)

747
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,829
(Careful)

748
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,170
(Glancing)

749
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,299
This is confusing.

750
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,338
(Can you help me?)

751
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,769
Can you just give me a plain one?

752
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,939
(Experts blame the tools.)

753
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,449
(She finishes styling the wig with a new device.)

754
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,449
(Step 6: Attach the wig on her hair, and then that's it!)

755
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,950
(She's satisfied.)

756
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,989
(The dessert tastes sweet for those who accomplished their goals.)

757
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,650
(Crunchy)

758
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,930
(Audrey's do-it-yourself hairstyling session is over.)

759
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,559
All right. Let's start JAM REPUBLIC's camera rehearsal.

760
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,869
(Her hair stays fixed despite the intense choreography.)

761
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,279
(JAM REPUBLIC treats their rehearsal like a real performance.)

762
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,980
(They safely finish the rehearsal.)

763
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,789
(They thoroughly check their footage too.)

764
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,288
(They take their performance more seriously than any crew does.)

765
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,159
Even Emma. If you just do one.

766
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,689
(Kirsten goes over detailed feedback for everyone.)

767
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,730
I think it gets better.

768
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,358
The producers all loved it. And it was perfect.

769
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,699
- All of them. - See? We worked together.

770
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Thank you.

771
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,529
- Yes. Thank you so much. - Thank you.

772
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:32,899
Good work.

773
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,170
Thank you. I was like...

774
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,940
Could you take a photo of us?

775
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,439
(JAM REPUBLIC wants to remember this moment with a photo.)

776
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,479
So pretty.

777
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,209
(Clicking)

778
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,250
Thank you.

779
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,219
It's still on.

780
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,848
(A posing genius)

781
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,619
(After their performance, they become playful.)

782
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:56,189
(May this journey be remembered as the most passionate days.)

783
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,690
- Thank you. - Thank you.

784
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,930
(Another crew wants to remember this journey with photos.)

785
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,069
This really is our final mission.

786
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,929
(Crying)

787
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,338
- Who will take the rug? - Me!

788
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:09,969
- Can I take the sofa? - Great.

789
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,109
(How will I say goodbye to the show?)

790
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,940
Bye, hideout.

791
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,308
- Bye. - Bye.

792
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:17,309
It's been fun.

793
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,119
Let's do our final run-through.

794
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,920
(BEBE prepared a performance using masks.)

795
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:31,660
(Bada looks uncomfortable.)

796
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,470
(They aren't able to connect their moves smoothly.)

797
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,039
(In the end, they stop the rehearsal for a moment.)

798
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,640
Here's some pain reliever.

799
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,750
- How does it feel? Are you okay? - My knee felt like...

800
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:54,348
it suddenly twisted this way.

801
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,349
(Her knee joint was strained due to powerful movements.)

802
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,289
(She tries spraying a pain reliever to soothe the area.)

803
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,029
Okay.

804
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,098
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine now.

805
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,499
(Bada doesn't show her pain to keep the rehearsal on track.)

806
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,528
We should get you more knee pads to stabilize the knee.

807
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:10,700
(She declines the extra pads in case they interfere with dancing.)

808
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:13,240
Should you ask for emergency medical treatment?

809
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,239
- But it's... - You shouldn't wait to get treated.

810
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,980
(In the end, she wound up leaving to get emergency treatment.)

811
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,910
Thank you.

812
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,279
Oh, no.

813
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,049
(BEBE decides to suspend rehearsal until they see how she recovers.)

814
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,929
(Can BEBE safely complete their live performance?)

815
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,289
- Please come up on stage. - Let's go!

816
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,758
- Hello. - Hello.

817
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,798
Good luck!

818
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,400
She wished us good luck.

819
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,799
- Good luck, 1MILLION. - We're so grateful for that.

820
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,339
Let's warm up, girls.

821
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,268
(How 1MILLION warms up)

822
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:53,209
(Isn't it easy?)

823
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,279
Look at that angle.

824
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,808
(It's not a deep-rooted tree, but a Harimu tree.)

825
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,219
The headstand is the best warmup for the rehearsal.

826
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,689
(Gathering energy for victory through her toes)

827
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,318
(What did 1MILLION prepare just for this performance?)

828
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,119
You have to put this on your chest...

829
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,219
and do it.

830
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,689
I'll try it afterwards.

831
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,788
(A mysterious, white powder?)

832
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,500
You have to put a lot of it on.

833
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,959
(What is this powder that they're piling on?)

834
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,029
- You lift this up to release. - Let me try.

835
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,470
(An ambitious prop prepared for 1MILLION's final performance)

836
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:22,969
(Did you see it when it aired?)

837
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,239
(The actual live performance)

838
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,538
(The white powder erupted with a powerful jump.)

839
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,679
(Her nose tickles.)

840
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,049
This performance isn't good for one's bronchial tubes.

841
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,419
I was really worried about how much of the powder would be visible,

842
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,920
depending on the lights and the camera angles.

843
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,219
But they adjusted to us using it, so I think it will come out well.

844
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,259
What do you think? How did it go in rehearsal?

845
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,659
- I think it's good. - I feel like I performed my all.

846
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,059
Just do it like that.

847
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,768
- It's good. - Just do it like in rehearsal.

848
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:51,529
I think all we have left to do is get our makeup on.

849
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,999
- All you need is makeup? - Yes.

850
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,709
- Compared to now... - It'll help us express ourselves.

851
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,808
Just go all natural.

852
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,268
(This is really all natural.)

853
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,910
- As we are. Born to be dancers. - Right.

854
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,808
(Is there another dusty party on the rehearsal stage?)

855
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,549
- Hello. - Hello.

856
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,210
- We're MANNEQUEEN. - We're MANNEQUEEN.

857
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,449
Today is the long-awaited finals.

858
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:14,789
(A flashy rehearsal to be performed with feather boas)

859
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,699
(Feathers float in the air.)

860
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,399
(The feathers are proportional to the flashiness of the dance.)

861
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
I swallowed so many feathers.

862
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,999
- Thank you. - Thank you.

863
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,599
- Thank you. - Thank you.

864
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,468
I have three mics right now, so I'll do an interview now.

865
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,609
Which crew does MANNEQUEEN consider its greatest rival?

866
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,239
Our greatest rival?

867
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,908
Honestly, all three crews are so good,

868
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,178
I just hope we perform well with no mistakes and no injuries.

869
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,718
However, MANNEQUEEN will still aim to win.

870
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,820
(MANNEQUEEN will aim to win.)

871
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,149
- Get it up. - Are you ready?

872
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,420
Samba.

873
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,389
(Waackxxxy also leaves, maybe exhausted from rehearsal?)

874
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,900
(BEBE also finishes their rehearsal after recovering from the injury.)

875
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,799
- Seriously... - We have an hour and a half left.

876
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,868
(Darkness has descended on the studio.)

877
00:34:58,869 --> 00:34:59,869
Oh, no.

878
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,368
I feel weird.

879
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,638
To think Street Woman Fighter 2 ends today...

880
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,768
It seems like a lie.

881
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,078
By tomorrow,

882
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,639
- all of this... - It will all be over.

883
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,380
may seem like a dream.

884
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,649
I was really happy to be here.

885
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,050
I consider it a turning point in my life.

886
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,349
I consider it a huge turning point.

887
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,888
As episodes 8 and 9 aired,

888
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:21,960
I increasingly felt...

889
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,259
that I didn't want it to end. I kept thinking that.

890
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,460
I wanted to keep doing more fun things.

891
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,669
I think it's too bad that it's over.

892
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,070
I really gave it my all.

893
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:35,569
I'm happy it's over,

894
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,209
- but I also think it's too bad. - You feel relieved but regretful.

895
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,178
The time just flew by.

896
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,238
- That's true. - The first shoot felt so recent.

897
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,480
Now what will I do?

898
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,449
We rushed here in a frenzy,

899
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,219
and now only the Finals are left.

900
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:52,889
I find that hard to believe.

901
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,219
But what is this?

902
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,630
Is this for us?

903
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:57,730
- It's nothing? - It's flipped over in a scary way.

904
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,460
(A suspicious card on the table looks familiar.)

905
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:04,629
(What is this card?)

906
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,099
(To be continued)

907
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,340
But what is this?

908
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,670
Is this for us?

909
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,840
- It's nothing? - It's flipped over in a scary way.

910
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,480
(A suspicious card on the table looks familiar.)

911
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,480
It's nothing?

912
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,219
(It's nothing.)

913
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,689
Then why did you put it here? It's scary!

914
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,750
Wait a minute.

915
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,919
Is this a new mission?

916
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,059
We just flipped over the card that we gave you earlier.

917
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,759
- I see. - That was good.

918
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,129
- Gosh, seriously. - Imagine getting a new mission.

919
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,500
In one hour...

920
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,860
(Screaming)

921
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,429
Just an hour...

922
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,969
Just an hour before a live broadcast.

923
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,070
(Trembling)

924
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:42,309
They'll ask us to come up with a new performance.

925
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,638
Street Woman Fighter 2 has made us this way.

926
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,379
- That's true. - Just by putting this here...

927
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,448
- It's not even surprising. - It's just suspicious.

928
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,779
To think we're all scared of this one piece of paper.

929
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,619
Seriously, a piece of paper can mean everything.

930
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,550
You've worked hard to make it all the way to finals.

931
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,518
(Clapping)

932
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,219
- Bravo. - We worked very hard.

933
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,719
Today's totally D-day.

934
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,218
It's almost time.

935
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,888
- Is that why you're trembling now? - I'm so nervous.

936
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,800
She's talking with her leg.

937
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:07,098
I'm so nervous.

938
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,730
I'm not as nervous as I thought I would be today.

939
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:11,299
(Buckey's in a different class.)

940
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,598
Instead, I feel...

941
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,738
like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.

942
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,339
I just want to perform well today.

943
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,408
- You practiced hard, considering. - True.

944
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,078
You'd say, "great job," then practice again.

945
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,280
So I won't make any mistakes.

946
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,380
I think a lot of people came to watch.

947
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,820
- Was it 1,000 people? - Yes.

948
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,119
It's the biggest audience yet in Street Woman Fighter 2.

949
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,388
I think we'll draw a lot of energy from the audience.

950
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:33,319
- That's true. - For today.

951
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,259
I'm really looking forward to it.

952
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,460
- We're doing what we do best. - That's true.

953
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,789
Let's have a refreshing performance,

954
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,860
and have a refreshing beer after.

955
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,029
Let's wrap up in a refreshing way.

956
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,199
- In a refreshing way. - Yes.

957
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,570
What a journey.

958
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,510
All we have to do is dance once.

959
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,769
It's the Finals.

960
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,479
(It's really the end.)

961
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,250
This is the last interview we'll do.

962
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,019
I'm so happy this is the last interview I'll do.

963
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:02,519
I'm so bad at interviews.

964
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,319
I think...

965
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,689
(What is it?)

966
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,629
We've been through a lot of stressful things together,

967
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,669
and even though you've all seen me at my worst,

968
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,198
you're still here. You didn't abandon me, and I'm thankful.

969
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,638
(Audrey cautiously reveals her true feelings.)

970
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,669
I always had my little thing.

971
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,069
I like to freestyle. It's whatever.

972
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,509
Literally, when I filled out my paper...

973
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,979
- "It's whatever." - When I filled out...

974
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,150
- "Whatever." - my paperwork...

975
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,149
When I filled out my paperwork, and had to write in weaknesses,

976
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,949
I wrote, "dancing in a group."

977
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,049
(Really?)

978
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,489
I didn't know that this was a group thing.

979
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,459
(The profile Audrey wrote for their first meeting)

980
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,360
("My weakness is that I can have difficulty blending with groups.")

981
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,429
(But after meeting the members of JAM REPUBLIC, )

982
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:54,399
(Audrey realized working as a group could be precious and bring joy.)

983
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,909
That was very meaningful to me.

984
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,408
- Audrey. - Gosh.

985
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,679
(Audrey, the shy youngest, shares how she feels about the members.)

986
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,880
(Kirsten holds her hands without a word.)

987
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,049
(Kissing back)

988
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,119
And remember, you're 19.

989
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,619
And you're amazing. Incredible.

990
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,019
(Embarrassed)

991
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,459
This is just the beginning.

992
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,988
- JAM REPUBLIC! - JAM REPUBLIC!

993
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:15,729
(These dancers gathered with the same love for dance.)

994
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,829
Fight!

995
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,359
- Let's go! - Let's go!

996
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,658
(Doing something "together")

997
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,899
(Achieving something they "like" together)

998
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,269
- To our beloved 1MILLION, - To our beloved 1MILLION,

999
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,839
- good luck, 1MILLION! - good luck, 1MILLION!

1000
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,609
(Shall we take a look at the shining final chapter?)

1001
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,369
(Just 5 minutes before the Finals go live)

1002
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,239
(The audience members suddenly start to cheer.)

1003
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,980
(The fight judges enter.)

1004
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,649
(They're so popular.)

1005
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,590
(Judge Monika's refreshing fan service)

1006
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,760
(Looking flashy)

1007
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,058
(Next up is Mike Song.)

1008
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,199
(I can feel your passion, 200 percent.)

1009
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,799
(Taking off his jacket due to the heat in the studio)

1010
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,199
(Cheering passionately)

1011
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,210
(Sending hearts)

1012
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,569
(All three fight judges sit down.)

1013
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,808
We will now begin our dance battle.

1014
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:10,609
(The live broadcast of the Finals has finally begun.)

1015
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,779
They've begun.

1016
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,518
(The 4 finalist crews wait in real time in their rooms.)

1017
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,420
It's coming on screen.

1018
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,059
Okay.

1019
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,159
- It's 50,000 dollars. - I want it.

1020
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,289
(Another prize, diamond rings)

1021
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,199
They look so cool.

1022
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:27,959
- Hey. - Look at that style.

1023
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,529
- Now I want to win. - I want that.

1024
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,000
I would've worked harder if I knew I was getting those rings.

1025
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,469
(Actor Kim Bo Sung was caught on camera.)

1026
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,439
(Even the BEBE babies recognize this man of "loyalty.")

1027
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,678
- Loyalty. - Loyalty.

1028
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,809
- Loyalty. - Loyalty!

1029
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,749
Earlier, I took a photo with "loyalty" man's wife.

1030
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,618
- Did you like that? - Yes, I did.

1031
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,218
He said, "my wife's a big fan."

1032
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,859
(The dancers relieve anxiety by laughing a lot.)

1033
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,860
Loyalty!

1034
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,788
(Back Koo Young came as a spectator to cheer on the dancers.)

1035
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,189
(Discovering a familiar face)

1036
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,099
- It's Back Koo Young. So handsome. - He's so handsome.

1037
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,469
- He really is. - What's he doing there?

1038
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,669
(MC Kang Daniel introduces the final performances.)

1039
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,269
(The End Credit Mission)

1040
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:12,638
(1MILLION heads backstage.)

1041
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,679
Everyone, hands.

1042
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:21,820
(They carefully put on the white powder they prepared.)

1043
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,719
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1044
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,789
Don't get hurt, since this is your last one.

1045
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,988
Yes.

1046
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:29,229
(The experienced MC Kang cheers them on between emceeing.)

1047
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,030
(1MILLION shouts their final cheer.)

1048
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,259
I love you, 1MILLION.

1049
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,299
Let's win, 1MILLION.

1050
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,130
Whether we win or lose, let's go!

1051

00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,179
Don't be sad.

1061
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:07,980
- You did great. - I'm not crying.

1062
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,819
I was so happy while dancing.

1063
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,090
I felt so refreshed.

1064
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,519
I feel so light now.

No crying.

1069
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,670
(Here, they're trying to control their emotions before performing.)

1070
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,209
(They finally shout their final cheer.)

1071
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,010
- In 1, 2, 3. - Let's go!

1072
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,750
- I love you all. - I love you. Let's go.

1073

(The full cam version of BEBE's End Credit Mission)

1074
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,729
Let's go, BEBE!

1075
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,089
(Expressing the idea, "only those who are prepared can escape dark,")

1076
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,428
(this performance changes "Ending" to "And-ing," expressing darkly...)

1077
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:53,760
(that BEBE's dance will go on.)

1078
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:37,900
(Bada)

1079
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:43,109
- Thank you. - Go, BEBE!

1080
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,070
- BEBE! - BEBE!

1081
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:50,480
(BEBE wraps up impressively for their final performance.)

1082
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,780
- It's over. - That's insane.

1083
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,050
It went by in a flash.

1084
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,349
Why are you crying?

1085
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:57,919
Why are you crying?

1086
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,190
(Cheche started tearing up as they walked backstage.)

1087
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,860
You all worked hard, and I love you!

1088
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,359
- I love you. - Come here.

1089
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,559
(Love you, BEBE!)

1090
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,928
(The third crew up is JAM REPUBLIC.)

1091
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:08,730
Come on, it's the last one.

1092
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,198
(I'm nervous.)

1093
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,400
(Squealing)

1094
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,570
(Kirsten practices until the last moment.)

1095
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,578
- Last cheer in 3, 2, 1. - Put your hands in.

1096
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:20,839
- JAM REPUBLIC, let's go! - Let's go.

1097
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,209
Let's go.

1098

(A performance showing the identity of JAM REPUBLIC as a crew...)

1102
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,919
(with various backgrounds coming together for a common goal, )

1103
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,989
(and their tenacity, perseverance, and grit in overcoming hardship.)

1104
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:15,718
(JAM REPUBLIC comes off stage cheerfully.)

1105
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,059
We did it!

1106
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,559
It's done!

1107
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,099
(The leader, Kirsten, tears up for a moment.)

1108
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,530
Why are you doing that?

1109
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,069
We did it.

1110
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,210
(Now that their journey's over, memories flash through their minds.)

1111
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,839
In 1, 2, 3.

1112
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,880

(Suddenly tapping her rear)

1118
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,889
I'm sorry. That was your butt.

1119
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,759
- I like it. - I'm used to it now.

1120
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,959
- We're so comfortable now. - Yes, totally.

1121
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,659
- We're family now. - We're family.

1122
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:57,799
Let's have fun, okay?

1123
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,738
- Let's do it! - Let's show all we have this time!

1124
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,198
Now, in 1, 2, 3.

1125
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,468

(MANNEQUEEN dazzled as Street Woman Fighter 2's Ending.)

1135

We won't cry.

1137
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:20,139
- We did a great job. - No, don't cry.

1138
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:21,609
I was really happy.

You're wearing such a pretty outfit.

1154
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,969
Can you do "Smoke" in that?

1165
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,389
- You worked very hard. - Thank you. You worked hard.

1166
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,419
It's not important that we came in third place.

1167
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,288
We still worked hard.

1168
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:31,590
- We were in the top three. - We...

1169
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,499
And we tore it up in the Finals.

1170
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,599
Please look forward to seeing us in the future.

1171

(These leaders went through the same thing on different crews.)

1172
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:40,769
Don't cry.

1173
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:44,709
- You went through so much. - We really did.

1174
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,038
You did such a great job.

1175
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,039

I'm so proud of you.

1180
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,420

1181
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:02,359
BEBE did it.

I'm happy!

1185
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:13,368

Don't cry. You did great.

1196

- You did really great. - You were great.

1197
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,968
- Don't cry. You did well. - You did great.

1198

(Bada is feeling a thousand emotions sweep through her.)

1200
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:53,839
Everyone on Street Woman Fighter, you all worked very hard.

1201
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,980
(She shows her gratitude to everyone who has supported her.)

1202
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,448
(And they thank and say goodbye to...)

1203
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,789
(those who they competed against until the end.)

1204
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:07,558
- Please leave in an orderly manner. - Thank you.

1205
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,718
Thank you for your hard work.

1206
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,089
(Redy, a member of a competing crew, greets Bada warmly.)

1207
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,289
Congratulations.

1208
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:18,469
(A happy ending full of strong congratulations)

1209
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,698

1210
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,769
Bye.

1211
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,609
Congratulations.

1212
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:32,109
I knew someone from Daegu would do it.

1213
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,018
I knew you could do it.

1214
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,518
A congratulations hug?

1215
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:37,018
(The dancers convey congratulations, knowing what they went through.)

1216
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:38,049
It's over!

1217
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,419

- Let me see. - Here they are.

1222
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,699
What is that?

1223
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,598
- It's cute. - It's really pretty.

1224
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:54,399
- It's so pretty. - Let's switch.

1225
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,238
- It's so pretty. - It fits her perfectly.

1226
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:57,239
Isn't it pretty?

1227
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,709
Thank you to everyone who loved our show.

1228
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,109
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1229
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,779
I'll never forget this experience.

1230
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,750
- LADYBOUNCE! - LADYBOUNCE!

1231
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:09,750
Street Woman Fighter 2 was everything in 2023.

1232
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:12,419
(Everyone was great!)

1233
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,260
See you at the concert!

1234
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,058
(Putting the days of laughing and crying behind them)

1235
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:18,558
I'm taking the photo now.

1236
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,828
In 1, 2, 3.

1237
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:21,829
(They take one last group photo.)

1238
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,198
Thank you for your hard work.

1239
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,839
(1MILLION returns to their dressing room.)

1240
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,268
We tore it up!

1241
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,738
I'm so happy!

1242
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:38,348
(A last dance of joy)

1243
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:42,779
(The baby sub-leader, Harimu, is still feeling the after-effects.)

1244
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,249
If you want me to be quiet,

1245
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,190
you just have to let me end something.

1246
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,929
I get really quiet when that happens.

1247
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,899
I'll be loud again starting tomorrow.

1248
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,098
(Today, she'll cry, and tomorrow, she'll be loud again.)

1249
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:57,129
We're all done.

1250
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,598
- Hi. - Hi.

1251
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,599
It's Matthew.

1252
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,138
I just wanted to say I'm a big fan.

1253
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:04,440
I was wondering if I could get you guys' signatures.

1254
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:07,309
My gosh!

1255
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:09,308
Your accent. You've got a strong...

1256
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:10,649
- Yes. - A Canadian accent.

1257
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,908
- I knew it! - You're Canadian?

1258
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,079
Yes, I'm Canadian.

1259
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,879
In 1, 2, 3.

1260
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,189
(They take a nice group photo.)

1261
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,788
If it's possible,

1262
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:20,988
can we do the challenge?

1263
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:22,659
- Yes. - Yes!

1264
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,630
(Han Bin and Matthew did the Class Mission challenge.)

1265
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:34,670
(They dance together beautifully to the rhythm.)

1266
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,110
Let's go!

1267
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,749
- That was great. - Thank you.

1268
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:50,419
(JAM REPUBLIC and ZEROBASEONE did a nice joint performance together.)

1269
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,118
(Zhang Hao and Kim Tae Rae came to MANNEQUEEN's green room.)

1270
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,760
- Make a crown above your head. - A crown?

1271
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:57,260
Crown is actually the theme of our new single.

1272
01:00:58,159 --> 01:00:59,460
- Perfect. - That's great.

1273
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,999
Thank you!

1274
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,599
(They took a group photo while exchanging words of encouragement.)

1275
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,899
- Thank you. - I want to do something with Cera.

1276
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,098
Me?

1277
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:07,538
- Go ahead. - What is it?

1278
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,499
- In 5, 6, 7, 8. - In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1279
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,138
(They're killing it with Cera's signature move.)

1280
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,170
Awesome!

1281
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,839
You did it!

1282
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,139
- My wish just came true. - Thank you.

1283
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,210
Thank you.

1284
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,509
Thank you.

1285
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,449
- Thank you. - Take care.

1286
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:28,518
(BEBE celebrates their victory with their friends and family.)

1287
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:31,558
(Nam Ji Hyun came by their green room.)

1288
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,058
You guys did such a great job.

1289
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:34,658
It was an honour to watch you dance in person.

1290
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:35,828
- Gosh. - My.

1291
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,198
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1292
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,300
- Thank you for coming. - Thank you for coming.

1293
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,499
Congratulations!

1294
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,799
(Congratulations on your win, BEBE.)

1295
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,709
Go, BEBE!

1296
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:48,510
- Go, Ji Hyun! - Go!

1297
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:53,079
(Everybody has left, and BEBE is alone in the room.)

1298
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,380
We've received so much love...

1299
01:01:56,719 --> 01:01:59,789
and won a title that's more than what we deserve.

1300
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,519
What I really loved...

1301
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,259
is that through the series,

1302
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:08,759
we were able to record our growth which will last forever.

1303
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,960
I really loved that.

1304
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,868
(At the pre-production meeting)

1305
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,799
We haven't done this kind of...

1306
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,268
competition show before,

1307
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:19,070
and we're worried that we may not be able to survive.

1308
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:25,210
(None of the crews expected BEBE to win.)

1309
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,218
(People's critical views and harsh words)

1310
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:29,449
Why are they doing this show?

1311
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:34,719
(They were a crew that seemed to have more flaws than strengths.)

1312
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,789
(However, )

1313
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:46,630
(they surprised everyone during the No Respect Battle.)

1314
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,868
(They proved their talent during the Class Mission.)

1315
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:55,840
(They proved their talent during the Class Mission.)

1316
01:02:56,179 --> 01:03:01,249
(They pushed their limits during the K-pop Death match Mission.)

1317
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,849
(They pushed their limits during the K-pop Death match Mission.)

1318
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:10,158
(They overcame the crisis together during the Mega Crew Mission.)

1319
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,789
(They overcame the crisis together during the Mega Crew Mission.)

1320
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:20,892
(The New Song Preview Mission and Battle Performance Mission...)

1321
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:28,210
(were new challenges for them.)

1322
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:33,009
It's been such a wonderful journey,

1323
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,719
and we've grown so much.

1324
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:38,820
We also ended up making such a valuable achievement.

1325
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,819
I'm just so grateful.

1326
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,029
Cheche, Soweon, Kyma, Lusher,

1327
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,300
Tatter, and Minah. Thank you for following my lead.

1328
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,469
I couldn't have made it without you guys.

1329
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:54,339
I'll be better.

1330
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,639
Stick with me forever.

1331
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,309
- Yes! - Of course!

1332
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,209
We won first place!

1333
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,280
(We won first place!)
