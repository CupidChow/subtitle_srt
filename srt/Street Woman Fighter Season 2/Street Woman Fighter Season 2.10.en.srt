00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,389
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,105
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:24,899
This is your last interview on Street Woman Fighter 2.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,429
How do you feel?

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,230
(Hesitating)

6
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,030
Is this our last one? There's no more?

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,468
No, it can't be the last one!

8
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,310
This is actually so emotional.

9
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,508
(7 months ago)

10
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,880
Our ultimate goal is to make ourselves known.

11
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,549
I wanted the challenge.

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,390
I wanted to show people that female hip-hop dancers...

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,159
have been and will keep trying.

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,429
I wanted my teammates to succeed.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,358
I really liked the name of the show, Street Woman Fighter.

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,869
This type of show doesn't exist in Japan, so I was envious.

17
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,598
Also, it was for female dancers.

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,009
I thought about how lovely it would be to be able to perform...

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,439
on such a great stage.

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,078
Eight different dance crews have gathered...

21
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,119
to begin Street Woman Fighter 2.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,219
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,019
In 2021,

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,718
this show has brought dance fever to Korea.

25
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,818
(The sensational dance-off between women)

26
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,459
"Street Woman Fighter 1."

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,129
In 2022,

28
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,299
this show brought the dance fever back to Korea.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,230
"Street Man Fighter."

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,730
And now,

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,870
Street Woman Fighter 2 follows.

32
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,709
The first appearance of global crews...

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,739
caught people's attention from the beginning.

34
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,549
You're still an eighth-grader to me.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,579
I'm going to show you who is the queen!

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,795
From No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer...

37
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,988
that created a number of legendary scenes...

38
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,495
(No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer)

39
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,419
to the Class Mission,

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,829
a fierce dance-off for the main dancer position.

41
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,328
And the choreography of "Smoke," the mission song for the leaders...

42
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,900
led the global sensation...

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,569
(Trending number 1)

44
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,369
got many superstars to participate in the "Smoke" challenge.

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,568
(Many stars joined the "Smoke" challenge.)

46
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:16,409
This show continued to lead the dancing sensation.

47
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,209
Of all the dance series by Mnet,

48
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,580
Mega Crew Mission had brought the greatest number of dancers.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,520
That's amazing.

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,580
They're so cool.

51
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,089
As soon as the videos were released,

52
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,060
they were the top three trending videos.

53
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,859
The video by 1MILLION that placed 1st...

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,960
had 10 million views...

55
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,860
and helped them strengthen their position.

56
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,759
The most popular TV show for eight weeks straight.

57
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,969
The top two popular celebrities that weren't on dramas.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,168
With the highest viewer rating of 4.7 percent,

59
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:50,240
this program broke its own record every week.

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,109
Also, two weeks into opening the show,

61
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,650
the show had 100 million cumulative views.

62
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,848
Currently, the cumulative view count is over 520 million,

63
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,849
which proves how influential this is.

64
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,689
People from not only in Korea but also all over the world...

65
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,129
have reacted to our program.

66
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,300
These four crews are finally in the finals.

67
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,199
Finalist, 1MILLION.

68
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,468
From No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer...

69
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,669
to the Class Mission,

70
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,409
this crew has gotten low grades.

71
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,538
But they've brought 100 dancers, the most out of all seasons,

72
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,539
to the Mega Crew Mission.

73
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,310
And released a dominating performance.

74
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,026
I feel like you could show this in the Olympics for our country.

75
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,318
People gave the highest praise, saying that the performance was...

76
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,878
like the opening ceremony to a national event,

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,419
and they proved themselves.

78
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,389
1MILLION deserves to be one of the finalists.

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,060
Finalist, BEBE.

80
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,728
Their career is being Bada's students.

81
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,899
Others broke their hearts by calling them...

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,499
Bada and Girls.

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,629
That makes me upset.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,320
With their trendy choreography...

85
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,099
and teamwork,

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,810
they became a popular crew.

87
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,139
BEBE was the first crew to become a finalist.

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,479
Finalist, JAM REPUBLIC.

89
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,349
The competent, global dance crew...

90
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,650
showed its class from the start.

91
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,460
They turned the unexpected crisis into an opportunity...

92
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,759
and became a finalist...

93
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,660
with the support of viewers from all over the world.

94
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,569
Finalist, MANNEQUEEN.

95
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,769
They created many great scenes in battles with their dance skills.

96
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,659
After that, they had to go through discouraging moments...

97
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,470
as they placed low.

98
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,878
But they survived in their third Elimination Battle...

99
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,179
(They dramatically survived in the third Elimination Battle.)

100
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,679
and became the last finalist.

101
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,200
(MANNEQUEEN became the last finalist.)

102
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,120
And today,

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,148
it's the final round to determine the champion crew...

104
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,290
of Street Woman Fighter 2.

105
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,559
The final round consists of 20 percent...

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,906
of crew song performance voting...

107
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,000
and 80 percent of live text voting.

108
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,000
The champion crew receives...

109
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,569
a 50,000-dollar prize...

110
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,110
diamond rings to celebrate the victory.

111
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,040
1MILLION is bound to win.

112
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,839
We'll take the championship win.

113
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:08,649
1MILLION.

114
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,420
Who else would win if not BEBE?

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,220
We'll take the final crown.

116
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,790
BEBE.

117
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,120
JAM REPUBLIC is going to win.

118
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,490
And we are going to take that trophy.

119
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,259
JAM REPUBLIC.

120
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,060
We're going to place first, anyway.

121
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,829
MANNEQUEEN will take the trophy.

122
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
MANNEQUEEN.

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Street Woman Fighter 2.

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,039
The live finals to determine...

125
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,240
the number-one dance crew in the whole world.

126
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,209
It begins now.

127
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,579
Ready? Fight.

128
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,050
("Move!" by pH-1)

129
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,179
(Listen to "Move!" by pH-1)

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,549
(the song for the opening performance of the finals, )

131
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,878
(on all streaming platforms.)

132
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,649
(To be continued)

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,060
(Street Woman Fighter 2, Finals)

134
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,149
Mnet's original dance series.

135
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,949
Street Woman Fighter 2.

136
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,060
Main host, Kang Daniel.

137
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,519
Good evening.

138
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,859
Determine the number-one dance crew in the whole world.

139
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,428
Street Woman Fighter 2,

140
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,058
I'm your host, Kang Daniel.

141
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,700
(Kang Daniel)

142
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:50,840
In 2023, these amazing eight crews...

143
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,898
including the famous Korean crews...

144
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,469
and global crews,

145
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,008
have been in fierce dance battles...

146
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:00,340
to prove themselves every step of the way.

147
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,850
1MILLION,

148
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,049
BEBE,

149
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,259
JAM REPUBLIC,

150
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,860
MANNEQUEEN.

151
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:20,128
Among these four crews, the number-one crew...

152
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:23,100
in the whole world will take the championship title.

153
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,500
Which crew will take...

154
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,909
the champion trophy of Street Woman Fighter 2?

155
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,620
Before we begin in earnest,

156
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,419
I give you the judges that have been with the crews...

157
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,789
of Street Woman Fighter 2 from the start.

158
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,628
Monika, Shownu, and the special judge, Mike Song!

159
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,629
(Monika, Mike Song, and Shownu)

160
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,169
Monika,

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,499
you were a contestant in Season One,

162
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,709
and you became one of the fight judges...

163
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,179
in Season Two. You were here every season.

164
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,850
The final round this time must feel different.

165
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,720
What would you focus on?

166
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,849
This performance is...

167
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,418
the last one on Street Woman Fighter 2,

168
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,418
and I know, for sure, what these four crews will have...

169
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,690
in mind when they perform.

170
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,928
These crews will try to let...

171
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:27,899
their identities known to the world through this performance.

172
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,899
Winning the title must be their goal,

173
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,939
but it's also a place to shout out to the world...

174
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,039
that their ideas on dance are the correct answer.

175
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,809
Great.

176
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,649
And Mike Song.

177
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,119
You were with us in No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer...

178
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,979
and the Class Mission.

179
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,820
You've returned to honour us once again.

180
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,388
Your tremendous reactions...

181
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,428
as well as your commentary have been sensational,

182
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:57,700
and it shows how hard you've supported the program.

183
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,600
What are your expectations about the finals?

184
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,999
I'm well aware of the fact that all the crews...

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,109
in the final episode have master-level skills.

186
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,808
I think the most important part is...

187
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:16,349
to show your unique characteristics...

188
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,179
and who you really are.

189
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,950
All right.

190
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,019
Lastly, Shownu.

191
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,558
Please show your support for the four crews...

192
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,590
who will give us the best dance show ever.

193
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,099
You've worked really hard...

194
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,229
to be in the finals of Street Woman Fighter 2,

195
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,669
one of the toughest competitions in Korea.

196
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,339
I should have given you some compliments...

197
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,239
to cheer you up during the competition,

198
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,879
but I feel bad that I couldn't do that.

199
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:52,979
But I'll enjoy the show even more since it's the last one.

200
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,120
Great work so far.

201
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,820
Thank you for that.

202
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,589
A lot of people...

203
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,559
who love dance have joined us tonight.

204
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,158
Not only in this hall, but also in movie theatres...

205
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,499
all over the country,

206
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,899
numerous people are watching the live finals.

207
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,798
We appreciate the support and respect...

208
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,899
you've sent us for Street Woman Fighter 2.

209
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,509
We hope you enjoy tonight's show with the loudest cheers.

210
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,580
We will now begin the last dance-off...

211
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,419
of Street Woman Fighter 2 to determine the number-one crew...

212
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,959
among the four crews!

213
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,919
(The last dance-off starts now.)

214
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:49,109
Street Woman Fighter 2,

215
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,539
the final round is comprised of two different missions.

216
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,008
The first mission is the Global Artist Mission.

217
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,379
(Global Artist Mission)

218
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,819
Global Artist Mission.

219
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,950
Among four global artists loved by the whole world,

220
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,690
Ariana Grande, Beyoncé,

221
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,200
Lady Gaga, and Rihanna,

222
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,929
each crew chose an artist.

223
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,028
They must reinterpret the song by said artist...

224
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,638
and complete the best performance...

225
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,669
that surpasses that of the global artist.

226
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,539
And the second mission to finish the finals is...

227
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,079
the End Credit Mission.

228
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,080
(End Credit Mission)

229
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,619
The End Credit Mission is the finale of each crew.

230
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,820
The crews will portray their identities, themes,

231
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,460
and characteristics through dance in the end.

232
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,029
To prove the crew's unique style and world-class skills,

233
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,230
they put everything into this final performance.

234
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,299
So, we ask for your loud cheers,

235
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:56,340
support, and active participation in the vote.

236
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,879
Tonight, the number-one crew will be...

237
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,850
decided by 20 percent of crew song performance votes...

238
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,359
and 80 percent...

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,059
of live text votes.

240
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,528
(Your phone number will be collected and used...)

241
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,049
(for the text voting on this program.)

242
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,229
First, the crew song performance vote is...

243
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,700
a global vote that the whole world can participate in.

244
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,639
The votes from August 22, at 10:00 p.m. to today,

245
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,268
October 31st, 6:00 p.m.,

246
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,038
have been counted through the official platform...

247
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,949
of Street Woman Fighter 2 and Mnet Plus.

248
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,350
The voting has been closed.

249
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,319
Which crew did the global viewers...

250
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,190
love and care the most?

251
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,830
Here are the global ranks of the crew song performance vote.

252
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,860
In the crew song performance vote,

253
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
I will only announce fourth place.

254
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,090
Fourth place in the crew song performance vote is...

255
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,500
MANNEQUEEN.

256
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,038
(4th place, MANNEQUEEN, 2,119,971 views, )

257
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,610
(98,816 likes, and 175,192 votes)

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,110
MANNEQUEEN has earned 2,119,971 views,

259
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,019
plus 98,816 likes,

260
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,549
and 175,192 votes.

261
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,789
However, the current ranking can always change.

262
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,388
The final rankings of the four crews and the birth of the champion...

263
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,429
will be decided by you, the viewers,

264
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,099
who will watch the final performances...

265
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,429
and take part in the live text vote.

266
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,539
The live text vote that will begin soon...

267
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,340
takes up 80 percent of the total score.

268
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,008
Now, I will tell you...

269
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,980
how to vote for your crew in the live text vote.

270
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,278
Write the name or number...

271
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,549
of the crew that you root for in the text message,

272
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,529
and send it to 0011.

273
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,828
The live text vote will be explained by female fighters,

274
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,028
who have visited Street Woman Fighter 2.

275
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,670
Let's meet them together.

276
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,469
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

277
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,578
(Your phone number will be collected and used...)

278
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,180
(for the text voting on this program.)

279
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,956
(Street Woman Fighter 2 and "Street Comedy Woman Fighter 2")

280
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,410
(Number 1, 1MILLION)

281
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Hey, guys.

282
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:28,419
Did you know that the voting has begun?

283
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,619
I didn't know.

284
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,848
(Increasing blood pressure)

285
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,088
That's how you want to talk to me?

286
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,389
That wasn't on purpose. We honestly didn't know.

287
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,029
I'll teach you, Lia.

288
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,189
Will you?

289
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,959
Now, text 0011...

290
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,500
1MILLION's name or number 1.

291
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,038
I voted.

292
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,869
I didn't want to embarrass you.

293
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,569
You've never embarrassed me once.

294
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,109
Let's make up.

295
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,309
(A beautiful sight of becoming one with a single text vote)

296
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,848
If you're rooting for 1MILLION,

297
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,919
text the number 1 or 1MILLION's name...

298
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,190
to 0011.

299
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,518
Okay.

300
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,118
("Chilli" for voting)

301
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,729
(Number 1 or 1MILLION)

302
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,558
(No double votes are allowed, but you can vote for more than one.)

303
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,328
- Number one! - Let's go!

304
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,630
- Let's go, number one! - Number one!

305
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,200
(Number 2, BEBE)

306
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,439
I'm going to vote for number two, BEBE.

307
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,739
King Bada, step forward!

308
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,868
(Relaxed)

309
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,009
(Getting interesting)

310
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,679
Bada, you're still number two to me.

311
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,509
What? Number two?

312
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,679
Number two?

313
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,619
- Yes! Keep going! - Don't let her win.

314
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,480
Hang on, guys.

315
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,049
Did you guys vote yet?

316
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,690
Vote?

317
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,459
We talked about it, but it got nowhere.

318
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,960
You didn't do anything.

319
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,659
(Suddenly, there is tension in the air.)

320
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,789
Do you want to remain as Bada and Girls?

321
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,059
No.

322
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,699
You're truly members of BEBE.

323
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,768
(Was I too serious?)

324
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:49,899
Hurry up and vote.

325
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,838
It's 0011. Vote for number 2 BEBE.

326
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,098
- Is this right? - BEBE.

327
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,268
- Look. - BEBE.

328
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,669
Wait a second.

329
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
Did you vote?

330
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,608
I need my phone.

331
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,126
(King Bada was in no place to blame the others.)

332
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,048
If you're rooting for BEBE,

333
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,219
text 0011...

334
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,649
- number two or BEBE! - Please!

335
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,659
Go and vote for us.

336
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,318
- BEBE is number 2. - BEBE is number 2.

337
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,028
- Number 2. - Number 2.

338
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,558
(Number 3, JAM REPUBLIC)

339
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,199
Hi, guys. We are...

340
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,098
- number 3. - Number 3.

341
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,670
(I like number 3.)

342
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,430
Hello.

343
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,240
(Hello.)

344
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,139
Big-eyed Kirsten?

345
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,969
My name is Big-eyed Kirsten.

346
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,379
(Gosh.)

347
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,609
(They love it.)

348
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,980
(The room gets heated when she takes her sweater off.)

349
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,609
(Watch me dance.)

350
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,449
(Audrey loves it.)

351
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,818
Big-eyed Kirsten, timing.

352
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,889
What?

353
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,018
(She can barely breathe.)

354
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,058
Timing?

355
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,529
JAM REPUBLIC, come out.

356
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,890
Come out!

357
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,189
(Let's do this.)

358
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,059
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,829
It's time for text voting.

360
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,669
If you vote for number three...

361
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,670
Thank you.

362
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,038
Thank you. You are so wonderful.

363
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,109
Gosh.

364
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,368
If you support JAM REPUBLIC,

365
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,639
text 0011...

366
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,709
JAM REPUBLIC or...

367
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,118
- number 3. - number 3.

368
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,848
(No double votes are allowed, but you can vote for more than one.)

369
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:17,118
- It's number 3. - Number 3, guys.

370
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,758
(Number 4, MANNEQUEEN)

371
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,460
MANNEQUEEN, I am a queen card.

372
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,460
- Excuse me. - Gosh. What is it?

373
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,528
What are you doing? You should be voting.

374
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,899
My goodness.

375
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,140
What do you think you're doing?

376
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,170
We don't need six people.

377
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,899
Come out, Cera.

378
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,268
MANNEQUEEN, I am a queen card.

379
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,479
- Stop it. - What are you doing?

380
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
(The relaxed attitude of a winner)

381
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,548
Cera, did you lose?

382
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:42,609
Don't get intimidated.

383
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,278
Pak Cera.

384
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,449
- Gosh. - Pak Cera.

385
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,480
What?

386
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,088
(She can't hold in her laughter.)

387
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:51,459
I going to avenge my sister.

388
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,490
My gosh.

389
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,390
(It's Pak Cera versus Yoonji.)

390
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,229
(Pak Cera gets beaten up with dances.)

391
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,459
(Trapped in MANNEQUEEN's jail of dance)

392
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,558
All right.

393
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,568
I'll vote for MANNEQUEEN or number four.

394
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,569
Four.

395
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,308
If you support MANNEQUEEN,

396
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,169
text 0011...

397
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,709
number four or MANNEQUEEN.

398
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,179
- Please. - Please.

399
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,848
- MANNEQUEEN card, MANNEQUEEN card. - MANNEQUEEN card, MANNEQUEEN card.

400
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:21,949
We will now begin live voting.

401
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,690
Five, four, three, two, one.

402
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,960
(Voting begins.)

403
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,429
Street Woman Fighter 2.

404
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,298
Live voting has begun.

405
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,508
You are allowed to vote for more than one crew,

406
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:47,078
but you cannot vote for the same crew twice.

407
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,650
Make sure to remember that.

408
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,419
I hope you show a lot of support and text in many votes.

409
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,449
(Text voting 0011)

410
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,788
The profit from text voting...

411
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,518
will be donated to Mapo Foundation for Arts and Culture...

412
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,589
to support artists.

413
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,430
This is the live finals of Street Woman Fighter 2.

414
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,258
The first mission of the live finals...

415
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,798
that will bring forward a fierce and powerful battle...

416
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,970
in attempts to become number one globally.

417
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,399
It's the Global Artist Mission.

418
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,369
The first crew to perform...

419
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,809
is 1MILLION.

420
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,078
1MILLION introduced K-dance to the public.

421
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,049
Everyone agrees they are the best choreography crew in Korea.

422
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,219
They've prepared a special stage with the honour of global K-dance...

423
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,029
on the line. Let's watch it right away.

424
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,400
1MILLION, ready? Fight.

425
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:46,199
We received zero votes...

426
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,639
for our "Single Ladies" performance for the Global Artist Mission.

427
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,338
So we ended up not being able to perform...

428
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,879
the song of the artist we wanted.

429
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,949
However, do you remember...

430
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,819
when we were eliminated in the JYP match?

431
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,919
(They were eliminated from the K-pop Death match Mission.)

432
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,065
(They were automatically added to the YG match with no choice.)

433
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:09,029
It ended up bringing us a better result.

434
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,028
I think our crew...

435
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,459
- can use this... - As an opportunity.

436
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,598
Yes, we're a crew that can turn this into an opportunity.

437
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,599
That's right.

438
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,268
1MILLION has choreographed so many of Ariana Grande's songs, right?

439
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,209
- Yes, she's like a cousin to us. - Seriously.

440
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,838
It's hard to find songs better to dance to...

441
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,308
- than Ariana Grande's songs. - Of course.

442
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,749
I am confident we can pull this off.

443
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,909
We have to pick a song.

444
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,750
Should we decide while dancing?

445
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,956
(They dance to a random list of songs to choose one.)

446
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Wait. We need to feel the excitement rising in us.

447
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,489
I want it.

448
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,788
Since it's the finals,

449
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,959
I want to put on a performance we can enjoy with everyone.

450
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
(All the members of 1MILLION are having fun.)

451
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,429
We should do this one.

452
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,858
How can we not when we're all so excited?

453
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,298
I think it'd be okay to do two songs.

454
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,538
- Put them together? - Yes.

455
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,899
We couldn't just pick one song,

456
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,669
so we will show off...

457
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,838
the quality of our dance through "7 Rings..."

458
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,239
and create a performance...

459
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,650
that will let the energy within us explode through "Bang Bang."

460
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,919
(1MILLION stretches to warm up before practice.)

461
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
My body aches.

462
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,889
(Harimu brings something.)

463
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,519
- What's that? - I need sugar. I'll have a snack.

464
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,159
- A snack? - Yes.

465
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Give it to me.

466
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,159
You know the feeling.

467
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,600
(1MILLION gathers around the snack.)

468
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,798
Nice.

469
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,399
You should stick these on your fingers.

470
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,429
No.

471
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,469
- No? - I'll show you something awesome.

472
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,239
You put these on your fingers and eat them, right?

473
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,970
- This is normal. - I love it.

474
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,710
After putting them on your fingers,

475
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,470
eat like Cardi B.

476
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,538
Like this.

477
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,509
Don't take them off until you're done.

478
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,679
(She even makes facial expressions to imitate Cardi B.)

479
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,656
(She can even feed others without her fingers touching it.)

480
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,089
(Crunchy sounds)

481
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,159
It sounds exactly like "crunch."

482
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,190
- Not "cringe?" - "Cringe?"

483
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,660
This is tasty.

484
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,700
I loved this when I was little.

485
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,868
(Snacks taste better when you devour them.)

486
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,969
Try to look pretty.

487
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,699
(Like me!)

488
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,970
- This is so good. - Yes, it is.

489
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,709
I ate too much.

490
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,170
- Should we practice? - Yes.

491
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,440
(1MILLION focuses on practicing since it's the final stage.)

492
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,548
(Trying hard)

493
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm so tired.

494
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,719
- My feet are so sweaty. - I know.

495
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,220
You know you get tired more easily when you sweat, right?

496
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,589
I want to change shoes.

497
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,028
That's a sterilizing shoe rack.

498
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,959
- It's for dancers. - Really?

499
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
(Lia Kim's consideration for the dancers of 1MILLION!)

500
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,299
I'll give it a try.

501
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,239
I'd be grateful if it helps my shoes.

502
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,308
(The shoes are wet from dancing.)

503
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,509
- See you soon. - Bye.

504
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,910
Play.

505
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:40,779
(Standard styling, Preparing steam)

506
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:41,779
What colour do you like?

507
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,480
- Pink. - Light pink.

508
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,819
- Gosh. - Gosh.

509
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,449
It's done.

510
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,619
Ta-Da.

511
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,629
It feels different.

512
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,889
- You're right. - Right?

513
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,000
I love it because they aren't smelly anymore.

514
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,829
My shoes were wet from sweat on the inside.

515
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,670
Now it's dry.

516
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,739
Really?

517
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,269
Let's run.

518
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,379
I want to put on a performance...

519
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,209
that will let us prove how well we dance in the finals.

520
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,949
I am determined to show everyone...

521
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,619
the true value of 1MILLION.

522
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,940
(1MILLION is the best.)

523
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,969
You're so pretty!

524
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,239
(Choreography by 1MILLION)

525
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,650
You look like dolls.

526
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,819
You look like dolls!

527
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,329
(Lia Kim)

528
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,920
(1MILLION is already number 1. Enjoy it to the fullest!)

529
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,369
We watched 1MILLION's Global Artist Mission performance.

530
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:01,409
They started with dynamic moves...

531
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,710
and switched to a party vibe.

532
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,919
They were able to show us...

533
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,720
why 1MILLION is known for their choreography.

534
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,689
Fight judge Monika,

535
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,119
what did you think of 1MILLION's Global Artist Mission stage?

536
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:19,960
They understand the charisma of Ariana Grande.

537
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,329
I think...

538
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,970
she has a sexy side that can enjoyed by people of all ages.

539
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,868
It's a healthy type of sexy...

540
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,768
that won't allow anyone be biased against her.

541
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,538
You were able to display that sexiness accurately...

542
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,079
in various ways through your outfit,

543
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,650
choreography and structure.

544
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,480
It was the best.

545
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,650
Thank you for the compliment.

546
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,118
If you'd like to give 1MILLION,

547
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,029
the living legend of K-pop, the winner's trophy,

548
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,660
text 0011...

549
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,099
1MILLION or number 1.

550
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,369
Thank you, 1MILLION.

551
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,240
Number one.

552
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,980
(1MILLION, Lia Kim)

553
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,420
Global Artist Mission.

554
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,319
The next crew to perform...

555
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:23,660
is BEBE.

556
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:28,630
They started out as a rookie crew loved by many K-pop artists,

557
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:32,099
but now secured a spot among the top crews.

558
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,069
They say they've prepared a performance to win.

559
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,139
Let's take a look.

560
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,539
BEBE, ready?

561
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,039
Fight.

562
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,879
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

563
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,189
- I'm starving. - Me too.

564
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,048
- That looks good. - That looks good.

565
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,220
It looks good.

566
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:54,318
I want a Spicy Shrimp.

567
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,058
I want a Spicy Italian.

568
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:58,960
- I want an Italian B.M.T. - That sounds good.

569
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,636
You know it's a popular sandwich, right?

570
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,799
- I do. - Of course.

571
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,098
- Thank you. - Thank you.

572
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:04,629
- Thank you. - Thank you.

573
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,768
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

574
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,739
(Taking a huge bite)

575
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,768
(This is it.)

576
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,608
I just had a shrimp.

577
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,838
It's so juicy and delicious.

578
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,109
Try it.

579
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,449
This is really good.

580
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,880
It's the right amount of spicy.

581
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,679
I like adding egg Mayo...

582
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,118
- to B.M.T. - I see.

583
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,149
(Tatter likes to add ingredients.)

584
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,358
I heard adding avocado is also really good.

585
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,689
- Right. - It's also filling.

586
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,058
Which sauce did you choose?

587
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,659
I chose ranch and sweet chilli.

588
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,759
Chilli?

589
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,500
- Taste like chilli. - Chilli.

590
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,130
- Feel it. - Feel it.

591
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,470
Dilly.

592
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,599
That's right.

593
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,798
The spicy flavour reminds me of the dance.

594
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,476
You're right. We were automatically dancing.

595
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,169
Since we had a hearty meal,

596
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,869
shall we go practice hard?

597
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,009
- Yes. - Sounds good.

598
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,879
Ta-ta-ta.

599
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,348
We will now begin the first...

600
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,679
- Diva Contest. - Bring it on.

601
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,379
(BEBE is excited.)

602
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,818
We held a Diva Contest to create a theme...

603
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:00,190
for the Global Artist Mission.

604
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,389
When it comes to performances,

605
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,829
we've become known to put on energetic and powerful stages.

606
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,159
We plan to show everyone that we're a true diva.

607
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,569
We'll be sexier than ever.

608
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,739
What is she doing?

609
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,068
(Totally sexy!)

610
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,369
She's so pretty.

611
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,015
(The battle of sexiness has begun. Number 1, Diva Lusher)

612
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,940
(She is still a bit shy. Number 2, Diva Soweon)

613
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,079
(Clean and modern Number 3, Diva Minah)

614
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,608
She's carrying an umbrella.

615
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,348
(Dressed in a classic black outfit, Number 4, Diva Kyma)

616
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:27,379
(Showing off her charm!)

617
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,389
(What was that?)

618
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,789
(Who is the next diva?)

619
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,858
(The definition of "hip," Number 5, Diva Bada)

620
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:34,859
(It's Bada, the diva.)

621
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,529
She's a cool diva.

622
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,329
What's this?

623
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,258
(Funky cowgirl, Number 6, Diva Tatter)

624
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,359
- Gosh. - What's that?

625
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,069
When did you prepare all this?

626
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,799
(Bada loves it.)

627
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,298
It's the last.

628
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,299
(Finally, the last!)

629
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:50,568
(She turns the place upside down.)

630
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,868
- What's this? - Wait.

631
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,009
- Gosh. - Gosh.

632
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,449
(Unexpected charisma, Number 7, Diva Cheche)

633
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,379
(The rebellion of the youngest!)

634
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,619
I don't believe this. Look at our youngest.

635
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,980
What is going on?

636
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,518
If you had that inside of you,

637
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,618
show it to us.

638
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,789
Show us more.

639
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,890
- All right. - Nice.

640
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:07,559
Nice. I love it.

641
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,689
I personally...

642
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,689
liked the cowgirl concept.

643
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,129
I think we can pull it off.

644
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,558
Okay, we'll go with cowgirls.

645
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,529
- All right. - Okay.

646
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,229
We'll show you how sexy we are.

647
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,499
I want people to ask,

648
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,269
"Why did they wait so long to show us this?"

649
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,608
Since we chose Rihanna,

650
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,239
we'll put on a powerful performance.

651
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,909
Whatever you're imagining,

652
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,379
we'll show you something better.

653
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,808
Let's put on the coolest performance...

654
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,150
for the Global Artist Mission.

655
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,379
One, two, three.

656
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,749
- Let's go! - Let's go!

657
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,990
- Let's go. - Let's go!

658
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:52,649
(Tatter, Mommy is watching you!)

659
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:59,608
(Choreography by BEBE)

660
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:03,380
(Choreography by BEBE)

661
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,110
(You are the best.)

662
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,989
(Let's win 1st place, BEBE!)

663
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,320
We watched BEBE's Global Artist Mission performance.

664
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:31,159
It was like a festival we could all enjoy together,

665
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,159
and they displayed an unexpected charm with their cowgirl outfits.

666
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,829
Known to be good at dancing in sync and the small details,

667
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,000
they once again put on a flawless performance.

668
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,539
Fight judge Shownu,

669
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,968
from BEBE's Global Artist Mission performance,

670
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,940
what was the most impressive?

671
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,178
First of all,

672
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,908
I liked the overall structure,

673
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,578
and the ending when you paired up...

674
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,550
and sprinkled confetti in the air.

675
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,729
You dominated the stage...

676
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,558
and didn't miss anything from the song, expressing it all.

677
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,769
That was amazing.

678
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,539
One of BEBE's strengths...

679
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:19,480
is adding trendy moves to important parts of the song.

680
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,009
It's like those parts are embedded in my head when the show is over.

681
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,356
I believe I'll be thinking about it on my way home today as well.

682
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,750
You did a great job.

683
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,650
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

684
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,788
If you'd like to make BEBE,

685
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:35,189
the young generation dance crew, the final winner,

686
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,130
text 0011...

687
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:41,460
with the name BEBE or number 2.

688
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,030
Good job, BEBE.

689
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:00,719
The next crew to perform in the Global Artist Mission...

690
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,619
is JAM REPUBLIC.

691
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,960
Being a global crew,

692
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:10,388
JAM REPUBLIC grabbed the attention of people around the world,

693
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:14,130
and charged forward to the live finals with their support.

694
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,468
They have prepared a performance...

695
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,070
to show us the pride of the Worldwide Avengers Crew.

696
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,699
What kind of performance is it?

697
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,408
Let's watch it right away.

698
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,610
JAM REPUBLIC, ready?

699
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,809
Fight.

700
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,179
The sun is shining today.

701
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,879
Oh, my goodness.

702
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,879
(One cool autumn day)

703
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,049
(Where did JAM REPUBLIC go?)

704
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,988
It kind of looks like a Korean drama.

705
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,859
- It does. - That's fancy.

706
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,130
- "New Zealand Residence." - Yes, it looks like a house.

707
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,259
(New Zealand is where they filmed their Mega Crew Mission...)

708
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,999
(and Kirsten, Ling, and Emma's hometown.)

709
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,399
We're a global team, and represent New Zealand.

710
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,538
So the ambassador for New Zealand that lives in Korea...

711
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,440
invited JAM REPUBLIC over to her house.

712
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:59,509
- Hello, JAM REPUBLIC. - Hi.

713
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,178
I'm very excited that you are doing so well. Congratulations.

714
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,578
For everything that you've achieved so far.

715
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,078
We've got some New Zealand treats for you.

716
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,218
Anzac cookies, Afghan cookies, and pavlova.

717
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,750
Oh, pavlova. It feels like home already.

718
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,859
It's so nice to have you here.

719
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,888
Kirsten, you popped up on my Instagram feed yesterday...

720
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,388
because I follow Taeyang.

721
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,328
You were doing the "Smoke" challenge with him.

722
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,960
I was like, "I recognize this one."

723
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,799
And there's somebody else. The one with...

724
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,468
HUENINGKAI from TXT?

725
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,038
- Yes. - Yes.

726
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,569
I saw that one too. Yes.

727
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,670
Do you like K-pop?

728
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,439
I'm a big fan of BTS'.

729
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,909
(We're here with an Army.)

730
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,779
And within BTS, my favourite is Suga.

731
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,479
He does that... "Enemy, enemy, enemy."

732
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,078
Oh, my gosh.

733
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,489
You did that, right? Yes, that was great.

734
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,750
Maybe you should've been in that part.

735
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,259
(Chuckling)

736
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,089
So how has it been meeting all these K-pop idols...

737
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,788
and people you've admired from afar?

738
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,658
Is it quite amazing to meet them in person?

739
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:54,999
It's very surreal.

740
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,129
- Surreal. - Yes.

741
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,899
From seeing them on the screen...

742
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,268
to being able to feel their presence in person?

743
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:02,738
It's like... Yes, "surreal" is the word for it.

744
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:03,768
Yes.

745
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,638
And it shows what we can because these missions are quite hard,

746
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,979
and the show is quite challenging.

747
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,709
But it just got more about each other as a group,

748
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,379
and remembering why we're here.

749
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,578
You're doing such a great job representing New Zealand,

750
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,718
Australia, and America here in Korea.

751
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,618
I will be rooting for you in the finals.

752
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,089
I really want you to win.

753
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,888
I'll be your biggest supporter.

754
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:23,988
- Thank you. - Yes, thank you.

755
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,558
It was lovely that we met. It felt like home.

756
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,069
Our journey has basically been supported by...

757
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,839
not just New Zealand, Australia and America. It's been global.

758
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,509
All JAM REPUBLIC wants to do is give back our love and support...

759
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,539
to our Jammies, to our fans, and to our supporters.

760
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,480
Now that it's Global Artist Mission,

761
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,348
Beyonce is known globally.

762
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,348
She inspires so many...

763
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:49,488
and gives off that strength.

764
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,819
Global domination JAM REPUBLIC has.

765
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,089
Okay, when you think of Beyonce, what do you think of?

766
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,630
Three, two, one.

767
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,730
- Hats. - Hats.

768
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,529
Do I like this?

769
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,729
Ling-yonce!

770
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,058
(We love you, Ling-yonce.)

771
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,999
This is definitely what comes to mind when we think of Beyonce,

772
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,399
and we wanted to highlight what the world loves about her,

773
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,269
in terms of what she wears for shows.

774
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,638
So this mission is our mission.

775
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,709
We want to show everybody...

776
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,550
why we are the only international global crew in the final stage.

777
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,488
We are going to showcase as JAM-yonce,

778
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:24,949
so I hope you guys are ready.

779
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,820
Let's go.

780
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,070
(I love you, Audrey.)

781
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:51,250
("Flawless," "Baby Boy," and "Bow Down" by Beyonce)

782
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,179
(I love you, Audrey.)

783
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:29,239
You've watched JAM REPUBLIC's Global Artist Mission performance.

784
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,738
Just like what they said about...

785
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:34,579
showcasing as JAM-yonce for their pride as a global crew,

786
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,579
they opened their performance using hats, Beyonce's signature prop.

787
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:42,380
It was a special show you can only watch on Street Woman Fighter 2.

788
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:44,650
Mike Song, our special judge.

789
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,488
What did you think of JAM REPUBLIC's original choreography...

790
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,829
to Beyonce's music?

791
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:53,259
That was crazy!

792
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,300
You all killed it.

793
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,669
I felt so many emotions.

794
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,439
I think you guys used so many different weapons there.

795
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,639
It was so good.

796
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,408
I feel like in the beginning, using hats...

797
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:10,448
and then having a flow from cleanliness to strong energy,

798
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:13,749
to attitude and star quality.

799
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,448
You guys really went on the roller coaster,

800
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,718
and I think that just shows that you guys are high-level...

801
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:22,928
super experienced and honestly just masters.

802
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,928
I know Beyonce would be proud and just want to give you props.

803
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,558
You guys are always so fearless. Fearless coming on this show,

804
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,669
fearless using props in the final challenge.

805
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,099
It's so difficult to do that there.

806
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,369
I'm so happy for you all. Congratulations.

807
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,279
Mike said they used the props very well,

808
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,578
and their performance...

809
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:45,650
was memorable and full of different energies.

810
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,578
If you want to give JAM PUBLIC, the worldwide Avengers crew,

811
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,889
the honourable title as the number one global dance crew,

812
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:54,559
text your vote to 0011 now.

813
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,190
Please text "JAM REPUBLIC"...

814
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,599
or simply number three.

815
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,900
JAM REPUBLIC, great job.

816
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,130
Thank you.

817
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,980
The next crew to perform for the Global Artist Mission is...

818
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:23,820
MANNEQUEEN.

819
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:30,689
Waacking, hip-hop, choreography, and krumping.

820
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,030
MANNEQUEEN is a world-class crew of talented female warriors.

821
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,169
I can't wait to see how they combined...

822
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,639
these different genres and created a new performance.

823
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,968
Let's see it right away.

824
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,469
MANNEQUEEN. Ready? Fight!

825
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,280
(MANNEQUEEN's dance studio)

826
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,050
Although Lady Gaga wasn't our first choice,

827
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,618
I think her music...

828
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:55,749
- is a great fit for us. - That's right. It is.

829
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,049
Lady Gaga is known as the master of performance themes.

830
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,759
I believe we'll be able to give ourselves some flamboyant looks.

831
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,059
- You're right. - Absolutely.

832
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,029
Are you Lady Cera?

833
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,030
- That's right. - I'm Lady Yoonji.

834
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,750
For the days you want to look stylish.

835
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,245
For the days you want to look even more stylish.

836
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:12,269
(Cautious)

837
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,440
Lady Gaga is known for her coolest sunglasses.

838
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,269
No, it's her costumes.

839
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:20,210
- Lady Gaga. - Gaga.

840
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,710
- Hey. - Who's that?

841
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,479
Hey. I'm Lady Waackxxxy.

842
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,518
(Waackxxxy copied her makeup.)

843
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:27,649
(She already looks like a queen.)

844
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,589
I can see with my eyes open,

845
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,988
and even with my eyes closed.

846
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:32,988
I can see with my eyes open like this.

847
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,420
How many is this?

848
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,130
(Who's the lady in red high heels?)

849
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,328
(It's Buckey, MANNEQUEEN's eldest member.)

850
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:40,428
I'm a queen.

851
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:41,899
(Cracking up at her skit)

852
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,070
I'm "Judas" Buckey.

853
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,098
(She's dressed as Lady Gaga back in her "Judas" days.)

854
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,099
How do I look?

855
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,170
You just look pretty.

856
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,569
Is this what we're doing?

857
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,868
Are we doing pretty?

858
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,009
- What about me? - No, it's...

859
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,579
(Come on, next Lady Gaga.)

860
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,309
(Lady Redlic with the biggest ego ever)

861
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:58,509
Are you an AI character?

862
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,779
What's your theme here?

863
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,218
(Lady Redlic's theme is unclear.)

864
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:03,249
- Come on, look at us. - Look.

865
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,319
(Together, they look ridiculous.)

866
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,489
She looks the prettiest.

867
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,759
It's like Buckey is Lady Gaga,

868
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,389
and the four of us are just wearing props in a photo booth.

869
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,789
It's like we're in a photo booth.

870
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:15,400
- Stop that. - Here she comes!

871
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,929
What have you got?

872
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,080
(Her indescribable aura intimidates them.)

873
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,369
I'm scared.

874
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,440
No, don't be intimidated.

875
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,809
What?

876
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,010
- Oh, my gosh! - Yes!

877
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,049
The makeup looks good on her.

878
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,370
She totally looks like Lady Gaga!

879
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,718
(Astonished by the resemblance)

880
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,150
This might give me a nightmare.

881
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,389
- Let's go. - It's party

882
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,619
(Their Lady Gaga dress-up was a success.)

883
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,859
(The end of MANNEQUEEN's Lady Gaga contest)

884
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,230
- It looks good, right? - It does.

885
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:46,859
We should start practicing now.

886
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,859
Before we do, this will be a good warm-up exercise.

887
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,968
- Yes. - Shall we give it a try?

888
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,670
Here. First,

889
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,739
- you tap on this app. - Oh, my.

890
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,340
- Okay, let's go! - All right.

891
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,210
- Here we go. - I'm nervous.

892
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,280
Nice. Great.

893
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,210
This is so much fun.

894
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,479
(Dancing hard)

895
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,920
Even if you're not good at dancing, it'd be easy to follow.

896
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,059
(Quokka Yoonji is enjoying the game.)

897
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,118
(She got a bad for going to the wrong direction.)

898
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,218
She got it wrong!

899
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,666
(The full version video is available online.)

900
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,959
We're all warmed up now. Shall we begin our practice?

901
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,800
- Let's go! - Yes!

902
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,129
Lady Gaga is...

903
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,529
a revolutionary and daring artist.

904
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,340
A lot of her songs express strong determination.

905
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:32,968
We'll reveal the part of us that we're hiding inside...

906
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:37,150
and express our strong passion and our inner selves.

907
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:40,618
We're going to give you an unforgettable performance...

908
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,050
in the finals.

909
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,229
("Poker Face," "Scheibe," and "Judas" by Lady Gaga)

910
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,900
You guys look beautiful!

911
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,660
(I am going to show you who the queen is.)

912
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,539
You've watched MANNEQUEEN's Global Artist Mission performance.

913
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,209
Their pose during the intro to depict a human dress...

914
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,679
was very impressive.

915
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,380
They showed off their flexibility and technique, their strong suit,

916
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,320
and gave a performance that you can't take your eyes off.

917
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,050
Fight judge Monika.

918
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:36,860
What did you think of MANNEQUEEN's Global Artist Mission performance?

919
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,928
It was like Lady Gaga was actually here.

920
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes.

921
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,538
It didn't feel like a mission. It felt like I was at her concert.

922
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,170
I think Lady Gaga should buy this choreography.

923
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,610
It was truly amazing.

924
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,679
Thank you, Monika.

925
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,609
If you want to give MANNEQUEEN, the great world-class crew,

926
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,848
the crown as the queen of queens,

927
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,589
text your vote to 0011 now.

928
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:07,988
Please text "MANNEQUEEN" or number four.

929
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,019
(Text your vote to 0011.)

930
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,760
MANNEQUEEN, great job.

931
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,509
All right. You've watched...

932
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:30,179
all four finalists' performances for the Global Artist Mission.

933
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:33,249
The four crew have proven themselves once again...

934
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,749
with amazing reinterpretations of the global artists' music.

935
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:40,058
Which crew will be the final winner of Street Woman Fighter 2 tonight...

936
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:43,590
and win the title as the number one dance crew in the world?

937
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,900
The live voting is still open,

938
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,869
so make sure to cast your votes.

939
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:55,839
Now, there are some people in the live audience here...

940
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,070
who would like to express their support to the crews.

941
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,638
Firstly, I see someone enjoying the finals with hearty cheers.

942
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,980
It's the former sports star, Kwak Yoon Gy.

943
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,410
Please give the crews some words of support.

944
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,089
Yes, hello.

945
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:12,549
I'm Kwak Yoon Gy, the one who danced at the Olympics.

946
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:13,619
Yes!

947
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:18,429
Personally, while watching their performances,

948
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,999
I thought that if there was a dancing Olympics,

949
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,198
the competition would be as heated as this.

950
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,170
Their performances were fantastic and extraordinary.

951
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:29,440
I was touched like it was a sports game.

952
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,969
All right, thank you. It's an honour to have you here.

953
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:36,948
Now, these days, I enjoy watching...

954
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:38,649
ZEROBASEONE's performance.

955
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,618
They participated in the "Smoke" challenge...

956
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,389
and expressed their love for Street Woman Fighter 2.

957
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:47,018
We have some of ZEROBASEONE members joining us in the audience.

958
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:50,359
It's Han Bin, Matthew, Hao, and Tae Rae.

959
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Could you give the crews some words of support?

960
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,799
Let us say hello to everyone. In 2, 3.

961
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,570
- Hello, we're ZEROBASEONE. - Hello, we're ZEROBASEONE.

962
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:00,369
Yes.

963
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:02,439
All of us are big fans...

964
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,339
of Street Woman Fighter 2.

965
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,779
We'll be fully enjoying the crews' passion...

966
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,238
for dancing.

967
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:09,908
This is the finals, and they must be very nervous.

968
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:12,308
I hope our cheers will help them loosen up.

969
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,379
Good luck!

970
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,719
- Good luck! - Good luck!

971
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,730
Now, we're joined by one more special guest today.

972
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:28,859
He's one of my favourite seniors. It's Kim Jae Hwan.

973
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,229
No, I'm not your senior.

974
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,598
- Right. - Yes.

975
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,268
Anyway, you've come to show your support to the crews...

976
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:35,999
- of Street Woman Fighter 2. - Yes.

977
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,138
Please give them a few words of support.

978
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:40,880
Actually, I'm so hyped right now...

979
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,510
that I don't even know what to say.

980
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:46,848
That's how fantastic their performances were.

981
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:49,618
I got goosebumps all over. That's all I can say.

982
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:51,849
Also, I'm so grateful to Mnet...

983
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,190
for making such a great show like this.

984
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,030
And all the dancers in the show as well.

985
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,959
I think all their sweat and effort...

986
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,329
have paid off and made their performance so brilliant.

987
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,599
Thank you so much.

988
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,308
- Also, - All right.

989
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:12,238
Daniel, you make a good show host.

990
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:14,109
- Sorry? Oh, thank you. - You're a good show host.

991
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,409
Now, Tae Rae, could you say a few words as well?

992
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:20,919
Yes. First of all, all the dancers...

993
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,018
- just look radiant today. - Right.

994
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,848
Since they've worked so hard so far,

995
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,759
I hope they'll give their all to their performances today.

996
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,960
I'll be looking forward to it.

997
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,829
Great.

998
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,098
Lastly, there's someone...

999
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,129
who's been looking forward to the finals more than anyone.

1000
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,170
It's Nam Ji Hyun.

1001
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,969
Please give the crews a few words of support.

1002
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:44,769
Hello, I'm actress Nam Ji Hyun.

1003
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,109
I've been a big fan...

1004
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,479
of Street Woman Fighter 2.

1005
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,819
I've been enjoying every episode since August.

1006
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,249
It feels like a dream to be here to watch the finals live.

1007
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,018
It's such an honour. Thank you.

1008
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:04,860
I sense such great enthusiasm from the audience here.

1009
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,729
I'm sure it means a lot...

1010
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,729
to all the dancers on stage.

1011
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,170
I'll also show them my support as much as possible.

1012
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,039
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1013
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,868
Lastly, we're also joined by the judge of Street Woman Fighter 1,

1014
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,409
TAEYONG of NCT.

1015
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,119
Please give some words of support to the four crews.

1016
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:31,089
First of all, it feels completely different to watch...

1017
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,249
the finals live.

1018
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,988
Since the four crews are showing us such great passion,

1019
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:39,559
we'll also do our best to cheer for them. Good luck.

1020
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,230
Great, thank you.

1021
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:46,229
I appreciate all your heartfelt messages of support...

1022
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,638
for the four finalists.

1023
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:49,939
I hope you will keep supporting them...

1024
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,039
with even louder cheers until the end.

1025
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,539
You're watching Street Woman Fighter 2.

1026
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:00,750
Let's move on to the last mission, the End Credit Mission.

1027
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,819
(Second mission, the End Credit Mission)

1028
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,749
(End Credit Mission)

1029
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,420
1MILLION, BEBE,

1030
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,859
JAM REPUBLIC, MANNEQUEEN.

1031
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,360
This will be the last performance they'll be giving on our show.

1032
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,929
Which crew will be the first to perform?

1033
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,369
It's 1MILLION.

1034
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,308
1MILLION's Mega Crew Mission performance...

1035
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:30,849
has now hit over ten million views online.

1036
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,979
It's the best record we've seen in all seasons,

1037
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,219
and they're making new history.

1038
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:38,118
The finale by 1MILLION,

1039
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,949
the crew that started history.

1040
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,729
How will their end credits of dance look?

1041
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,190
1MILLION, ready?

1042
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,760
Fight!

1043
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:50,159
(Lia Kim)

1044
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,339
Lia, we're here!

1045
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,469
Hi.

1046
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,538
Do I look good in an apron?

1047
00:58:57,539 --> 00:58:58,939
It's a new look.

1048
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,046
(Lia Kim in an apron appears.)

1049
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,408
I invited the members at home.

1050
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:05,979
And I wanted to serve them a hot meal...

1051
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,279
so that we could spend...

1052
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,989
some time together to cheer up.

1053
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,739
- It looks so new. - You look so different.

1054
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,489
How does my doenjang stew taste?

1055
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,860
- It's tasty, right? - Yes.

1056
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,369
It's so good that it makes me frown.

1057
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:20,899
It's seriously good.

1058
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,768
I've always wanted to cook for you.

1059
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:24,828
Thanks.

1060
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,570
Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

1061
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,939
I'm so full.

1062
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,500
- I'm stuffed. - Me too.

1063
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:32,840
Since day one, a lot of things have happened to us, right?

1064
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,279
Share the most memorable mission...

1065
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,479
one by one.

1066
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,586
The Mega Crew Mission for me.

1067
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,848
Right.

1068
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:43,119
We devoted ourselves to it from the meeting to the choreo.

1069
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:46,449
We kept developing and revising it.

1070
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,359
There were a lot of conflicts and different opinions.

1071
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,428
Although it was tough, we were still...

1072
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:54,859
We were able to make up for each other's shortcomings.

1073
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,630
I realized what an actual team was.

1074
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,828
So,

1075
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:00,400
we're going to watch our Mega Crew Mission...

1076
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,968
to bring back the memories and strengthen our determination.

1077
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:06,038
That sounds fun.

1078
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:07,709
(1MILLION's reaction to its Mega Crew Mission)

1079
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,840
Yes.

1080
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,709
- Oh, my. - It's so...

1081
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,110
We had amazing teamwork.

1082
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,718
Let's go.

1083
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:14,979
(Drawn in)

1084
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,119
There you go.

1085
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,848
It amazes me non-stop...

1086
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:19,219
that I can't close my mouth.

1087
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:21,860
It's still awesome.

1088
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,029
- We made it, but it's incredible. - Yes, totally.

1089
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,059
It's so...

1090
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:31,029
- Hi, 1MILLION girls. - What?

1091
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,368
It's Lia.

1092
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:33,569
(Lia has a surprise message for the members.)

1093
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:34,570
What?

1094
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:36,075
(You can't just move our hearts like this.)

1095
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,170
You've done so well.

1096
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,638
Yes!

1097
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,309
We've all been through a lot.

1098
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,980
(Choking up)

1099
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,320
I couldn't stop crying,

1100
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,519
so I had to keep taking this video over and over.

1101
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:55,819
You guys had my back so reliably,

1102
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,635
and that was the only reason I could get through it.

1103
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:00,029
Even when Lia fell for a short time,

1104
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,429
we wanted to stand tall...

1105
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,659
so that she could get back up.

1106
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,469
One more time. Slowly.

1107
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,070
I doubt that I would have gotten through this if it weren't for you.

1108
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,570
Just performing on this stage with you guys...

1109
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,380
will be the happiest moment of my life.

1110
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,380
I love you all.

1111
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:23,078
Let's go, 1MILLION!

1112
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,090
(Bursting into laughter)

1113
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,319
- "Let's go, 1MILLION!" - You got it wrong.

1114
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,488
Right.

1115
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,589
- Hello. - Oh, my!

1116
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,428
(And a message from the members for Lia)

1117
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:34,658
I thought I was the only one!

1118
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:37,670
We've been seeing each other every day for half a year now.

1119
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,769
I've seen you more often than I have my mom.

1120
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:42,099
But you're practically...

1121
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,939
my Korean mom.

1122
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,968
(You're my Korean mom.)

1123
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,509
(Shy and touched)

1124
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,940
You bought me food,

1125
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,710
clothes, and shoes.

1126
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,449
So, I'm grateful.

1127
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:57,619
We've had it tough,

1128
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,590
and a lot of it seemed impossible.

1129
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,419
But we did it.

1130
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,859
I hope you never forget...

1131
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,960
that we're there for you.

1132
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:12,369
I want to keep dancing joyfully with you.

1133
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:15,638
I was glad to be on the journey of Street Woman Fighter 2...

1134
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:19,539
with you and the other members.

1135
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,980
Let's keep going until the end.

1136
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,340
Let's go!

1137
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:26,709
(Lia shows tears due to the members' sincerity.)

1138
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,780
When Debby said,

1139
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,250
"Korean mom," it was so...

1140
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:32,019
Same.

1141
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,320
I didn't think I was that nice to her.

1142
01:02:34,389 --> 01:02:35,889
Then, call her auntie.

1143
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,089
- Korean auntie. - Auntie.

1144
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,488
Watching this...

1145
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,499
- gave me energy. - Right.

1146
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,828
I have a feeling that I can do my best and do it well.

1147
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:45,146
(I'll do my best and do it well.)

1148
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,539
We came all the way to the finals.

1149
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,809
I want to have so much fun...

1150
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,669
- on the stage. - Right.

1151
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,010
- Definitely. - I just want to...

1152
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,039
At least, in this performance,

1153
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,380
I don't want to mind other people's prejudices.

1154
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:03,279
I hope we will show people...

1155
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,249
our true colours.

1156
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,158
- 1MILLION! - To the champion!

1157
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,259
- Whether we win or lose, - Whether we win or lose,

1158
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,428
- let's go! - let's go!

1159
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:14,760
(Whether we win or lose, let's go!)

1160
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:33,679
("Natural" by Imagine Dragons choreographed by 1MILLION)

1161
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,518
(The performance of 1MILLION's determination to focus on...)

1162
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:38,959
(the present and its true colours to overcome the prejudices.)

1163
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,460
(Lia Kim)

1164
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,678
That was the End Credit Mission by 1MILLION,

1165
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:50,579
the crew acknowledged not only by Korea but also by the world.

1166
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,089
We could feel their explosive passion...

1167
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,718
and their conflicting energy...

1168
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,730
that was intense yet gentle.

1169
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,559
Fight judge, Shownu.

1170
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,000
What did you think about 1MILLION's performance?

1171
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,808
I'm wondering how many performances...

1172
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:13,840
you came up with in such a short time.

1173
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:18,710
First, one of 1MILLION's strengths is...

1174
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,448
its flexibility...

1175
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:24,320
and the talent...

1176
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:28,389
that shows from the facial expressions.

1177
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:32,859
That went well with the explosive show today,

1178
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,329
and it was the best performance ever by 1MILLION.

1179
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,030
Great work. Thank you for the show.

1180
01:06:40,969 --> 01:06:42,340
Thank you for the comment.

1181
01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:45,670
1MILLION has shown its end credits through dance.

1182
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,309
The leader of 1MILLION, Lia Kim.

1183
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:52,309
How do you feel about finishing your last performance here?

1184
01:06:58,619 --> 01:06:59,989
Gosh.

1185
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:03,019
We've finally reached the end.

1186
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,768
I doubt that any of the dancers thought...

1187
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:16,139
that I could get through this program.

1188
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,610
Now that we've finished our final performance,

1189
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:22,610
I'm extremely glad.

1190
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,009
And the members that helped me get here,

1191
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,820
I love you all.

1192
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,788
I believe that we pulled off out last performance fabulously.

1193
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:33,849
Thank you!

1194
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,090
(Lia Kim)

1195
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,030
That was the last performance...

1196
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,900
by 1MILLION, one of the finalists of Street Woman Fighter 2.

1197
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,468
If you're rooting for 1MILLION,

1198
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:47,999
send a text message to 0011...

1199
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,109
with 1MILLION's name or the number one.

1200
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,745
(Text the number of the crew name to 0011.)

1201
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,539
Great job, 1MILLION.

1202
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:58,409
- Thank you! - Thank you.

1203
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,228
Tonight, the champion crew will be decided...

1204
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:20,130
by your live text voting.

1205
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:22,939
Your votes will determine the champion,

1206
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,039
so please vote for the crew that you're rooting for.

1207
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:29,010
The next crew to perform is...

1208
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:32,680
BEBE.

1209
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,288
BEBE is a team of Bada, the hottest choreographer,

1210
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:41,689
and the rookie dancers of the world of dancing in Korea.

1211
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,689
In the last mission, the crew placed first...

1212
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,889
and became the first crew...

1213
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,029
to secure its spot in the finals.

1214
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,568
BEBE is acclaimed as the future...

1215
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:53,630
of the K-pop world through Street Woman Fighter 2.

1216
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,439
What will their End Credit Mission look like?

1217
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,640
BEBE, ready? Fight!

1218
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,578
(A Store)

1219
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:06,778
- What is this? - Gosh.

1220
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:07,849
It's gorgeous.

1221
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,148
- Bada! - It's Bada.

1222
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,648
- Ta-Da! - Ta-Da!

1223
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:12,750
- What are you doing here? - What are these?

1224
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,788
We're going to get crew jewellery.

1225
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:16,419
I prepared these for you!

1226
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,189
(Make some noise.)

1227
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:21,228
Try on the ones that you like and pick one.

1228
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:22,630
- Yes! - Yes!

1229
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,669
- It looks cute. - Check out this necklace.

1230
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:25,899
I want this.

1231
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:28,839
I thought they only sold it on their app.

1232
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,738
I didn't know they had an offline store.

1233
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:32,270
- I know, right? - Me neither.

1234
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,709
Did you all pick one?

1235
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,180
We picked so many.

1236
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,278
- Seriously. - How should we pick one?

1237
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,510
I don't think we can decide.

1238
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:40,278
- Shall we decide? - Sure.

1239
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:42,619
- I choose you! - In 1, 2, 3.

1240
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,449
(We choose you!)

1241
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:47,288
We were thinking the same.

1242
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:49,089
- So, this is our crew ring. - Yes!

1243
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,330
(BEBE's new uniform, crew ring)

1244
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,359
I was watching, and...

1245
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,698
I found the championship ring.

1246
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:56,759
- Oh, my gosh. - They're gorgeous.

1247
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,800
Awesome.

1248
01:09:57,869 --> 01:09:59,129
- They're so pretty. - It's shining so brightly.

1249
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,198
- The colours are brilliant. - Beautiful.

1250
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,068
We're going to win, so should we tell them our sizes?

1251
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,038
- Sure. - Let's do that.

1252
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,999
We'll win the championship and come back for you.

1253
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:09,578
(The second special course by Bada)

1254
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:11,180
It's a theme park!

1255
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,379
How long has it been?

1256
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,648
I never had time...

1257
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:18,219
to make memories with them during Street Woman Fighter 2.

1258
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:21,419
So we came to a theme park as they all wanted.

1259
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,759
Hello.

1260
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,260
(The employees say hi with the "Smoke" move.)

1261
01:10:25,329 --> 01:10:26,759
- She did this. - I'm glad...

1262
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,760
- when they do this. - I know.

1263
01:10:27,761 --> 01:10:30,130
- You're so pretty, Tatter! - I love you!

1264
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,099
I love you, Bada.

1265
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,170
Thank you.

1266
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,140
It's weird that they recognize us.

1267
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,698
In 1, 2, 3.

1268
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,039
(They forget about the mission and have fun today.)

1269
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,810
Hold on!

1270
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:43,608
I feel like we've only been running forward.

1271
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:46,648
It was pleasant to spend the day...

1272
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:48,618
without any worries.

1273
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,590
I'm glad to share a memory as a team.

1274
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:53,749
What's going on now?

1275
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,318
- You're making me too happy. - What?

1276
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,318
To celebrate our friendship forever,

1277
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,158
I got us roses!

1278
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,736
(Sky-blue roses for their long friendship)

1279
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,259
When the members of BEBE first gathered,

1280
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,568
I gave them roses to promise that we'll forever be a family.

1281
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:08,368
But I never gave the new members any roses.

1282
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:12,039
I wonder when this type of day will come in the future.

1283
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,839
I feel like we've formed a stronger bond today.

1284
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,840
Right.

1285
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:17,339
I can't believe we're in the finals.

1286
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,750
I would never have been able to do it by myself.

1287
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,448
(Spotting something)

1288
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:22,779
Surprise!

1289
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:25,569
(The big event that even Bada didn't know about)

1290
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:27,319
It's Mom, Tatter.

1291
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,319
(Mom?)

1292
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:32,930
- I told you this would happen! - Are you watching?

1293
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,060
(A message from the families of the BEBE members)

1294
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,499
You're doing so great out there,

1295
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,939
so I'm proud of you and grateful for everything.

1296
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,939
I see Minah being on a team with such good people,

1297
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:52,350
and it makes me think about how blessed she is.

1298
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:56,050
I hope you keep doing well.

1299
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,619
Your mom and dad will always root for you from behind,

1300
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:03,460
so keep showing your efforts as you've always done...

1301
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,430
without minding the result.

1302
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:06,858
Hi.

1303
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:09,029
How are you doing, Soweon?

1304
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:12,369
(Soweon cries as soon as her mom appears.)

1305
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,770
I'm enjoying the show.

1306
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,139
You liked to dance when you were little,

1307
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,609
and I thought it'd only be a hobby.

1308
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,570
Now, you're properly showing them on Street Woman Fighter 2.

1309
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,579
I just want you to do what you want to do and be happy.

1310
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,310
Do whatever you want to do.

1311
01:12:27,579 --> 01:12:31,420
Don't forget that I'll always be your number-one fan.

1312
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:34,859
Thanks for letting me be your mom, Kyma.

1313
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:37,020
I love you so much.

1314
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:41,529
My daughter, Lusher.

1315
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,328
What are you doing over there?

1316
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:44,800
I know, right?

1317
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,930
She was obviously Lusher's mom.

1318
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:51,069
I saw you enjoying the work and powering through,

1319
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,170
and I was very proud of you.

1320
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:56,779
Please keep doing your best without any injuries.

1321
01:12:57,279 --> 01:12:59,309
(And...)

1322
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,310
My mom...

1323
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,419
Is that from your mom?

1324
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,300
(And a sincere message in a handwritten letter)

1325
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,859
But she said she didn't do anything.

1326
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,429
(The handwritten messages...)

1327
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:16,959
(hold her affectionate support for her daughter.)

1328
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,328
(I love you, Bada. Thank you for being my daughter.)

1329
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,630
(Our family will be happy.)

1330
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:21,698
(The warm words...)

1331
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:22,999
(make them all cry.)

1332
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,739
Oh, come on!

1333
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:28,210
This is probably a tear trigger for everyone.

1334
01:13:28,409 --> 01:13:31,079
- Exactly. - This is cheating.

1335
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,519
But it's nice to see our mothers.

1336
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,579
Absolutely.

1337
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,889
I don't think I'll ever forget today.

1338
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:42,188
Let's keep remembering today until the end of the finals.

1339
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,919
Sure. Let's dance hard.

1340
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,658
This is only a start, isn't it?

1341
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:49,600
The final round is our beginning.

1342
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:52,630
Let's go and begin our future.

1343
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,999
Not the end, but the beginning!

1344
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,639
- It's the beginning! - Yes!

1345
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,109
(It's the beginning now.)

1346
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,020
Let's go!

1347
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:16,760
Go!

1348
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:24,309
("Praise," produced music, and "Run It" choreographed by BEBE)

1349
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,599
(Meaning, "Only the prepared may escape from darkness,")

1350
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,868
(BEBE portrays its determination to keep on dancing...)

1351
01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:29,039
(in a dark manner.)

1352
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:04,800
(Bada)

1353
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:08,539
(Let's go, BEBE!)

1354
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:19,948
(Number 2)

1355
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:23,919
- BEBE! - BEBE!

1356
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,019
That was the End Credit Mission by BEBE that turned...

1357
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,789
from the youngest rookie crew to a named crew.

1358
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,689
Your intense moves using masks were pretty impressive.

1359
01:16:34,029 --> 01:16:36,358
They've shown how they'll keep devoting themselves to dancing...

1360
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:39,529
after growing to a whole new level on Street Woman Fighter 2...

1361
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:42,399
in the last performance.

1362
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,939
Special judge, Mike Song.

1363
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:48,079
What did you think about their performance?

1364
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,239
When I watched BEBE's performance,

1365
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:55,680
I felt that we found a leader of the new generation.

1366
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:02,459
I think you greatly affected the global dance culture.

1367
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,329
I'm just so proud to see you guys. I'm happy for you.

1368
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:07,659
Congratulations.

1369
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,369
Thank you, Mike Song.

1370
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:13,600
The leader of BEBE, Bada.

1371
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,739
How does it feel to finish your last performance here?

1372
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,439
Yes. First,

1373
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:23,179
I'm exhilarated that BEBE...

1374
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,179
was able to come to the finals.

1375
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:30,278
And I'm glad to have shown you our unique performance.

1376
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,288
My heart is full, and it's an honour.

1377
01:17:32,289 --> 01:17:35,390
Also, the members who came through with the performance.

1378
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:36,890
Thank you.

1379
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:38,890
Great work.

1380
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:41,800
It was such a happy and fun journey,

1381
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,169
and I hope it touched your hearts as well.

1382
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:46,270
Thank you for watching!

1383
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:52,339
That was the last performance...

1384
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:55,010
by BEBE, a finalist on Street Woman Fighter 2.

1385
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:57,139
If you're rooting for BEBE to win,

1386
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,979
text BEBE or the number two...

1387
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,818
to 0011.

1388
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:05,788
(Text the number of the crew name to 0011.)

1389
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:07,189
Great job, BEBE.

1390
01:18:10,189 --> 01:18:11,789
(Number 2)

1391
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:14,659
(BEBE for the championship)

1392
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:21,869
(Bada)

1393
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,969
Tonight, the number-one crew in the whole world...

1394
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:28,680
will be decided by your live text voting.

1395
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,680
Vote for the crew that you're rooting for right now.

1396
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:35,180
The next crew to perform is...

1397
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:37,520
JAM REPUBLIC.

1398
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:44,789
JAM REPUBLIC is the first global crew in Street Woman Fighter.

1399
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,929
A total of 23 countries, including Korea,

1400
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:52,228
helped propel their videos to an unprecedented popularity.

1401
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:55,399
They set a new record across all seasons of the show.

1402
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,510
For each mission, they showcased their worldwide talent boldly.

1403
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:02,909
How will JAM REPUBLIC'S ending performance turn out?

1404
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:06,109
JAM REPUBLIC, are you ready? Fight!

1405
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,688
(Kirsten)

1406
01:19:15,689 --> 01:19:16,719
Hey.

1407
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,559
Long time no see.

1408
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,890
Hello. I'm LaTrice.

1409
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,559
Guys, we're all in different countries.

1410
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,670
This is wild.

1411
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:28,239
- I miss you all. - I miss you guys too.

1412
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:30,339
How are we feeling about finals, all?

1413
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,908
I can't believe how quick it's coming.

1414
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:35,309
And we're excited! Just waiting to see what comes next.

1415
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:38,949
For the finals, after we perform, and whatever happens,

1416
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,278
it's going to be really sad saying goodbye to everyone.

1417
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:42,279
Yes, it'll be sad.

1418
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:45,649
Wait, do you guys remember the first time we met together?

1419
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:48,419
(JAM DROP LING would like to share a memory.)

1420
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:50,559
(During their first meeting with the producers)

1421
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,129
Hi, I'm Audrey.

1422
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:57,029
I'm from Washington, America, yes.

1423
01:19:57,399 --> 01:19:58,828
Hi guys, I'm Ling.

1424
01:19:58,829 --> 01:20:01,568
I'm Emma. I'm from New Zealand as well.

1425
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:03,898
I am from Brisbane, Australia.

1426
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,310
Hi, I'm Kirsten.

1427
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:07,509
(Why did you decide to be on Street Woman Fighter 2?)

1428
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,679
I really love Korea, and I love K-pop,

1429
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,979
so I'm just excited to be in the culture.

1430
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:14,209
I also love the name of the show.

1431
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,649
It's like "Street Fighter,"

1432
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,196
so it's giving me attacking vibes. I just can't wait to get out there,

1433
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,948
and kill the beat, buys.

1434
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:23,488
I think it's a new challenge for me.

1435
01:20:23,489 --> 01:20:26,130
"Woman power" is really a game changer.

1436
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,930
Dance as well. It's going to be amazing.

1437
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,646
(What are you looking forward to the most on Street Woman Fighter 2?)

1438
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,898
Different women freestyling.

1439
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:37,299
It'll be interesting to see all the different styles there.

1440
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,739
That has me excited.

1441
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:41,470
(SWF2 would like to share a memory.)

1442
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,679
(Audrey was looking forward to freestyling.)

1443
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:51,850
(She was able to prove her battle skill in front of many.)

1444
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:54,389
I'm really excited for...

1445
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:57,859
the choreography for the artists that you bring on.

1446
01:20:59,029 --> 01:21:00,469
(SWF2 would like to share a memory.)

1447
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,499
(The most anticipated Artist's New Song Preview Mission)

1448
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,470
(Ling was able to meet Hwasa, an artist she's been a fan of.)

1449
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:10,738
(She was able to receive the highest praise for her dance.)

1450
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:13,009
I think I've seen a lot of Korean dancers...

1451
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:15,408
just on social media.

1452
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:19,148
I'm excited to see how they work in person.

1453
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:21,279
It would be nice to see them firsthand.

1454
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:24,988
(Through Street Woman Fighter 2, JAM REPUBLIC made memories...)

1455
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:27,520
(with other Korean dancers.)

1456
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,759
(What side of JAM REPUBLIC will we see on SWF2?)

1457
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,589
Everyone in this crew has got their own individual strengths.

1458
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:40,068
Moreover, as the first global crew to enter the competition, the show,

1459
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:41,999
we have confidence.

1460
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,099
Everyone here is a beautiful woman.

1461
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,539
I think that's going to be something that no one else has seen.

1462
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:50,309
Oh, my gosh, this was five months ago.

1463
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,309
We did a lot, right?

1464
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:54,549
We did well, guys.

1465
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:55,679
Good memories.

1466
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,849
No regrets, baby.

1467
01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:01,488
I have to say, the number of times I'm like,

1468
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:02,959
"I can't wait till it's over," and now I'm like, "aw."

1469
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,919
- I'm sad. - Sad.

1470
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,300
We have an announcement.

1471
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,799
Another challenge has been put out.

1472
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,969
- Let me guess. - It's a new mission?

1473
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,130
I want to go home.

1474
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,739
- Hi Kirsten. - Hi Kirsten.

1475
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,068
(A surprise video message from families of the members)

1476
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,738
We just want to say how proud of you we are...

1477
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:25,478
for all your hard work on this show. We love you.

1478
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:27,779
- And we can't wait to see you. - Oh, my gosh.

1479
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:29,648
We love you.

1480
01:22:29,649 --> 01:22:31,379
- Gosh. - Go, JAM REPUBLIC!

1481
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,488
Go, JAM REPUBLIC!

1482
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:34,919
We love you so much.

1483
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,658
We encourage you to keep going.

1484
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:38,858
You have so much to give.

1485
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:41,559
Just keep climbing up.

1486
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,059
Just have fun...

1487
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,568
for the last competition.

1488
01:22:45,569 --> 01:22:49,538
And make the most of your time. Enjoy it and have fun.

1489
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:50,568
Hi, Emma.

1490
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:53,068
- Gosh. - Hello from Auckland, New Zealand.

1491
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:55,409
- Go Emma, we love you. - Go Emma, we love you.

1492
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:57,379
- Go! - We love you!

1493
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,649
- What's that? - I just want to do my heart.

1494
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:02,849
- That's so lovely. - That's great.

1495
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,090
She wanted to do a heart.

1496
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,390
- Oh, my gosh. - Like this.

1497
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:08,119
Hi Audrey.

1498
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,618
We just wanted to say congratulations...

1499
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:11,158
for making it to the finals.

1500
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:13,858
We're super proud of you and all the hard work you've put in.

1501
01:23:13,859 --> 01:23:15,600
We love you and miss you.

1502
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,630
That was the best mission.

1503
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:20,399
This was really the first prize.

1504
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:24,269
Throughout this whole journey, we wouldn't be here without you.

1505
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,238
And a big shout out to our families.

1506
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,310
We love you and we miss you so much.

1507
01:23:29,109 --> 01:23:30,909
- This one. - This one.

1508
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:33,250
I'm doing it like this.

1509
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:37,349
For the Ending Credits performance, it's our goal to showcase...

1510
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,919
not only who we are,

1511
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,818
but also represent the world.

1512
01:23:40,819 --> 01:23:43,389
By having the flags on the back of our LED lights...

1513
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,259
for JAM REPUBLIC showcases...

1514
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,589
who we are, where we come from,

1515
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:48,429
and who we represent.

1516
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,099
I think we're going to try our best to put on the best stage...

1517
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,799
that we can do. We're not holding back for this one.

1518
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,538
This is not the end,

1519
01:23:55,539 --> 01:23:57,669
so make sure you stay tuned.

1520
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:01,539
- Let's go. - The finals!

1521
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:03,010
Let's go!

1522
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,510
(Would you like to see JAM REPUBLIC'S Ending Credits?)

1523
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,350
("Jele" by DBN Gogo, Sino Msolo, Kamo Mphela, Young Stunna, Busiswa)

1524
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:27,269
(A performance highlighting JAM REPUBLIC's identity...)

1525
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,299
(as a diverse band of dancers unified to achieve success...)

1526
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,980
(and to show how will, toughness, and tenacity overcame adversity.)

1527
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:00,689
JAM REPUBLIC!

1528
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,818
JAM REPUBLIC's Ending Credits performance...

1529
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,890
reminded us once more this is a worldwide Avengers crew.

1530
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:37,728
Once more, they've boldly showcased...

1531
01:26:37,729 --> 01:26:39,868
the fresh, new performance style...

1532
01:26:39,869 --> 01:26:42,938
that is JAM REPUBLIC's strength.

1533
01:26:42,939 --> 01:26:45,739
They've proven their unrivalled skills again.

1534
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,640
Fight judge Monika,

1535
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:51,439
what did you think of JAM REPUBLIC's Ending Credits Performance?

1536
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,549
I thought it was incredible, and there's so much I could say.

1537
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,149
Right now, I'm a little emotional.

1538
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:58,919
This is what how I'd like to express it.

1539
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:01,819
All of your roots are so beautiful.

1540
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:06,329
They're so beautiful.

1541
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:07,630
Thank you so much.

1542
01:27:07,631 --> 01:27:10,859
Thank you for sharing this performance with us.

1543
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:13,770
Thank you for your kind words.

1544
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:17,000
JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten,

1545
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,439
as the first global crew in Street Woman Fighter history,

1546
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:22,039
your crew has made it to finals.

1547
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,680
How do you feel, having finished your final performance?

1548
01:27:29,649 --> 01:27:30,680
Take your time.

1549
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:36,189
No!

1550
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,299
I'm here. Okay.

1551
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,199
I just want to say, it's been a journey.

1552
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,698
What we wanted to show again on our last performance...

1553
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:52,609
is the journey that we've taken.

1554
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:54,969
We came here to show...

1555
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,639
so much, not just one thing.

1556
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,078
And I hope you understood...

1557
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,079
everything that we did, the story that we told.

1558
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:05,519
And we are so happy...

1559
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,090
and proud to be standing on this stage in front of you all.

1560
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:12,390
So thank you very much for this moment.

1561
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,060
This is so amazing.

1562
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:19,368
Kirsten told us that she's very grateful...

1563
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:21,898
to have been able to share their journey...

1564
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:24,039
through their last performance.

1565
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:27,309
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1566
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:30,180
The final performance for JAM REPUBLIC is now over.

1567
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,549
Viewers who support JAM REPUBLIC,

1568
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:34,979
please text pound 0011...

1569
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:38,448
and send a message saying JAM REPUBLIC...

1570
01:28:38,449 --> 01:28:39,719
or the number three.

(Vote for the crew number or the crew name via text.)

1572
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:43,960
JAM REPUBLIC, thank you for your hard work.

1573
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,430
Thank you.

1574
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:48,729
Thank you.

1575
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,609
(JAM REPUBLIC, you tore it up)

1576
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:04,639
Tonight, the winning crew will take home the trophy.

1577
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,350
Which crew will win?

1578
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:09,579
Please vote for the crew you support right now.

1579
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,819
The last crew to perform...

1580
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:14,789
is MANNEQUEEN.

1581
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,328
MANNEQUEEN has world-class skill and seeks to expand their range.

1582
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:25,970
They are a pioneering crew on the dance scene.

1583
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:29,340
In the recent Elimination Battle, they won an overwhelming victory,

1584
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:31,669
and survived to show you this final performance.

1585
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:35,539
What kind of Ending Credits performance will MANNEQUEEN show?

1586
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:37,239
MANNEQUEEN, ready?

1587
01:29:37,579 --> 01:29:38,579
Fight!

1588
01:29:43,449 --> 01:29:46,009
We believe the finals will be better after we eat, so let's eat.

1589
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:47,449
It's pizza.

1590
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:49,390
Ta Da.

1591
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:52,059
(A pizza party for the finals)

1592
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,089
- This looks so delicious. - It looks insane.

1593
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:56,760
- To MANNEQUEEN's victory! - To victory!

1594
01:29:56,829 --> 01:29:59,229
(Taking huge bites)

1595
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:00,629
It's so delicious.

1596
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,569
They're so generous with the toppings.

1597
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:04,238
She took such a huge bite.

1598
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:05,939
- Is it crispy? - It's good.

1599
01:30:06,069 --> 01:30:07,840
The dough is chewy and delicious.

1600
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,108
(MANNEQUEEN enjoys healing time with delicious food.)

1601
01:30:09,109 --> 01:30:10,109
It's really delicious.

1602
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:12,579
Now that we're full and feeling refreshed,

1603
01:30:12,609 --> 01:30:14,249
let's present what we've prepared.

1604
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,648
Let's reveal our Secret Santas.

1605
01:30:16,649 --> 01:30:18,750
(Gosh, I'm so nervous.)

1606
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,220
Please look forward to what gift I bought.

1607
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,090
I'm here to buy a gift for my Secret Santa.

1608
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,529
I want to get something a little cuter.

1609
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,259
I'll prepare a handwritten letter...

1610
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,930
to convey my feelings. I think that's a good idea.

1611
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,898
- Try to guess mine. - Cera's?

1612
01:30:33,899 --> 01:30:35,568
I didn't drop any hints at all.

1613
01:30:35,569 --> 01:30:36,639
- I think it's Buckey. - Ha Eun.

1614
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,776
- I really didn't drop hints. - Me.

1615
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,868
The reason I chose this gift...

1616
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:40,908
is that I was...

1617
01:30:40,909 --> 01:30:42,478
thinking of my friend.

1618
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:43,639
- Friend? - Friend?

1619
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,710
It must be me.

1620
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,210
My Secret Santa is my friend.

1621
01:30:47,649 --> 01:30:48,709
She's crying!

1622
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,019
(Already moved)

1623
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,479
It's Yoonji!

1624
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,948
I wanted to get her a pretty makeup pouch.

1625
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:56,220
Thank you.

1626
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,689
Thank you.

1627
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,129
This is my pouch now.

1628
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:00,590
Throw that out now.

1629
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,728
I like moving things over right away.

1630
01:31:02,729 --> 01:31:05,329
This is so nice. Thank you.

1631
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,429
She's putting on an act now.

1632
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:08,898
Ta Da!

1633
01:31:08,899 --> 01:31:10,500
(Waackxxxy's Secret Santa was Yoonji.)

1634
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,038
(Already getting teary)

1635
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:13,139
What is it?

1636
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,840
It's your favourite.

1637
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,408
(Impressed)

1638
01:31:17,409 --> 01:31:18,409
It's perfect.

1639
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:20,010
Doesn't this remind you of me, everyone?

1640
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,749
It's a hair mask.

1641
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,778
(She even gifted a hair mask to improve her hair.)

1642
01:31:22,779 --> 01:31:24,380
I'll have to use a lot of this.

1643
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,750
I'm the Secret Santa for Ha Eun,

1644
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:29,359
or Redlic, and I'm on my way to buy her gift right now.

1645
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,020
It's silver and has a heart.

1646
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:33,329
I think this one...

1647
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,289
suits Ha Eun well.

1648
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:37,129
(Crying)

1649
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:38,130
Gosh.

1650
01:31:38,131 --> 01:31:39,599
It's so cute.

1651
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,920
(It's so cute that I'm "Sadlic.")

1652
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,969
(Cutesy)

1653
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,439
That really suits you.

1654
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,170
- Thank you. - I was Secret Santa...

1655
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,739
- for Buckey. - Gosh!

1656
01:31:48,039 --> 01:31:49,509
Thank you.

1657
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:50,955
- I'm going to carry this around. - All right.

1658
01:31:50,979 --> 01:31:52,139
This is for the blue-loving Funky Y.

1659
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,148
(Buckey was Secret Santa for their leader, Funky Y.)

1660
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:55,749
Our eldest member got gifts for our leader.

1661
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,750
It's blue.

1662
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:57,919
Everything's blue.

1663
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,066
(An assortment of blue gifts for Funky Y)

1664
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,389
It's over now.

1665
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:01,919
- It's a blue envelope. - There's even a letter.

1666
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,788
- This is really moving. - Who's next?

1667
01:32:03,789 --> 01:32:04,920
Who did Funky Y have?

1668
01:32:04,989 --> 01:32:06,159
It was Cera.

1669
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:09,429
Something that's with Cera for 365 days out of a year.

1670
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:10,930
- A cell phone? - A scarf.

1671
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:13,130
Her clogs.

1672
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,299
Gosh.

1673
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:17,000
She's always wearing them. She wears them every day.

1674
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,039
Since it's the winter, I got her some fur ones.

1675
01:32:20,069 --> 01:32:22,170
(Decorating them to be Cera-style)

1676
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,909
Here's "queen,"

1677
01:32:24,409 --> 01:32:26,309
and a crown that lights up.

1678
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,779
(Exclaiming in delight)

1679
01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:30,979
I told you I wanted something that lights up!

1680
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,448
Try them on, quick.

1681
01:32:32,449 --> 01:32:34,148
Please look forward...

1682
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,920
to us together,

1683
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:38,019
- Black Swan and White Swan. - Black Swan and White Swan.

1684
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,358
Her handwriting is like a professor's.

1685
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:40,589
(Time to read the letters aloud)

1686
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,629
"From Ms. Funk, Secret Santa to Cera."

1687
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,898
("From Ms. Funk, Secret Santa to Cera.")

1688
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:46,728
- Just cry, since it's the end. - "Dear Cera,"

1689
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:49,670
"I'm glad I'm able to tell you how I really feel"...

1690
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,369
"as we prepare for our final performance."

1691
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,909
"Even though you don't stand out within our crew,"

1692
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:57,680
"you're the quietest and most reliable."

1693
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,709
"Your role was to support the team, Cera."

1694
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:02,078
"That was very precious,"

1695
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:04,479
"and I'm even more grateful you were able to do that, Cera."

1696
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:07,890
"I think it's such a blessing that I met you, Ha Eun."

1697
01:33:08,289 --> 01:33:09,420
- Yes. - That's right.

1698
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,988
"I can't express in words how precious you are to me."

1699
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,559
"We have a special relationship, you and I."

1700
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,658
"I'm grateful and happy"...

1701
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:17,335
"that you were there along my dance journey."

1702
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:18,829
"From Cera."

1703
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:23,770
"To one of the youngest members of MANNEQUEEN, our quokka,"

1704
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,939
"we first met when we were both students."

1705
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:31,239
"Now, I'm on TV with you and performing with you on stage."

1706
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,250
"I'm so happy to be here with you."

1707
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:35,949
"If you weren't part of MANNEQUEEN,"

1708
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:38,818
"I wouldn't have been able to endure until now,"

1709
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:40,520
"and I wouldn't have come this far."

1710
01:33:40,619 --> 01:33:42,520
"You went through a lot as the leader, right?"

1711
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:44,789
(Crying)

1712
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:48,089
"Thank you for always pointing us in the right direction gently."

1713
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:50,635
"Every time I see you doing that, I think you're so impressive."

1714
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:51,729
That's true.

1715
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,430
She's right.

1716
01:33:53,431 --> 01:33:56,239
"I believe this is just the start for us, for MANNEQUEEN."

1717
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,898
"I'm looking forward to where you lead us as our leader,"

1718
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:00,369
"and let's do well in the future."

1719
01:34:00,439 --> 01:34:01,509
(Love you, MANNEQUEEN!)

1720
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,039
You worked so hard.

1721
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:06,310
We experienced a lot of hardship and a lot of adversity,

1722
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:09,778
but it's because we went through all those things...

1723
01:34:09,779 --> 01:34:11,979
that we were able to get this far.

1724
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:14,219
With every episode that passes,

1725
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,788
we look happier and happier.

1726
01:34:17,789 --> 01:34:19,728
We were truly happy while we were dancing.

1727
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:23,599
Ending Credits for MANNEQUEEN...

1728
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,658
means a fresh start.

1729
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:28,799
In that case, we want to end...

1730
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,339
with our best performances, while we're having the most fun.

1731
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,908
Something that will show how MANNEQUEEN will move.

1732
01:34:32,909 --> 01:34:35,568
We will show everyone a grand, flashy performance.

1733
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:36,810
In 1, 2, 3.

1734
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:39,009
(MANNEQUEEN, let's win this!)

1735
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:40,510
Let's go!

1736
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,759
("Express" by The Beautiful People, "Show Me How You Burlesque")

1737
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:07,969
(This is a real show! A Vegas-style show that's hard to see in Korea)

1738
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,238
(A performance showing MANNEQUEEN's diverse styles of dance)

1739
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:11,919
(The end is another beginning! Curtains rise on MANNEQUEEN's show!)

1740
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:24,439
This was the Ending Credits performance for Queen of Queens,

1741
01:37:24,579 --> 01:37:27,609
MANNEQUEEN, who are strongest and brightest when on stage.

1742
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,919
As befitting a crew encompassing many genres,

1743
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,319
their colourful styles created a rich performance.

1744
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:38,220
They have gifted viewers with a happy and enjoyable ending party.

1745
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:39,930
Fight judge Shownu,

1746
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,100
what did you think of MANNEQUEEN's Ending Credits performance?

1747
01:37:45,329 --> 01:37:47,868
This performance showed what can happen...

1748
01:37:47,869 --> 01:37:50,840
when a crew with a diverse range of individual talents...

1749
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:55,568
and personalities can come together.

1750
01:37:55,569 --> 01:38:00,149
I think this performance was the epitome of that.

1751
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:03,750
I always tend to root for the ones who grow the most.

1752
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,549
I think MANNEQUEEN is the crew that grew the most...

1753
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:09,619
out of all four teams here.

1754
01:38:09,859 --> 01:38:11,220
Thank you for your hard work.

1755
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:14,260
Thank you for your kind words.

1756
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:18,760
MANNEQUEEN's leader Funky Y,

1757
01:38:19,529 --> 01:38:22,840
you've finally completed your last performance.

1758
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,539
How do you feel?

1759
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,340
I'm very happy.

1760
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:33,078
We got to finals with difficulty, so if we got to perform,

1761
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:35,180
we wanted to show a fun, energy-filled performance.

1762
01:38:36,949 --> 01:38:39,850
I'm not crying.

1763
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:43,520
We wanted to show a fun, energy-filled performance.

1764
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:47,630
It was an honour to give the ending performance of the show.

1765
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,528
The audience's support and cheer...

1766
01:38:50,529 --> 01:38:53,669
made our performance very fun.

1767
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:54,970
Thank you.

1768
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:01,568

For the live finals,

1799
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,109

(The special stages will begin now!)

1839
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:01,960
(What does Street Woman Fighter 2 mean to you?)

1840
01:46:02,029 --> 01:46:03,599
To me, Street Woman Fighter 2...

1841
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,629
is something that motivates me to live my life diligently.

1842
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:08,069
It's a new challenge...

1843
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:11,299
and a happy place.

1844
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:12,699
It's the second life.

1845
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:17,079
It's the last hope that made me shine once more.

1846
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:19,608
Street Woman Fighter 2 is...

1847
01:46:19,609 --> 01:46:23,818
a big turning point in my life.

1848
01:46:23,819 --> 01:46:27,219
It made me clearly see...

1849
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:30,019
who I was, how I danced,

1850
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,589
and what kind of dance I wanted to show.

1851
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:35,358
Once Street Woman Fighter 2 began airing,

1852
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:37,759
I felt like I had received recognition...

1853
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,769
as a dancer.

1854
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,129
I just love to dance.

1855
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:45,038
I think... That's kind of all I know.

1856
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:48,038
And I love seeing people's reactions.

1857
01:46:48,039 --> 01:46:51,239
All I want is to make people feel some type of way...

1858
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:52,778
through my movement...

1859
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:56,180
and through how they feel when they watch me perform.

1860
01:46:56,579 --> 01:46:58,978
Yes, that's I want. I just want to make people...

1861
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:01,350
feel some type of way when they watch me dance.

1862
01:47:01,649 --> 01:47:05,358
I didn't know there was such a big flame inside me.

1863
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:07,158
Being on Street Woman Fighter 2 made me think,

1864
01:47:07,159 --> 01:47:08,759
"This was how much I wanted to dance."

1865
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,499
"This was how much I wanted to avoid losing."

1866
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,770
"This was how much I wanted to grow through challenges."

1867
01:47:13,899 --> 01:47:17,000
I realized that through Street Woman Fighter 2.

1868
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:19,100
Through Street Woman Fighter 2,

1869
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:21,169
I gained the members.

1870
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:24,139
The teammates told each other, "We can do this."

1871
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,680
We consoled and supported each other.

1872
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:31,149
"We will do really well." When they gave me courage...

1873
01:47:31,449 --> 01:47:33,488
with confidence,

1874
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:36,919
I felt, "So this is how it feels to have someone by my side."

1875
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:40,029
Those moments made me feel that way.

1876
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,159
I didn't know...

1877
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:46,029
that I could dance so confidently before people.

1878
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:48,630
I proved that to myself.

1879
01:47:48,899 --> 01:47:50,738
It made me so happy.

1880
01:47:50,739 --> 01:47:55,038
My cool seniors and colleagues made me realize,

1881
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:57,709
"This is the mindset I should have when I dance."

1882
01:47:57,710 --> 01:48:00,309
"This is the mindset I should have toward dance."

1883
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:02,408
I learned how precious dance was.

1884
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:06,078
Also going against the stereotypes of, you know,

1885
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:07,349
dancers being...

1886
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:10,089
just the background people to the artist...

1887
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:13,459
and showcasing that, you know, on Street Woman Fighter 2...

1888
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:17,499
We are not only dancers. We are also the artists...

1889
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,759
and the main act. And...

1890
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,600
we can hold the stage ourselves on our own.

1891
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:27,738
I think the show made people see...

1892
01:48:27,739 --> 01:48:30,840
that dancers could have various charms and talents.

1893
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:36,680
(48 dancers united with their love for dance.)

1894
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,148
(As an artist and the main act, )

1895
01:48:39,149 --> 01:48:42,249
(the 48 dancers will shine even more in the future.)

1896
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:47,659
(Street Woman Fighter 2 will root for them.)

1897
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,300
Find the number one crew in the global dance scene.

1898
01:48:54,529 --> 01:48:56,430
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1899
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:00,539
All performances and live text votes came to an end.

1900
01:49:01,239 --> 01:49:03,710

01:51:40,699 --> 01:51:43,069
many emotions on Street Woman Fighter 2.

1942
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:45,939
Please tell us how it feels to place fourth.

1943
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:49,409
I am very happy.

1944
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,779
Until the finals...

1945
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,409
I won't cry.

1946
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:00,719
Until the finals, the team members stayed with me.

1947
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,489
I want to thank them and tell them that I love them.

1948
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,020
We love you.

1949
01:52:06,659 --> 01:52:09,728
I wondered when else we would receive...

1950
01:52:09,729 --> 01:52:11,728
so much love.

1951
01:52:11,729 --> 01:52:15,528
I want to thank the fans...

1952
01:52:15,529 --> 01:52:17,699
who love us a lot.

1953
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:21,939
As for our team,

1954
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:25,809
each member wants to say a word. Would it be okay to do that?

1955
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:27,479
- Yes! - Yes!

1956
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:29,409
All right.

1957
01:52:34,949 --> 01:52:35,949
Well...

1958
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,319
I won't cry.

1959
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:42,189
Firstly, I just want to say...

1960
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:46,399
Without this show, MANNEQUEEN wouldn't have existed.

1961
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:50,670
- That's a lie. - Thank you so much.

1962
01:52:50,899 --> 01:52:53,869
I can't stress that enough. Thank you.

1963
01:52:56,739 --> 01:53:00,749
Thank you so much.

1964
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:03,750
I am so happy that we placed fourth.

1965
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:06,519
I am so proud. I love the MANNEQUEEN members.

1966
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,050
Producers and writers, thank you so much.

1967
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:13,289
(Redlic, smile.)

1968
01:53:13,989 --> 01:53:15,060
Let's go.

1969
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:17,898
Come on.

1970
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:21,169
In the end, I cried on every single episode.

1971
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,999
Thank you so much.

1972
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,539
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1973
01:53:29,909 --> 01:53:31,909
All right. Firstly,

1974
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:36,778
I want to thank the audience members who came to root for MANNEQUEEN...

1975
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:39,879
despite the late hours.

1976
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:43,988
And holding the microphone is making me want to cry.

1977
01:53:43,989 --> 01:53:45,890
Thank you for everything.

1978
01:53:48,729 --> 01:53:51,029
I am going to show you who the queen is!

1979
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,029
Yes, you are the queen.

1980
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,469
I want to thank everyone.

1981
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:00,309
There is something personal I want to say.

1982
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:02,739
When Street Woman Fighter 1 aired,

1983
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:07,009
a close friend who was like a big sister to me got ill...

1984
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:08,409
and ended up passing.

1985
01:54:08,649 --> 01:54:11,648
She told me that she wanted me to appear on this show.

1986
01:54:11,649 --> 01:54:14,420
I wanted to invite her here.

1987
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:17,158
I think she gave me...

1988
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:21,329
these five members to take her place.

1989
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:25,559
To my cousin who went up to the sky,

1990
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,769
I became a proud sister.

1991
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,599
Again, I want to thank the crew members,

1992
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,140
judges, and production crew.

1993
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:39,379
MANNEQUEEN, thank you for your hard work.

1994
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:40,380
(MANNEQUEEN is the queen.)

1995
01:54:40,381 --> 01:54:43,779
I will now announce the crew that placed third.

1996
01:54:44,779 --> 01:54:45,879
The number three crew.

1997
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,788
With the explosive and energetic vibe,

1998
01:54:49,789 --> 01:54:52,459
this crew gave a strong performance for every mission...

1999
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,229
and awed people.

2000
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:57,560
Which crew placed third?

2001
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:11,010
The crew that placed third is...

2002
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:18,180
It's... Thank you for your hard work.

2003
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,979
It's 1MILLION.

2004
01:55:21,649 --> 01:55:25,789
(3rd place, 1MILLION)

2005
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:32,000
For the crew song performance vote,

2006
01:55:32,329 --> 01:55:35,898

2016
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,090
The leader of 1MILLION, Lia Kim.

2017
01:56:02,289 --> 01:56:03,828
Congratulations on placing third.

2018
01:56:03,829 --> 01:56:06,799
You must have felt many emotions throughout the challenges...

2019
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,100
you faced on Street Woman Fighter 2.

2020
01:56:09,369 --> 01:56:12,539
Please tell us how it feels to place third.

2021
01:56:14,069 --> 01:56:18,039
On this meaningful competition,

2022
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:22,948
we placed third. Members, thank you so much.

2023
01:56:22,949 --> 01:56:24,380
Thank you so much.

2024
01:56:26,619 --> 01:56:29,948
To be honest,

2025
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:33,619
I have danced mechanically...

2026
01:56:34,989 --> 01:56:39,499
for a long time in the past.

2027
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:42,229
I didn't know why I was dancing.

2028
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,568
I was lost in that regard...

2029
01:56:46,569 --> 01:56:49,269
for a long period of my life.

2030
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:54,079
But through the missions on Street Woman Fighter 2,

2031
01:56:54,409 --> 01:56:57,078
I got to know people...

2032
01:56:57,079 --> 01:56:59,380
who loved dancing so much.

2033
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:04,618
Witnessing the dancers' passion on the show...

2034
01:57:04,619 --> 01:57:06,760
inspired me a lot.

2035
01:57:06,989 --> 01:57:10,328
So I earned the strength...

2036
01:57:10,329 --> 01:57:13,929
to enjoy dancing once more.

2037
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:15,199
I am very thankful for that.

2038
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:18,568
Thanks to this cool show,

2039
01:57:18,569 --> 01:57:21,640
we received an opportunity...

2040
01:57:21,869 --> 01:57:24,839
to show our cool performances...

2041
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,209
and our cool sides.

2042
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:30,379
So I sincerely thank the production crew...

2043
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,350
behind this show.

2044
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,249
1MILLION...

2045
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:36,688
will continue to do cooler things...

2046
01:57:36,689 --> 01:57:38,419
in the future.

2047
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:41,989
This isn't the end. Through future endeavours,

2048
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:44,600
we will show who we are. Thank you.

2049
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:49,100
1MILLION, thank you for your hard work.

2050
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:51,300
Street Woman Fighter 2.

2051
01:57:51,369 --> 01:57:53,369
Now, only two candidates remain...

2052
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:55,010
for the final winner.

2053
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:56,939
They are BEBE...

2054
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,039
and JAM REPUBLIC.

2055
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:02,778
One of these two crews will become...

2056
01:58:02,779 --> 01:58:05,250
the final winner of Street Woman Fighter 2.

2057
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,449
With each mission, they showed...

2058
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,319
the best effort and performances.

2059
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:12,989
BEBE and JAM REPUBLIC had a fierce rivalry.

2060
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:15,959
Tonight, only one crew will seize...

2061
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,729
the trophy.

2062
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,459
Before announcing the result,

2063
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:21,068
I will reveal the difference...

2064
01:58:21,069 --> 01:58:23,000
between the two crews' live text votes.

2065
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:25,269
Between BEBE and JAM REPUBLIC,

2066
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:27,170
the difference in the live text votes...

2067
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:30,409
is 13,323 votes.

2068
01:58:31,979 --> 01:58:34,909
In the crew song performance vote,

2069
01:58:36,050 --> 01:58:37,079
BEBE placed second...

2070
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:39,479
and JAM REPUBLIC placed first.

2071
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:42,350
They had a neck-to-neck match.

2072
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,460
Bada of BEBE.

2073
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,729
How are you feeling?

2074
01:58:49,159 --> 01:58:52,260
All right. Firstly,

2075
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:59,139
it's thanks to the support of many people...

2076
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:05,278
who love BEBE that we had such a good result.

2077
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:08,379
So we wanted to show a good performance.

2078
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:09,408
Was it okay?

2079
01:59:09,409 --> 01:59:10,818
- Yes! - Yes!

2080
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:15,618
All right. Thank you for giving us this good result.

2081
01:59:15,619 --> 01:59:17,988
Thank you for voting diligently.

2082
01:59:17,989 --> 01:59:19,818
Please continue to root for us.

2083
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:20,960
Thank you.

2084
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:26,399
And Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC,

2085
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:27,899
how are you feeling?

2086
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,669
I feel very happy.

2087
01:59:35,670 --> 01:59:39,908
We, JAM REPUBLIC, had a really confident final show...

2088
01:59:39,909 --> 01:59:41,210
with our last piece.

2089
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:44,618
And win or lose, we are still winners.

2090
01:59:44,619 --> 01:59:47,850
And we came here wanting to give you a show.

2091
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:51,859
I hope you were inspired and loved our performance...

2092
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:54,358
because we really gave it our all. And...

2093
01:59:54,359 --> 01:59:56,259
thank you for all the loving supporters,

2094
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:58,760
the new supporters, our family and friends.

2095
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,600
Thank you.

2096
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,300
Kirsten is happy to be here.

2097
02:00:05,369 --> 02:00:07,809
Regardless of the result,

2098
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:10,880
she thinks it was a good experience because she received...

2099
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:13,180
inspirations from the dancers.

2100
02:00:13,539 --> 02:00:16,309
BEBE is led by Bada, the choreographer...

2101
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:18,949
who is the most loved by K-pop artists.

2102
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:21,920
It's a young-generation crew that captivated the Gen MZ.

2103
02:00:22,119 --> 02:00:25,390
In the Class Mission, they started the "Smoke" challenge craze.

2104
02:00:25,619 --> 02:00:27,729
By winning the K-pop Death match Mission...

2105
02:00:27,989 --> 02:00:30,430
and placing first in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

2106
02:00:30,529 --> 02:00:35,029
they finalized their spot in the finals before any other crew.

2107
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:36,929
JAM REPUBLIC is...

2108
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:40,170
a global crew with the best dancers from different countries.

2109
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,009
The leader, Kirsten is...

2110
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:46,078
a well-renowned dancer who has taught Justin Bieber,

2111
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:47,449
Rihanna, and Ciara.

2112
02:00:47,779 --> 02:00:49,948
Her participation in Street Woman Fighter 2...

2113
02:00:49,949 --> 02:00:51,750
became the talk of the town.

2114
02:00:51,819 --> 02:00:53,648
Their performance video of each mission...

2115
02:00:53,649 --> 02:00:55,949
received attention and love from around the world.

2116
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:59,420
They proved that they were the world-renowned crew.

2117
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:03,930

very anxious and nervous.

2137
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:32,778

Bada of BEBE.

2167
02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:24,019
- Yes. - Firstly,

2168
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:26,220
congratulations on winning.

2169
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:28,228
Please tell us how it feels to be...

2170
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:30,390

02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:32,699
Please say a few words.

2172
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:35,430
Firstly,

2173
02:05:39,239 --> 02:05:40,600
I prepared...

2174
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,909
an acceptance speech.

2175
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:48,250
But... Thank you.

2176
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:51,648
To be honest, I didn't write it as an acceptance speech.

2177
02:05:51,649 --> 02:05:54,420
I just wrote it for everyone I was thankful for.

2178
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,688
Yes.

2179
02:05:58,689 --> 02:06:02,689
So the moment we poured our everything into...

2180
02:06:03,159 --> 02:06:04,460
passed.

2181
02:06:04,529 --> 02:06:08,699
We are so thankful that we concluded the finals well.

2182
02:06:09,899 --> 02:06:12,698
To be honest, I never thought the end would come.

2183
02:06:12,699 --> 02:06:14,408
But the end came.

2184
02:06:14,409 --> 02:06:17,139
Participants of the eight crews...

2185
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:21,250

2186
02:06:21,949 --> 02:06:23,149
We love you.

2187
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:26,719
We also love the four crews that prepared...

2188
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:29,849
amazing performances for the finals.

2189
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:31,118
You worked so hard.

2190
02:06:31,119 --> 02:06:32,920
I am very proud of all the dancers.

2191
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,759
It was an honour.

2192
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,090
Thank you so much.

2193
02:06:37,699 --> 02:06:42,429
Looking back, every moment and every performance was precious.

2194
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:46,099
It was really an honour. Thank you.

2195
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:48,409
And the production crew,

2196
02:06:48,569 --> 02:06:51,210
thank you so much. Thank you.

2197
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:55,209
BEBE's mom and dad, Producer Da Yeon...

2198
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:58,920
and Writer Ji Young, are you watching this?

2199
02:06:59,319 --> 02:07:02,520
Thank you for taking care of the seven timid members...

2200
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:05,260
with a lot of worries until the end.

2201
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:09,959
Since you made this cool stage,

2202
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:12,099
we could dance in a cool way.

2203
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:16,269
Thanks to the production crew and the show,

2204
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:19,038
we are receiving so much love.

2205
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:22,639
We want to thank the production crew of Street Woman Fighter 2.

2206
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:23,739
Thank you.

2207
02:07:27,779 --> 02:07:29,979
Now comes the last part.

2208
02:07:30,979 --> 02:07:35,948
The ones who raised us to be cool, healthy, and cute women,

2209
02:07:35,949 --> 02:07:38,060
BEBE members' parents.

2210
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:41,430
Are you watching this?

2211
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:45,800
Are you watching this live? I hope you are recording this well.

2212
02:07:46,029 --> 02:07:47,359
Yes.

2213
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:50,568
We decided to star in Street Woman Fighter 2...

2214
02:07:50,569 --> 02:07:52,640
because we wanted to be the daughters...

2215
02:07:54,069 --> 02:07:56,210
our parents and families were proud of.

2216
02:07:59,539 --> 02:08:00,939
(BEBE, congratulations.)

2217
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:03,150
That was why we starred in the show.

2218
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:06,278
We could keep that promise.

2219
02:08:06,279 --> 02:08:09,750
For that, we are really grateful.

2220
02:08:09,989 --> 02:08:12,818
And lastly, there are...

2221
02:08:12,819 --> 02:08:17,059
so many fans who love Street Woman Fighter 2.

2222
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:20,759
Thank you for loving the crews.

2223
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,499
Thanks to everyone who roots for BEBE,

2224
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:26,568
we could dance well...

2225
02:08:26,569 --> 02:08:31,679
and win the trophy in the end.

2226
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:35,250
To be honest, I think all the crews are winners.

2227
02:08:35,479 --> 02:08:36,550
I agree.

2228
02:08:36,649 --> 02:08:39,148
I truly think that.

2229
02:08:39,149 --> 02:08:41,390
Thank you so much.

2230
02:08:41,489 --> 02:08:44,759
Babies, thank you for following the leader.

2231
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:46,119
Thank you so much.

2232
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:50,930
Can each member say a few words?

2233
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:52,600
- Yes! - Yes!

2234
02:08:56,029 --> 02:09:00,399
Ever since I began to dance, my family members...

2235
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:04,210
believed in me, rooted for me, and loved me. My mom...

2236
02:09:04,439 --> 02:09:07,179
and my late grandma,

2237
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:10,648
thank you so much. I love you guys.

2238
02:09:10,649 --> 02:09:11,879
I love you guys.

2239
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:13,380
(Victory, come on.)

2240
02:09:16,689 --> 02:09:19,859
All right. Firstly,

2241
02:09:21,229 --> 02:09:23,789
it was an honour...

2242
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:27,158
to meet and dance with the eight crews...

2243
02:09:27,159 --> 02:09:29,470
on Street Woman Fighter 2.

2244
02:09:29,630 --> 02:09:32,339
I want to thank my family members...

2245
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,510
who rooted for me and supported me.

2246
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:35,869
And...

2247
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:42,978
As the youngest member of BEBE,

2248
02:09:42,979 --> 02:09:46,449
I will work hard. Thank you.

2249
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:50,019
BEBE, thank you.

2250
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:53,590
Unfortunately, we will have to stop here due to time.

2251
02:09:53,989 --> 02:09:56,858

The leader of JAM REPUBLIC, Kirsten,

2266
02:10:32,829 --> 02:10:34,460
please say a few words.

2267
02:10:39,569 --> 02:10:42,538
First of all, I just want to say thank you.

2268
02:10:42,539 --> 02:10:44,908
This is not a loss. This is a win in our eyes.

2269

I want to first of all, say thank you...

2270
02:10:47,579 --> 02:10:51,649
all these amazing girls standing next to me.

2271
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:55,318
We wouldn't have JAM REPUBLIC if it weren't for them.

2272
02:10:55,319 --> 02:10:58,560
So first of all, I would like to thank Nick and Ricks...

2273
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,219
and JAM REPUBLIC's staff.

2274
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:03,288
I would like to thank JAM REPUBLIC's crew...

2275
02:11:03,289 --> 02:11:04,999
that has been on this journey...

2276
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,528
and all the staff members on Street Woman Fighter 2.

2277
02:11:07,529 --> 02:11:11,438
And again, our families, our supporters, our Jammies.

2278
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:13,198
We wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for you.

2279
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:15,069
Thank you for showing your love and support.

2280
02:11:15,239 --> 02:11:17,568
I hope you really felt something from us.

2281
02:11:17,569 --> 02:11:20,778
Because again, we didn't come here to win. We came here to show you...

2282
02:11:20,779 --> 02:11:22,778
what an international crew is all about.

2283
02:11:22,779 --> 02:11:24,919
I hope you take that and feel inspired by that.

2284
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:26,448

02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:39,999
JAM REPUBLIC, you worked hard until the end. Well done.

2290
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,898
And there are people who accompanied the eight crews on their journey...

2291
02:11:41,899 --> 02:11:45,339

The fight judges, Monika, Shownu, and Mike Song.

2293
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:52,738
You worked hard by watching all the missions and battles...

2294
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:54,539
and evaluating them.

2295
02:11:55,149 --> 02:11:56,880
We thank you sincerely.

2296
02:11:57,079 --> 02:12:00,019
Street Woman Fighter 2 ends here,

2297
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:02,349
but the passion and performances of the dancers who love to dance...

2298
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:04,050
aren't over yet.

2299
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,519

2303
02:12:11,859 --> 02:12:13,939
of the crews who commanded the Korean dance scene...

2304
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:15,828
and their unexpected daily life behind the stage,

2305
02:12:15,829 --> 02:12:17,969

It will be a national tour.

2316
02:12:42,229 --> 02:12:43,728
And with the craze of Street Woman Fighter 2,

2317
02:12:43,729 --> 02:12:45,698
the dance battle of the female teenage dancers...

2318
02:12:45,699 --> 02:12:46,828
around the world will begin.

2319
02:12:46,829 --> 02:12:49,328
Among the female teenage dancers who love to dance,

2320
02:12:49,329 --> 02:12:51,169
the world-class dancers who will continue on...

2321

the K-dance syndrome will be chosen.

2322
02:12:52,699 --> 02:12:54,839
Please look forward...

to "Street Dance Girls Fighter 2."

2324
02:12:58,609 --> 02:13:01,108
If JAM REPUBLIC doesn't win...

2325
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:02,180
I am sorry.

2326
02:13:02,779 --> 02:13:04,078
Next week,

2327
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:07,019

02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:25,300
came to an end with BEBE's victory.

2334
02:13:25,439 --> 02:13:27,438
So that there will be more stages...

2335
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:29,470
that let the dancers enjoy themselves and grow,

2336
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:32,379
so that dancers can shine on those stages,

2337
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:34,438
please give your continuous attention and support.

2338
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:36,809
This is where I say goodbye.

2339
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:39,719
I am Kang Daniel, the host of Street Woman Fighter 2.
