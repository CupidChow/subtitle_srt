1
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,189
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,065
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,128
(The final results of two missions...)

4
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,558
(for the six crews are revealed.)

5
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,299
We've been desperate,

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,898
so I think we can go to the Finals.

7
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,698
The competition is fiercer among lower ranks.

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,019
I just didn't want to place last.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,438
(The last Elimination Battle to decide the last finalist)

10
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,108
(Which 4 crews will advance to the Finals?)

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,140
(The winning crew's benefits)

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,109
(A 50,000-dollar prize)

13
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:48,889
(Diamond rings for the champions from amondz)

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,559
Two ways to take part...

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,990
in the voting for the crew song performance.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,258
Number one,

17
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,728
you can vote for the crew song performance...

18
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,229
on Mnet Plus' application or homepage.

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,298
Among eight crews who performed to their crew songs,

20
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,298
vote for the crew with the best performance.

21
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,399
Number two,

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,768
go to the official platform for Street Woman Fighter 2,

23
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,039
press Like on the video of the crew that you like...

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,239
and watch it until the end.

25
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,709
The crew song performance vote to determine the final winner...

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,979
will be counted until 6:00 p.m. on October 31,

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,019
the day of the Finals.

28
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,149
Today's result announcement...

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,188
will decide on the eliminated crew.

30
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,089
By adding the points from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,358
and the Battle Performance Mission,

32
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,598
the final rankings will be determined.

33
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,858
The number-one crew...

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,529
of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission is BEBE.

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,230
Number two is 1MILLION.

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,540
In third place is JAM REPUBLIC.

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,370
In fourth place is Wolf'Lo.

38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,268
In fifth place is LADYBOUNCE.

39
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,239
In sixth place is MANNEQUEEN.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,348
But this is not the end.

41
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,756
You still have the points from the Battle Performance Mission.

42
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,649
These points are big enough...

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,218
to change the final rankings.

44
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,890
It can change the rankings.

45
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,548
The Battle Performance Mission consists...

46
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,318
of points from the fight judges,

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,789
the live audience voting, and the online public evaluation.

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,958
The online public evaluation went on...

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,029
from the midnight of October 10 to the midnight of October 13.

50
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,269
The first placer of the online public evaluation...

51
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,509
gets 500 points, and the lower ranks 30 points less as it goes down.

52
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,309
The crew that had...

53
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,579
the most views in the Battle Performance Mission...

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,779
is JAM REPUBLIC.

55
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,908
(JAM REPUBLIC had the highest views.)

56
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,309
Oh, my gosh.

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,349
All kill.

58
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,379
They're out of our league.

59
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,258
At midnight on October 13, they got the most attention...

60
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,418
with 2,251,936 votes.

61
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,460
In three days.

62
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,960
The world-class superstars.

63
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,499
Thank you for all the support and all the views.

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,030
And all I could say is that we're very happy...

65
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,370
and shocked too, so...

66
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,930
thank you.

67
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,068
- They killed it. - Literally.

68
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,468
They nailed both missions.

69
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,469
I'm jealous.

70
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,478
On the other hand, this crew had the lowest views.

71
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,679
It was LADYBOUNCE.

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,809
(LADYBOUNCE had the lowest views.)

73
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,849
What? Again?

74
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,710
It's so upsetting.

75
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,478
(In the online public evaluation of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission)

76
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,019
(LADYBOUNCE had...)

77
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,120
(the lowest views.)

78
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,158
About the points earlier...

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,758
and the points from Battle Performance Mission,

80
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,728
I think we did really well.

81
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,598
- Yes! - You're right!

82
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,900
- Yes! - That's right.

83
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,829
We did it with confidence,

84
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,938
so we don't regret a thing. And we'll make sure...

85
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,840
to get the highest views one day.

86
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,908
Let's go.

87
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,240
Bounce to the top!

88
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,779
- You are crazy. - Let's go.

89
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,878
- Are you sure? - I'm sure.

90
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,609
- One day. - Now,

91
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,948
I will announce the final results of the Battle Performance Mission.

92
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,418
Oh, boy.

93
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,448
It's time.

94
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,549
It's the last one.

95
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,259
I want to go to the Finals.

96
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,628
Battle Performance Missions were...

97
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:41,990
BEBE versus Wolf'Lo,

98
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,929
LADYBOUNCE versus JAM REPUBLIC,

99
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,060
and 1MILLION versus MANNEQUEEN.

100
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,728
I will announce the live evaluation of each match-up,

101
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,568
which is the sum...

102
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,169
of the fight judge voting and the live audience voting.

103
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,769
(Battle Performance Mission, live evaluation)

104
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,179
In the live evaluation,

105
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,849
BEBE, LADYBOUNCE and 1MILLION are ahead.

106
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,149
You only have the online public evaluation left...

107
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,549
to determine the final rankings of the Battle Performance Mission.

108
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,089
Since you have a large amount of 500 points,

109
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,158
the final results can change at any given moment.

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,188
According to the final rankings from the total points...

111
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,458
of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission and Battle Performance Mission,

112
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,500
two crews will be eliminated.

113
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:21,999
(Sighing)

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,269
(Shaking her head)

115
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,239
The last place, sixth place, will be eliminated, for sure.

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,609
And fifth place will go straight to the Elimination Battle.

117
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,578
I will now announce...

118
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,508
the final rankings that will decide...

119
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,910
the fates of these six crews.

120
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,409
(Final Rankings)

121
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,550
Hang on.

122
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,049
Oh, no!

123
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,119
(I'd rather not watch.)

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,289
- This is the final one, right? - Yes.

125
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,160
Who do you think will rank higher between JAM REPUBLIC and us?

126
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,088
We did very well for the YouTube votes,

127
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,870
so, hopefully, that puts us through to winning the Finals.

128
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,899
I honestly can't tell.

129
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,799
The scores weren't that different earlier.

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,539
They were only 30-point differences.

131
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,069
I thought, "Could we catch up to Wolf'Lo?"

132
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,540
My goal was fifth place.

133
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,079
We couldn't afford to lose here.

134
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,609
Of the six crews, the first crew...

135
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,819
to secure a spot in the Finals with the highest points.

136
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,449
I will now announce the first-place crew.

137
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,889
In first place is...

138
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,449
Either BEBE or JAM REPUBLIC.

139
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,559
We had the extra points from the challenge,

140
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,629
so I was excited about it.

141
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,489
I think there's a lot of love,

142
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,799
and the views are through the roof.

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,959
So, I can only hope.

144
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,269
In first place is...

145
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,170
(Nervous)

146
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,069
BEBE.

147
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,268
(BEBE won the previous two missions.)

148
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,739
(BEBE is the first one to secure a spot in the Finals.)

149
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,839
BEBE.

150
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,579
(Moved)

151
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,750
Don't cry.

152
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,850
I couldn't believe my ears.

153
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,749
Congratulations.

154
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,549
(BEBE, 1,040 points)

155
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,050
(Amazed)

156
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,620
They got 1,040 out of 1,200 points.

157
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,930
They got a spot in the Finals.

158
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,399
BEBE has earned 470 points from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...

159
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,729
and 100 points from the live evaluation...

160
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,875
of the Battle Performance Mission.

161
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,469
With 1,515,025 views,

162
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,208
plus 168,974 likes,

163
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,768
and 92,056 votes,

164
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,078
you're 2nd in the public evaluation and get 470 points.

165
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,778
With a total of 1,040 points, you have been declared 1st place.

166
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,619
They must be so happy.

167
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,378
First, our goal...

168
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,758
when we appeared in this show was...

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,958
to get to the final round.

170
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,799
We're thankful to advance with such a high score.

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,099
We'll keep doing our best...

172
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,569
to take the championship trophy in the end.

173
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,028
How ambitious!

174
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,338
- Thank you! - Thank you!

175
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,870
(Congrats.)

176
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,970
I see.

177
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,509
I will now announce the second-place crew.

178
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,039
The second-place crew received a lot of public attention...

179
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,019
and had higher views than most in the Battle Performance Mission.

180
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,278
- It must be JAM REPUBLIC. - Yes.

181
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,449
I think it's 1MILLION.

182
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,865
1MILLION got a high score in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

183
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,259
as the crew was chosen by the public.

184
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,159
We have one of the important extra points,

185
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,259
so I think we have a shot at second place.

186
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,529
We're going to the Finals.

187
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,028
I think we have proven our popularity...

188
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,540
with both challenges, being the number-one viewed.

189
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,040
So, that gives me a lot of confidence.

190
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,838
The second-place crew has been decided...

191
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,338
based on the sum of the points from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...

192
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,578
and the Battle Performance Mission.

193
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,879
Please. Second place would be lovely.

194
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh, my gosh!

195
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,050
Second place is...

196
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,519
JAM REPUBLIC.

197
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,019
JAM REPUBLIC.

198
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,220
Yes.

199
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,620
JAM REPUBLIC.

200
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,689
(We agree.)

201
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,430
(Audrey is in her element.)

202
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,100
Audrey is so glad.

203
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,799
JAM REPUBLIC has earned 400 points in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

204
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,398
and 20 from the live evaluation of the Battle Performance Mission.

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,909
you have received 500 points from winning the public evaluation.

209
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,818
You have placed 2nd with a total of 920 points.

210
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,059
They won the public evaluation.

211
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,888
Obviously, we're going against so many great crews,

212
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,088
so we're extremely grateful to be in the top three.

213
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,398
And we are excited. Yes!

214
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,059
(She's so cute.)

215
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,369
- Well done, ladies. - Nice job.

216
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,529
That was great.

217
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,369
Up next is...

218
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,898
(Looking forward to it)

219
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,170
two crews tied in second place.

220
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,810
Two crews tied in second place.

221
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,578
- Wait. What? - It's a tie.

222
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,680
There's a tie?

223
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,180
The crew that's tied in second place with JAM REPUBLIC is...

224
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,579
1MILLION.

225
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,518
(2nd place, 1MILLION, 920 points)

226
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,720
1MILLION.

227
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,589
Thank you.

228
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,090
(Relieved)

229
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,789
You could have told us our ranking first!

230
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,158
(Congratulations.)

231
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,928
- How do they have the same points? - I know, right?

232
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:49,069
1MILLION has earned 440 points from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

233
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,499

237

you have earned 410 points from placing in the public evaluation.

238
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,820
You're tied in 2nd place with a total of 920 points.

239
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,249
We received a lot of love from the public,

240
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,888
which was why we could place so high.

241
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,360
We'll keep doing our best in the future.

242
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,860
Good luck.

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,799
Now it's our fight.

244
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,399
This will be neck-and-neck.

245
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,000
Fourth to sixth places are so fierce.

246
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,199
The crews that haven't been named yet are...

247
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Wolf'Lo, LADYBOUNCE, and MANNEQUEEN.

248
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,669
The 6th placer of these 3 crews...

249
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,979
is eliminated instantly...

250
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,309
and will be asked to leave the fight club tonight.

251
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:37,149
We let go of all our worries when we came here,

252
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,179
but I'll have some hope.

253
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,519
As you can see,

254
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,159
we're here, ready for the Elimination Battle.

255
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,429
I'm convinced that I can humbly accept the result.

256
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,729
We want the battle.

257
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,298
We badly want it.

258
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,299
(Right, guys?)

259
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,830
I badly do!

260
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,200
So scary.

261
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,599
The sixth-place crew to sadly leave...

262
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
the competition before the last hurdle...

263
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,269
to the Finals is...

264
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,015
They're announcing sixth place first.

265
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,649
The sixth placer will be eliminated...

266
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,210
without the Elimination Battle.

267
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,378
We're going to find out now?

268
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,148
There's no way. Who would go?

269
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,320
Sixth place is...

270
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,590
Oh, no.

271
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,518
I hoped we hadn't placed sixth.

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,359
I badly wanted to be in the Elimination Battle.

273
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,829
If we can dance until the last moment,

274
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,059
we'll do our best.

275
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,029
Please give us one last chance.

276
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,129
Give us one last chance.

277
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,889
The last place, sixth place, is...

278
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,500
I want to have a battle.

279
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,470
(What is their fate?)

280
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,839
Wolf'Lo.

281
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,908
(Wolf'Lo placed 6th in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...)

282
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,255
(and the Battle Performance Mission.)

283
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,309
(Final ranking, 6th place: Wolf'Lo, 660 points)

284
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,549
We got 660 points.

285
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,320
- Good work, girls. - Great job.

286
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,349
You guys were amazing!

287
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,658
- We love you, Wolf'Lo. - We love you, Wolf'Lo!

288
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:52,990
I'm crying.

289
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,558
You were the best!

290
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,859
- Well done. - Good work.

291
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,329
Wolf'Lo has earned 310 points in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

292
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,069
zero points from the live audience in the Battle Performance Mission,

293
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,099
views of 669,549,

294
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,369
plus 72,329 likes,

295
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,109
and 37,437 votes. You placed 6th in the global public evaluation.

296
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,408
You have earned 660 points in total and placed 6th.

297
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,209
(Wolf'Lo, a total of 660 points, 6th place)

298
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,579
They lost so many points in the Battle Performance Mission.

299
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,220
I feel so bad.

300
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,919
Well done.

301
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,518
Wolf'Lo has prepared for the best and given the best performance.

302
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,990
Its leader, Halo,

303
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,360
please say a few words for the last time.

304
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,000
(Choking up)

305
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,529
I wasn't going to cry today,

306
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,740
but I can't help it.

307
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,840
I guess we did our best.

308
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,370
Of course, you did.

309
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,940
We did our best.

310
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,450
On Street Woman Fighter 2,

311
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:52,249
I wondered how I became the leader...

312
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,620
among all my teammates.

313
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:55,419
And it turned out...

314
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,289
that all I had was the trust I had for them.

315
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,960
Based on our trust, we were able to make this far.

316
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,798
I'll keep doing my best...

317
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,569
with my teammates...

318
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,038
in the street dance world...

319
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,669
and in many other worlds.

320
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,869
- Thank you. - We love you so much!

321
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,939
Thank you!

322
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,549
- We love you! - We love you.

323
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,279
(Crying Haechi Wang)

324
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:25,549
(Shocked)

325
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,850
She's never cried here!

326
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,220
- Seriously. - She cries today.

327
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,518
She's pretty even when she cries.

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,860
Don't cry, doctor.

329
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,230
I appreciate all the crews for competing with us.

330
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,959
(Touched)

331
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,569
It's actually absurd that I get to dance with such veterans...

332
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,539
on the same team.

333
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,609
Since the moment I started dancing hip-hop,

334
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,049
they've been playing the main roles in the industry.

335
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,219
They paved the way for me,

336
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,919
and it allowed me to grow slowly.

337
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,519
I deeply want to thank the senior dancers.

338
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,200
(Lia is moved by all the old memories.)

339
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,729
I've actually been dancing only for myself...

340
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,070
since I started dancing hip-hop.

341
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,569
I had been focusing...

342
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,109
on my growth and achievements, and I was proud of them too.

343
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,409
But from here,

344
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,908
I learned the value of dancing...

345
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:29,178
for the public.

346
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,018
The effort you put into the dance to show other people...

347
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,119
and the joy you get from it. I learned a huge deal of it,

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,719
so a lot of you here were...

349
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,518
like my teachers.

350
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,559
I want to thank every one of you.

351
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,759
(You're amazing.)

352
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,128
(Chocol's fans until the last day)

353
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,799
I want to say this.

354
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Wolf'Lo...

355
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,638
has always placed low...

356
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,768
(Choking up)

357
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,440
- She was upset. - No, I wasn't!

358
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,709
We've always placed low...

359
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,179
and barely made it out of Elimination Battles,

360
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,149
but we all know that we're good dancers.

361
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,349
Of course, we do!

362
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,219
You bet you are.

363
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,589
Of course.

364
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,518
We respect and love hip-hop,

365
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,229
but we came to respect...

366
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,759
all of you, thanks to this show. Thank you.

367
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,460
Great job.

368
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,069
(Capri's respect)

369
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,298
It occurred to me that it was a good choice...

370
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:27,570
to decide to come here and take on the challenge.

371
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,870
I learned a lot from your dancing.

372
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,980
Until I'm 50 or 60 years old,

373
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,009
She's so cool.

374
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,678
I want to keep growing...

375
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,048
and do my best to dance as long as I can.

376
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,220
Thank you for everything.

377
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,159
I'd like to say one more thing. It's nothing much, though.

378
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,459
We had a lot of audiences...

379
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,128
in our two Elimination Battles.

380
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:56,230
So, we were able to enjoy them with the people's cheers.

381
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,539
But we don't have that today, right?

382
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,740
I hope you can cheer for the two crews in the battle.

383
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,808
- Let's go! - Good luck!

384
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,579
- You've got this! - Good luck!

385
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,679
All members of Wolf'Lo, great job so far.

386
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,288
Wolf'Lo will...

387
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,418
- now leave the fight club. - No!

388
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,518
- Thank you for your work. - Thank you!

389
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,018
Great work.

390
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,888
Don't miss us too much.

391
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:22,960
Thank you.

392
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,799
- Good luck. Don't get hurt. - We'll see you.

393
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,330
You're all smaller than me.

394
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,230
You're like Bada.

395
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,569
- So inspirational. Seriously. - Yes.

396
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,239
- Your movement is incredible. - Thank you.

397
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,168
I love your freestyle dance.

398
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,808
I love your freestyle dance.

399
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,980
Your choreo is so creative.

400
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,808
So creative. It's wonderful.

401
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,649
Thank you.

402
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,950
- Give me a hug too. - Get in here.

403
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,619
When the show started,

404
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,759
we came here wanting to prove ourselves.

405
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,558
What's hip-hop's appeal?

406
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,959
How free it is. Freedom.

407
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,589
- I just think it's cool. - Me too.

408
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,929
Hip-hop is the coolest.

409
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,729
(When Wolf'Lo got its crew song in May 2023)

410
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,128
This is a song just for us.

411
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,870
It's insane.

412
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,408
(The first shoot of Street Woman Fighter 2)

413
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,169
Are we the only street dancers?

414
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,979
In the first battle,

415
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,450
our crew won first place, right?

416
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,949
We thought,

417
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,019
"We can keep this up, and we'll win."

418
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,719
(The memory of winning the first mission)

419
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,158
When it actually began,

420
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,959
it was a fight against ourselves.

421
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,089
We had to dance the genres that we weren't familiar with.

422
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,158
(Wolf'Lo needed more effort than others.)

423
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,329
It must have been her first time shaking her bottom.

424
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,029
I bet it's taking a toll on her.

425
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,798
There were moments where I had to create...

426
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,940
something to a song that I would never have chosen.

427
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,768
(So, the members put more time and work into it.)

428
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,879
We reckoned that it'd be better to accept that we weren't the best.

429
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:49,080
There were many obstacles to overcome.

430
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,878
We've been dancing freestyle and in dance-offs for ten years,

431
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,018
but they were the ones who defined choreographies.

432
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,418
So, we had to take on new challenges every time.

433
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,389
We had a lot of fun along the way,

434
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,229
and we tried to be closer to the public.

435
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,129
I enjoyed every moment of it.

436
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,369
It's so fun.

437
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,699
(The members of Wolf'Lo were happy to practice dancing every day.)

438
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,909
As we worked hard,

439
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,008
we realized that what we were doing was the style of Wolf'Lo.

440
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,449
So, we needed some time.

441
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,518
We learned more, worked harder, and challenged ourselves.

442
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,490
We came to create them through this show's missions.

443
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,919
We're going to keep trying,

444
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,119
so we're not that sad.

445
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,200
For working harder than me every time,

446
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,729
thank you.

447
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,268
You did such great work.

448
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,130
It must have been tough for her as the leader.

449
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,470
No, we all had it rough.

450
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,440
We were all leaders.

451
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,109
That's probably why it was harder.

452
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,278
(It's not touching anymore.)

453
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,608
We have too many leaders.

454
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,150
Your lashes came off.

455
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,249
- Are you serious? - It's for YouTube Shorts.

456
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,490
Oh, come on.

457
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,659
This will be our last chant in the hideout.

458
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,359
I don't want to go!

459
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,690
- Don't send us away! - Use your feet, then.

460
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,699
In 1, 2, 3.

461
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,930
- Wolf! - Wolf!

462
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,230
Don't put it on our name.

463
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,170
Bye, Wolf'Lo's hideout!

464
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,339
- It's sunny when it's raining. - There's the sun.

465
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,008
- The weather's nice. - It's so nice.

466
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,809
(We hope for Wolf'Lo's bright days ahead.)

467
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,979
Wolf'Lo has been eliminated,

468
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,278
and the remaining crews are LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN.

469
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,048
And of the two crews, the fifth-place crew...

470
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,190
will go straight to the Elimination Battle.

471
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,789
What? If the 5th-place crew goes, what about the 4th-place crew?

472
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,630
So, 4th and 5th places aren't having the Elimination Battle?

473
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,029
Or they changed the rules, so we're also candidates.

474
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:50,828
I'm scared.

475
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,200
NOB of LADYBOUNCE.

476
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,669
If your ranking doesn't change from fifth place,

477
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,109
you will go straight to the Elimination Battle.

478
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,779
How do you feel right now?

479
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,450
First off, I'm grateful that we at least get an Elimination Battle.

480
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm confident that I can humbly accept whatever the result is.

481
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,749
Funky Y of MANNEQUEEN.

482
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,618
In Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

483
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,689
you placed sixth,

484
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,528
but you managed to increase your ranking.

485
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,588
What's your expected ranking?

486
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,768
Whatever the result is, I believe that we can...

487
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:25,569
participate in the battle with everything we've got.

488
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,539
Between LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN,

489
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,970
the fifth-place crew to go to the Elimination Battle is...

490
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,949
MANNEQUEEN.

491
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,519
(MANNEQUEEN placed 5th.)

492
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,278
(The dancers are surprised by the unexpected result.)

493
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,450
What?

494
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,149
MANNEQUEEN has earned 250 points...

495
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,788
from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

496
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,629
thirty points from the live audience in the Battle Performance Mission,

497
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,028
views of 771,338,

498
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,868
plus 87,722 likes,

499
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,229
and 44,435 votes.

500
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,038
You placed 3rd in the global public evaluation and earned 440 points.

501
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,970
You placed 5th with a total of 720 points.

502
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,939
Funky Y of MANNEQUEEN,

503
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,380
you will go to the Elimination Battle.

504
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,849
How do you feel?

505
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,979
MANNEQUEEN's goal today...

506
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,489
was to show everyone a memorable battle even if we get eliminated.

507
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,650
So we will do our best in preparing for the battle.

508
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,089
This puts LADYBOUCE in fourth place.

509
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,159
LADYBOUNCE received 280 points from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

510
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,729
eighty points from the live audience in the Battle Performance Mission,

511
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,169
views of 648,786,

512
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,568
plus 90,382 likes,

513
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,479
and 21,573 votes.

514
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,909
You placed 5th in the global public evaluation and earned 380 points.

515
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,349
It adds up to a total of 740 points, putting you in 4th place.

516
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,419
(Final Results)

517
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
However,

518
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,159
LADYBOUNCE in fourth place...

519
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,159
will not go straight to the Elimination Battle.

520
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,189
- What? - What?

521
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,389
Will not go straight to the Elimination Battle.

522
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,759
- What? - What?

523
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,729
- Then who will they battle with? - I don't know.

524
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,900
The rule must have changed.

525
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,798
Maybe there is another mission.

526
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,338
That means we haven't secured our spot in the Finals?

527
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,008
No, we need to do another mission.

528
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,739
Which crew will compete...

529
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,339
with fifth place MANNEQUEEN in the Elimination Battle?

530
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,910
The crew to be in the Elimination Battle...

531
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,348
(Nervous)

532
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:21,949
will be selected by BEBE in first place.

533
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,949
Will be selected by BEBE in first place.

534
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,018
- What? - Gosh.

535
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,019
Selected by BEBE.

536
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,459
(Everyone is shocked.)

537
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,559
What?

538
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,328
So JAM REPUBLIC,

539
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,459
1MILLION, and LADYBOUNCE...

540
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,199
have become elimination candidates.

541
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,899
First place has the power.

542
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
It's a benefit.

543
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,268
I got goosebumps.

544
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,469
I was shocked. I'm not going to lie.

545
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,239
So many thoughts were going through my head.

546
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,879
Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC,

547
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,048
despite the fact that you won second place,

548
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,078
you may not be able to go to the Finals.

549
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,950
I feel very confused right now.

550
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,159
We can only hope and pray...

551
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,629
that it's not us and we pray it's not us.

552
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,129
If we to be in the Elimination Battle,

553
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,528
we will do our very best...

554
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,900
to make sure to go to the Finals.

555
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,868
We were preparing ourselves, since we thought it'd be us.

556
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,669
Whatever the choice or result,

557
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,538
we will get through it well.

558
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,639
The elimination candidates to battle with fifth place MANNEQUEEN...

559
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,548
are JAM REPUBLIC, 1MILLION, and LADYBOUNCE.

560
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,149
Out of the three crews,

561
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,048
which will compete with MANNEQUEEN in the Elimination Battle?

562
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:30,519
Please make a decision after discussing it thoroughly, BEBE.

563
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,789
What should we do?

564
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,689
I knew it. We can't assume anything.

565
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,358
You're right. This is a survival show.

566
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:40,258
This is unbelievable.

567
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,399
Honestly, I think strategically,

568
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,439
she'd try to get rid of us.

569
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,869
Or it's 1MILLION.

570
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,739
- I have two ideas. - Me too.

571
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,808
- Me too. - What are they?

572
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,179
Either we let nature take its course...

573
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,450
or try to eliminate one of the better crews.

574
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:00,220
- That could be smarter. - Yes, in the long run.

575
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,150
They will have to battle against MANNEQUEEN.

576
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,018
- They are good at battling. - They're good at battling.

577
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,318
Yes, they're good at battling.

578
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,729
Since we have to battle, let's try hard.

579
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,130
Let's do our best.

580
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,959
BEBE, have you made a decision?

581
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,328
Yes, we have.

582
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,630
I'm so nervous.

583
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,729
Which crew will BEBE choose...

584
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,170
for the Elimination Battle?

585
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,108
We chose...

586
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,609
I really hope Bada doesn't pick us.

587
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,109
I'm more nervous than earlier.

588
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,150
I have no idea who it'll be.

589
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,480
(Which crew does BEBE pick?)

590
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,848
Which crew will BEBE choose...

591
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,359
for the Elimination Battle?

592
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,159
We choose...

593
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm nervous.

594
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,729
I don't want to be chosen. Can I hope for that?

595
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,129
Don't say, "1MILLION."

596
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,829
This is driving me crazy.

597
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,799
A part of me believed in Bada.

598
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,469
(Please.)

599
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,710
(Which crew does BEBE pick?)

600
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,139
As today's final results showed,

601
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,079
we will have LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN battle.

602
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,449
That's such a relief.

603
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,519
Lia.

604
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,249
I think it's better and fair...

605
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,459
to respect the rankings and pick accordingly.

606
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,889
Those in second place...

607
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,559
tried hard to make it that far.

608
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,359
Okay. We all agree, right?

609
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,298
BEBE, 1MILLION, and JAM REPUBLIC...

610
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,139
will go to the live finals.

611
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,039
- I'm relieved. - Tears of relief?

612
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,670
My gosh.

613
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,180
My blood is still trying to get back to moving.

614
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,308
LADYBOUNCE has been chosen...

615
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,979
to battle MANNEQUEEN in the Elimination Battle.

616
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,318
The new rule...

617
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,118
gave us a little bit of hope...

618
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,088
that we might not have to battle.

619
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,389
It kind of feels like false hope,

620
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,889
but we get to show you a performance we worked hard to prepare.

621
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,929
- It's good. - We'll do our best.

622
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,059
Good luck, MANNEQUEEN.

623
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,460
- Good luck. - Good luck.

624
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,358
I really like LADYBOUNCE.

625
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,268
I hope it will be an impressive battle.

626
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:58,029
I will kill this battle today.

627
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,868
(We plan to do the same.)

628
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,608
(Kill it and toss it)

629
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:04,768
There is only one spot left on the list...

630
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,139
for the live finals.

631
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,709
Which crew will win...

632
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,048
the last survival ticket...

633
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,578
in this battle between LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN?

634
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,278
LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN,

635
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,288
please get ready for the last Elimination Battle...

636
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,690
to win your spot in the live finals.

637
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:20,919
(Elimination Battle, LADYBOUNCE versus MANNEQUEEN)

638
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,129
I think it's a relief we were at least fifth place.

639
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,729
I'd like to be in the Elimination Battle.

640
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,730
(In total agreement)

641
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,230
- We're going to do our best. - Of course.

642
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,068
We will win today...

643
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,469
and go to the Finals.

644
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,368
We will show you...

645
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:36,809
why MANNEQUEEN is the best in battling.

646
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:40,278
I can predict what MANNEQUEEN will do.

647
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,078
We just have to refrain from getting upset...

648
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,209
and enjoy ourselves.

649
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,548
I think it will be fun.

650
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:47,048
I really wanted to battle.

651
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,889
We wanted to be in the spotlight, and we will.

652
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,118
We will think of this as the last battle...

653
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,588
and give it everything we have.

654
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:55,229
Let's just do a good job...

655
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,636
at doing what we've prepared so far and have been doing.

656
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,328
I look forward to this.

657
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,858
Both teams never lost in a battle.

658
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,098
- That's right. - I can't wait to see this.

659
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,599
I expect them both to be determined.

660
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,209
I'm curious what kind of energy they will give off.

661
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,410
It'll be a good battle, interesting to watch.

662
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,479
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

663
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,649
(Elimination Battle)

664
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,078
We will now begin...

665
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,578
the Elimination Battle...

666
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,348
for a spot in the live finals.

667
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,758
Let's go.

668
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,759
Let's go.

669
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,118
(Monika, Honey J, Trix)

670
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,588
This is the last Elimination Battle.

671
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,229
They must be nervous because it's so empty.

672
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,828
Let's have LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN, that will battle...

673
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:37,845
in the final Elimination Battle come up to the stage.

674
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:40,868
(MANNEQUEEN enters first as the crowd cheers.)

675
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,838
- MANNEQUEEN is here. - Let's go.

676
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,639
- Let's go. - Let's go.

677
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,809
Queen of queens!

678
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Let's go!

679
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,048
Hey!

680
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,079
LADYBOUNCE!

681
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,749
- LADYBOUNCE. - LADYBOUNCE.

682
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,449
I love their outfits.

683
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,489
They look like warriors.

684
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,189
So hot.

685
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,219
They look so pretty.

686
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,229
I don't know what to think.

687
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,489
They look so different.

688
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,429
LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN came this far...

689
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,328
proving the skills of their crews.

690
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,868
However, 1 of the 2 crews...

691
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,569
will have to leave Street Woman Fighter 2 today.

692
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,590
Those who are smiling are the winners. So smile.

693
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,868
I believe in us. 1, 2, 3.

694
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,909
- Let's go. - Let's go.

695
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,979
One, two, three.

696
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,079
- I love you. - I love you.

697
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,679
LADYBOUNCE and MANNEQUEEN,

698
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,778
step up to the fight zone.

699
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,649
- LADYBOUNCE. - MANNEQUEEN.

700
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,019
- Good luck. - Let's go.

701
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,689
The Elimination Battle is 4 out of 7.

702
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,858
If anyone wins 4 rounds out of the 7,

703
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,959
the battle win end immediately.

704
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,399
I believe the important point...

705
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,199
will be how LADYBOUNCE performs in the 1 on 1 and 2 on 2 battles.

706
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,470
MANNEQUEEN is a crew of battlers.

707
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,298
They must be so nervous.

708
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,568
MANNEQUEEN is a tough opponent.

709
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:52,338
But when LADYBOUNCE faces a tough opponent,

710
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,979
we experience an awakening.

711
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,048
(That's so cool.)

712
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,108
We promise to show you a crazy performance, a crazy stage.

713
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,318
I believe in myself and my crew.

714
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,518
I know we can do this.

715
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,588
(That's so cool.)

716
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:05,189
Believe in myself and my crew.

717
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,788
This is the last battle to go to the Finals.

718
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,959
So we worked very hard to prepare for this.

719
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,999
We'll have fun as we battle...

720
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,630
LADYBOUNCE, whom we really like.

721
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,098
- Let's go. - Good luck.

722
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,068
Street Woman Fighter 2.

723
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,139
We will start the Elimination Battle.

724
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,910
Round One is a Hidden Battle.

725
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,568
(Round 1, Hidden Battle, LADYBOUNCE versus MANNEQUEEN)

726
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,209
The Hidden Battle is free routine battle...

727
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,980
with no limits in props, songs, or number of members dancing.

728
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,579
Good luck! Seriously!

729
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,989
LADYBOUNCE will go first.

730
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,489
MANNEQUEEN will go next.

731
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,989
(1st: LADYBOUNCE, 2nd: MANNEQUEEN)

732
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,419
It's a Hidden Battle.

733
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,490
What props are they using?

734
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,130
Get ready to battle.

735
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,289
Here come our props.

736
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,328
(Gasping)

737
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,660
My gosh.

738
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
That's strange.

739
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,529
- What is it? - What is that?

740
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
It's a structure.

741
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,439
It's a structure.

742
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,609
- It really is. - It's a structure.

743
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,739
(Confused)

744
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,409
Something huge was brought onto the stage.

745
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,515
I was wondering what it was.

746
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,549
Did they make that?

747
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:06,919
We made it out of an iron structure.

748
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,919
It was finished two hours ago.

749
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,618
We wanted to use it in the Finals,

750
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,859
but if we save it for later, we might end up wasting it.

751
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,559
It's impressive...

752
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,829
that they brought that for 40 seconds.

753
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,130
I would've done the same...

754
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,829
since I didn't want to go home.

755
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,199
(Glancing at MANNEQUEEN)

756
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,029
They're so different from us.

757
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,740
Let's stay focused.

758
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,169
(MANNEQUEEN prepared bright-coloured fans.)

759
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,839
They brought fans.

760
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,440
I could see they were prepared.

761
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,480
Don't worry about them.

762
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,048
They came prepared.

763
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,609
They must be seriously determined.

764
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,778
I'm so nervous.

765
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,920
Me too.

766
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,518
Survival or elimination.

767
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,419
This is for the last ticket to the live finals.

768
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,690
It's the battle you have to win to survive.

769
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:48,059
Are you ready?

770
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,690
- Fight. - Let's go to the Finals!

771
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,559
It was a shooting game performance.

772
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,200
Do they mean to shoot and kill us?

773
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,299
There is a popular shooting game.

774
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:01,269
It has a well-known BGM.

775
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,169
They must own the copyrights,

776
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,108
so we even personally got permission...

777
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,009
from the large company.

778
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,379
We need to win this round to stand a chance,

779
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,579
so we were determined to win this round.

780
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,150
I spotted the enemy.

781
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,618
(Us?)

782
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,990
(Commence attack!)

783
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,839
(It draws their attention.)

784
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,930
This is cool.

785
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,710
The balloon didn't pop.

786
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,339
I tried everything I could to pop the balloon,

787
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,480
but failed.

788
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,529
(This is LADYBOUNCE.)

789
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,368
(MANNEQUEEN)

790
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,008
(We'll end you.)

791
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,039
One.

792
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,239
(That's so witty.)

793
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,839
Gosh.

794
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,179
Two, one.

795
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,909
They tried so hard to show us their skills,

796
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,079
but I wasn't fazed.

797
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,778
Switch.

798
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,720
- MANNEQUEEN. - Here they come.

799
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,249
- Let's go. - Let's go.

800
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,259
Watch us.

801
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,088
Watch closely. This is how you use props.

802
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,559
Let's go.

803
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,960
(They steal the spotlight.)

804
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:37,930
(In love)

805
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,640
That's pretty.

806
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,490
- This is insane. - So pretty.

807
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
(They heat up the stage.)

808
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,140
She dropped it.

809
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,309
(Watching closely)

810
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,939
(Redlic and Funky Y drop the fans.)

811
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,740
Pull yourself together.

812
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,149
(That's right. Finish it.)

813
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,109
Five, four,

814
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:26,079
three, two, one.

815
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,480
Battle set.

816
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,989
That was so cool.

817
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,618
That was...

818
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,919
- so quick. Right? - Was it 40 seconds?

819
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,059
I was dancing along.

820
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,259
It takes 40 seconds to heat a stick of fishcake.

821
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,828
They completed all that in the same amount of time.

822
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:40,999
The charm was totally different.

823
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,430
They're so different.

824
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,299
(Marvelling)

825
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,900
I don't know what to do.

826
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,640
Let's check the result of the battle right away.

827
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,170
I really want to win.

828
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,140
Weren't we overwhelming?

829
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,779
Fight judges, open your cards.

830
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,380
Three, two, one.

831
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,619
(Which crew won Round 1?)

832
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,250
(LADYBOUNCE 1:2 MANNEQUEEN)

833
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,919
(Surprised)

834
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,719
In Round One,

835
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,329
MANNEQUEEN won 2 to 1.

836
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,129
(Elimination Battle)

837
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,500
Honey J, what did you think about the two crews' battle?

838
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,429
First of all, I only realized after the battle was over...

839
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,139
that I had to decide who would win.

840
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,039
I was immersed in the performance.

841
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:25,709
LADYBOUNCE had separate parts where they used their props...

842
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,980
and where they danced.

843
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,079
MANNEQUEEN made the props part of their dance.

844
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,519
It had a smooth flow.

845
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,380
Since it was a battle,

846
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:38,549
I chose the crew with more energy.

847
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,619
I believe your skills show...

848
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,659
from the moment you choose which prop to use.

849
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,529
I thought LADYBOUNCE's structure...

850
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,359
was unique, which is a plus.

851
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,899
However, you could also wonder...

852
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,970
why you had to use that.

853
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,639
Why did you put two frames together...

854
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,969
in a "V" when you're shooting?

855
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,609
I was curious,

856
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,209
but never found out.

857
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,809
I didn't understand it...

858
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,150
although I liked the concept of shooting.

859
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,950
In the case of MANNEQUEEN,

860
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,419
anyone could tell they were depicting flames.

861
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,388
They chose something easy to understand.

862
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,888
It could've been easy and predictable,

863
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,590
but it wasn't predictable.

864
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,759
Even in the quality of the performance,

865
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,259
MANNEQUEEN, who chose props that could blend in with them,

866
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,729
put on a cleaner performance.

867
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,360
That's why I voted for MANNEQUEEN.

868
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,969
We were overly greedy.

869
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,299
I was so sad...

870
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,069
that we let them get their first win...

871
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,790
in a performance battle, not a solo battle.

872
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,009
(Sighing)

873
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,638
The air is the heaviest today out of all the battles.

874
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,210
It doesn't matter how loud we scream.

875
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,849
That's right.

876
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,319
My shoulders feel so heavy...

877
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,718
as a judge today.

878
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,079
Of course they are.

879
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,089
Okay. The second round...

880
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,559
is a 1-on-1 battle.

881
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,559
Our member for the 1st 1-on-1 battle...

882
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,359
is Yoonji.

883
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,429
(Yoonji, the queen of waacking)

884
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,269
This is tough.

885
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,070
We expected that.

886
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,969
It'll be either Waackxxxy or Yoonji.

887
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,610
It turned out to be Yoonji.

888
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,479
NOB of LADYBOUNCE,

889
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,280
who is the battler of LADYBOUNCE...

890
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,589
that will intimidate the opponent and bring you victory?

891
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,219
The member that will intimidate the opponent...

892
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,249
- Who could it be? - Intimidate the opponent.

893
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,049
It's Vessi.

894
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,118
(Vessi, the voguing lady)

895
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,919
(Here comes the voguing queen.)

896
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,959
(Okay, let's go.)

897
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,099
It's Vessi of LADYBOUNCE versus Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN.

898
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,130
It's waacking versus voguing.

899
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,768
It's a novel combination.

900
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:31,098
It's voguing versus waacking.

901
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:32,400
Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN,

902
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,239
would you declare war?

903
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,808
Our goal is to actually...

904
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:40,138
end the battle quickly by winning 4 to 0.

905
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,509
(She provokes her opponent.)

906
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,609
(No way.)

907
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,780
I will start by making the score 2 to 0.

908
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,489
That's hot.

909
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,219
Yoonji.

910
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,289
Good job.

911
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,419
You said you'll win 4 times 1st,

912
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,689
but I'll try hard to make sure it isn't easy.

913
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,058
- Good luck. - Let's go.

914
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,928
- Not easy. - Not easy.

915
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,069
- Not easy. - Not easy.

916
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,730
That was cool.

917
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,239
Let's go, Yoonji.

918
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,500
Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN will go first.

919
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,510
Vessi of LADYBOUNCE will go second.

920
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,340
We'll be cheering for you.

921
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:13,609
You just have to be confident.

922
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
(Roaring)

923
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,349
How good will she be?

924
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,420
- Let's go. - Yoonji.

925
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,518
(I'm going to show you who the queen is.)

926
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,590
Here it is.

927
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,989
I'll show you why I'm queen.

928
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,459
(This is a familiar pose.)

929
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,289
- She could scare a ghost away. - Seriously.

930
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,789
Are you going to be cute like this?

931
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,800
(This is so much fun.)

932
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,460
I won't step back.

933
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,630
I can't let everyone focus on Yoonji.

934
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,570
These two are unbelievable.

935
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,569
They're unbelievable.

936
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,869
(Showing off)

937
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,409
They're fighters. That's good.

938
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,538
It's a battle. There is no holding back.

939
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,079
- They're both so talented. - This is a battle.

940
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,150
Gosh. Are they dating?

941
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,678
We will now begin the battle between the two dancers...

942
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,765
that will fight for their pride, reputation, and victory.

943
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:56,888
You guys ready?

944
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:57,988
- Yes. - Yes.

945
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,019
Fight.

946
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,989
(Yoonji goes first.)

947
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,559
This is my song.

948
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,789
I won.

949
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,800
Go for it.

950
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,429
(Screaming)

951
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,480
(She kills the beat as she searches for Vessi.)

952
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,889
Amazing.

953
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,199
Yoonji.

954
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,029
Let's go.

955
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,468
(Go, Yoonji.)

956
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,139
Go!

957
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,339
Nice.

958
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,739
Go!

959
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,948
(Baby)

960
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:56,949
That's right.

961
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,549
(Queen of wit)

962
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,579
(That's our Yoonji.)

963
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,590
(It's chilli!)

964
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,320
I saw 1MILLION and improvised.

965
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:08,690
I wanted them to go crazy.

966
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,289
(This is so exciting.)

967
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,400
Five, four,

968
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,329
three, two, one.

969
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,828
Switch.

970
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,129
(Switch, Vessi goes second.)

971
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,940
I'll go at my pace.

972
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,769
Wait and see who wins.

973
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:25,439
It's Vessi.

974
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,579
Let's go.

975
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,030
(The power of voguing)

976
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,210
(Screaming)

977
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,679
(This is it.)

978
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,389
(Way to go, Vessi!)

979
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,360
Let's go!

980
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,259
Five, four,

981
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,929
three, two, one.

982
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,860
Battle set.

983
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,000
(Cheering)

984
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,768
(Well done, Vessi.)

985
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:29,000
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

986
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,738
- Yes! - That was awesome!

987
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,480
It was a battle between two queens.

988
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,780
You did such a great job.

989
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,649
- Great job. - You're the best.

990
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,479
- Well done. - You were both really good.

991
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,578
You were both really good.

992
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,718
She even did the "Chilli" move.

993
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,888
How did she even think of that on the spot?

994
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:47,218
- Vessi was amazing. - I know, right?

995
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,289
Now, let's find out the winner of the battle.

996
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,459
Fight judges, open your cards.

997
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,828
We must win the second round too...

998
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,229
and make the score 2 to 0.

999
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,069
I have no regrets. I did everything I could.

1000
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,499
It was the best 40 seconds I could give.

1001
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,110
Three, two, one!

1002
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,408
(Surprised)

1003
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,480
One!

1004
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,349
(MANNEQUEEN wins with a score of 3 to 0.)

1005
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,050
(Thank you.)

1006
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,820
With a score of 3 to 0,

1007
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,289
Yoonji of MANNEQUEEN takes the win once again.

1008
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,589
I'd like to thank the two of them...

1009
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:26,500
for showing us what voguing and waacking are.

1010
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,859
Although Yoonji didn't dance...

1011
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,268
to powerful music, I could still feel her energy,

1012
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,968
like she was thinking, "I'm a battler, and I have to win."

1013
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,968
She did some witty moves here and there,

1014
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,808
and her dance had more things to remember.

1015
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:42,138
That's why I chose Yoonji.

1016
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,209
When Vessi started dancing,

1017
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,218
I thought I sensed a change in the air.

1018
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:50,050
I thought she had incredible energy,

1019
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,658
but she couldn't keep it up until the end.

1020
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,859
I wish she had.

1021
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,089
I should've won that round to give my team a better chance to win.

1022
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,030
I felt terrible and sad.

1023
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,829
But you did so well. You were the best.

1024
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,328
You did really great.

1025
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,968
I almost cried watching you.

1026
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,238
- You were amazing. - Exactly.

1027
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,969
We have to win the third round.

1028
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,879
MANNEQUEEN won the second round as well,

1029
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,579
and they're now in the lead.

1030
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,149
If they win the next around too,

1031
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,009
LADYBOUNCE will be put in a position...

1032
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,050
where they must win all of the four remaining rounds.

1033
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,550
That's true.

1034
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:27,260
So this is going to be an important round,

1035
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,859
and it's called the Secret Round.

1036
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,929
"Secret"?

1037
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,389
What's a Secret Round?

1038
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,329
- They covered one up. - What?

1039
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,729
There's something a little strange here.

1040
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,238
- Wait, this is... - What?

1041
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,138
- "Secret Round"? - There's a Secret Round.

1042
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,169
I don't know what the Secret Round is about.

1043
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,439
What on earth is that?

1044
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,808
Picking the dancer they'll battle against?

1045
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,379
That's possible.

1046
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,308
Maybe they'll bring in two different props,

1047
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,979
- and ask them to dance with it. - Freestyle?

1048
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,149
Perhaps.

1049
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,649
But it wouldn't make sense for it to be a choreography, right?

1050
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,190
- Because what does that even mean? - You're right.

1051
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:01,859
We didn't give either of the crews...

1052
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,360
any information about the Secret Round. Here's what it is.

1053
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,899
What is it, a call-out or what?

1054
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,169
It's a 3-on-3 relay battle.

1055
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,399
(What?)

1056
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,198
(A 3-on-3 relay battle?)

1057
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,138
- I told you it'd be 3-on-3. - When?

1058
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:18,069
They really didn't know.

1059
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,679
They have to pick three dancers now.

1060
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,279
In a 3-on-3 relay battle,

1061
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,309
three dancers from each crew will be chosen on the spot to dance.

1062
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:28,849
Each dancer will freestyle for 30 seconds in relays.

1063
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:31,189
- So they'll go back and forth? - Dance in turns.

1064
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,089
- So they'll battle in relays. - Yes.

1065
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,058
Each pair will dance to the same music,

1066
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,459
and after one pair finishes dancing, the music will change.

1067
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,999
Three pairs in total will battle this way in relays.

1068
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,529
So after hearing the music,

1069
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,538
you can freely choose your dancer for the battle.

1070
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,468
- This is like a war of nerves. - Yes.

1071
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,169
It's like, "To this music, Harimu should dance."

1072
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,009
"To this music, Redy should dance.

1073
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,808
You also need to see who the battler from the other team is...

1074
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:57,948
and strategically pick your team's battler.

1075
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:01,250
This 3-on-3 relay battle will be a fierce battle of wits.

1076
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,749
It's all about improvisation.

1077
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,218
We should prepare ourselves.

1078
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,089
I think they'll play various kinds of music.

1079
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,590
If they play hip-hop music,

1080
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,158
- then I'll do it. - You should do it.

1081
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,029
- If it's disco... - Then it should be me.

1082
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,499
But it's LADYBOUNCE.

1083
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,899
I'm sure they'll play hip-hop music.

1084
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,129
Huddle up, shall we?

1085
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,299
Those who will be dancing can go all out from the start.

1086
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,738
Thirty seconds is really short.

1087
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,509
This is totally new.

1088
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,610
It's really important who goes first.

1089
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,209
Isn't it better to go second?

1090
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,348
- Yes. - It's better.

1091
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,908
You can be more strategic.

1092
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,920
It all comes down to his bottle spin.

1093
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,149
- Okay. - Okay.

1094
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,218
MANNEQUEEN will dance first, and LADYBOUNCE will follow.

1095
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:42,090
- Good luck! - You got this!

1096
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,729
Will MANNEQUEEN take one step closer to survival?

1097
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:47,399
Or will LADYBOUNCE put a stop to MANNEQUEEN's winning streak?

1098
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,328
This is going to be an important round. Let's start.

1099
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:51,499
Are you guys ready?

1100
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
- Yes! - Let's go!

1101
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,299
(MANNEQUEEN versus LADYBOUNCE)

1102
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,369
Fight!

1103
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,980
- Cera, you're up. - Cera should do it.

1104
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,820
The music was definitely for me. I knew I should do it.

1105
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,249
(Screaming)

1106
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,550
This is insane!

1107
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:13,388
I knew Cera was going to slay it with her legs.

1108
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:14,459
(MANNEQUEEN's first battler is Cera.)

1109
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,260
Cera, let's go.

1110
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,549
(Mesmerized)

1111
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,949
(This is crazy!)

1112
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,900
Five, four, three, two...

1113
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
(Back off!)

1114
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:04,440
Two, one!

1115
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,409
That's it. You'll win for sure.

1116
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,449
- Switch! - Okay!

1117
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,480
From LADYBOUNCE, it's Vessi.

1118
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,219
(When the music started to play)

1119
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:15,879
- Vessi, do you want to do it? - Me?

1120
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,889
How about Vessi?

1121
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,619
When I heard the music, I knew it had to be me.

1122
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:23,460
I wanted to dance gracefully in my own style.

1123
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,289
Go!

1124
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,480
Five, four, three, two...

1125
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,550
One! Switch.

1126
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,590
(What's the music for the second battle?)

1127
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,719
It's hip-hop.

1128
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,359
- Should I do it? - You should.

1129
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Okay.

1130
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,860
Me or you?

1131
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,440
- Do you want to do it, Yoonji? - Me?

1132
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,658
Should I?

1133
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:00,699
(Let's go, Waackxxxy.)

1134
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,230
Let's go, Waackxxxy!

1135
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,170
From MANNEQUEEN, it's Waackxxxy.

1136
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:09,809
(It's giving everyone goosebumps.)

1137
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,010
Oh, man.

1138
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,448
Gosh, that's insane.

1139
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,519
Come on!

1140
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,519
Yes, Waackxxxy!

1141
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,209
I don't know how she's still got healthy joints.

1142
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,788
(Focusing again)

1143
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,730
Let's go, Waackxxxy!

1144
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,730
Nice! That's it!

1145
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,070
Okay! Yes!

1146
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,400
I was in it to win. I wasn't going to lose.

1147
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:45,609
Five, four, three...

1148
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,239
(Screeching like a crow)

1149
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,210
Two, one! Switch!

1150
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,218
(LADYBOUNCE's second battler is Biggy.)

1151
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:57,288
It wasn't because of Waackxxxy but the music...

1152
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:59,219
why I thought I should go for it.

1153
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,019
It didn't matter who I was going against.

1154
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Go! Keep going!

1155
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:12,769
That's it!

1156
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:18,069
Here we go!

1157
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,679
(Here we go.)

1158
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,079
Yes!

1159
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,819
Five, four,

1160
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,690
three, two, one!

1161
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,860
Switch.

1162
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,500
From MANNEQUEEN, it's Yoonji.

1163
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:48,440
The music was for me.

1164
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,909
(Dancing automatically)

1165
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,440
I had to end the game.

1166
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:01,619
(Gasping)

1167
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,889
I love it!

1168
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,130
You're killing it!

1169
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:18,869
Oh, my goodness.

1170
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,070
She's amazing!

1171
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,710
(Glaring)

1172
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:32,849
(Okay, thank you.)

1173
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,919
I thought that if we didn't turn things around,

1174
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,349
we might lose.

1175
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:39,349
From LADYBOUNCE, it's NOB!

1176
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,659
(They're slaying it!)

1177
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,959
She was in her element.

1178
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,170
She's in her element!

1179
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,469
Hey!

1180
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,110
Go! Come on!

1181
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,289
Man, are you kidding me?

1182
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:21,259
Five, four, three, two, one!

1183
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,659
The battle is over.

1184
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,399
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1185
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,599
That was amazing.

1186
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,098
I don't know what to do here.

1187
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,039
- That was fun! - It was fun.

1188
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,839
Their songs would've been fine.

1189
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,308
I'm sorry, but I wish they would do this all day.

1190
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,348
- I feel bad, but I do. - I know, right?

1191
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,709
I couldn't see NOB's legs.

1192
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,990
I know. I couldn't see her legs.

1193
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:41,659
- That's NOB. - I couldn't see them.

1194
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
It was so cool.

1195
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,518
Now, let's find out the winner of this battle.

1196
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,190
It must be hard for the judges to decide.

1197
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,590
(Yes, it is.)

1198
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:51,030
This is driving me crazy.

1199
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,460
They seem torn.

1200
00:49:52,461 --> 00:49:54,699
I thought we still had a chance.

1201
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,500
I thought we'd still win.

1202
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:59,299
Fight judges, open your cards.

1203
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,869
Three, two, one!

1204
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,709
(Monika has chosen MANNEQUEEN.)

1205
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,769
One!

1206
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:08,109
(MANNEQUEEN wins with a score of 3 to 0.)

1207
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,138
With a score of 3 to 0...

1208
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,209
(Disappointed)

1209
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,149
With a score of 3 to 0,

1210
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,018
MANNEQUEEN takes yet another win.

1211
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:17,049
It's okay!

1212
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,049
It's okay! You can win the next one!

1213
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,618
- You can do it! - You can do it!

1214
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:23,359
Honey J, what did you think of this round?

1215
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,259
Everyone from LADYBOUNCE...

1216
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,928
expressed the music very well.

1217
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:30,069
Their dance matched the tone of the music perfectly.

1218
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,468
I loved their moves...

1219
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,000
and flows.

1220
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,638
However, MANNEQUEEN...

1221
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:38,340
did things that I hadn't expected.

1222
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,908
They weren't following the music.

1223
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:43,448
They were making the music follow their moves.

1224
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:44,809
Watching that,

1225
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,948
I could see why they sweep through all the dance battles.

1226
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,219
They proved it with their dance.

1227
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,988
Continuing their winning streak,

1228
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:57,829
MANNEQUEEN has won 3 rounds out of 7.

1229
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,198
If they also win the fourth round,

1230
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,299
the Elimination Battle will end then and there.

1231
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,928
If so, LADYBOUNCE who couldn't win a single round...

1232
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,768
will be the last crew to be eliminated,

1233
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:10,710
and they will have to leave.

1234
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,309
I was like, "Is this a dream?"

1235
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:16,409
Our only option was to win the next round.

1236
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,049
I had a lot on my mind at that time.

1237
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:21,249
The fourth round which could be the final round,

1238
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,189
is going to be a 5-on-5 group battle.

1239
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,390
(Round 4, 5-on-5 group battle)

1240
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:28,590
(The two crews have changed their outfits and returned.)

1241
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:30,388
Purple is their colour.

1242
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:31,859
They look great.

1243
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,859
Why do I feel so nervous for them?

1244
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,530
Boy, they must be nervous.

1245
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,828
I hope this won't be the final round.

1246
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:40,569
LADYBOUNCE must be more nervous than ever.

1247
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,939
We were now more desperate than MANNEQUEEN.

1248
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,268
We were determined...

1249
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,239
to give it our all and turn the tables around.

1250
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,979
- Guys, just have fun. - I can certainly do that.

1251
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,110
- I'm curious how they'll play this. - Right.

1252
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:55,179
This is a cut-throat battle where the loser gets instantly eliminated.

1253
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,888
LADYBOUNCE versus MANNEQUEEN. Let's start the battle.

1254
00:51:58,889 --> 00:51:59,988
Are you guys ready?

1255
00:51:59,989 --> 00:52:01,158
- Yes! - Let's go!

1256
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,218
Fight!

1257
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,090
(MANNEQUEEN goes first.)

1258
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,859
- What's going on? - What?

1259
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,899
- Can't nobody - Can't nobody

1260
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,669
The battle was going to be over if we won that round.

1261
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,439
We wanted to make it to the Finals with a clean sweep.

1262
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,940
- Can't nobody hold us down - Can't nobody hold us down

1263
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,610
It's similar to our dance.

1264
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,650
Fly up!

1265
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,658
(Ta-Da)

1266
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,579
Did you see that? We can do technical moves too.

1267
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:40,058
It wasn't so intimidating.

1268
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:42,059
Our dance was more fun. I was sure we'd win.

1269
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:45,329
(That's my charm)

1270
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,670
(Shooting off their waacking moves)

1271
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,510
(Perfect teamwork)

1272
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,488
I'm so bad, bad, but I'm so good, good

1273
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:07,489
Yes!

1274
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,789
Nice!

1275
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:16,730
Five, four, three, two, one.

1276
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:19,670
Switch. LADYBOUNCE.

1277
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,169
I thought, "We did it. We're going to win this round too."

1278
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,639
(This is fun to watch.)

1279
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,509
LADYBOUNCE.

1280
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,408
That might be our last performance, so what couldn't we do?

1281
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,549
We wanted to have fun like we always had.

1282
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,979
Hey!

1283
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,619
(They're going crazy.)

1284
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,618
(Excited)

1285
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,190
They picked this music?

1286
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,159
(Let's have some fun.)

1287
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,630
(She's getting carried away.)

1288
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:53,489
(Their moves look familiar.)

1289
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,369
(They're MANNEQUEEN's iconic moves.)

1290
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,268
(Those are our moves.)

1291
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:59,979
(We remember.)

1292
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,980
We knew...

1293
00:54:00,981 --> 00:54:04,050
we'd probably battle against MANNEQUEEN, so we prepared it.

1294
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,079
They were certainly targeting us.

1295
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,750
(LADYBOUNCE anticipated their opponent precisely.)

1296
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:26,800
(Surprised)

1297
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,039
(That's the LADYBOUNCE we know.)

1298
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:35,739
(Precise and clean technique)

1299
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,880
It was not looking good.

1300
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,480
Hey!

1301
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,050
(Her eyes wander in shock.)

1302
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,960
(Wait, that's...)

1303
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:58,469
You've got to do it

1304
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,899
Three, two, one!

1305
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,340
(Bring it on.)

1306
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,539
One. Battle set.

1307
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,038
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1308
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,739
That's it!

1309
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,578
(Harimu roars.)

1310
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,109
(Don't overuse your voice, Harimu.)

1311
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,019
(Everyone is captivated by LADYBOUNCE.)

1312
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,920
(Copying their cool moves)

1313
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,719
This is tough.

1314
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,888
- We had the same idea. - They did waacking.

1315
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:21,960
We had the same idea.

1316
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,320
Great job.

1317
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,189
That was mean!

1318
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,359
(The waacking battle isn't over yet.)

1319
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,399
Fight judges, please think carefully...

1320
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,868
and choose the winner of this battle.

1321
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:33,738
Gosh, this is really tough.

1322
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,639
Come on, please. I want to keep it going.

1323
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:38,745
But they anticipated their opponent and came up with the dance.

1324
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,510
Their moves were targeted at MANNEQUEEN.

1325
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,709
They really went all out for it.

1326
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,009
Still, I think we did well.

1327
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,049
I was 100 percent sure we were going to win.

1328
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,119
I believed we started to turn things around.

1329
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,718
Now, let's find out the winner of this battle.

1330
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,960
Fight judges, open your cards.

1331
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:57,389
I can't watch.

1332
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:00,929
Three, two, one!

1333
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:06,299
One!

1334
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,538
(Trix has chosen LADYBOUNCE.)

1335
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:08,569
One!

1336
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:13,480
(LADYBOUNCE wins with a score of 3 to 0.)

1337
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,948
With a score of 3 to 0, LADYBOUNCE...

1338
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:19,149
takes the win.

1339
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,449
Yes, they deserve that.

1340
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,879
You can do it!

1341
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,090
This is our first win.

1342
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,189
(They finally got their first win.)

1343
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,788
We did it. This is good enough for me.

1344
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,288
- What? No. - Hey.

1345
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,928
Hey, we're going to come from behind.

1346
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,189
That one victory felt so precious.

1347
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,829
I was happy. It was a valuable victory.

1348
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,799
First of all, you danced...

1349
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,538
to similar music like you guys had planned it.

1350
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:41,768
(Similar music and structure)

1351
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:44,409
And the structures of your dance were also similar.

1352
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,408
But in my opinion,

1353
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:51,849
LADYBOUNCE's dance had more various components.

1354
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,178
LADYBOUNCE took their first win making a last-ditch effort...

1355
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,689
and somehow managed to survive on the verge of elimination.

1356
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,549
So this battle that will determine the fate of the two crews...

1357
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,090
will continue to the fifth round.

1358
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,729
- Let's go! - Do your best until the end!

1359
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,189
The fifth round which now is expected to be even fiercer...

1360
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,098
is going to be a 1-on-1 battle.

1361
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:11,269
The battler from our crew for this round is...

1362
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:12,530
Who is it going to be?

1363
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,869
- Naro? - Capri?

1364
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,299
(Who's the battler for Round 5?)

1365
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,308
Biggy.

1366
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,638
Biggy!

1367
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:20,808
(It's me.)

1368
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:22,439
Go, Biggy!

1369
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,609
Biggy!

1370
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,848
(DJ for the day)

1371
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:28,650
The battler from our crew for this round is...

1372
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,219
Waackxxxy.

1373
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,448
(Waackxxxy)

1374
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,190
(Bowing)

1375
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:35,666
- Let's go, Waackxxxy. - Waackxxxy.

1376
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,488
They're going with waackers for all dance-offs without mercy.

1377
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,529
It would've been fun if it was someone who hasn't danced solo.

1378
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,329
It's just that they don't want to lose.

1379
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,730
Neither of them.

1380
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,529
Wasn't it also the two of them earlier?

1381
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:48,769
- Okay! - It's a rematch!

1382
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,940
(Waackxxxy and Biggy already had a dance-off in Round 3.)

1383
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:54,309
Waackxxxy.

1384
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:55,840
(We meet again.)

1385
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,849
If it's her again, I'm sure you'll win.

1386
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,050
It was just as I expected.

1387
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:01,348
It was me versus Waackxxxy again, and I wanted to make it fun.

1388
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:03,689
- Biggy, you got this? - Of course.

1389
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,189
Just have fun.

1390
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,789
Do what you want to do.

1391
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,859
Biggy has nothing to fear.

1392
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,229
She's a talented dancer,

1393
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,999
and the two of them specialize in different genres.

1394
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,960
She certainly has a chance to win.

1395
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,469
I feel so reassured.

1396
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,098
When Waackxxxy stepped forward, I had no worries.

1397
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,599
I'm going to win no matter what.

1398
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,268
Round 5, 1-on-1 battle.

1399
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:28,439
It's going to be Biggy of LADYBOUNCE versus Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN.

1400
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,408
- LADYBOUNCE versus MANNEQUEEN. - Let's go!

1401
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,509
Neither of them can afford to lose this round.

1402
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,419
Let's begin the fierce battle between the two dancers.

1403
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,488
Are you guys ready?

1404
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:39,289
- Go! - Sink or swim. Let's go!

1405
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,058
Fight!

1406
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,759
(Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN goes first.)

1407
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,130
- This music. - Fifth round.

1408
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:48,929
This is crazy. I mean, the music!

1409
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:53,000
I told myself, "Listen to the music."

1410
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,170
(Focusing together)

1411
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,869
Let's see.

1412
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,239
Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN.

1413
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,119
(To be continued)

1414
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:08,750
Let's go.

1415
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,289
MANNEQUEEN's Waackxxxy.

1416
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,260
She's not human.

1417
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:26,729
I saw that she was possessed at that moment.

1418
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,090
(Waackxxxy is one with the music.)

1419
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,610
Nice!

1420
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,349
(Admiring)

1421
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,079
Is this the judges' show?

1422
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:00,900
Go, girl!

1423
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,709
I wasn't that flustered.

1424
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,480
It didn't matter what she did.

1425
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:11,010
Go, girl!

1426
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,090
Nice.

1427
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:20,559
Yes!

1428
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,789
Let's go!

1429
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,788
Four,

1430
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,599
three, two, one.

1431
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,900
Switch!

1432
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,340
(Drawn in)

1433
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,269
LADYBOUNCE's Biggy.

1434
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,139
Switch!

1435
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,380
LADYBOUNCE's Biggy.

1436
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,780
I wasn't nervous at all.

1437
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,109
I thought that doubting myself at that moment...

1438
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,780
was a foolish thing to do.

1439
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,989
(Let's enjoy the battle.)

1440
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:03,769
(Go, Biggy.)

1441
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:25,449
(Grinning)

1442
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:28,360
Three, two, one.

1443
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,860
Battle, over!

1444
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,690
Great.

1445
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:33,929
- Yes! - Awesome!

1446
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,098
(The two hug each other for the hard work.)

1447
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:38,000
- Well done. - That was great!

1448
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:40,129
That was incredible.

1449
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,138
You were amazing.

1450
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:42,868
- You were great. - Well done.

1451
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,069
Amazing!

1452
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,809
- Awesome! - Well done.

1453
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,809
(Cheering)

1454
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,010
I liked both of them.

1455
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,879
Both of them were pretty different.

1456
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,348
But she's fine. Like a... You know, she's like...

1457
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:55,979
- Biggy? - Yes, she's fine.

1458
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,348
I liked both of them, to be honest.

1459
01:01:58,349 --> 01:02:01,360
But Waackxxxy was convinced.

1460
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,429
I could tell that she was convinced she'd win.

1461
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:06,689
If MANNEQUEEN wins this round,

1462
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,760
they survive,

1463
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:09,659
and the Elimination Battle ends.

1464
01:02:09,699 --> 01:02:12,030
But if LADYBOUNCE wins,

1465
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,539
LADYBOUNCE will get another chance in the battle.

1466
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,139
We had a faint hope.

1467
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:22,579
I was hoping for a good result for the members who trusted me.

1468
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,879
I was so proud of Waackxxxy,

1469
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,079
and she did amazingly.

1470
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,780
I just wanted to end it here.

1471
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:31,488
We will now check the outcome of the battle...

1472
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:34,190
that may or may not be the last one.

1473
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:36,488
Fight judges, open your cards.

1474
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,190
Three, two, one.

1475
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,860
(Who did the fight judges choose?)

1476
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:48,138
(LADYBOUNCE: 0, MANNEQUEEN: 3)

1477
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,598
With a score of 3 to 0,

1478
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,909
MANNEQUEEN wins.

1479
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,138
- Well done. - Well done!

1480
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,980
- You were great. - You were awesome!

1481
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,409
First off, great job.

1482
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,979
The moment Waackxxxy stepped up...

1483
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,149
We normally skip the intro of the song,

1484
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,988
but you confidently stood at the center...

1485
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:09,859
to show us your stuff, and I was great.

1486
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,229
If Biggy had...

1487
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,999
just one more factor,

1488
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,499
I would have chosen you.

1489
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,629
That's how cool...

1490
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,469
your flow was.

1491
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,469
But it wasn't good enough as this was a dance-off.

1492
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,139
You've become so much cooler, Biggy.

1493
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:26,669
- That's right. - In fact,

1494
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,839
she was one my students.

1495
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,549
Her past images popped up...

1496
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,279
when she was dancing.

1497
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,049
I thought, "She must have worked really hard..."

1498
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,149
"to improve."

1499
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,590
Though you lost this time,

1500
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,389
you were awesome. I mean it.

1501
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,859
The crew that failed to overcome...

1502
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,098
the obstacle to the final round and must end the journey...

1503
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,869
on Street Woman Fighter 2 is LADYBOUNCE.

1504
01:03:53,269 --> 01:03:55,198
(Eliminated Crew, LADYBOUNCE)

1505
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,169
You were fabulous today.

1506
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,408
I'll look forward to your future.

1507
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:02,309
It's been an honour to be your judge. Thank you.

1508
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,609
I obviously knew about LADYBOUNCE,

1509
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,079
even before they joined this competition.

1510
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,489
I was always excited to watch their performances.

1511
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:16,690
You were already fantastic before this.

1512
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:22,359
It seems that a lot of people saw how charming LADYBOUNCE was,

1513
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,860
and I'm glad as one of your fans.

1514
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:25,698
I'll keep rooting for you.

1515
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,539
I also failed before the final round.

1516
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,070
And I can't stop thinking about it.

1517
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,070
There was a performance that I had been dying to do,

1518
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:34,756
but I still haven't been able to do it.

1519
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,139
So, I can relate to how regretful you are,

1520
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,710
and I know how sad it is to get low views,

1521
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:41,349
though they're merely numbers.

1522
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:43,049
Someone said last time,

1523
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,518
"It feels like everyone is denying our crew."

1524
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,436
I can relate to you since I felt the same thing.

1525
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,960
And I'm terribly sorry because I feel like I became...

1526
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,428
the one to deny you.

1527
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:53,959
But I believe...

1528
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,058
that this competition is created...

1529
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,369
with the production crew's consideration...

1530
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,500
to help the public understand dance through figures.

1531
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,599
Your passion will come through to everyone.

1532
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,738
They won't just feel your dancing skills.

1533
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:07,439
They'll feel your lives...

1534
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,210
and find courage in the meantime.

1535
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,178
I'm very proud of you,

1536
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:12,380
and thank you.

1537
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,719
First...

1538
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,419
The first thing that comes to mind is...

1539
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,420
how thankful I am for my teammates.

1540
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:24,130
We've been a crew for a very long time,

1541
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,659
and we needed a chance to refresh ourselves.

1542
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:28,030
The whole team needed that.

1543
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:31,369
Thank you for motivating us,

1544
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:34,769
and I believe we did well enough by coming this far.

1545
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:39,570
I want to tell all my teammates that they did well.

1546
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:40,909
You did so well.

1547
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:45,679
Getting a golden opportunity to go through this program...

1548
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:48,519
with the members was a huge part of my life.

1549
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:51,519
Let's keep dancing hard together.

1550
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:52,849
Good luck!

1551
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:57,559
All members of the eight crews here are serious about dance.

1552
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,328
I was very happy and pleased to compete...

1553
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:04,000
with other people who were also serious about dance.

1554
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,129
She's cute.

1555
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:10,369
I'll grow to be tougher...

1556
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:12,940
and keep working harder...

1557
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:14,379
(Moved)

1558
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,110
to meet you way up there.

1559
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:18,710
Great.

1560
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,409
I love you, Capri!

1561
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,050
I...

1562
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,420
absolutely love...

1563
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,960
dance. I mean it.

1564
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,019
She confessed her love to dance.

1565
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:31,629
Good for you.

1566
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,689
But...

1567
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:36,429
I struggled to find out...

1568
01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:38,570
how to improve or practice...

1569
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,840
for a long time.

1570
01:06:41,469 --> 01:06:44,538
With all those amazing dancers...

1571
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:47,610
out there in the Korean world of dance,

1572
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,679
our team is truly honoured...

1573
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,679
to be chosen as a competitor.

1574
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:55,848
I appreciate the production crew for giving us a chance...

1575
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,789
to perform like this.

1576
01:06:57,989 --> 01:07:01,219
And thank you for making me love dance more.

1577
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,519
I'm going to be...

1578
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,929
way cooler.

1579
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,329
I'm serious.

1580
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:08,630
Please look forward to it.

1581
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,429
- Yes. - Yes, Biggy!

1582
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,130
You're already cool.

1583
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,598
You're already awesome as you are,

1584
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,199
but I'll look forward to it!

1585
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:17,940
(Oh, my gosh.)

1586
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,439
Although we're eliminated.

1587
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,179
We believe that this is a new start.

1588
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,079
Please look forward to our future,

1589
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,879
and I want to thank all seven crews...

1590
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,650
for being here with us.

1591
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,550
You're amazing!

1592
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,218
We love you, LADYBOUNCE.

1593
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:37,360
Can the leaders of each crew say a few words as well?

1594
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:39,130
- Please. - Please do.

1595
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,159
Even before I came to Street Woman Fighter 2,

1596
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,699
I was aware of how great LADYBOUNCE was.

1597
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,599
So, I was extremely glad to be able...

1598
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,369
to compete with you.

1599
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,940
You looked great in every performance...

1600
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,880
you gave us here.

1601
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:59,109
Thank you so much for the show,

1602
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,348
and it was an honour to compete with you.

1603
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:03,348
- Thank you so much. - Thank you!

1604
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:04,589
We love you, LADYBOUNCE.

1605
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,150
- We love you. - We love you.

1606
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,320
It was pleasant to compete with you.

1607
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:12,889
I learned a lot from you, and you inspired me.

1608
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,360
It's only a start, right?

1609
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,698
I hope to influence...

1610
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:19,528
the world of dancing in a good way...

1611
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,399
by trying many things together.

1612
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,898
Great work so far, and thank you.

1613
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,309
- Thanks. - Thanks.

1614
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,608
- LADYBOUNCE is the best! - The best!

1615
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,438
- Thank you. We love you. - You're the best.

1616
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,809
You guys are powerful and swaggy.

1617
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:34,349
Thank you for showing us your energy...

1618
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:38,019
because, on the stage, seeing your presence and your piece,

1619
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,148
we were screaming.

1620
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:41,658
We didn't really want to battle. We were just having fun.

1621
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,328
Keep shining, and it's not the end.

1622
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:45,688
You're bigger than the show.

1623
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,658
And you're only going to go up.

1624
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:49,299
JAM REPUBLIC loves you.

1625
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,398
Thank you so much.

1626
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:52,800
They're so cute.

1627
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,300
Thank you!

1628
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,568
(And MANNEQUEEN that was in a heated battle)

1629
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:59,309
Since we were teenagers...

1630
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,709
(Choking up)

1631
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,340
Don't.

1632
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:04,810
(The tear trigger)

1633
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:08,550
We've entered dance competitions together.

1634
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,020
(NOB, Vessi, Biggy, and Funky Y have been close since they were young.)

1635
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,358
(Funky Y and LADYBOUNCE danced on the same stage, )

1636
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,519
(even 11 years ago.)

1637
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,960
The days when we grew together...

1638
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,399
as colleagues and friends keep occurring to me.

1639
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:23,829
It feels nice to see you give...

1640
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,170
amazing performances on such a huge show after a decade.

1641
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:31,670
I hope we can keep dancing until we're 40, 50,

1642
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:34,039
or until we die.

1643
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,909
You were incredible.

1644
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,209
(She gives them a heartfelt message as an old colleague and competitor.)

1645
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,078
The oldest female crew in Korea,

1646
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:43,919
LADYBOUNCE, gave...

1647
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,419
a lot of crews the courage...

1648
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,118
to keep their crews together.

1649
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,759
Though I don't represent any of them,

1650
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,460
I just want to say thank you for existing.

1651
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,630
She's right.

1652
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,198
Hence, the last eliminated crew...

1653
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,970
of Street Woman Fighter 2 is LADYBOUNCE.

1654
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,839
- Thank you! - Thank you.

1655
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,380
Funky Y.

1656
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:11,550
(NOB ends up bursting into tears in Funky Y's arms.)

1657
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,479
Great work.

1658
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:15,720
Funky Y.

1659
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,619
- It was so fun. - I could tell.

1660
01:10:18,789 --> 01:10:22,118
We were also inspired by your crew.

1661
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:24,158
- We learned a lot from you. - So much.

1662
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,188
Teamwork wasn't something that you could achieve by practice.

1663
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,100
I'm glad that you felt that.

1664
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,169
Your crew has distinctive teamwork,

1665
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,670
and no one can copy it.

1666
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,470
Thank you for saying that.

1667
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:40,568
Who should I hang out with...

1668
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,310
when you're gone?

1669
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:43,839
Thank you for everything.

1670
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,778
I wanted to do better. I could have done better.

1671
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:48,849
You did so great.

1672
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,448
- You were fabulous. - You were the best.

1673
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:52,519
You were insane.

1674
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,590
Stop talking nonsense.

1675
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,219
We've been competitors the whole time.

1676
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,629
We've always been competitors while we were here,

1677
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,999
and they supported us, saying that we did well.

1678
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,899
It felt like I had a new team called Street Woman Fighter.

1679
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,669
I appreciated everything they said to me,

1680
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,800
which was why I couldn't stop crying.

1681
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,909
I was thankful and content.

1682
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:15,278
Great work, LADYBOUNCE.

1683
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:16,710
(Clear pronunciation)

1684
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,210
(Sad)

1685
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,479
(The dancers give LADYBOUNCE a warm goodbye.)

1686
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,349
Don't forget about us!

1687
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:26,089
- LADYBOUNCE! - LADYBOUNCE!

1688
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:28,659
LADYBOUNCE rules!

1689
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:31,988
Great work, girls.

1690
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:35,299
Come here. Bring it in.

1691
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,300
Bring it in!

1692
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:37,430
We did great.

1693
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:39,599
We did so well.

1694
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,699
I'm proud of us for making it this far.

1695
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,699
I really am.

1696
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,309
After we had new members...

1697
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,608
on the team,

1698
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:50,509
Street Woman Fighter 2 was, in fact, where the 5 of us...

1699
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,448
could become one.

1700
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:53,908
So, it means a lot to me.

1701
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,579
I'm grateful that I experienced it together.

1702
01:11:57,989 --> 01:11:59,789
(What you're doing is right, so keep going.)

1703
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,988
(Looking good, our leader!)

1704
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:05,658
Although I don't think I did a good job as a leader,

1705
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:09,430
they still trusted me and followed my lead, and I'm thankful.

1706
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,068
(I have no regrets. I believe in you.)

1707
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:14,068
The five of us became one...

1708
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:16,899
and lived every day to the full.

1709
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,109
I was extremely lucky to get the opportunity...

1710
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:25,108
to show all our efforts without omission...

1711
01:12:25,109 --> 01:12:27,108
on such a large stage.

1712
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,249
I shined the brightest when I danced here,

1713
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:34,220
and this program taught me that I was still alive.

1714
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:37,319
My future plans? I want to be way cooler.

1715
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:39,960
That's all I can think of. I want to be way better.

1716
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,698
(Don't leave any regrets.)

1717
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:45,970
I'm honestly a bit excited to work hard with them.

1718
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:51,438
Girls, LADYBOUNCE starts over with all five members.

1719
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:53,439
- In 1, 2, 3. We love you. - We love you.

1720
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,809
Great work, everyone.

1721
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,448
- Bye! - Bye.

1722
01:12:58,449 --> 01:12:59,810
- We love you. - Don't forget us!

1723
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,618
LADYBOUNCE's journey starts now.

1724
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:03,979
(We root for your new future.)

1725
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,019
(It's our turn to step forward.)

1726
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,959
(LADYBOUNCE forever)

1727
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,759
(LADYBOUNCE, the oldest female crew in Korea)

1728
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,760
(The final missions are revealed at last.)

1729
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:17,930
(The final mission did not seem easy.)

1730
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,130
(The nightmare of missions is back.)

1731
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:22,500
(The notice was given to each crew.)

1732
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:23,939
What?

1733
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:25,270
(No way.)

1734
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,710
(What's the mission that caused a mental breakdown?)

1735
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:33,709
(CJ ENM Ilsan Production Center)

1736
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,879
From No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer...

1737
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,618
to the Battle Performance Mission,

1738
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:40,389
these four crews proved that they were best...

1739
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,158
and survived this long.

1740
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,989
We appreciate your hard work.

1741
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,459
(We've done so much.)

1742
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,659
Great work, everyone.

1743
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,398
The last mission...

1744
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:50,199
of Street Woman Fighter 2.

1745
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:52,130
The final live mission will be held...

1746
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:54,699
on two stages.

1747
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,039
(Final Mission Announcement)

1748
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,938
It has to be the last one.

1749
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,809
The final one.

1750
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,969
It's the last one!

1751
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,339
One of the two missions is...

1752
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,108
the End Credit Mission.

1753
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,220
- What? - The End Credit Mission?

1754
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:09,879
These are the end credits.

1755
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,389
- End credits. - End credits?

1756
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,488
What does that mean?

1757
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,889
The End Credit Mission is...

1758
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,420
a mission of giving a performance with a strong sense...

1759
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,688
of your crew's identity and individuality.

1760
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,828
It must be a performance that only your crew can do,

1761
01:14:22,829 --> 01:14:25,299
and you will give the public...

1762
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,539
your crew's finale in this mission.

1763
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,999
(That's cool.)

1764
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I like it.

1765
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:33,209
It's the finishing touch.

1766
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,539
I'm crying already.

1767
01:14:34,939 --> 01:14:36,108
It's the last one.

1768
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:38,148
In the end credits,

1769
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:40,648
you see the names of people...

1770
01:14:40,649 --> 01:14:42,818
who worked on that piece.

1771
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:45,849
We could wrap up our dramatic storyline...

1772
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,460
on Street Woman Fighter 2 in the End Credit Mission.

1773
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,158
The other mission is...

1774
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:53,288
- I can't tell which one this is. - I wonder what it is.

1775
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:54,629
I can't wait to find out.

1776
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,028
The other mission is...

1777
01:14:56,029 --> 01:14:57,199
(What will it be?)

1778
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:59,300
the Global Artist Mission.

1779
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,169
(Global Artist Mission)

1780
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,398
- What? - What?

1781
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,770
"Global Artist?"

1782
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,309
That sounds so fun.

1783
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:07,108
We're going global this time.

1784
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:08,908
JAM REPUBLIC members just smiled so brightly.

1785
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:11,880
Exactly. Look how excited LaTrice is.

1786
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:14,250
I'm listening to all your lyrics now.

1787
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,349
It's nice that we finally get to dance to music we understand.

1788
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,648
- Same. - I know!

1789
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:23,720
Here are the four global artists.

1790
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:25,759
- Let's go! - This is the important part.

1791
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,028
This is crucial.

1792
01:15:27,029 --> 01:15:28,199
Beyoncé.

1793
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,430
Ciara.

1794
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,460
Madonna.

1795
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,399
(Who are the legendary artists in the line-up?)

1796
01:15:33,069 --> 01:15:34,699
(Ariana Grande)

1797
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,600
(Screaming)

1798
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,909
Ariana!

1799
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:39,608
(Screaming)

1800
01:15:39,609 --> 01:15:41,108
(BEBE is pleased.)

1801
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:42,979
It's Ariana!

1802
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:46,009
RnB, hip-hop, and dance.

1803
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,948
The genius artists with a wide range of genres.

1804
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:50,618
The guaranteed pop star, Ariana Grande.

1805
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:52,589
(The guaranteed pop star, Ariana Grande)

1806
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,449
Ariana Grande.

1807
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:56,788
(She automatically makes her signature moves.)

1808
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:59,289
- You're Bariana Grande. - Totally.

1809
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,300
I created so many dance moves for Ariana's songs,

1810
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:03,929
such as "7 Rings."

1811
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:07,728
Many people told me that I came up with the best choreography...

1812
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,039
among all the dancers who tried it out.

1813
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:12,640
- I'm Bariana Barande. - I'm Kyriana Grande.

1814
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,479
I feel like BEBE will choose Ariana Grande.

1815
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:17,609
Here goes the next artist.

1816
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:22,380
(Beyoncé)

1817
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:23,920
(There you go!)

1818
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,118
Of course.

1819
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:27,188
(High-fiving)

1820
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:29,220
(Making the signature moves again)

1821
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,158
She won the most awards...

1822
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:33,630
at the Grammy Awards of all female artists so far.

1823
01:16:33,729 --> 01:16:36,299
The irreplaceable popstar, the queen of queens,

1824
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,399
Beyoncé.

1825
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:40,898
There are so many good songs by Beyoncé.

1826
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:43,839
The queen of queens, Beyoncé.

1827
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,068
I'd choose Beyoncé.

1828
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:46,969
She's got a lot of options.

1829
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:50,408
Beyoncé sang all types of genres.

1830
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:51,908
I bet they all want Beyoncé.

1831
01:16:51,909 --> 01:16:53,209
Absolutely.

1832
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,318
Here's the next artist.

1833
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,750
Who's the next artist?

1834
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,890
(Lady Gaga)

1835
01:17:00,189 --> 01:17:01,560
Lady Gaga.

1836
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:06,460
- It's ours! - "Gaga, ooh, la-la."

1837
01:17:07,159 --> 01:17:10,100
With unconventional styles and a strong identity,

1838
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,170
she's known as the most influential artist in the whole world.

1839
01:17:13,369 --> 01:17:15,368
The icon of the time, Lady Gaga.

1840
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:17,239
(The icon of the time, Lady Gaga)

1841
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,309
- Awesome. - It's ours!

1842
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:20,710
Sorry.

1843
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,379
I bet MANNEQUEEN will...

1844
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,608
be awesome if they get Lady Gaga.

1845
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:26,648
They almost roared when they saw Lady Gaga.

1846
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:29,078
- They'll wear flaming outfits. - Yes.

1847
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:32,419
Now, I give you the last artist.

1848
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,589
Who will be the last one?

1849
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,789
Who else is there? Rihanna?

1850
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,889
We can't let Rihanna's song go to JAM REPUBLIC.

1851
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,560
- Never. - Never.

1852
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:42,300
If they get it, they'll dominate it.

1853
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:45,970
I have collaborated dance for Rihanna.

1854
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:48,369
I know that I can absolutely slay.

1855
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,000
I give you the last artist.

1856
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:54,210
(Rihanna)

1857
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,039
Oh, it is her.

1858
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,180
- It was her. - I thought so.

1859
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:01,180
(Kirsten is pleased.)

1860
01:18:01,649 --> 01:18:03,880
- "Rude boy, can you get it up?" - Stand up.

1861
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,920
She tops all the charts every time she releases a song.

1862
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,720
The sexy popstar that's known as the Billboard dominator.

1863
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,529
The most representative iconic signer, Rihanna.

1864
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:15,500
(JAM REPUBLIC is thrilled.)

1865
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:17,130
- Rihanna. - Rihanna.

1866
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:18,629
(Dancing with satisfaction)

1867
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,129
Look at JAM REPUBLIC. They're smiling.

1868
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,299
(Truly elated)

1869
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,469
I would love to get Rihanna.

1870
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,238
Same here. I would love to get Rihanna.

1871
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:28,039
Ariana Grande, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna.

1872
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,379
Gosh, they only picked the legends.

1873
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,948
- It's a battle of queens. - Exactly. A battle of queens.

1874
01:18:32,949 --> 01:18:34,978
- Right. - "Who's the queen?"

1875
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:36,479
(Simply put, who is the queen?)

1876
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,148
It's a war of queens.

1877
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:40,890
This is like a fight to the crown.

1878
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,060
Discuss with your crew which artist you want to choose.

1879
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,359
Then we'll meet back here.

1880
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,198
She's very young.

1881
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:51,259
- She has this youthful image. - Right.

1882
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,270
- Rihanna has so many great songs. - Right.

1883
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:55,599
I think BEBE will go after Rihanna.

1884
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,639
For rhythm and blue and pop music.

1885
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,839
Which artist do you want?

1886
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,368
I would love to get Rihanna.

1887
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:02,640
But Rihanna has so many legendary performances.

1888
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,108
The Royal Family did a lot of performances...

1889
01:19:04,109 --> 01:19:05,109
with Rihanna's songs.

1890
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:07,278
If we can do better than them, we can go for it.

1891
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:10,040
If we're not confident to do so, giving up Rihanna can be a strategy.

1892
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,420
Raise your hands for Lady Gaga.

1893
01:19:13,689 --> 01:19:14,720
No one?

1894
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,318
She's really cool, though.

1895
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,059
But I'm not sure if we'd live up to it.

1896
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,658
What about Ariana Grande?

1897
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:21,228
I feel like that's too soft.

1898
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:23,429
1MILLION would do Ariana Grande. I see it.

1899
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,099
Beyonce. Or I can do Rihanna as well.

1900
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,129
(Will they choose either Rihanna or Beyonce?)

1901
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:29,739
I have worked with Rihanna.

1902
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,669
(Kirsten has experience of working with her...)

1903
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,045
(for fashion shows and the Super Bowl.)

1904
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:34,686
(Will they go with Rihanna as she has experience?)

1905
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,340
I think Beyonce.

1906
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:39,279
- What about you, Ling? - Beyonce.

1907
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,578
Beyonce.

1908
01:19:40,579 --> 01:19:43,478
JAM REPUBLIC picked Beyonce.

1909
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,818
I think she has queen power...

1910
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:49,358
as well. And we wanted to show a variety.

1911
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:50,719
Actually, a small part of me...

1912
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,589
wanted her song, "Crazy in Love."

1913
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:54,999
When he said, "the queen of queens," he said...

1914
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,260
Beyonce.

1915
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,369
The queen of queens, Beyonce.

1916
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:01,228
- The queen of queens? - The queen of queens? MANNEQUEEN.

1917
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,500
("The queen of queens" is the intro line for MANNEQUEEN.)

1918
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,669
I thought she was the perfect artist for our final performance.

1919
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:08,709
So our crew must get her no matter what.

1920
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:10,978
(Both JAM REPUBLIC and MANNEQUEEN chose Beyonce.)

1921
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:12,909
There's an announcement.

1922
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,879
An hour later from now...

1923
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,948
Okay. What?

1924
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:19,389
The open performance of the artist each crew chose will begin.

1925
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:23,459
(They must copy the choreography of the artist for 40 seconds.)

1926
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,389
Then the crew that chose Ariana Grande...

1927
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:26,788
will copy her choreography.

1928
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:29,559
You don't have to copy it exactly the same.

1929
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,528
We want you to add a little bit of your crew colour...

1930
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,528
based on the choreography.

1931
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,739
As always, we're fighting for the songs.

1932
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:39,209
(The crews must compete by dancing the choreography...)

1933
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,680
(if their choices overlap.)

1934
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:44,038
"Single Ladies."

1935
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,108
(The crew who chose Beyonce...)

1936
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:46,809
(must copy the choreography for "Single Ladies.")

1937
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:48,210
Come to think of it, we have heels.

1938
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:50,119
- We can wear the same outfits. - We can.

1939
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,488
(The outfits they wore for the Elimination Battle...)

1940
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:53,489
(are perfect for this song.)

1941
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:54,889
As we're performing a pop star's song,

1942
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:58,329
we must win over the judges with our looks and image.

1943
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,030
(Their Final Mission is at stake...)

1944
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,799
(on this very important decision of picking the global artist.)

1945
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,629
(The 4 crews have gathered to perform the choreography.)

1946
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,328
This is the Global Artist Mission.

1947
01:21:05,329 --> 01:21:08,439
I'm curious to find out as to which crew chose which artist.

1948
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:12,309
You will reveal your decisions through your performances.

1949
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:15,139
The first crew to perform is 1MILLION.

1950
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,310
- Okay. - Okay.

1951
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:19,009
(1MILLION always goes first.)

1952
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,109
The sink-or-swim spirit.

1953
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,349
- What do you think they chose? - Lady Gaga.

1954
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,619
I'm betting at Beyonce.

1955
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,689
Ariana.

1956
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:27,988
(The other crews don't know which artist they chose.)

1957
01:21:27,989 --> 01:21:31,989
(Which global artist did 1MILLION choose?)

1958
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:38,369
(1MILLION chose Beyonce.)

1959
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:41,069
They'll overlap with us.

1960
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,398
Gosh, that was shocking.

1961
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:44,569
(Including JAM REPUBLIC, three crews chose Beyonce.)

1962
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,840
No way.

1963
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:48,909
(In despair)

1964
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:52,879
I think we should go with the song we're the most confident with.

1965
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,879
I want a song with a bit of charisma.

1966
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,419
Beyonce or Rihanna.

1967
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,420
Beyonce's songs have a lot more wow moments.

1968
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,688
As for Rihanna,

1969
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:02,419
her songs go like this.

1970
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,528
With Beyonce's songs, you get to unleash your passion.

1971
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:06,828
(Beyonce has an explosive vocal.)

1972
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:08,429
With her music alone,

1973
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,099
you can feel her explosive energy.

1974
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,868
So if we were to win Beyonce,

1975
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:16,270
we'd have an advantage over the other crews.

1976
01:22:16,369 --> 01:22:20,238
(1MILLION also finds out about the open performance.)

1977
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,539
Okay. What?

1978
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:25,049
The phrase, "interim check,"

1979
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:27,078
instils fear in me.

1980
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:29,319
"Interim check."

1981
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:32,849
The fear of K-pop Death match Mission...

1982
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,250
is looming over me.

1983
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:36,459
(She had a hard time learning the moves before the Song Battle.)

1984
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:38,465
(She had a hard time learning the moves before the Song Battle.)

1985
01:22:38,489 --> 01:22:41,658
Everyone knows that I'm not so great...

1986
01:22:41,659 --> 01:22:43,559
at memorizing the choreography.

1987
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,100
So I decided to follow the spirit of "sink-or-swim."

1988
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,238
Left, right.

1989
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:52,909
(How will 1MILLION execute "Single Ladies?")

1990
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:06,618
(Focused)

1991
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:07,720
(Focused as well)

1992
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,050
(1MILLION finished the performance with an impactful move.)

1993
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,289
We must win the battle and take Beyonce for ourselves.

1994
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:44,688
After watching 1MILLION's performance,

1995
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:47,559
I thought it looked fancy because they added in...

1996
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,329
a lot of formations even though they were only given a short time.

1997
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,328
But there were parts that their moves didn't stand out.

1998
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,299
So that was a bit disappointing.

1999
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,009
First of all, I thought it was a bit vague that...

2000
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:02,879
I couldn't find a specific part of this choreography that...

2001
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,179
showed the unique crew colour of 1MILLION.

2002
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,460
So that was a bit disappointing.

2003
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:08,978
I thought it was simple.

2004
01:24:08,979 --> 01:24:12,589
And it was great that you stuck to the original choreography.

2005
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,519
But I think something a little different...

2006
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,659
and a change of tempo would have been better.

2007
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,890
(1MILLION's open performance is over.)

2008
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:21,559
(BEBE will continue with their open performance.)

2009
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,200
I wonder which artist they chose. Ariana?

2010
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,329
- Ariana Grande. - Ariana.

2011
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:26,698
It's a ponytail.

2012
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:27,699
(She's wearing a ponytail like Ariana Grande.)

2013
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,470
(You know what I'm talking about, right?)

2014
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:34,039
(Which global artist did BEBE choose?)

2015
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:36,779
Let's go.

2016
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,149
(BEBE chose Beyonce as their global artist.)

2017
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,419
(It's Beyonce again.)

2018
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,659
(Are you serious?)

2019
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:52,560
- Oh, my gosh. - Gosh.

2020
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:55,259
(Shocked)

2021
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,629
(Everyone is having a mental breakdown.)

2022
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:58,199
BEBE chose Beyonce?

2023
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:00,199
I didn't think it was a good fit.

2024
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,639
We have to think about our final performance.

2025
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,608
We must decide what we want to show people.

2026
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:06,938
That way, we can choose an artist.

2027
01:25:06,939 --> 01:25:10,078
It's something we always talked about doing.

2028
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,125
Personally, I want to show a different side of our crew.

2029
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,809
We must be smart about our decision.

2030
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:16,449
We've only shown strong and intense performances.

2031
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:23,818
(BEBE mostly put on gender-neutral and powerful performances so far.)

2032
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:26,859
We should pick a song that will help us show a different side of us.

2033
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,799
- Our 1st choice would be Beyonce. - Our 1st choice would be Beyonce.

2034
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,728
- Beyonce always delivers. - Right.

2035
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:34,769
I think she's the perfect artist for the kind of performance...

2036
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,639
we wanted to put on for our final stage.

2037
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,709
We must go with Beyonce no matter what.

2038
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:41,909
We can show people that we can be queens and super feminine.

2039
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,279
To show people an unexpected side of us, we must get Beyonce.

2040
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:46,948
I think we'll be able...

2041
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:49,779
to show people that our crew colour and the word, "diva,"

2042
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,220
can be used interchangeably.

2043
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:54,520
(How will their version of "Single Ladies" look?)

2044
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,310
They stuck to their style.

2045
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:27,590
(Funky Y loves it.)

2046
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,220
Hey!

2047
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,398
(Queen Bada)

2048
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:45,640
(Acknowledging)

2049
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,038
They were so good.

2050
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:49,278
They're going to break the stage.

2051
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,309
We are determined to have people call us "divas."

2052
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,510
So we really want to win.

2053
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,778
First of all, the intro showed a unique style of your crew.

2054
01:26:56,779 --> 01:26:59,789
Thanks to that, you drew us in right away.

2055
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:03,889
But I thought the formations lacked in variety.

2056
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,188
So it didn't look as grand.

2057
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:07,988
A part of me did wonder if you guys did the song justice...

2058
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:10,228
and reflected the mood of the song...

2059
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,170
in your choreography.

2060
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:16,499
I believe that from the get-go, BEBE showed BEBE's style...

2061
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,938
which I loved.

2062
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:20,738
The only thing was that from the beginning,

2063
01:27:20,739 --> 01:27:22,710
there were really no formation changes.

2064
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,109
I really liked the last formation.

2065
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,948
But some parts needed a bit more fine-tuning,

2066
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:29,989
so that was disappointing.

2067
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,049
But we still managed to fulfill our intention...

2068
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:34,719
and showed them our colour.

2069
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,689
We were very happy with it.

2070
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:39,189
(JAM REPUBLIC is next.)

2071
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:40,366
I wonder which artist they chose.

2072
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,430
(They strike up their poses and wait for the song.)

2073
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,560
Their first pose is quite similar

2074
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:45,729
Hey, this is bad.

2075
01:27:46,069 --> 01:27:47,729
Look. This is the pose.

2076
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,999
(JAM REPUBLIC starts a similar pose like the other two crews...)

2077
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,640
(that chose Beyonce.)

2078
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:56,051
- Gosh, seriously? No way. - Did everyone choose Beyonce?

2079
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,579
(Yes, we chose Beyonce.)

2080
01:27:59,409 --> 01:28:00,679
(They find this hilarious.)

2081
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,810
Seriously?

2082
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,919
- Come on! - Gosh.

2083
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,449
(She's captivated.)

2084
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:24,640
Nice.

2085
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,269
(Watching more closely than anyone)

2086
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,449
(Focused Lia)

2087
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:50,829
Hey.

2088
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:53,500
Okay.

2089
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,829
It could change.

2090
01:28:55,069 --> 01:28:56,599
I can only hope...

2091
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,840
they felt the power that we brought.

2092
01:28:58,909 --> 01:29:00,038
First of all,

2093
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:03,239
I thought it was well-coordinated, personally.

2094
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:07,978
Structurally, if there had been something that caught the eye more,

2095
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:09,949
it might have been better. That's what I think.

2096
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,118
Even though it was good overall,

2097
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:16,460
the ending could have been more explosive.

2098
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,280
I think that might've suited the dance more.

2099
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,788
I felt like you showed me exactly what I expected...

2100
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:23,199
of JAM REPUBLIC on the Maginot Line,

2101
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:27,129
so I felt I would've been more impressed if you went beyond that.

2102
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:30,539
I think I expected a bit more.

2103
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,609
(The last to go is MANNEQUEEN.)

2104
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,039
They're dancing in heels.

2105
01:29:34,109 --> 01:29:36,078
No way. Are they doing Beyonce too?

2106
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,879
Are all four crews really dancing to Beyonce?

2107
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,010
All four are doing Beyonce?

2108
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,060
Even the whole beginning.

2109
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,260
(Gosh)

2110
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:54,829
They're going to dance this?

2111
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:57,000
They don't miss a single detail.

2112
01:29:57,659 --> 01:30:01,068
(Unlike the other crews, MANNEQUEEN does the intro too.)

2113
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:02,140
That's ridiculous.

2114
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:06,770
(Playing for the fourth time, "Single Ladies" by Beyonce)

2115
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,639
I never thought...

2116
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,010
that even MANNEQUEEN would choose the same song.

2117
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:14,679
(All four crews chose Beyonce.)

2118
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,979
How did all four crews choose "Single Ladies?"

2119
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,550
This is insane.

2120
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:33,869
They abandoned the rest.

2121
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:38,038
(The three blondes dance in the center.)

2122
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,368
When they had only three people dancing, and then people waiting,

2123
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,810
it felt very disconnected.

2124
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:49,750
(Focused)

2125
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,819
(Impressed)

2126
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:18,738
We added in our own colour, using waacking and wearing heels,

2127
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:20,310
so I really think we did well.

2128
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:23,618
First of all, you showed us many compositions in a short time.

2129
01:31:23,619 --> 01:31:25,448
You showed MANNEQUEEN's waacking in the dance,

2130
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:28,220
and I liked how you added in your style,

2131
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,719
but because you had many parts that were divided up,

2132
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,029
I didn't know where to look at times.

2133
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,129
- That's true. - Yes.

2134
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:36,699
Maybe it was that. Disconnection.

2135
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:41,329
For the chorus, the attack by the three blondes was great,

2136
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:43,299
but the three who were waiting...

2137
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:46,509
were just standing still for what felt like a long time.

2138
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:49,510
After that, I couldn't focus as much on the dance.

2139
01:31:53,149 --> 01:31:55,010
Now that all the songs have been selected,

2140
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,020
we will begin the voting for our internal evaluation.

2141
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:00,318
We can just pick the one that performed the best.

2142
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:02,559
I think there will be a big difference in votes.

2143
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,219
(Artist Selection Internal Evaluation)

2144
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,788
(Crews must vote for the crew that performed Beyonce the best, )

2145
01:32:05,789 --> 01:32:07,460
(but cannot vote for their own crew.)

2146
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:09,729
We will now reveal the results.

2147
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:10,898
Here they come.

2148
01:32:10,899 --> 01:32:12,899
I can't tell if I'm cold or nervous.

2149
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:15,529
Right? I got goosebumps. I think I'm nervous.

2150
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,500
Every moment is a challenge.

2151
01:32:17,939 --> 01:32:19,038
We're going to work hard,

2152
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:20,739
so I really hope we get picked.

2153
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,809
We need to capture Beyonce.

2154
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:24,238
(Global Artist Mission What will the results be?)

2155
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,978
(Voting results: 14 votes, 8 votes, 2 votes, 0 votes)

2156
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:28,549
(The votes that each crew received are revealed first.)

2157
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:30,148
(The crew in 1st place received 14 votes.)

2158
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:32,118
(The crew in last place received 0 votes.)

2159
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:33,520
There's one that got zero votes.

2160
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:36,159
I think BEBE got zero votes.

2161
01:32:36,189 --> 01:32:38,489
We're not the ones with zero votes, right?

2162
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,090
I hope that's us.

2163
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:42,699
I think JAM REPUBLIC got 14 votes.

2164
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,260
Either them, or us.

2165
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,029
I can't watch.

2166
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:47,469
- What? - Why? What happened?

2167
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:50,068
(An unexpected result?)

2168
01:32:50,069 --> 01:32:51,769
(Which crew will capture the artist, Beyonce?)

2169
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:53,915
(Join the audience at the Finals of Street Woman Fighter 2.)

2170
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:56,140
I want Beyonce no matter what.

2171
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:58,908
I think it's fitting that we get Beyonce.

2172
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:01,050
We definitely need to get Beyonce.

2173
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:02,849
The real queens are here.

2174
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:03,955
That's why Queen Beyonce should be ours.

2175
01:33:03,979 --> 01:33:05,349
(What is the final result of the Artist Selection?)

2176
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,688
(JAM REPUBLIC, 14 votes, BEBE, 8 votes)

2177
01:33:06,689 --> 01:33:08,188
(MANNEQUEEN, 2 votes, 1MILLION, 0 votes)

2178
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:10,858
(JAM REPUBLIC, 14 votes)

2179
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:14,159
(JAM REPUBLIC won Beyonce with 14 votes.)

2180
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:15,329
Everyone, you did great.

2181
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:18,828
- Thank you, guys. - Thank you.

2182
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:19,970
Congratulations.

2183
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:23,260
JAM REPUBLIC showed off their own style with the song.

2184
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:24,609
It was only after five seconds,

2185
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,038
when I was like, "just take it!"

2186
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:30,578
How could they get it so clean, tidy, and perfect in just an hour?

2187
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:32,810
I think it really showed their individual influences.

2188
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:36,318
I'm very happy.

2189
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:40,250
I'm excited to put our piece together for the finale.

2190
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:42,819
I'm going to show you who the real queen is.

2191
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:44,889
(JAM REPUBLIC, Beyonce)

2192
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:45,929
(1MILLION, 0 votes)

2193
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:47,390
No one chose 1MILLION.

2194
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:48,460
We're used to this.

2195
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:51,329
- We got 0 votes. - We got 0 votes.

2196
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,669
I agree that we didn't do well.

2197
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:56,398
I think we have to acknowledge that,

2198
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:57,970
but getting zero votes...

2199
01:33:58,039 --> 01:33:59,469
was still shocking.

2200
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:01,670
How could we get zero votes?

2201
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,680
Let's pick the artist whose songs we can do well.

2202
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,050
We can just...

2203
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:08,879
- It's easy for us. - We don't even have to discuss.

2204
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,279
BEBE chose the artist,

2205
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:12,488
Rihanna.

2206
01:34:12,489 --> 01:34:14,549
(BEBE chooses Rihanna.)

2207
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:15,719
MANNEQUEEN...

2208
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,789
chose Lady Gaga.

2209
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:18,889
(1MILLION automatically gets Ariana Grande.)

2210
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:19,960
That suits us so well.

2211
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,559
(BEBE, Rihanna, 1MILLION, Ariana Grande)

2212
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,198
(JAM REPUBLIC, Beyonce, MANNEQUEEN, Lady Gaga)

2213
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,228
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2214
01:34:24,229 --> 01:34:27,328
(The long-awaited finals)

2215
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:28,430
It's the Finals now.

2216
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:29,849
I'm going to get greedy for this.

2217
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,800
JAM REPUBLIC is going to win.

2218
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:33,969
My crew...

2219
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:36,539
will take this trophy home no matter what.

2220
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:40,180
I think we'll end up the crew in first place, in the end.

2221
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:42,179
(The last four crews to make it into the Finals)

2222
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,319
1MILLION.

2223
01:34:43,579 --> 01:34:44,720
BEBE.

2224
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:46,189
JAM REPUBLIC.

2225
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,789
MANNEQUEEN.

2226
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:52,430
(Final Mission, Global Artist Mission)

2227
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,889
(The Global Artist Mission)

2228
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,559
(1MILLION discusses the song they want to choose.)

2229
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,929
She just has too many songs.

2230
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:01,429
We've made so many dances for Ariana Grande...

2231
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,738
at 1MILLION.

2232
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,470
She's basically our cousin.

2233
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:07,839
There's no better music to dance to than Ariana Grande's.

2234
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,840
(Totally agreeing)

2235
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:11,609
(What will be the final performance that 1MILLION prepares?)

2236
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:14,509
(BEBE also discusses their song for the Global Artist Mission.)

2237
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:17,679
First of all, Rihanna is seductive...

2238
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,949
and gives off a sexy vibe very well.

2239
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:22,249
(Let's show off a side of ourselves that's totally new and unexpected.)

2240
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,419
Like, "who are they?"

2241
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,720
I think that kind of reaction could be more explosive.

2242
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,889
(This place gives off a careless vibe.)

2243
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:29,060
Are you ready?

2244
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,799
(A mad dance party)

2245
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,299
What's going on?

2246
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,300
(Screaming)

2247
01:35:36,739 --> 01:35:37,799
Look at how prepared she is!

2248
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,140
(Why is the mad dance party going on?)

2249
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:46,579
(Which crew will win and be 1st globally in dance?)

2250
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:49,550
We're pour in all of our souls.

2251
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,179
We'll get this no matter what.

2252
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:53,819
I think we'll get the trophy.

2253
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:57,019
JAM REPUBLIC is ready for finals.

2254
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,389
We're aiming for first place.

2255
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:59,759
We can win definitively.

2256
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,920
I'm totally confident we can.

2257
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:03,129
The finals will be scored by crew song performance votes...

2258
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:05,059
and live broadcast text votes.

2259
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,199
These votes will determine which crew will win.

2260
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:11,898
(On October 31, the winning crew will be chosen on a live broadcast.)

2261
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:16,140
(Please vote for a crew song performance to determine a winner!)
