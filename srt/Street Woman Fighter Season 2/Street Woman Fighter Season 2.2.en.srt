1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,208
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,950
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,810
(Amazed)

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,348
Amazing.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:16,518
The one that looks like lettuce stands out.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,558
(The back of her head is exactly like green lettuce.)

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,928
How could you call it lettuce?

8
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,788
(Halo warms up.)

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,429
Ms. Lettuce is looking good.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,800
(Halo has acquired the nickname of Lettuce.)

11
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,629
(I see.)

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,268
The one in the green outfit. I keep looking at her like crazy.

13
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,340
She resembled Yu Aoi when she had long, straight hair.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,609
Vessi resembles HyunA.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,280
NOB looks just like Hwang Bo.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,979
She does.

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,750
Who's Funky Y, by the way?

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,478
The one that resembles Kolleen Park.

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,679
(Funky Y)

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,648
Yoonji looks like a quokka.

21
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,789
A happy quokka.

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,490
She looks like Lisa.

23
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,829
(Who's the dancer that resembles Lisa from BLACKPINK?)

24
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,398
(Kirsten looks just like her when she smiles.)

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,099
She's just like Lisa when she smiles.

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,130
(Kirsten looks just like her when she smiles.)

27
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,098
She's pretty. I've never seen her in person.

28
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,640
- Really? - Who?

29
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,769
Bada.

30
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,370
- She's got the boyish vibe. - Right.

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,378
- She looks like Kim Yeon Koung. - Totally.

32
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:12,839
- A tough girl. - Right.

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,609
Ladies are into that style.

34
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,010
I should have brought a wedding ring.

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,079
Street Woman Fighter Season 2.

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,389
(The first dance-off, )

37
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,750
(No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer)

38
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,859
(You're still an eighth-grader to me.)

39
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,829
(She's absolutely insane.)

40
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,030
(The best dance-off that everyone loved)

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,760
(It's finally here.)

42
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,299
(Am I supposed to keep playing along?)

43
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,670
(How will the battle end between Lia Kim and Mina Myoung?)

44
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,670
(The fiercer dance-off begins now.)

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,969
(Vote for the crew's performance to determine the final winner!)

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,310
As the weakest dancer, I pick...

47
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,919
Mina Myoung from Deep N Dap.

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,289
(1MILLION's Lia Kim versus Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung)

49
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,349
Mina Myoung.

50
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,260
I've been waiting for this moment.

51
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,129
It's the battle of the grown-ups!

52
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,560
I wanted this.

53
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,329
I'm standing up for this.

54
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,198
This is for real, and it hits differently.

55
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,800
It's no longer fun.

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
This match-up has finally happened.

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,439
I know why they're on bad terms.

58
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,539
There must be some things that need to be talked about.

59
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,580
I heard that it ended badly...

60
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,949
and that they completely split up.

61
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,718
Mina and Lia will face each other.

62
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,788
That's insane.

63
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,659
And here we are with our popcorn.

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,689
"Oh, my goodness!"

65
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,388
I asked her to increase the draft payment.

66
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,899
When I created the most drafts by myself,

67
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
I came up with two drafts a week.

68
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,198
I could barely sleep ten hours during one whole week.

69
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,069
But that payment raise never happened.

70
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,938
It's supposed to help...

71
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,709
both the artist and the crew grow together.

72
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,049
She offered a term that would cause us harm,

73
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,120
so we naturally couldn't accept it.

74
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,818
(Mina brought the draft into question.)

75
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,859
Tina was an assistant choreographer.

76
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,989
She taught the dancers for drafts.

77
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,060
Maybe she was mistaken from that.

78
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,330
But I was the one...

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,729
who came up with the choreography itself.

80
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,069
I thought, "Has she ever created one whole choreography?"

81
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,168
For MAMAMOO's choreography,

82
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,538
I stayed up all night with her.

83
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,840
We both worked all night on that,

84
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,039
so I couldn't understand what she was complaining about.

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,209
You seemed to have a lot of complaints.

86
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,918
It's not that I had complaints.

87
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,849
The title of the chief choreographer of 1MILLION.

88
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:37,860
I wonder if you earned that...

89
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,090
solely with your effort.

90
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,430
It's not like I stole it from anyone.

91
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,599
Can I say one more thing?

92
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,370
She talks too much.

93
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,430
Can you be quiet?

94
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,469
Can you be quiet?

95
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,009
Sure.

96
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,348
Let's just get on with it. It feels like crap.

97
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,879
Okay! Let's do this!

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,819
I guess she has a hard time controlling her emotions.

99
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,418
Try meditating, then.

100
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,860
Good luck.

101
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,430
She probably thinks that I can't freestyle,

102
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,500
so it's about time I show her.

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,859
I'd like her to show me by dancing...

104
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,670
what direction she was trying to take.

105
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,639
Are they actually going to fight?

106
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,838
This program is about fighting.

107
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,509
- That's true. - It has "Fighter" in the title.

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,008
The two dancers' battle begins now.

109
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,410
- Yes! - Let's go!

110
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,909
(Make some noise!)

111
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,209
Let's go!

112
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,648
You guys ready?

113
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,318
Let's go!

114
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,449
(Bring it on.)

115
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,490
Fight!

116
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,519
Let's go!

117
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,790
I'll stomp on you.

118
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,629
Okay.

119
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,040
She's doing the same thing over again.

120
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,540
Are you mad?

121
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,480
I wanted to get under her skin.

122
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,850
(Screaming)

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,990
(She accidentally bumped into her as it was too close.)

124
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,519
She hit her.

125
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,329
They're actually fighting.

126
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,688
It's a real fight!

127
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,199
It's dangerous. Be careful.

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,860
- Fight! - Let's go!

129
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,898
She was all up in my face, and I wasn't sure.

130
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,699
- Please move back. - Chill.

131
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,410
Don't touch!

132
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,370
Don't touch!

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,008
No fighting. Don't...

134
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,779
No.

135
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,619
Don't touch!

136
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,490
No touching!

137
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,949
- Don't touch! - No touching!

138
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,220
Back up.

139
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,730
She gritted her teeth.

140
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,100
I've never seen her like that.

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,699
I feel like crying.

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,410
Five, four, three, two, one.

143
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,309
(It's so scary.)

144
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,579
(I'm terrified.)

145
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,648
One! Switch.

146
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,519
Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung.

147
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,319
Okay.

148
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,959
She's been waiting for this exact moment.

149
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,889
I badly wanted to win.

150
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,128
She should at least try.

151
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,300
Give me your best.

152
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,740
Okay!

153
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,509
Okay!

154
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,490
Queen bee!

155
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,800
(Impressed)

156
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,100
Look at her facial expressions.

157
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,310
Five, four, three, two, one.

158
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,839
The battle's over!

159
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,749
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

160
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,879
- Well done. - Is that allowed?

161
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,849
That was fun. One more time.

162
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,388
That was feisty.

163
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,290
We literally need popcorn.

164
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,289
- Was she hit? - Lightly.

165
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,689
As they were dancing.

166
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,459
Let us determine the winner of this battle.

167
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,529
How are we supposed to decide?

168
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,670
(It's so difficult to be the judge.)

169
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,629
I think it's going to be a tie.

170
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,768
Yes, I agree.

171
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,370
- It's tough to decide. - Right.

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,439
I thought that I showed them as much as I could.

173
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,639
I think I'll win. I'm positive.

174
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,550
Three, two, one.

175
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,049
(Monika held both cards up.)

176
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,720
(What?)

177
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,720
(What's the result of the battle between two leaders?)

178
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:03,859
One.

179
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,388
(Shownu chooses Deep N Dap.)

180
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,359
(What's Mike Song's decision?)

181
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,060
(Deep N Dap)

182
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,629
(Lia Kim of 1MILLION loses.)

183
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,899
(Mina Myoung of Deep N Dap wins.)

184
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,209
(Deep N Dap won the first battle against 1MILLION.)

185
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,009
One invalid ballot.

186
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,209
With a score of 2 to 0,

187
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,490
Mina Myoung of Deep N Dap has defeated...

188
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,289
Lia Kim of 1MILLION.

189
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,789
You never know what will happen in a dance-off until you see it.

190
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,829
She won that with grit and guts.

191
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,189
It's her first win.

192
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,159
That's right.

193
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,830
Even if I lose the rest of the battles today,

194
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,070
I won't mind.

195
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,440
(Covering her mouth)

196
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,110
It's terrifying.

197
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,820
Monika, what's your opinion on this battle?

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,419
To be honest, I didn't like it.

199
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,689
Probably because I know how good they both are.

200
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,830
They were quite emotional just now,

201
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,158
and the movements were to criticize each other.

202
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,499
For an honest battle of dance moves,

203
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,699
they were way too emotional,

204
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,669
and we never got to see their full abilities.

205
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,940
I couldn't help but feel ashamed.

206
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,709
It was a shameful battle...

207
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,610
as I couldn't show people my best moves.

208
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,849
And they were...

209
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,778
the founding members of 1MILLION.

210
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,619
I totally agree that Mina played...

211
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,449
a huge part in our history.

212
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,359
1MILLION couldn't have come this far without her.

213
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,589
So, I get why she's so upset.

214
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,429
I'd like to apologize to her if I get a chance.

215
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,128
(Feeling mixed emotions, )

216
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:59,399
(Mina Myoung is deep in thought.)

217
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,370
(The Battle with the Weakest Dancer continues.)

218
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,879
The next one up on the 1-on-1 battle is...

219
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,408
(Nervous)

220
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,079
(Hearts racing)

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,979
Ling of JAM REPUBLIC.

222
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,589
(Ling)

223
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,590
Ling.

224
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:17,489
- Nice. - I finally get to see her battle.

225
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,759
- You got it, Ling. - Of course.

226
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,589
(I know her!)

227
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,059
- In Royal Family... - She's the only Asian.

228
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,369
Maybe people heard of Royal Family.

229
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,669
I think I was the only Asian for a while.

230
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,308
(Ling is a world-famous performer and former member of Royal Family.)

231
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:38,878
Do we want to pick an opponent we can actually challenge?

232
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,710
- Or do we want to chill? - Right.

233
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,709
I've never battled before.

234
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,479
So see what it's like to have...

235
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,549
an amazing battler standing before me for my first battle.

236
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,459
The No Respect Dancer...

237
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,519
Is it you, Cera?

238
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,830
(Startled)

239
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,758
I'm curious who chose Cera.

240
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,029
Could it turn out to be Ling?

241
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,229
That could be possible.

242
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,829
Ling is very flexible as well.

243
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,039
You two also have similar vibes.

244
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,099
(Who did Ling choose to battle?)

245
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,570
(Cera)

246
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,610
Cera from MANNEQUEEN.

247
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,539
See?

248
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,648
(Exclaiming in surprise)

249
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,480
Here it comes.

250
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,648
(Gosh!)

251
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,720
This will be fun.

252
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,250
Dopamine!

253
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,019
- Come on. - Let's go, Cera.

254
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,320
You've waited a long time, Cera.

255
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,558
Let's go.

256
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,690
(Intimidating her opponent)

257
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,230
(Exclaiming)

258
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,600
- You got this. - Go, Ling. Let's go.

259
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,369
Here they are.

260
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,600
Why me?

261
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,909
I think she made the wrong choice.

262
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,279
I'm going to pick an amazing battler.

263
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,609
(During the crew lineup reveal)

264
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,638
- Cera? - What?

265
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,979
She has that famous video.

266
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,648
- The green dress. - Right.

267
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,779
- Yes, that's very famous. - I know it.

268
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,450
Cera, who got ten million views.

269
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,489
She got so many views for just her battling video.

270
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,489
It's gotten over 16 million views now.

271
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,889
That's how she got her nickname Ten Million Cera.

272
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,699
She has clean, balanced moves,

273
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,429
and flexibility.

274
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,329
- She's well-balanced. - She's well-balanced.

275
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,099
- We can tell. - She has a strong core.

276
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,940
Her sub-genre is ballet.

277
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,470
She does ballet?

278
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,638
Cera has a ballet background.

279
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,308
I also have a ballet background.

280
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,250
She wants to battle with flexibility?

281
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,850
(World-famous performer versus Dark horse battler)

282
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,389
Flexibility versus flexibility? Let's do this.

283
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,449
Get that confidence. Let's go.

284
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,788
This will be mind-blowing.

285
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,220
I'm looking forward to this.

286
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,459
We will now begin the battle of the two dancers.

287
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,428
- Are you guys ready? - Yes.

288
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:38,459
(Let's go!)

289
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,200
Watch and learn, you guys.

290
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,629
Fight.

291
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,569
(Her look changes.)

292
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,200
Come on.

293
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,879
She shouldn't waack.

294
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,089
She's suddenly waacking?

295
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,758
She'll have to learn how to twirl again.

296
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,460
Look at Cera's face.

297
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,969
(Slipping)

298
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,000
Fight.

299
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,110
She was so much worse than I expected.

300
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580
(Slapping)

301
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,518
If my opponent touches me,

302
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,190
I get highly motivated.

303
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,460
Three, two, one.

304
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,058
Switch. Cera from MANNEQUEEN.

305
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,129
Let's go.

306
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,360
It's my song.

307
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,699
This is insane. Let's go.

308
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,969
- This is your song. - Let's go.

309
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,799
Gosh.

310
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,569
She doesn't even blink.

311
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,210
Let's go. Show her.

312
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,809
Didn't she pick me to see this?

313
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,309
Then I'll show you my signature move.

314
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,610
Watch closely.

315
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,349
(Her mouth drops open.)

316
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,289
My gosh.

317
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,959
Body control. Skills. Nice.

318
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,999
(Beat kill!)

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,500
- Body control. Skills. Nice. - Work.

320
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,399
Hey.

321
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:32,509
(Highly satisfactory)

322
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,580
It's over.

323
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,820
She's standing in that position.

324
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,149
I stuck it in her face.

325
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,259
That's right.

326
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,389
(Tapping)

327
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,190
What was that?

328
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,589
(A touch for a touch.)

329
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,859
She's a true battler.

330
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,859
- Go. - Let's go.

331
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,330
That's it.

332
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,830
That's right.

333
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,840
Battle over.

334
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,109
Come on. Good job.

335
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,138
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

336
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,740
Give us more.

337
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,008
That was unbelievable.

338
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,249
Did you see her balance?

339
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,849
How long was she standing on one foot?

340
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,850
(Copying Cera's signature move)

341
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,220
That was awesome.

342
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,359
(My goodness.)

343
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,589
I'm okay.

344
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,388
- I tried, guys. - You're fine.

345
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,389
- Don't worry. - You're fine.

346
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,459
Anyone could see I won.

347
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,000
It could be nothing but complete victory.

348
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,869
Fight judges, open your cards.

349
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,169
Three, two, one.

350
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,700
One.

351
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,840
(Cera wins 3 to 0.)

352
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,909
Very good.

353
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,808
(Blowing a kiss)

354
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,449
You did a great job.

355
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,479
You did great.

356
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,719
You did your first battle.

357
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,979
- First battle chance? - You did your first battle.

358
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,849
First battle chance. My gosh.

359
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,388
I'm really proud of myself...

360
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,518
for having done my first battle and to have...

361
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,559
my first battle with a very professional battler.

362
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,469
The next battler up...

363
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,470
(Who is up next for No Respect Battle with the Weakest Dancer?)

364
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,000
- is Mini from Wolf'Lo. - Nice.

365
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,508
- Let's go. - Let's go.

366
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,539
Pink girl.

367
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,709
Pink girl.

368
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,909
(She is pink from head to toe.)

369
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,548
You're the only Type I. Sit in the middle.

370
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,518
- Hello. - Hello.

371
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,850
My scalp is sweaty, but I can't give up my hat.

372
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,320
Pink Lover.

373
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,719
My nails and hair are pink.

374
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,259
My blouse is a light pink. My jacket and bag are pink.

375
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,859
Hi, I'm the Pink Lover of Wolf'Lo.

376
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,799
I'm Mini, the hip-hop dancer.

377
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,138
"The pink dancer?"

378
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,768
I've heard that several times.

379
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:43,908
I don't think there is a hip-hop dancer that doesn't know me.

380
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:46,339
I always dance...

381
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,850
wearing pink.

382
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,878
I wanted to choose...

383
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,919
(Who did Mini, the pink dancer, choose to battle?)

384
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,019
someone pink to battle.

385
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,919
(Pink pants)

386
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,620
(Pink crew)

387
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,329
I'd love to show you who the winner in pink is,

388
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,699
but the dancer I chose...

389
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,338
is Akanen from TSUBA KILL.

390
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,170
(Akanen)

391
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,469
- Akanen. - Akanen.

392
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,539
Akanen.

393
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,710
- All right. - Let's go.

394
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,150
Is it Korea versus Japan?

395
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,778
The battle between Korea and Japan is insane.

396
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,849
(The Korea versus Japan dance battle begins.)

397
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,548
This will be interesting.

398
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,749
I love this battle.

399
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,749
I think it will be amazing.

400
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,518
Japan has an older street culture...

401
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,459
- than we do. - Way older.

402
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,629
They have strong basic skills.

403
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,599
They're all good at hip-hop.

404
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:40,828
I'm very proud of my dance.

405
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:44,740
In Japan, dance is part of compulsory education.

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,399
Many people start dancing when they are little...

407
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,470
and continue.

408
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,139
Many people are good at dancing, choreography,

409
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,710
and battling.

410
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,348
Many Korean dancers went to Japan to learn.

411
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,818
Even I went to learn.

412
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,059
I can't help but admit the Japanese are good at dancing.

413
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:09,489
Akanen was like a celebrity to me.

414
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,828
She's a celebrity among dancers.

415
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,459
(During the crew reveal)

416
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,028
(They are all shocked.)

417
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,970
What? Seriously?

418
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,269
What?

419
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:18,700
- Akanen? - Akanen.

420
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,000
(This is unbelievable.)

421
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:24,639
I think she is the top choreographer in Japan.

422
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,909
Akanen is the pride of Japan.

423
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,179
Akanen is creative...

424
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,009
and has good judgement as a leader.

425
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,588
- Akanen. I see. - Is it really Akanen?

426
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,649
- Hip-hop. - It's hip-hop.

427
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,890
Japan likes hip-hop.

428
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,618
(Watching carefully)

429
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,890
It was...

430
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,558
uninspiring.

431
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,558
I thought Japan was very good at hip-hop.

432
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,259
Is she really a hip-hop dancer?

433
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,068
TSUBA KILL, seriously.

434
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,539
- Seriously. - I'll kill them.

435
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,740
I'll now have to show them what I can do.

436
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,709
I believe Japanese crews...

437
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,319
have stronger dance skills.

438
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,149
(I am confident.)

439
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,989
You can't hold back if it becomes an international battle.

440
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,289
Mini will give it everything.

441
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,788
Bring it on, Korea versus Japan.

442
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,028
Since it's a battle between Korea and Japan,

443
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,199
I will give it everything I have...

444
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,499
to return to Japan as a winner.

445
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,028
(If Korea and Japan battles with dance, )

446
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,700
(Japan is stronger.)

447
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,269
(I'll beat everyone!)

448
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,910
Show them the power of Korea.

449
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,339
I will show them the power of Japan.

450
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,309
This is a great opportunity to see Akanen dance.

451
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,649
The two dancers' battle begins now.

452
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,849
Are you guys ready?

453
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,779
Fight.

454
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,390
(Mini goes first.)

455
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,759
Here she is.

456
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,890
Let's go!

457
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,769
My gosh, I'm scared.

458
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,779
Let's go!

459
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,089
What? She made a mistake.

460
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,960
I think I pulled a muscle in my back.

461
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,759
Pull yourself together. You have to focus.

462
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,740
She isn't as good as I thought.

463
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,480
Is that it?

464
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,250
Nice.

465
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,589
Nice.

466
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,829
Two, one.

467
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,959
Switch.

468
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,799
Akanen from TSUBA KILL.

469
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,200
I'm way better than her...

470
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,170
when it comes to skills.

471
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,170
I will show them here.

472
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,269
Let's go.

473
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,319
Gosh. That's amazing.

474
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,220
Bring it on. I'll battle you all you want.

475
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,930
Let's go.

476
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,730
Nice.

477
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,750
Battle over.

478
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,180
That was insane.

479
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,419
It was cool because they were different.

480
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,750
I can't tell who will win.

481
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,019
- Mini was a bit worked up. - Right.

482
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:01,490
Let's check the result of the battle.

483
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,029
Fight judges,

484
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,259
open your cards.

485
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,929
Akanen was so cute.

486
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,170
I will easily beat her.

487
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,329
This is a battle I can't lose.

488
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,838
Open your cards.

489
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,269
Three, two, one.

490
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:17,409
(Mike Song, Pass, Shownu, Wolf'Lo)

491
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,779
- Yes. - What?

492
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,640
(Who did Monika choose?)

493
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:25,078
(They need a rematch due to a tie.)

494
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,419
It's a tie.

495
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,420
My gosh.

496
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,089
The rematch will be bloody.

497
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,859
- Rematch? - Mini is mad.

498
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,288
You can't lose. Let's go.

499
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,460
This is annoying.

500
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,329
I might lose if I let my guard down.

501
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,700
I will have to do my best as a battler this time.

502
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,200
I was surprised because I didn't expect a tie.

503
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:51,308
I was determined to win and make my crew proud.

504
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,578
This is scary.

505
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,210
- Let's go. - Let's go.

506
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,309
Mini and Akanen.

507
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,450
Are you guys ready?

508
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,980
- Fight. - Let's go.

509
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:03,049
(They simultaneously start dancing for 40 seconds.)

510
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,660
(Gasping)

511
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,099
Move up.

512
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,170
I can't tell who will win.

513
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,618
Great. That's not bad.

514
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,789
(Everyone marvels.)

515
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,558
Four, three, two, one.

516
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,289
One, one, one.

517
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,298
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

518
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,959
(Mini versus Akanen battle meme 1)

519
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,999
You have to do it together.

520
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,430
(Mini versus Akanen battle meme 2)

521
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,839
Let's check the result of the battle.

522
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,808
(This is agonizing.)

523
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,440
Fight judges, open your cards.

524
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,980
I hope they hold up our card.

525
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Mini will never be able to beat Akanen.

526
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,048
I thought I won.

527
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,779
Anyone could see I won.

528
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,690
(Wolf'Lo versus TSUBA KILL, which crew is the winner?)

529
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,990
(Mini wins with a score of 3 to 0.)

530
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,460
Mini from Wolf'Lo won 3 to 0.

531
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,700
It was so hard to judge.

532
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,169
It was super hard.

533
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,240
Who really wants it more, and who draws your attention...

534
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,150
Even the dance quality might be different,

535
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,979
but sometimes I'm not even looking at the dance quality...

536
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,419
because someone is just taking the energy,

537
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,519
and I don't end up watching the other person.

538
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,589
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

539
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,920
You're the coolest.

540
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,329
Mini from Wolf'Lo, who won,

541
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,529
will place the loser's chip on TSUBA KILL's board.

542
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,299
- No. - No.

543
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,568
It's okay.

544
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,999
(Mini gives Akanen the loser's chip.)

545
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,170
I was the first in my crew to battle...

546
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,910
and was very upset I lost.

547
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,279
This round of No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer...

548
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,679
is a special round.

549
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,519
It's a battle of the aces.

550
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,680
Ace?

551
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,818
What is that?

552
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,019
Select the ace dancer to represent your crew.

553
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:20,588
An ace dancer will randomly be named...

554
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,489
to enter the fight zone first.

555
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,989
If the other ace dancers...

556
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,659
think the ace dancer in the fight zone is weak,

557
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,629
you can challenge them to a battle.

558
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,199
If there are more than two challengers,

559
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,670
one will be chosen for the battle.

560
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:39,980
The 2 ace dancers will each dance to the same song for 40 seconds.

561
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,880
The same song?

562
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,349
Special points will be given out in the Ace Battle.

563
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,548
The winner of the Ace Battle...

564
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,490
will get two points, which is twice the original point.

565
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,460
MANNEQUEEN won 1 and lost 4 out of 5 battles so far.

566
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,130
If you win the Ace Battle, you get two points.

567
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:02,230
We can turn the tables if I win just twice.

568
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,429
We'll have to aim for this.

569
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,739
(LADYBOUNCE is in great need for points.)

570
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,970
The loser will be deducted two points.

571
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,268
You either get double winning points...

572
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,480
or double losing points.

573
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,309
- That's huge. - You can't be reckless about this.

574
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,150
You will now...

575
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,250
select the ace dancer to represent your crew.

576
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,259
Strategically, we have to choose the best dancer.

577
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,089
Since I lost earlier, I want to make up for it.

578
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,099
(Waackxxxy lost to Kirsten in the one-on-one battle.)

579
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,069
If you're okay with it, I'd like to go...

580
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,470
and bring back two points.

581
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,269
Do you want to?

582
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
(Shaking her head)

583
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
No.

584
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,039
What are you thinking?

585
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,608
I'm contemplating it.

586
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,750
- Contemplating it? - Yes.

587
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,049
It's scary.

588
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,949
Since a single match can lead up to a score gap of four,

589
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,490
I didn't want to give the girls that pressure.

590
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,059
I think I could go for it.

591
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,430
I think you could kill it.

592
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,028
I will announce the ace dancers that will be in the Ace Battle.

593
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,369
It's me, Waackxxxy.

594
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,299
Rena.

595
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,200
Locker Zee.

596
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,039
Vessi.

597
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,809
Kyma.

598
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,880
Amy.

599
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,980
Kirsten.

600
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,579
Baby Sleek.

601
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,379
(8 Crew Aces: Waackxxxy, Rena, Locker Zee, Vessi, )

602
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,220
(Baby Sleek, Kirsten, Amy, Kyma)

603
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,819
The battler for the first round of the Ace Battle...

604
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:37,758
is Baby Sleek from Wolf'Lo.

605
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,858
- Okay. - Go.

606
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,200
Please step into the fight zone.

607
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,269
It was like Lucifer walking into the school of devils.

608
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,109
No one can beat her in a battle.

609
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,339
She is our hidden card.

610
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,609
Everyone is afraid of her.

611
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,079
- It's Baby Sleek. - Baby Sleek.

612
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,079
It isn't fair if Baby Sleek is on the show.

613
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,249
Do you see "winner" in yellow writing?

614
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,348
That's insane.

615
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,589
What's crazy...

616
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,919
is that she was the winner...

617
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,489
from 2001 to 2023, this year.

618
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,029
I show total respect.

619
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,089
It makes me sit up straight.

620
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,230
She's an all-style dancer.

621
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,630
She is good in all genres.

622
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,900
She was already waacking when I was 16.

623
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:24,009
She's the one that brought waacking into Korea.

624
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,608
She used to waack, but she's also good at hip-hop...

625
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,109
and popping.

626
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,279
She's a beast in battling.

627
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,619
I've been in over 1,000 battles.

628
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,619
She always won.

629
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,389
She's still winning so many battles,

630
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,559
so if we select Baby Sleek as our ace dancer,

631
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,559
everyone will be scared, and no one will want to battle her.

632
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,400
She battles and calls it her way of relaxing.

633
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,769
We chose her so she could have fun.

634
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,940
Ace Dancers that would like to challenge Baby Sleek...

635
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,568
from Wolf'Lo to win two points, make your move.

636
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,579
You get 100 seconds.

637
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,240
- Let's go. - Bring it on.

638
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,410
- Bring it on. - What is going on?

639
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,420
They have to jump at her.

640
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,150
This is scary.

641
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,490
Absolutely not.

642
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,690
Let's just say she won.

643
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,618
What happens if no one wants to battle?

644
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:13,759
I don't know.

645
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,690
If...

646
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,759
If...

647
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,730
no one challenges me, do I win two points?

648
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,630
- She might just get two points? - There might be a challenger.

649
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,939
Come on. We don't have time. We have to get going.

650
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,470
(There isn't much time left! No one challenges her.)

651
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:31,539
I hope someone challenges her. Shouldn't Waackxxxy challenge her?

652
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:32,680
Should I challenge her?

653
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,278
Challenge her if you want to,

654
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,379
but not if you don't want to.

655
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,308
- Don't worry about the points. - It's truly okay.

656
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,019
There are ten seconds left.

657
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:41,890
- No one can beat Baby Sleek. - Ten,

658
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,288
nine, eight, seven,

659
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:48,359
six, five, four...

660
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,058
Great!

661
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,059
(Amy comes forward confidently.)

662
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,269
She's really bold.

663
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,598
If no one goes for it, should I?

664
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,640
Do you want to?

665
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,170
(Nodding)

666
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,170
Go for it.

667
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,639
- Yes! - She went for it confidently,

668
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,379
and I thought it was really cool.

669
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,210
I'll show them. This is my opportunity.

670
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:12,679
- Amy! Let's go! - Amy learned...

671
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,689
the legitimate hip-hop dance.

672
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,489
Her freestyle dance has a great flow.

673
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,288
She's a very talented dancer.

674
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,329
(Amy is an all-rounder who's mastered every genre.)

675
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:25,299
A small person can do bigger things.

676
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,500
I'll show you.

677
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,069
I thought, "Does she want to challenge me?"

678
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,900
"That's bold."

679
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,970
Let's begin the battle between the two ace dancers now.

680
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,099
Are you guys ready?

681
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:36,970
Let's go. Fight.

682
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,579
When I was about to start, I suddenly wanted to shake her hand.

683
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,019
When I want to do something, I have to do it.

684
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,190
I was like, "What? Out of the blue?"

685
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,259
From that moment, I was completely focused.

686
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:00,599
Okay.

687
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,910
It was brave. I'll give her that.

688
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,410
Look at Wolf'Lo. They don't look intimidated at all.

689
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,309
I'm good at provoking my opponent.

690
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,779
I set them off.

691
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:22,420
- Four. - She's so good at teasing you.

692
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,690
- One. Switch. - You'd better watch out.

693
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,490
She's a bit... She's scary.

694
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,730
Watch and learn.

695
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:41,670
(Impressed)

696
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,880
She's no match for me.

697
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,390
That'd make your heart skip a beat.

698
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,798
Three, two, one.

699
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,399
One. Battle over.

700
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,599
Baby Sleek made it look so easy, didn't she?

701
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,509
Let's find out the winner of this battle.

702
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,509
Three, two, one.

703
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,910
(Baby Sleek of Wolf'Lo wins the battle 2 to 1.)

704
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,319
- Gosh, it was an honour. - For me too.

705
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,788
She still won one vote.

706
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,258
- I'm proud of her. - Yes!

707
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,018
Well done, Amy.

708
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,660
I got one vote.

709
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,690
- You're the best. - You were great.

710
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,959
First of all, Amy stood up to Baby Sleek,

711
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,569
and I want to applaud her for that.

712
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,199
That's right.

713
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,940
She went for it when no one dared to.

714
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,109
You're going to make it.

715
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,839
I'm going to make it.

716
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,078
But I know that while Amy must've practiced her move 100 times,

717
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,379
Baby Sleek must've done it 10,000 times.

718
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,118
I know the process they've gone through,

719
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,018
and I had no choice but to vote based on that.

720
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,589
There was a big difference in quality.

721
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:04,818
Yes.

722
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:07,089
I knocked off my crew's score.

723
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,259
I feel so bad for my crew members.

724
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,558
Now, Baby Sleek of Wolf'Lo,

725
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,960
please add two points to your score.

726
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,969
- Yes! - We're going to run out of space.

727
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,798
We're going to run out of space soon.

728
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,899
Can you believe that?

729
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,868
- Gosh, that's insane. - Unbelievable.

730
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:24,038
Wolf'Lo just keeps on winning.

731
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,940
Wolf'Lo is so hard to beat.

732
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:30,109
(Wolf'Lo showed the strength of a battler crew.)

733
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,479
The winner.

734
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,119
(Wolf'Lo has scored 7 wins and 0 defeats.)

735
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,319
(Wolf'Lo is slaying everyone.)

736
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,059
(Wolf'Lo hasn't lost a single battle yet.)

737
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,088
No one can beat us right now.

738
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,829
Dance-offs are about confidence.

739
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,299
Now, the next ace dancer is...

740
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,930
(Nervous)

741
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,739
(Who's the next ace dancer?)

742
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,768
Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC.

743
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,440
(Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC)

744
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,809
- Yes. - Step on it.

745
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,949
(Glaring)

746
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,879
- Maybe she'll challenge her again. - What?

747
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,818
- The ace of MANNEQUEEN. - You may be right.

748
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:08,579
I think Waackxxxy will try to even the score.

749
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,159
(Kirsten picked Waackxxxy for the Battle with the Weakest Dancer.)

750
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,928
(After fighting hard for their pride, )

751
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,800
(Kirsten defeated Waackxxxy.)

752
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,969
(Waackxxxy, a dance battler, got her pride hurt.)

753
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,868
You have 100 seconds.

754
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,400
Ready? Let's go.

755
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,038
(Glancing)

756
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,578
(All eyes are on one person.)

757
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,579
Let's see.

758
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,650
(Standing up)

759
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,750
Let's go.

760
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,280
Come on!

761
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,320
For revenge!

762
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,189
- Yes, don't give up! - That's right!

763
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,429
Don't give up.

764
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,260
Let's go!

765
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,129
- Revenge! - You got this!

766
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,070
- Let's go! - Get your revenge!

767
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,769
This is round two between them.

768
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,599
Waackxxxy. Here you go again.

769
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,510
I guess she just couldn't accept that Kirsten won, and that's okay.

770
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,209
It puts you under a lot of pressure to challenge someone again...

771
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,549
because you might lose once again.

772
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,849
Waackxxxy is a dance battler through and through.

773
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,289
Five, four,

774
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,590
- three. - Anyone else?

775
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,759
This is my stage. Stay out of it.

776
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,658
- We shouldn't interfere. - No, we shouldn't.

777
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:25,900
Let's stay put.

778
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,529
Let's just start right away.

779
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,629
Four.

780
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,899
(The countdown begins.)

781
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,929
Three,

782
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,840
- This is for revenge. - two, one.

783
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,439
(Okay, let's go.)

784
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,468
- All right. - For revenge!

785
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,110
They're in for another battle.

786
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,109
Facing off again in the Ace Battle are Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC...

787
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,610
and Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN.

788
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,179
It's a rematch.

789
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,250
This is going to be a great match.

790
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,388
My dance in the previous battle?

791
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:52,320
I'll show you crazier moves that can't even be compared.

792
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,788
You got this, Waackxxxy.

793
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:55,730
- Hey. - Waackxxxy, you got this.

794
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,190
- Let's go. You got this. - Let's go, bonny.

795
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,730
She just wanted to regain her title,

796
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,769
and I'm ready to defeat her again.

797
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,300
Kirsten, you're done.

798
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,268
This is so scary.

799
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:09,639
This is going to be so good.

800
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:12,879
Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC versus Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN.

801
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,009
The battle between the two ace dancers begins now.

802
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,179
Are you guys ready?

803
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:17,909
Fight!

804
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,780
I got this.

805
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:25,989
Kirsten got lucky with the music.

806
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,658
Okay, it's show time. This is my time.

807
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:29,889
Let's go! You got this!

808
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,739
(Screaming)

809
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,138
Yes!

810
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,170
(Glaring)

811
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,320
(Thrilled)

812
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,960
She's in this to win.

813
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,929
(Astonished)

814
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,239
She did it. There's no need to see the rest.

815
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,239
What the heck?

816
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,618
Three, two, one. Switch.

817
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:32,820
- One. Switch. - You got it, Kirsten.

818
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,989
Switch. It's Kirsten's turn! Let's go.

819
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,230
(Screaming)

820
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,039
How do you beat that?

821
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:48,800
Yes!

822
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,619
Musicality. Yes.

823
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,519
Gosh, the groove.

824
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,658
Gosh, she's good.

825
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:09,230
Look, I got goosebumps.

826
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,729
Where are you going?

827
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,170
(Everybody, scream.)

828
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,739
That's what Gabee did!

829
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,019
I can't see you!

830
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,658
It was a cliché.

831
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,260
(Come back down.)

832
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,699
They went head-to-head.

833
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,369
It was cool because... Yes.

834
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,449
Battle over.

835
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,888
- She went up there. - Yes. Gosh.

836
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,030
(Torn)

837
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,928
Was 40 seconds always this short?

838
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,570
Kirsten, stairs.

839
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,300
- She was like, "It's hot here." - You saw her bottom.

840
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,469
No, Waackxxxy got her.

841
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,669
- This is about the dance. - That's right.

842
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,709
Let's find out the winner of this dance battle.

843
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,308
- How can you decide that? - They were both good.

844
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:37,380
That was incredible.

845
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,849
Oh, my gosh.

846
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,718
They were both so good.

847
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,590
It's hard to decide. They have completely different styles.

848
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,460
They were both great.

849
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,360
Fight judges, open your cards.

850
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,190
Please.

851
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,869
Oh, please.

852
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,199
Three.

853
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,670
Two.

854
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
One!

855
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,709
I can't decide this.

856
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,709
- One! - I can't decide this.

857
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,750
One!

858
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,219
(Two of the fight judges passed.)

859
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,348
Gosh, it's a rematch.

860
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:17,550
This is a rematch.

861
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,989
Again? Seriously?

862
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,260
Gosh, this day is full of drama.

863
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,899
Kirsten is so hard to beat.

864
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,400
I think it's because the two of them have different styles.

865
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,029
All right, buddy. You never ever quit!

866
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,469
- Let's go. - You can do it again.

867
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:35,539
Are you guys ready? Let's go. Fight!

868
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,309
(They'll dance for 40 seconds at the same time.)

869
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,679
Come on! Show her!

870
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,689
Come on, Waackxxy. Crush her.

871
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,960
Crush Kirsten!

872
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,598
(Shocked)

873
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,469
(Is this for real?)

874
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,659
Let's go!

875
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,130
(Screaming)

876
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,639
(Stunned)

877
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:45,940
What?

878
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,590
Three, two, one!

879
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,419
You're so good.

880
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,459
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

881
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,760
You have my respect! Yes.

882
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,098
(They deserve...)

883
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,000
(a standing ovation.)

884
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,669
What do we do?

885
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,038
- This is an absolute legend. - That was incredible.

886
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,699
What are the chances?

887
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,308
Will I ever see anything like this again?

888
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:20,110
- I know, right? - I don't think I will.

889
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,210
It was not a battle. It was a jam.

890
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,480
They were like in sync.

891
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:27,280
Maybe we could join teams.

892
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,549
(It was a fantastic dance battle...)

893
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,820
(between Waackxxxy and Kirsten.)

894
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,090
This time, it can't be a draw. You can't pass.

895
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,659
You have to decide the winner.

896
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:45,969
How can you decide that?

897
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,198
All right, fight judges. Open your cards.

898
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,969
Three, two, one!

899
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,780
One!

900
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,010
(Waackxxxy of MANNEQUEEN wins the battle 3 to 0.)

901
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,550
(After a defeat, Waackxxxy wins by a shout out.)

902
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,190
Well done.

903
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,988
- Well done. Thank you for that. - Thank you so much.

904
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:11,489
Waackxxxy is finally smiling.

905
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes, she's finally smiling.

906
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,929
I'm so happy. I really am.

907
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,670
Well, I can't describe how I feel with words.

908
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,570
I can finally look at my teammates in the eye.

909
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,570
Finally.

910
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,868
She evened the score.

911
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,909
She did. With a win twice as big.

912
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,780
- Hey. - Thank you.

913
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,349
Sorry, guys.

914
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,788
(JAM REPUBLIC got 2 loser's chips from MANNEQUEEN.)

915
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:39,989
The next round is...

916
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,489
the Crew Battle.

917
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,859
(Thrilled)

918
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
Yes.

919
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,928
- This is going to be so much fun. - Here we go.

920
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:50,170
This, I'm confident to win.

921
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,199
For the Crew Battle, you'll compete against...

922
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:53,369
The team of our choice.

923
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,839
The team we can beat...

924
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,468
and we consider as our rival.

925
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:59,109
If we're doing this, it'll be more fun to pick a strong team.

926
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,678
I want to challenge...

927
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,308
(That'd be awesome.)

928
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,379
I like... Because it's such a big name here.

929
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,578
Let the best team win.

930
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,819
We can easily beat them.

931
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,250
Let's see who will win.

932
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,319
You'll be competing against the crew of your choice.

933
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,919
It's time for a war.

934
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,090
(Dopamine being released)

935
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,399
The first match of the Crew Battle is...

936
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,698
(Who'll go first for their first group dance battle?)

937
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,730
(Excited)

938
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,969
1MILLION versus...

939
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,638
(Which crew will be facing off against them?)

940
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:31,709
LADYBOUNCE.

941
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,110
(The first match of the Crew Battle, 1MILLION versus LADYBOUNCE)

942
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,349
(Surprised)

943
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:39,618
That's going to be fun.

944
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,948
It's LADYBOUNCE. I think we will...

945
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,349
easily crush them.

946
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:46,018
1MILLION is a crew we really wanted to challenge.

947
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,518
I want to show them how it's done.

948
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,328
You guys called our performance...

949
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,099
out of style.

950
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,170
Out of style.

951
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:58,199
I said, "out of style."

952
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,038
- "Out of style." Old-fashioned. - "Out of style?"

953
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,638
(You mean it's old?)

954
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,510
(They've been stuck for 15 years.)

955
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,439
(Darn it, that's insulting.)

956
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,879
They called our dance old which was insulting,

957
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,279
- but we don't respect 1MILLION. - That's true.

958
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,980
Dancing is a business for them.

959
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,288
I agree that our dance is commercial.

960
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:17,749
But does that mean...

961
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,589
we have no passion for dancing?

962
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,888
If anyone thinks that,

963
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,329
I'd say they're just ignorant.

964
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,399
- We've been waiting for this day. - That's right.

965
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,999
Think about how we've survived the last 15 years.

966
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,669
Let's show them.

967
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,940
They think all we did to survive was breathe.

968
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,868
The team has been standing for such a long time,

969
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:39,239
and that's very rare.

970
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:43,308
They've built great teamwork over the years. They're expressive.

971
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:44,610
The original tough girls.

972
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:49,178
We've always tried to give different kinds of performances.

973
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,488
(They've worked consistently for 15 years.)

974
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:52,090
How many views do you get?

975
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,320
We put in a lot of effort, but it wasn't easy.

976
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,299
We're such a great team. I wonder why people don't see it.

977
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,359
(But their passion was unnoticed.)

978
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,368
We work so hard, even when no one is there to see it.

979
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:08,440
We always try our best to make results.

980
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,510
That's why I want us to succeed more badly.

981
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:16,479
(LADYBOUNCE joined the show to let the world know their dance.)

982
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,949
I felt terrible, to be honest.

983
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,920
We lost all the individual dance-offs.

984
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:24,689
(LADYBOUNCE didn't do well in the previous dance battles.)

985
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,460
(Their board is full of loser's chips.)

986
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,928
What's worse, I'm the leader,

987
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:31,360
and it was our first battle.

988
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,329
If I had scored our first win,

989
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:39,900
it would've kept the team's spirits up.

990
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:42,440
And I should've put myself forward as the ace dancer...

991
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,409
and forgotten about being strategic.

992
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,480
She must've felt so pressured.

993
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,719
I should've done it myself.

994
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:58,920
As the leader,

995
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:01,789
I should've been the one.

996
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,789
I felt...

997
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,159
I felt terrible.

998
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,968
We hugged each other...

999
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,769
and consoled each other.

1000
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:17,369
That's how we've held out for all these years.

1001
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,138
It already happened. We can't change that.

1002
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,479
- Right. - We can't go back.

1003
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,009
This is how we've always held out.

1004
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,319
And you know this, right? A bad start like this...

1005
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,380
will make it more meaningful when we cross the finish line.

1006
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,190
One, two, three.

1007
00:47:31,191 --> 00:47:32,750
- Go, team! - Go, team!

1008
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,360
I'll kill it in the Crew Battle.

1009
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,760
(Let's keep our spirits up.)

1010
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,229
Group dance battles are what we do.

1011
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,699
I know we can win. We have to win.

1012
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:46,169
Let's begin the dance battle between the two crews.

1013
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,239
Are you guys ready?

1014
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,000
Let's go. Fight!

1015
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,239
Let's go!

1016
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,539
(Let's make some noise.)

1017
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,539
(LADYBOUNCE dances first.)

1018
00:47:58,849 --> 00:47:59,920
(Make it twice as cool.)

1019
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,320
(Make it twice as cool.)

1020
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,459
(Her jaw drops.)

1021
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,889
This is what I'm talking about.

1022
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,590
(Perfectly in sync)

1023
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,300
Yes!

1024
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
(Dropping)

1025
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,689
That's great.

1026
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,789
They're well in sync.

1027
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,488
Yes, that's my move.

1028
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,630
I guess you guys wanted to try it.

1029
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,299
(They provoke 1MILLION with Lia Kim's pistol dance.)

1030
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,369
Interesting.

1031
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:57,609
(Do you want to join 1MILLION?)

1032
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,709
- No. - No!

1033
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,010
Never!

1034
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,308
No.

1035
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:03,379
Nice!

1036
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,908
- That's cute. - Good one.

1037
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,718
That's what I expected from LADYBOUNCE.

1038
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,050
- That was cool! - It was cool.

1039
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,448
Switch. It's 1MILLION's turn.

1040
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,460
Let's go.

1041
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,289
Let's go.

1042
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,988
I want to show them how intense...

1043
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,629
our dance can be.

1044
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,760
Let's go!

1045
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,610
(Keep your head down.)

1046
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:35,409
(That's 1MILLION.)

1047
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,480
Yes.

1048
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:48,059
(Here comes tutting.)

1049
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,489
(They're pretty good.)

1050
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,199
(1MILLION kept the opponent's highlight moves.)

1051
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,868
It's insane.

1052
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,069
I'm so scared!

1053
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,940
Two, one.

1054
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:09,138
The battle's over.

1055
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,379
(Chicken)

1056
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,650
I can't tell who will win.

1057
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,009
A chicken fight.

1058
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,079
- That's me. - How cute.

1059
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,489
Well done.

1060
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,690
- They're good. - They're all so serious.

1061
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,260
That was cool.

1062
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,019
That was fire.

1063
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,190
Let's check the result of this battle.

1064
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,658
Fight judges, open your cards.

1065
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,730
Let's get one winner's chip.

1066
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,598
We were convinced...

1067
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,340
that we'd defeat them in team performances.

1068
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,238
Just from the quality of the dance,

1069
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:38,739
ours was higher.

1070
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,909
(LADYBOUNCE gets 1 vote.)

1071
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,049
(LADYBOUNCE gets 2 votes.)

1072
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,279
(LADYBOUNCE wins with a score of 3 to 0.)

1073
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,549
(Roaring)

1074
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,848
(They can't believe it.)

1075
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:52,919
Are you serious?

1076
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,428
With a score of 3 to 0, LADYBOUNCE defeats 1MILLION.

1077
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,788
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1078
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,759
(They miraculously take their first win.)

1079
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,199
Our crew wins only if we're united.

1080
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,399
(Congratulations!)

1081
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,098
- They're pretty strong as a team. - Right.

1082
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,328
One might think...

1083
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,868
that they won just because of their good ideas,

1084
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:10,469
but my criterion was the quality.

1085
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,739
LADYBOUNCE got more points for their teamwork.

1086
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,940
Thank you!

1087
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,649
LADYBOUNCE, the winner,

1088
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,280
will now attach the winner's chip to their board.

1089
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,518
- It's our first time! - It's our first time!

1090
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,919
- Finally. Congratulations. - Yes!

1091
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,489
(LADYBOUNCE gets their first winner's chip.)

1092
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,190
Good job.

1093
00:51:30,191 --> 00:51:31,359
(The first win that they desperately wanted)

1094
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,089
Well done. Great work, guys.

1095
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,400
- Great work. - Good work.

1096
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,960
We finally have one.

1097
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,670
We were confident.

1098
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,999
We believed that we still had one more chance...

1099
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,038
to show people what we did best.

1100
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:45,570
It helped me believe again...

1101
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,509
that we could only do this as a team.

1102
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,480
I thought, "This is what we're good at, guys."

1103
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,149
(The win means a lot more as they proved it as a team.)

1104
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,150
For your pride,

1105
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,250
and for the honour of your crew,

1106
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,719
you have engaged in a fiercer battle as you represented your country.

1107
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:04,959
I will now announce...

1108
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,259
the final result of No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer.

1109
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,260
Eighth place.

1110
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:10,499
(No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer, 8th place)

1111
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,530
LADYBOUNCE.

1112
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,968
One win and eight losses.

1113
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,968
(LADYBOUNCE, 1 win and 8 losses)

1114
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:17,039
Really?

1115
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,238
They were a 15-year-old crew,

1116
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,639
and all they had were the loser's chips.

1117
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:26,880
(LADYBOUNCE only had 1 win in the battle.)

1118
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,448
The first last-place crew of Street Woman Fighter 2...

1119
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:34,659
will start with a dishonourable title of the weakest crew.

1120
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,459
(Sighing deeply)

1121
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,658
Yes.

1122
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:42,658
It's quite shocking and heartbreaking,

1123
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,800
but we'll make sure to show you...

1124
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:49,698
our charms, skills, and teamwork...

1125
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,369
in the next battle.

1126
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,078
(8th place, LADYBOUNCE)

1127
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,179
Next, seventh place.

1128
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,710
It's 1MILLION with 4 wins and 11 losses.

1129
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,420
Eleven losses?

1130
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,149
How did they end up in seventh place?

1131
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,190
Amy completely ruined it in the Ace Battle.

1132
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,919
(Amy lost twice in a row in the Ace Battle...)

1133
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,590
(where your losses are doubled.)

1134
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,158
We have too many of them because of me.

1135
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,428
- No. - Don't say that.

1136
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:19,529
I couldn't stop feeling sorry.

1137
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,269
I'd rather have them yell at me.

1138
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,509
"Even if it means breaking our bodies,"

1139
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,139
"let's fight them like crazy."

1140
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,879
That was our determination,

1141
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,110
and we were true to that.

1142
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,908
(7th place, 1MILLION)

1143
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:32,050
Sixth place,

1144
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,849
TSUBA KILL with 4 wins and 6 losses.

1145
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,190
I thought that we'd place higher.

1146
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,428
(6th place, TSUBA KILL)

1147
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,859
(Disappointed, upset)

1148
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,928
It's annoying.

1149
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:47,158
Fifth place,

1150
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:49,460
Deep N Dap with 5 wins and 6 losses.

1151
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,030
(5th place, Deep N Dap)

1152
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:54,369
That's all right. At least, we beat 1MILLION.

1153
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,409
Fourth place,

1154
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:00,480
JAM REPUBLIC with 6 wins and 6 losses.

1155
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,038
Thank you.

1156
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,109
(4th place, JAM REPUBLIC)

1157
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:08,018
I haven't battled since I was 11 or 9 years old.

1158
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:10,618
I'm really proud of the girls, of the first challenge.

1159
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:11,690
Third place,

1160
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,119
BEBE with 6 wins and 1 loss.

1161
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:15,820
Gosh, third place?

1162
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,159
BEBE placed higher than I expected.

1163
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,658
BEBE placed third.

1164
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:20,759
They have only one loss?

1165
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,059
It hurts my pride.

1166
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:23,428
I thought, "What's happening?"

1167
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:24,530
"Am I dreaming?"

1168
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,869
(3rd place, BEBE)

1169
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,199
(Smiling widely)

1170
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,670
Second place,

1171
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,110
MANNEQUEEN with 8 wins and 5 losses.

1172
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,650
They ended up in second place.

1173
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,679
When did MANNEQUEEN get so many wins?

1174
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:43,149
(They had more losses than wins earlier in the battle.)

1175
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:48,489
(But the members who were good at battles brought them back.)

1176
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,189
We could have placed first if we had done better.

1177
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,559
If I had won two more times in the Ace Battle,

1178
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,929
we could have placed first.

1179
00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:01,000
(2nd place, MANNEQUEEN)

1180
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,038
The waackers really pulled that one off.

1181
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,980
- They dominated it. - They did.

1182
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,279
Which crew is the strongest crew...

1183
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,649
that won No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer?

1184
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,049
It's Wolf'Lo with 12 wins and 1 loss. Congratulations.

1185
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,749
(1st place, Wolf'Lo)

1186
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,349
We're the real street dance crew.

1187
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:20,158
(Impressed)

1188
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:21,919
- That was insane. - Give us three chips.

1189
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,460
They were overwhelming.

1190
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,059
- Good work. - Wolf'Lo!

1191
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,598
(The members of Wolf'Lo showed us...)

1192
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:30,969
(the strength of authentic street dancers.)

1193
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,939
(1st place, Wolf'Lo)

1194
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,098
I'm a little jealous.

1195
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,369
- Good for them. - I'm jealous.

1196
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,940
Orange must be a winning colour.

1197
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:42,309
That was so close.

1198
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,550
(What awaits Wolf'Lo?)

1199
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,979
Celebration!

1200
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,018
(Make some noise!)

1201
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:48,420
- I'm so happy. - Applause.

1202
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,149
We were convinced that we'd win the battle...

1203
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,320
as we were proud of it.

1204
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,730
But what surprised me was BEBE.

1205
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,729
We placed third!

1206
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,529
(3rd place, BEBE)

1207
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,729
Third place.

1208
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,940
We placed higher than the crews that underestimated us.

1209
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:09,800
I personally think that this is a start.

1210
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,509
There will be more missions that have to do with choreography,

1211
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:15,010
and if we placed eighth there,

1212
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,079
that would be a bit...

1213
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:21,049
So, we'd have to watch a lot of videos...

1214
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,279
and get ready for the coming missions.

1215
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,518
We have to work hard to develop our skills.

1216
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:26,590
- Right. - Right.

1217
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,759
- Yes! - It's over.

1218
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,888
Fourth place, baby.

1219
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,288
(4th place, JAM REPUBLIC)

1220
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:35,629
(Kirsten celebrates by herself.)

1221
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,300
Well done, ladies. We did it.

1222
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,170
We really did it.

1223
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,639
- I'm very proud of us. - Yes.

1224
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,738
- I can finally fall asleep. - I know.

1225
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,510
- I feel like this is the finale. - Yes.

1226
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,779
Tomorrow, we're like...

1227
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,909
(Bawling tomorrow)

1228
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,309
Street Woman Fighter 2.

1229
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,579
It's here.

1230
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,980
That scared me.

1231
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,288
Street Woman Fighter 2, the 1st battle,

1232
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,288
No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer.

1233
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:02,059
Did it help you figure out the other crews?

1234
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,059
Yes. Absolutely.

1235
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,190
To try and secure your ranking...

1236
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,429
or go up the ranking,

1237
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,769
here's the next mission that you'll face soon.

1238
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,538
- The next mission. - Finally.

1239
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:14,739
The next mission is...

1240
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,569
Ta-Da!

1241
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,768
Your next mission is...

1242
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:19,238
Class Mission.

1243
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,280
(Class Mission)

1244
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:24,749
The time has come.

1245
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,819
It's one of the main missions in the Street Woman Fighter series.

1246
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,679
"Hey Mama" and "New Thing" have returned.

1247
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,090
It was loved by the public and turned into Memes.

1248
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,860
The Class Mission has gone viral a few times.

1249
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:37,190
I'm so confident.

1250
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:39,029
In the Class Mission,

1251
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,098
the elite members of each crew will be assigned to four classes.

1252
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,800
The leader class, sub-leader class, middle class, and rookie class.

1253
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,439
Each class will finish a dance video.

1254
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,869
(Each class makes a dance video.)

1255
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,238
Okay.

1256
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,579
This time around, we are separated.

1257
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,980
It's very interesting.

1258
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,150
I don't know what to expect, but...

1259
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,050
I think the girls are going to be able to hold it down on their own.

1260
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,719
It seemed like a chance to make up for the previous mission.

1261
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:05,589
In each class, there will be one main dancer...

1262
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,719
to be the protagonist of each dance video.

1263
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,388
The main dancer will get extra points,

1264
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:13,800
stand at the center of the video, and direct the dance video.

1265
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,230
A hundred extra points?

1266
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,799
Let's earn some points from this.

1267
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,300
It was my turn to show them.

1268
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,368
I've been making choreographies my whole life.

1269
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,639
I believe that it's one of 1MILLION's strengths.

1270
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,909
We're like the Avengers.

1271
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,010
Who would beat us?

1272
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,038
Let's show them how good we are at choreographing.

1273
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:30,649
To be honest,

1274
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,549
I'm the most qualified person for the Class Mission.

1275
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,719
I'm sure that I can win.

1276
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,749
Individual scores will be given out in the Class Mission.

1277
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,690
The points will be distributed differently in each class.

1278
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,888
Individual scores?

1279
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,659
Individual scores from...

1280
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,899
The three fight judges will rank...

1281
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,400
the dancers of each class from 1st to 8th places.

1282
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:56,538
The individual scores differ based on the rankings.

1283
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:57,809
(The scores are based on the rankings.)

1284
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,440
The individual scores didn't exist before, right?

1285
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,439
So, they're also going to evaluate the individuals.

1286
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,979
It's a total survival.

1287
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,078
I'll have to dance hard.

1288
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,649
So, we're going to rank high in every single one,

1289
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,279
- if not be the main dancers. - Yes.

1290
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,519
Just take over.

1291
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,549
It's certainly harsh.

1292
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,719
That's cold.

1293
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,659
In No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer,

1294
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,689
we had announced...

1295
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:20,360
that the first-place crew would receive a huge benefit.

1296
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,659
That's us.

1297
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,529
The benefit for the first-place crew...

1298
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,730
to help you start the mission at an advantage is...

1299
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:31,510
that we'll tell you the lineups for all seven crews.

1300
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,510
That's good.

1301
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,809
If the class seems easy, we can send a good one...

1302
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,150
to get the main dancer position.

1303
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:42,149
We get to see which strategy the other crews are using...

1304
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,579
from the revealed lineups.

1305
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,750
We decided to take the calculative and strategic approach.

1306
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,059
(The leaders of the 7 crews will decide on the class lineups.)

1307
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,388
I don't think that the youngest member...

1308
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,400
has to take the rookie class.

1309
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,900
For the middle class, Waackxxxy and Yoonji.

1310
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,369
We're securing 100 points from the middle class.

1311
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,439
In the rookie class, Tatter.

1312
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,408
She could show us the refreshing vibe of a rookie.

1313
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:06,808
We have to be smart about it.

1314
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:09,210
We need a good strategy.

1315
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,879
Let's see what they have on their minds.

1316
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,250
(The final class lineups of the 7 crews)

1317
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:17,389
Maybe I should use the same strategy.

1318
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:22,059
(Leader, Sub-leader, Middle, and Rookie)

1319
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,189
Joined by the best producers in South Korea,

1320
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,329
here's the song for the Class Mission.

1321
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,629
They're playing it now?

1322
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,300
- No way! - Already?

1323
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,799
Hello,

1324
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,368
- Street Woman Fighter 2. - Dynamic Duo!

1325
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:37,908
We're Dynamic Duo, and we're the producers of the Class Mission.

1326
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,739
- I'm Choiza. - And I'm Gaeko.

1327
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,178
- It's Dynamic Duo! - What? It's Dynamic Duo?

1328
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:44,609
Dynamic Duo worked with Padi...

1329
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,320
to write the song, "Smoke."

1330
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,779
("Smoke" by Dynamic Duo and Lee Young Ji)

1331
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,049
I like it already.

1332
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,288
(Lyrics that suit a dance battle...)

1333
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:52,488
(with aggressive sounds)

1334
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:54,019
It's your song.

1335
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,558
It's genuine hip-hop.

1336
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,989
It's so hip.

1337
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,859
It's straight-up hip-hop.

1338
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,860
That's one win.

1339
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:02,658
This was my music.

1340
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,130
I could apply my skills to create the moves.

1341
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,639
It's going to be so cool.

1342
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,768
It sounds difficult.

1343
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:11,609
I rarely made choreographies for rap songs,

1344
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,469
so I needed a lot of time to think.

1345
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,638
It wasn't the type of music that I was good at.

1346
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,408
But I didn't want to be...

1347
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:21,179
someone's backup dancer when I came all the way here.

1348
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,618
(Sub-leaders: Harimu, Lusher, Downy, )

1349
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,448
(LaTrice, Biggy, Redlic, Sayaka, and Mini)

1350
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:25,590
Let's go.

1351
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,459
(Standing up)

1352
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,618
I'm so jealous!

1353
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,689
I'm such a huge fan.

1354
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,759
I love you!

1355
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,329
I'm a huge fan.

1356
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,759
Hello.

1357
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm a producer for the Class Mission, Crush.

1358
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,500
- Crush. - It's Crush.

1359
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,239
- I love his music. - It's sick.

1360
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:46,038
The song that I produced is called "Click Like."

1361
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,880
It's a groovy and danceable song.

1362
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:50,179
("Click Like" by Crush)

1363
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,079
Wait. That's your song!

1364
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,709
- I like it. - Show us right now.

1365
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,848
(Her body automatically responds.)

1366
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,849
- It suits you, Redlic. - Right.

1367
01:01:57,949 --> 01:02:01,590
This song was made for me to kill it out there.

1368
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,919
It's so sexy.

1369
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,889
My choreography will have to be good.

1370
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,029
I liked the song already, and I heard so much sound.

1371
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,768
So I knew I could really show off the music well.

1372
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:14,570
This is my time to shine.

1373
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,569
Fire. You're going to eat that.

1374
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,610
Cool.

1375
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:22,139
(Middle)

1376
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,009
The middle class? I wonder what the song is.

1377
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,479
Who will have produced it?

1378
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,479
We have Dynamic Duo and Crush.

1379
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,650
And then...

1380
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,889
Hello, Street Woman Fighter 2.

1381
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:32,888
So many stars.

1382
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:34,118
(I love them!)

1383
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:36,288
We sang "Swipe" for your Class Mission.

1384
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:37,829
- I'm TAEYONG. - An I'm TEN.

1385
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:39,230
I can't believe it's NCT.

1386
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,460
What do I do?

1387
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:43,598
We will play the song for the Class Mission...

1388
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,170
- right now. - Right now.

1389
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,968
("Swipe" by TAEYONG and TEN)

1390
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:48,468
(A hip-hop dance song)

1391
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:51,669
- Take it, girl! - Yes!

1392
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,010
I could pull this off.

1393
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,579
- Right. - I could.

1394
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,078
Momo and I have worked...

1395
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,049
as a pair for the longest time.

1396
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:01,519
I want to win and help our crew win.

1397
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:04,590
Many of them will underestimate us as we're two street dancers.

1398
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,619
We'll have to show them how intimidating we can be.

1399
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,788
(Rookie)

1400
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,159
- The rookie position! - Rookies.

1401
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:14,629
Hello.

1402
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,460
I'm a producer of the Class Mission, Czaer.

1403
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,399
(Czaer produced "LAW" for the sub-leaders...)

1404
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,899
(in "Street Man Fighter.")

1405
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,868
We sang "Twerk," a song for your Class Mission.

1406
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,670
- I'm MIYEON. - I'm YUQI.

1407
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:25,808
We will now play...

1408
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:28,679
the song for your Class Mission.

1409
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,078
("Twerk" by MIYEON and YUQI)

1410
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,649
It's completely your type of song.

1411
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,018
(A cheerful and energetic song)

1412
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,320
Okay.

1413
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:39,149
Rena is going to take over.

1414
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,619
Absolutely.

1415
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:43,690
I felt like they wrote the song for me.

1416
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,428
It was kitschy and young.

1417
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:47,730
I could pull that off.

1418
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,059
It's the toughest ordeal in Yeni's life.

1419
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,329
I was shocked by "Twerk."

1420
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,900
Why did my class song have to be "Twerk?"

1421
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,400
I'm having a hard time.

1422
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:59,138
In 12 hours, you will present...

1423
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,780
your 30-second choreography to your class members.

1424
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,779
We could totally pull it off.

1425
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,150
Let's make something great.

1426
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:06,949
It would have to be overwhelming...

1427
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,250
so that they could only watch us.

1428
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,549
We have to try something that we never have.

1429
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,319
I'm saying that we have to be ready for that.

1430
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,259
Let's all do our best in our classes.

1431
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,889
- No more room to step back! - No more room to step back!

1432
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,260
(The day to choose the choreography dawns.)

1433
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:24,730
(The dancers came up with the moves all night.)

1434
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,029
We slept for two hours.

1435
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,670
Though we're sleepy, let's keep going.

1436
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:31,468
I stayed up all night to make the choreography,

1437
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:32,709
so I wanted to show them what I've got.

1438
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:35,138
The mission can bring out the best of our crew,

1439
01:04:35,139 --> 01:04:36,840
so we'll win in every class.

1440
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,448
People have this prejudice...

1441
01:04:38,449 --> 01:04:40,049
that we won't be able to create a choreography...

1442
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,249
as we're street dancers.

1443
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,879
But what I make is also a choreography.

1444
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,319
Nice. I like that.

1445
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,848
(The dancers get feedback from their teammates.)

1446
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,359
That was awesome!

1447
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,288
(Hugging her to praise her)

1448
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:52,288
I have to do well.

1449
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:53,289
(Stopping)

1450
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,269
(Tilting her head)

1451
01:04:57,329 --> 01:04:58,868
"Ding-dong." Not like this.

1452
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:01,039
Just use your facial expression.

1453
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:02,899
(Glaring)

1454
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,538
It's "Swipe," right?

1455
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:07,109
I think just one more hand gesture will complete it.

1456
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,739
- I like the overall flow. - Okay.

1457
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,050
- I love it so much! - That's so cool.

1458
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,710
I literally want to learn it.

1459
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:16,218
I love to work under pressure.

1460
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:19,389
"Diamonds are made under pressure," something like that.

1461
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:21,119
We're the Avengers.

1462
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,389
I'm going to risk my life for this.

1463
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:24,590
I've got this.

1464
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:27,559
(The choreography choice for the Class Mission begins.)

1465
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,300
(Which dancer's choreography will be chosen in each class?)

1466
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,500
(The fight club)

1467
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,368
Is there a class that you're looking forward to?

1468
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,400
The leader class.

1469
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:37,539
Leaders.

1470
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,169
Just the list of the leaders...

1471
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,639
makes you think that it's going to be good.

1472
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,738
- Goodness. - That's crazy.

1473
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:44,109
By the way,

1474
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,408
they're such tough competition.

1475
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:49,619
(The leaders check their moves one last time.)

1476
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:52,788
I'm the leader, so I have to do this well.

1477
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:57,059
I wanted to be of help to the team as the leader.

1478
01:05:58,059 --> 01:06:01,259
The main dancer and choreography of the leader class...

1479
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,329
get the most love and attention from the public.

1480
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,170
So, I get more eager.

1481
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,368
That's why I prepared extra hard for this.

1482
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:12,840
I'd have to put my pride on the line for this.

1483
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,340
It's going to be a bloodbath among the leaders.

1484
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:17,650
(Time to choose the choreography for the leader class)

1485
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,349
(Halo, the leader of Wolf'Lo, goes first.)

1486
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:23,049
I wonder what Halo came up with.

1487
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,319
Hers would be totally...

1488
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,949
(It's going to be hip-hop.)

1489
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:29,059
I can't wait to check out her choreography.

1490
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,329
I liked her energy.

1491
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,300
I thought it was fly. It seemed really cool and popping.

1492
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:49,010
(They give feedback right after.)

1493
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:52,309
It wasn't all that memorable except for the final pose.

1494
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,049
I don't think it'll look so cool...

1495
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,750
when we do the moves in a group.

1496
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:59,288
The biggest flaw was that you failed to portray the lyrics...

1497
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:02,518
and only made it look cool by putting them together.

1498
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,229
But the recent trend is,

1499
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:06,658
rather than portraying the lyrics,

1500
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:08,928
it's about focusing on the rhythm and flow.

1501
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:12,069
Then, you portray the lyrics in the hook, as far as I know.

1502
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,269
So, I can't accept your feedback.

1503
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:21,510
(The war of nerves among the leaders is intense.)

1504
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:25,348
(NOB, the leader of LADYBOUNCE, goes second.)

1505
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:26,550
(Staring intently)

1506
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:29,679
NOB might be amazing at it.

1507
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,649
I think NOB will come up with something clever.

1508
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,519
I bet it'll be witty.

1509
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:44,768
There were a lot of repetitive moves which were easy to remember.

1510
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,000
I liked the whole structure of the dance.

1511
01:07:51,909 --> 01:07:55,408
I thought it was kind of childish and light.

1512
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:57,678
The tip of your fingers and toes was a bit messy.

1513
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,109
The tip of my toes was messy?

1514
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,550
(She doesn't understand.)

1515
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,589
I believe that your fingers and toes should be restrained...

1516
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,718
to look like a picture.

1517
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:10,219
I thought it was messy in terms of those.

1518
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,899
In the video of our introductory meeting,

1519
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,430
NOB gave me such harsh criticism, so...

1520
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,799
(During the introductory meeting of the 8 crews)

1521
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,270
(NOB criticized Mina from Deep N Dap's video.)

1522
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:29,210
I was very excited to see how good you were.

1523
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:31,648
But I didn't see any strong points.

1524
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,050
(I didn't see any strong points.)

1525
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,988
It didn't make me want to dance this choreography.

1526
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:43,288
Like in short-form content... "One, two, three, four."

1527
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:46,488
It's only comprised of short moves,

1528
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,729
so I'm not exactly sure about using it as our choreography.

1529
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,069
(Funky Y, the leader of MANNEQUEEN, goes third.)

1530
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,909
I like that she tried to go the feminine way.

1531
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:07,278
I didn't think the dance suited the song.

1532
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,288
It was as mediocre as the one made by a student.

1533
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:15,189
I thought, "Is it worth it to copy it?"

1534
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,329
(Mina Myoung, the leader of Deep N Dap, goes fourth.)

1535
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:26,329
I liked how the groovy moves were connected.

1536
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,340
I liked the structure and the highlights.

1537
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,839
However, you've gotten weaker compared to the past,

1538
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,809
so it looked like you couldn't handle your own moves,

1539
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:36,909
and that was disappointing.

1540
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,849
Maybe I couldn't see the moves clearly...

1541
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,379
or you've actually gotten heavy.

1542
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,050
I couldn't see the moves clearly.

1543
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,520
(Lia Kim, the leader of 1MILLION, goes fifth.)

1544
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:51,359
She's practically the mother of K-pop choreographies.

1545
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:56,229
(Lia Kim created countless legendary K-pop dances.)

1546
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,399
I'm looking forward to this the most.

1547
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:01,600
(She's the top of the choreo scene. How will Lia Kim's choreography be?)

1548
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,100
Hold on, I'll start over.

1549
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,710
I'll start over. I'm sorry.

1550
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,680
(Lia Kim's second attempt)

1551
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,949
(Gosh...)

1552
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:16,550
(She makes another mistake out of nervousness.)

1553
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,989
She got her choreography wrong twice.

1554
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,029
Why does she have so little confidence?

1555
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,569
I think this is due to a lack of preparation.

1556
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,100
She didn't practice enough for her body to memorize it.

1557
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,938
(She quickly reviews her 30-second dance.)

1558
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:38,469
(Sighing)

1559
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,309
I'm not fast when it comes to creating choreography.

1560
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,679
It takes me a whole week to come up with the choreography...

1561
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,408
that I teach in classes.

1562
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:49,119
Making something in one day was a bit tough for me.

1563
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,920
You won't make any more mistakes, right?

1564
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,149
I'm thinking of this as my last chance.

1565
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,659
(Lia Kim's choreography starts up again.)

1566
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:16,710
Personally, this was the dance I found the most lacking.

1567
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:19,948
The choreography is too one-dimensional,

1568
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:21,478
and you were too stiff.

1569
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:24,720
There was no part where I could understand its flow.

1570
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:29,158
There was a lot of open space that I feel you could've filled.

1571
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:32,059
The structure felt like you put in moves you were comfortable with,

1572
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,460
so it felt a little shoddy.

1573
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:38,099
(The next ones up are the leader of TSUBA KILL, Akanen, )

1574
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,228
(and JAM REPUBLIC's leader, Kirsten.)

1575
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,898
I'm curious what kind of dance the foreigners came up with.

1576
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:44,739
This is going to be fun. It'll be entertaining to watch.

1577
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,419
I thought the structure of her choreography was good.

1578
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:59,090
I thought the tension and power fit the music well too.

1579
01:12:00,689 --> 01:12:03,688
But because you stuffed in too many moves,

1580
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:05,358
it was hard to pick out the highlights.

1581
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:07,828
I felt like I couldn't focus on the choreography...

1582
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:09,460
as a result.

1583
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:11,728
I wonder what Kirsten came up with.

1584
01:12:11,729 --> 01:12:14,769
She has great energy in her dancing in general.

1585
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,499
She stands out too much with moves only she can do.

1586
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,010
I find her to be my biggest rival.

1587
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,478
She had great energy with amazing expression.

1588
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,090
The quality of her moves was good too.

1589
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,728
I felt like you used the same rhythm over and over...

1590
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,569
for the 30 seconds.

1591
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:48,470
Because there were so many simple moves repeated,

1592
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:50,000
I'm not interested in performing this dance.

1593
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,778
(The final leader, Bada of BEBE)

1594
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:57,478
- Bada is the best one. - Yes.

1595
01:12:57,479 --> 01:12:59,210
Bada is really good.

1596
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,948
Bada's created the dances for a lot of hit songs.

1597
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,250
She's highly skilled in developing choreography.

1598
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,289
I thought Bada Lee would be my only competition.

1599
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,789
(How will Bada's choreography look, as everyone's greatest competition?)

1600
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:36,549
While I was watching Bada...

1601
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,989
(Curious and nervous)

1602
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,489
I could find no flaws.

1603
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:41,960
I couldn't sense any.

1604
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:46,129
You use the difference between strong and weak well,

1605
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,389
and your highlight moves are really fun to watch.

1606
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,059
I thought it was very powerful and very clean.

1607
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,828
The highlighted moves were very well-expressed.

1608
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:53,969
(Bada's choreography received only praise from the leaders.)

1609
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,269
(After the choreography previews, they need to choose one.)

1610
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,269
I just want to do the dance that looked the best.

1611
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,270
I want to dance Bada's.

1612
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:03,938
I will go with Bada as well.

1613
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,750
I want to do Bada's dance.

1614
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:07,350
I did it.

1615
01:14:07,779 --> 01:14:08,948
But what I'm curious about...

1616
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,049
(I'm curious about this.)

1617
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,750
is that Halo said she wanted to perform Bada's dance.

1618
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,959
Is it because you think...

1619
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,989
you can steal it?

1620
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,500
I don't think I can steal it.

1621
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,669
But if you do end up stealing it,

1622
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:26,898
you can revise it to make it your own.

1623
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:28,368
And if some of Bada's parts are good,

1624
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:31,469
you can make it your own by adding in her parts.

1625
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:34,739
I'm wondering why no one is thinking of that.

1626
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:37,278
- I didn't think of that. - Right?

1627
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:38,279
Should we start over?

1628
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,310
(Do we have to vote again?)

1629
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:40,810
Wait, what's going on?

1630
01:14:40,949 --> 01:14:45,118
At first, things were going to my advantage.

1631
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,818
But after Mina Myoung's comments,

1632
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:50,989
the mood changed all of a sudden.

1633
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:52,689
I wanted to put a stop to that.

1634
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,728
I want to do a dance that looks really cool.

1635
01:14:56,729 --> 01:14:58,728
This will last forever.

1636
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:01,669
If I do something of low quality thinking I can steal it,

1637
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,738
the leader will end up heading in the wrong direction.

1638
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:05,510
I think people should consider that.

1639
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,738
I really wanted my choreography to be chosen,

1640
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:11,140
so I could show people that I'm a true leader.

1641
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:14,310
That's how strongly I felt about it, so I kept trying to appeal to them.

1642
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,019
It's not finished yet,

1643
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,319
so we should think about things more carefully.

1644
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:24,759
(The leaders return to their crew hideouts.)

1645
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,829
You scared me.

1646
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:29,229
- We haven't decided yet. - I see.

1647
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,000
The mood is favouring Lee Bada.

1648
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:34,398
Mina Myoung said...

1649
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:35,769
that the others should be smart about choosing...

1650
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,340
a choreography that they can steal.

1651
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:40,509
(Regretful)

1652
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,478
Bada's physicality is so strong.

1653
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,510
If you choose Bada's dance, the main dancer will be Bada.

1654
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:46,648
Right.

1655
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:49,779
I think they'll choose someone else.

1656
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,289
They're being so strategic about it.

1657
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,259
I wonder what we'll pick.

1658
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,260
This is a hard mission.

1659
01:15:57,989 --> 01:15:59,259
(It's so hard.)

1660
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:04,898
(The final vote to decide the leaders' dance)

1661
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:07,828
Can I do Bada's dance better than she can?

1662
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,300
I'll have to make a more strategic decision.

1663
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:11,840
(The dance selection vote is over.)

1664
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:15,279
(BEBE's leader Bada returns to her hideout.)

1665
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,209
(Shocked)

1666
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,210
What happened?

1667
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:22,720
- Hi. - How was it?

1668
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,920
Whose dance was picked?

1669
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:26,488
I got it!

1670
01:16:26,489 --> 01:16:27,849
(I got it!)

1671
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:28,858
What was that?

1672
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:30,219
(We're so excited!)

1673
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,590
We're doing Bada's.

1674
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,358
We have a tie...

1675
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:35,560
between Bada and Akanen.

1676
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:38,129
(BEBE's Bada and TSUBA KILL's Akanen each got 3 votes.)

1677
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:39,429
I'm so nervous.

1678
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,469
(Bada's dance was chosen by a re-vote of 4 to 2.)

1679
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,139
- Okay. - It's decided.

1680
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,609
It was decided after a re-vote.

1681
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,339
Why are you crying?

1682
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,938
(Now that the pressure has lifted, the leader Bada starts to cry.)

1683
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,938
Bada had a hard time.

1684
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,608
I felt relieved that I didn't disappoint the members,

1685
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:56,449
and that made me tear up.

1686
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,420
I lost 4 to 2.

1687
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,250
That was so close.

1688
01:17:00,619 --> 01:17:03,488
But no one considered...

1689
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:04,858
stealing Bada's dance.

1690
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:07,460
The leader class just chose the best dance.

1691
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,000
- Not the ones they could do well? - No.

1692
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,969
I won't be in a dance that doesn't look good.

1693
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,930
It's not over until it's over.

1694
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,999
We'll have to take the main dancer position.

1695
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,068
You can do it.

1696
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:18,669
You can do it, no matter what.

1697
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:21,068
I believe I can steal this choreography.

1698
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:25,310
I was confident that I could fight for the main dancer.

1699
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,180
I'll work hard so I don't lose this.

1700
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:31,590
It would be so hard for me if this is stolen from me.

1701
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,389
(Choosing the choreography for the rookie class)

1702
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:36,289
Who will go first?

1703
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,390
(Looking around)

1704
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:41,729
(The rookie class is exhibiting a heavy mood.)

1705
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,429
It felt savage and icy.

1706
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,368
One could call it a psychological fight among women.

1707
01:17:46,369 --> 01:17:48,198
There was a lot of tension in the air.

1708
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:51,100
This fight will be a bloody one.

1709
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:52,409
(During the rookie class lineup reveal)

1710
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:53,409
Rookie.

1711
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,938
(Redy, Tatter, Gooseul, Emma, )

1712
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:56,239
(Capri, Buckey, Rena, Yeni Cho)

1713
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,350
Okay.

1714
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,349
The rookies are strong.

1715
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,219
- That's incredible. - I knew they'd be strong.

1716
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,749
I think the competition...

1717
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,049
will be the fiercest among the rookies.

1718
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:09,459
Considering these were the rookies, everyone was a strong dancer.

1719
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,919
I was a bit worried.

1720
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,630
I felt some pressure.

1721
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:15,829
Honestly, I'm not very worried.

1722
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,399
There wasn't a single person I thought would be my competition.

1723
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,670
I'll go first.

1724
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
(Gooseul, Deep N Dap's rookie, offers to go first.)

1725
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:25,909
(Keeping her in check)

1726
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,810
This song is totally me. I can do this.

1727
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,478
- She's the most unlikable member. - She's so unlikeable.

1728
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:34,509
Isn't that the pink-haired dancer from Deep N Dap?

1729
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,679
She was so talkative.

1730
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,488
(I've never thought Lia Kim was a good dancer.)

1731
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:39,818
(Glaring)

1732
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:41,960
(If you look at her choreography, it's all the same.)

1733
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:45,188
(Gooseul criticized the others without holding back.)

1734
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:48,398
(Gooseul says a lot of provocative things.)

1735
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:51,158
Gooseul and I aren't too far apart in age,

1736
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,898
and I think she's around the same class as me.

1737
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:56,369
Who does she think she is, talking like that to me?

1738
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,770
Let's see how good she is.

1739
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:00,640
(How will Gooseul's choreography be?)

1740
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:11,989
I'm sorry, but could I do it one more time?

1741
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,859
(Gooseul made a mistake during her choreography.)

1742
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:17,960
What was that?

1743
01:19:18,189 --> 01:19:19,889
A choreography dancer...

1744
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,158
makes a mistake and stops dancing?

1745
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:23,760
I thought she was such an amateur.

1746
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,430
I'm human. I can make a mistake while dancing.

1747
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,539
There were no "wow" moments that really moved me.

1748
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:39,408
I'd rather die than do that choreography.

1749
01:19:39,409 --> 01:19:40,479
I didn't say a word.

1750
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,818
(Worlf'Lo's rookie Yeni Cho, MANNEQUEEN's rookie, Buckey)

1751
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:46,750
(Yeni Cho and Buckey showed off dances in their own style.)

1752
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,118
I'm sorry,

1753
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:49,158
but I had no idea what they were doing.

1754
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,590
I couldn't even tell if they actually choreographed it.

1755
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,189
It was a little regretful.

1756
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,529
(1MILLION's rookie, Redy)

1757
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,340
The balance was great throughout her piece,

1758
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:06,170
but the dance looked too familiar.

1759
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:09,109
(BEBE's rookie, Tatter)

1760
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:12,549
When I watched Tatter's dance,

1761
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,949
I couldn't sense any confidence in her expression.

1762
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:17,750
Her dance fit the song the worst, out of all of them.

1763
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:19,789
At this rate, mine will be chosen.

1764
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:23,019
(TSUBA KILL's rookie, Rena)

1765
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,930
(Nervous)

1766
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:30,159
There's Rena.

1767
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,198
I think Rena will have come up with a good choreography.

1768
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,528
If I had to pick someone who's the stiffest competition,

1769
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,699
- it would be Rena. - Right.

1770
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:37,969
I think Rena is competition.

1771
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,238
- Because she's just Rie Hata. - Yes, Rie Hata.

1772
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,478
She dances just like Rie Hata.

1773
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,578
(Rie Hata, a hot choreographer in Japan)

1774
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:48,679
- Of the Japanese dance crews... - They have great dancing skills.

1775
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,948
(Rena is a dancer for the Rht. crew.)

1776
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:53,889
(From doing previews for J-pop choreography...)

1777
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,519
(to doing performances with K-pop artists...)

1778
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,288
("Freak" by ZICO)

1779
01:20:57,289 --> 01:20:59,859
(Rena built up steady experience doing choreography for K-pop.)

1780
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,028
Isn't Rena the best one there?

1781
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,800
- Yes. - She'll definitely be the center.

1782
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:17,438
It was really cool.

1783
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,549
You could see her flavour in her choreography.

1784
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,408
I'd like to do that dance.

1785
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,180
I thought it was of high quality.

1786
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,529
Thank you.

1787
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:37,629
I'm very confident.

1788
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:40,569
I think everyone will choose my choreography.

1789
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,198
(LADYBOUNCE's rookie, Capri)

1790
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,368
During the first mission battles,

1791
01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:48,380
we showed too weak a side of ourselves.

1792
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:50,409
Eighth place, LADYBOUNCE.

1793
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:55,648
(LADYBOUNCE was the weakest No Respect crew.)

1794
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:56,749
It pained me.

1795
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,019
It was humiliating too.

1796
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,118
It wasn't just that we ground our teeth.

1797
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,859
We practically ground them to powder.

1798
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,118
Help me out, leader.

1799
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:06,358
(Capri got a review from her leader, NOB.)

1800
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:08,189
I think you should go to the side blatantly, like this.

1801
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,099
I think you can break it up a little more.

1802
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,329
Not making a mistake is key.

1803
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,698
I want to show everyone everything we can...

1804
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:14,829
through dance.

1805
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,278
(Capri made a mistake early on.)

1806
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:30,318
I'm sorry.

1807
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:31,989
(Capri made a mistake early on.)

1808
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,789
(What is she doing?)

1809
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:39,390
(Capri can't get started with her dance again.)

1810
01:22:43,699 --> 01:22:44,930
I'll start over.

1811
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,578
It felt like she was playing around.

1812
01:22:58,579 --> 01:22:59,810
There was nothing but rhythm.

1813
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:02,618
Boom, tap, boom, tap, the end.

1814
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:03,619
(Boom, tap, boom, tap, the end)

1815
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:05,989
Honestly, it was like a regressed version of Rena's dance.

1816
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,090
It was childish.

1817
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:10,159
It was fine at first, but then she kept repeating the same moves.

1818
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:12,060
Why did she create a choreography like this?

1819
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:20,728
(The dancers evaluate Capri's choreography seriously.)

1820
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:24,169
First of all, I was revising this until the last minute,

1821
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,769
because I wanted to do well.

1822
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:27,538
But because I'm not very experienced,

1823
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:32,109
some of that last part was freestyle dancing.

1824
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,380
(Capri finished up with freestyle.)

1825
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,989
The rhythm-making is done well in the last part of the dance,

1826
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,448
so if we end up doing my choreo,

1827
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,989
I can make that part more diverse.

1828
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:46,688
(Silence)

1829
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,728
I finished, but I didn't feel satisfied.

1830
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:49,899
It felt unsatisfying.

1831
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,828
If we were to pick the best choreography,

1832
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,000
I would choose Rena.

1833
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,669
Rena's choreography...

1834
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,270
was good, after all.

1835
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:00,438
If my choreography isn't going to be picked,

1836
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:02,840
I want to pick the one that I can do well.

1837
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:06,148
(Will Rena's choreography be chosen?)

1838
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:09,279
I vote for...

1839
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:11,350
LADYBOUNCE's Capri.

1840
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,390
(Surprised)

1841
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,559
I would choose Capri.

1842
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,118
I choose Capri.

1843
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:19,259
I choose Capri.

1844
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,459
Capri won four votes,

1845
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,929
and everyone else got one vote each.

1846
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:27,100
With the majority of the votes, we're going with Capri's.

1847
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,669
I couldn't understand.

1848
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:32,039
How did she get four votes?

1849
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,810
But...

1850
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,979
does everyone know...

1851
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,479
that we have to do this dance?

1852
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:43,420
You know that, right?

1853
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:47,988
I was wondering why...

1854
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:49,788
I can't remember the last part.

1855
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:51,760
You said it was freestyle, right?

1856
01:24:51,789 --> 01:24:54,259
I'm sorry, but could you show us the first part again, at least?

1857
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,729
(Nodding)

1858
01:24:59,069 --> 01:25:03,100
(Capri is unable to start showing her dance.)

1859
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:05,340
Does she not remember it? Why won't she start?

1860
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,010
Now she couldn't even do the first part of the dance.

1861
01:25:10,109 --> 01:25:12,550
I thought that was a little extreme.

1862
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,850
You won't do this...

1863
01:25:20,619 --> 01:25:22,020
even when we're learning the dance, right?

1864
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,189
Of course not.

1865
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,390
(Feeling dissatisfied)

1866
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,999
(She is unable to show the others the first part of the dance.)

1867
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,199
I'm sorry.

1868
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,969
(Serious)

1869
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:41,068
Maybe we should pick someone else.

1870
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,380
(Maybe we should pick someone else.)

1871
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:51,078
You seem a little unprepared.

1872
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,390
It's also important for us to have enough time to practice.

1873
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,260
(Which choreography will the rookie class choose?)

1874
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:01,389
(After the vote, Capri returns to her hideout.)

1875
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:02,658
Capri.

1876
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:04,100
- Did you do well? - You did well.

1877
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,698
- Gosh. - You did well.

1878
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:08,739
Why do you look so down?

1879
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,340
Gooseul, did you do well?

1880
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,739
What happened?

1881
01:26:11,869 --> 01:26:13,369
- I'm so annoyed. - Why?

1882
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:16,078
What happened? You worked hard.

1883
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:18,079
- They didn't pick mine. - What?

1884
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,148
- I'm sorry. - Why?

1885
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:21,210
They already voted?

1886
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,688
(Rena ends up crying after the vote is over.)

1887
01:26:25,689 --> 01:26:26,919
Whose dance was chosen?

1888
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,220
Capri's.

1889
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,429
They chose mine.

1890
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:33,589
(Capri's choreography was chosen.)

1891
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,430
- But it was so unsatisfying. - Why? What happened?

1892
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,228
She didn't finish making her choreography,

1893
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:38,630
so she couldn't even dance her own choreo.

1894
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:39,899
What's funny...

1895
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:41,228
is that she was making it up as she was going along.

1896
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:43,538
The choreography wasn't finished.

1897
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:45,868
Then how was hers chosen?

1898
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:48,778
So the main reason why a lot of people chose Capri's...

1899
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:50,478
is because her choreography was easy.

1900
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:53,050
That's why I chose it as well.

1901
01:26:53,149 --> 01:26:55,350
I can do Capri's style well.

1902
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,448
I'll memorize the moves...

1903
01:26:56,449 --> 01:26:58,149
and take everything for myself.

1904
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,289
Everyone's going to be set on trying to steal it.

1905
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,659
You should steal the choreography.

1906
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:03,819
I'll steal it.

1907
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,389
That's also a reason I chose it.

1908
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,460
Because I wanted to steal it.

1909
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,359
Rena is my biggest competition.

1910
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:12,069
They said they respected me,

1911
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,829
but they said if they danced my choreography,

1912
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,770
they didn't think they'd be able to be the main dancer,

1913
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,739
so they didn't want to choose mine.

1914
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,908
What is that?

1915
01:27:19,909 --> 01:27:22,379
It's a very impressive dance, but I'm not sure...

1916
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,539
it will look as good if we try to dance it.

1917
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,709
I think that only Rena can pull this dance off.

1918
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,720
(The rookie class dancers held Rena's chances back.)

1919
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:32,148
I really thought mine was the best.

1920
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:34,549
This is ridiculous. You have to shoot a video with Capri's dance.

1921
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:36,188
Will that even turn out okay?

1922
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:37,589
I don't want to lose to the dancers...

1923
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,389
who said they didn't have the confidence to perform my dance.

1924
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,358
- I never want to lose to them. - Definitely not.

1925
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:44,159
- I definitely don't want to lose. - Of course not.

1926
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:49,239
(The main dancer auditions have finally begun.)

1927
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:51,199
I'm going to steal the choreography and change it.

1928
01:27:52,909 --> 01:27:54,938
(The sub-leader class exhibits a savage mood.)

1929
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:57,139
So I believe I gave a fair play to the challenge.

1930
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:00,009
(Which dancer will have the honour of being the main dancer?)

1931
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:05,050
(D-day for the main dancer auditions for the Class Mission)

1932
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:07,319
Gosh. Oh, my gosh.

1933
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,960
This is my leader.

1934
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,618
This is our leader!

1935
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,759
(With the main dancer auditions ahead, the dancers practice hard.)

1936
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,260
I practiced so hard yesterday.

1937
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:16,930
I'm really going to steal this choreography.

1938
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,829
No one wants to be in the background.

1939
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:21,100
Everyone wants to be the star, and I will be that star.

1940
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,300
I've never not been the main dancer.

1941
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:26,409
I've been the main dancer in every dance video I was in.

1942
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:28,068
It's my choreography, so I need to keep it.

1943
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:29,179
I'm confident I can do it.

1944
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,310
This is my own choreography.

1945
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:32,250
Can anyone do it better than me? No way.

1946
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:35,010
We're taking the main dancer title.

1947
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:36,578
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

1948
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:37,750
(Class Mission Main Dancer Auditions)

1949
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,219
(The dancers have gathered together for the main dancer auditions.)

1950
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,060
(The fight zone is full of tension.)

1951
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:45,828
(Peeking over)

1952
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:47,858
Everyone's really investigating the others.

1953
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:48,999
(Glancing over)

1954
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,228
I'll do the choreography better...

1955
01:28:51,229 --> 01:28:53,169
than Capri can.

1956
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:54,430
I'm confident I can take it from her.

1957
01:28:54,569 --> 01:28:57,899
We really need 100 points for the crew.

1958
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,210
Don't lose.

1959
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:00,369
The main dancer will be ours.

1960
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:02,778
(Monika, Mike Song, Shownu)

1961
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:04,538
We'll start with the rookie class.

1962
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,879
(The first main dancer audition will be for the rookie class.)

1963
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,349
- Let's go, Tatter! - Tatter!

1964
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,350
- Let's go! - Tatter!

1965
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:10,519
Take my energy.

1966
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,949
- Let's go, Capri! - Let's go!

1967
01:29:12,189 --> 01:29:13,988
Let's go!

1968
01:29:13,989 --> 01:29:16,520
You've got this. Okay? Let's go.

1969
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,788
- Rena, you can do it. - Let's go!

1970
01:29:17,789 --> 01:29:18,858
- You'll be fine. - Let's go.

1971
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:20,090
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1972
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,129
Are you ready, Redy?

1973
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,100
Are you ready, Redy?

1974
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,259
Gooseul!

1975
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,399
Let's go, Gooseul!

1976
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,299
Capri's choreography was chosen.

1977
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,739
I heard your choreography wasn't finished when it was picked.

1978
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,809
(Capri was unable to show her whole dance before the vote.)

1979
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:40,709
I was so unprofessional...

1980
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:41,979
that even I felt bad for myself.

1981
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:44,819
I need to finish this no matter what before I go.

1982
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:46,849
Boom, step.

1983
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:49,459
I'll do it no matter what. I will make it happen.

1984
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,059
I can do it.

1985
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,329
(Will Capri be able to teach the moves without any problems?)

1986
01:29:52,489 --> 01:29:53,688
Shall we start?

1987
01:29:53,689 --> 01:29:54,859
(The rookie class finally starts to practice the moves.)

1988
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,000
After five and six...

1989
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,310
Hold on.

1990
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:08,810
As expected,

1991
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,579
she got confused from the start.

1992
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,850
Three...

1993
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,350
I'll listen to the music first. Sorry.

1994
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:21,318
(It goes slow due to the disorganize choreography.)

1995
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:22,560
(Glaring)

1996
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,520
Wait a second.

1997
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:27,828
I didn't think it was right. I was so flustered.

1998
01:30:27,829 --> 01:30:29,999
She didn't even know the choreography.

1999
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,729
Later, the dance will be all over the place.

2000
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:35,669
If we continued like this,

2001
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:37,669
would the whole class fail together?

2002
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:41,609
I didn't have any concern about her choreography.

2003
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,409
How's Capri's choreography?

2004
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,049
(Showing it right away)

2005
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,978
- It's really simple. - Yes.

2006
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:51,779
Rena will so be the leader. Yes!

2007
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,488
- I'll do my best. - I could see that.

2008
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,720
I'll really do my best.

2009
01:30:54,989 --> 01:30:56,759
(Glancing)

2010
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,158
The one I'm keeping in check the most in our class...

2011
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:00,358
is Rena.

2012
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:04,658
I could feel that Rena understood the choreography perfectly.

2013
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:07,328
She changed it to fit her style.

2014
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:08,999
Rena is a strong competition.

2015
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,398
The one I consider my rival...

2016
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:14,038
Honestly, there's none.

2017
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:18,409
I will steal the main dancer position for good.

2018
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,880
I will be the main dancer.

2019
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:23,349
While looking at the rookies' choreography,

2020
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:25,019
I thought,

2021
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,119
"It's totally doable."

2022
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,389
It's so simple.

2023
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:30,519
I thought it'd have been easy to learn the moves.

2024
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,459
So I think it could be a little risky.

2025
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,930
Won't it be fun to steal it? I will steal it.

2026
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:37,529
I can't let them steal it.

2027
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,599
We kept saying...

2028
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,170
that Capri will play a big part in Class Mission.

2029
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,499
Thankfully, it was my type of song.

2030
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,038
- Right. - I told you.

2031
01:31:46,039 --> 01:31:49,209
So no one can pull it off better than me.

2032
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:52,078
For our team, I'll take the main dancer position.

2033
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:53,250
It's my choreography, after all.

2034
01:31:53,649 --> 01:31:55,948
We'll find the best dancer in the rookie class.

2035
01:31:55,949 --> 01:31:57,520
Ready? Fight.

2036
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,449
Capri, let's go!

2037
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,988
(The first group for the main dancer audition)

2038
01:32:00,989 --> 01:32:02,220
(Emma, Capri, Gooseul, Yeni Cho)

2039
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:06,829
Hey!

2040
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:08,789
Let's go!

2041
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,529
Good job!

2042
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,579
- Okay. - Follow me!

2043
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:47,769
Yes. Okay.

2044
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,269
Good job!

2045
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:50,270
(The second group for the main dancer audition)

2046
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:51,340
(Tatter, Rena, Redy, Buckey)

2047
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:53,340
Rena, you can do it!

2048
01:32:55,609 --> 01:32:57,510
Okay!

2049
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:16,399
They are good!

2050
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:40,090
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2051
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:41,850
- That was great! - Awesome!

2052
01:33:42,189 --> 01:33:44,318
That was crazy!

2053
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:46,228
(Our Tatter is the best!)

2054
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:49,100
Crushed it. Redy crushed it!

2055
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,260
This is hard.

2056
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,000
It will be tough to decide.

2057
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,529
- I have no idea. - Many dancers did well.

2058
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:58,099
The one who feels the pressure is the one who made the choreography,

2059
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,569
worrying about getting her choreography stolen.

2060
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:01,310
Our Capri has no match.

2061
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,680
Hey, everyone!

2062
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:04,680
We'll do one more match.

2063
01:34:05,609 --> 01:34:09,219
Someone other than me grabbed her attention.

2064
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,579
This is intense.

2065
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:13,319
Here we go. LADYBOUNCE's Capri.

2066
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,249
- Yes! - Capri!

2067
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,359
Of course!

2068
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:17,719
BEBE's Tatter.

2069
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,089
(BEBE's Tatter)

2070
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:20,460
- Yes! - Good!

2071
01:34:21,229 --> 01:34:22,559
MANNEQUEEN's Buckey.

2072
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,828
(MANNEQUEEN's Buckey)

2073
01:34:23,829 --> 01:34:24,829
- Yes! - Yes!

2074
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,470
Lastly, TSUBA KILL's Rena.

2075
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,169
- Yes! - Let's go!

2076
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:31,369
Get it, Rena!

2077
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:33,868
All four of them have totally different colours.

2078
01:34:33,869 --> 01:34:35,438
It really depends on what they are looking for.

2079
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:36,439
Yes.

2080
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,210
- Let's go! - Don't let them beat you!

2081
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,579
Buckey!

2082
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:42,349
Let's go, Tatter!

2083
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:43,448
(BEBE's Tatter and MANNEQUEEN's Buckey)

2084
01:34:43,449 --> 01:34:45,278
I might really get picked.

2085
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:46,519
I think I'll be the best.

2086
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,520
I will steal the title.

2087
01:34:47,521 --> 01:34:50,520
I will show off my strengths.

2088
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:55,859
Let's go!

2089
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:58,300
You're so good!

2090
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:08,270
Let's go!

2091
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:12,379
(Screaming)

2092
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,278
(Good job, Buckey.)

2093
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:15,818
Rena, go and get it!

2094
01:35:15,819 --> 01:35:17,019
Let's go!

2095
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,978
Capri, let's go!

2096
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:20,719
I made the choreography myself.

2097
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,049
So I'm very confident.

2098
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:25,359
I'll show them why I have to be the main dancer.

2099
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,828
Becoming the main dancer was the only thing on my mind.

2100
01:35:28,829 --> 01:35:30,930
It's a do or die.

2101
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,329
- Capri, let's go! - Rena!

2102
01:35:38,569 --> 01:35:39,970
Okay.

2103
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:42,510
Let's go.

2104
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:07,899
- Let's go! - Nice!

2105
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,340
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2106
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,879
(Scream!)

2107
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,038
It's obvious.

2108
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:20,079
- It's a done deal. - She's the best!

2109
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,778
- Why do they go so well? - Exactly.

2110
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:23,249
The two of them should form a crew.

2111
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,520
Have you made up your minds?

2112
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,989
Well...

2113
01:36:26,449 --> 01:36:28,420
- Give me five seconds. - Five?

2114
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:31,359
It's so hard to tell.

2115
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,629
Capri's dance is more fun, for sure.

2116
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:35,459
But I think it'll be Rena.

2117
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,659
I think Capri will be the main dancer.

2118
01:36:37,729 --> 01:36:39,000
Please, say Capri.

2119
01:36:40,069 --> 01:36:42,469
For me, it took ten seconds...

2120
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,839
- to decide. - Right away?

2121
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,068
She was more dynamic in the choreography.

2122
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:52,238
I think this person amplified...

2123
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:55,210
the colour of the song better.

2124
01:36:55,479 --> 01:36:56,919
I like them both.

2125
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,488
It's one to one. So It's up to me to decide.

2126
01:36:59,489 --> 01:37:00,649
Okay.

2127
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:04,159
The main dancer of the rookie class is...

2128
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,619
Please.

2129
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,459
(Let's see.)

2130
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,659
Please.

2131
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,000
The main dancer of the rookie class is...

2132
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:15,799
I was very confident...

2133
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,738
that it'd be me,

2134
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:20,210
but honestly, I was really nervous at that moment.

2135
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,108
I did my best.

2136
01:37:22,109 --> 01:37:24,609
I had a feeling I could be the main dancer.

2137
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:26,849
I showed them all. I crushed it.

2138
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:27,948
I am confident.

2139
01:37:27,949 --> 01:37:30,118
I excelled at it with no regrets.

2140
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:31,880
So it'll be me, obviously.

2141
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:34,148
The main dancer of the rookie class is...

2142
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:35,149
(What's the final decision of the fight judges?)

2143
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,688
TSUBA KILL's Rena.

2144
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:41,090
(TSUBA KILL's Rena)

2145
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,630
TSUBA KILL's Rena.

2146
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:46,630
(Rena did it!)

2147
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,670
(The opposite reactions from the two crews)

2148
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:58,239
(Capri's main dancer position was stolen by Rena.)

2149
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,109
(Disappointed)

2150
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,479
- You're the best. - Amazing!

2151
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,149
(The Rookie Class's main dancer, TSUBA KILL's Rena)

2152
01:38:07,289 --> 01:38:08,648
(Rookies sincerely congratulate her with applause.)

2153
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:09,960
Good job!

2154
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:12,188
(Our Capri did a great job!)

2155
01:38:12,189 --> 01:38:13,689
- You did great. - Good job.

2156
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,959
The choreography was great and all,

2157
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,658
but was it suitable for the video?

2158
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:21,670
I tried to identify your capacity as the star of the video.

2159
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,799
What played a big role...

2160
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,738
was that Rena danced as if she were the main dancer.

2161
01:38:26,739 --> 01:38:29,710
That is the reason why we chose her.

2162
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,140
Congratulations.

2163
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:32,979
Thank you.

2164
01:38:34,949 --> 01:38:36,220
Good job.

2165
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,850
It'd be terrible to get it stolen.

2166
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,589
What upset me the most was...

2167
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:46,429
that I couldn't help my team...

2168
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:48,229
because I couldn't be the main dancer.

2169
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:53,470
(Capri ends up shedding tears.)

2170
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:56,840
You did great.

2171
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,538
I really wanted to win it...

2172
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:02,710
for the team.

2173
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,180
Our little one bore that pressure.

2174
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:08,050
Gosh. This is sad.

2175
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:11,079
I feel like I couldn't take...

2176
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,118
what was there for me to take.

2177
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,020
I cried because I was upset.

2178
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:17,920
But I don't regret how I danced today.

2179
01:39:18,189 --> 01:39:21,229
If you don't have any regrets, that's what matters.

2180
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:23,199
You were amazing.

2181
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,729
(Class Mission Main Dancer Audition)

2182
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,999
(Main Dancer Audition Sub-leader class)

2183
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,970
(The sub-leaders have a serious vibe.)

2184
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:34,369
It's dangerous.

2185
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:38,408
I heard the process of choosing the choreography for this group...

2186
01:39:38,409 --> 01:39:40,449
was very fierce.

2187
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:43,179
I heard there was a fierce fight...

2188
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,079
between LaTrice and Redlic.

2189
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,560
(When selecting the choreography for the sub-leaders)

2190
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,890
"Sub-leader" is a strong word.

2191
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:57,229
So I was surprised to see Harimu.

2192
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:58,528
(When revealing the lineup for each class)

2193
01:39:58,529 --> 01:39:59,898
(Sub-leader class, Harimu)

2194
01:39:59,899 --> 01:40:02,739
It's surprising Harimu is in the sub-leader class.

2195
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,238
I thought she was the weakest in 1MILLION.

2196
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:07,438
I thought she'd be a rookie.

2197
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:08,608
- Me too. - Me too.

2198
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:11,438
Because she's the youngest in the crew.

2199
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:14,279
That's such an old-fashioned thinking.

2200
01:40:14,649 --> 01:40:17,220
(Sub-leader class, 1MILLION's Harimu)

2201
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:18,550
I'll start.

2202
01:40:20,689 --> 01:40:22,419
I've never seen her dance.

2203
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:23,890
I wasn't really thrilled.

2204
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:27,390
(How's the choreography prepared by 1MILLION's Harimu?)

2205
01:40:30,729 --> 01:40:33,429
I like the continuous hip moves.

2206
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:35,670
It could show our energy.

2207
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:37,340
She was better than I expected.

2208
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:45,278
I thought it was a cute, pretty,

2209
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:48,079
powerful, and good choreography.

2210
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,279
However,

2211
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,019
I don't want to dance to it, honestly.

2212
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,949
(I don't want to dance to it.)

2213
01:40:56,619 --> 01:40:58,719
She's a younger dancer.

2214
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:01,329
And her confidence and performing was lacking.

2215
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:05,059
(Deep N Dap's sub-leader Downy, LADYBOUNCE's sub-leader Biggy)

2216
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:08,429
(BEBE's sub-leader Lusher)

2217
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:11,670
(Wolf'Lo's sub-leader Mini)

2218
01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:14,369
I thought it was a student performance.

2219
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:18,710
It felt like you were squeezing in highlight moves by constraint.

2220
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,709
It feels like you were fooling around.

2221
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:23,520
I feel like you didn't do your best job.

2222
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,119
No way.

2223
01:41:28,989 --> 01:41:30,020
Right.

2224
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,829
(Gulping)

2225
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,630
I got it.

2226
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,170
I didn't like everyone's dance.

2227
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,068
(Redlic's criticism tenses up the fight zone.)

2228
01:41:43,069 --> 01:41:44,199
It was intimidating.

2229
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:46,099
I know she's a strong choreographer.

2230
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,340
And a strong performer.

2231
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:49,068
Redlic is the strongest.

2232
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,778
From the top of my brain,

2233
01:41:50,779 --> 01:41:53,078
I feel like the most experienced choreographer...

2234
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:55,010
in the sub-leader class is Redlic.

2235
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:58,448
Redlic is working actively in the choreography scene.

2236
01:41:58,449 --> 01:42:00,289
She's really famous too.

2237
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,519
Chris Brown gave her a shout out or something.

2238
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,520
I think so.

2239
01:42:03,521 --> 01:42:06,759
I heard Chris Brown gave her a shout out.

2240
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,029
She's a strong competition.

2241
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,358
The Class Mission. It's for me.

2242
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:12,259
I'm the only one who can excel at it.

2243
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,199
(How's the choreography by Redlic whom everyone is keeping in check?)

2244
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:16,769
The beginning goes well with the concept,

2245
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:19,239
and it was very attractive.

2246
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,408
Redlic. She's good.

2247
01:42:25,409 --> 01:42:26,948
She's a competitor,

2248
01:42:26,949 --> 01:42:28,350
but she's annoyingly good.

2249
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,519
(Admitting)

2250
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,049
The moves were cool and powerful.

2251
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:34,919
Three were many sexy moves.

2252
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,358
It was sexy. I admit it.

2253
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,720
It was heart-fluttering even in women's eyes.

2254
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,189
(Jealous)

2255
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,689
(Next is JAM REPUBLIC's sub-leader, LaTrice.)

2256
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:47,929
LaTrice is something.

2257
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:49,698
She's a really good dancer.

2258
01:42:49,699 --> 01:42:52,639
I've seen her doing strong and powerful...

2259
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,170
Afro dances before.

2260
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:56,339
(Groovy dancing based on Afro...)

2261
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,579
(and powerful energy are LaTrice's strengths.)

2262
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:00,149
But would that fit the song?

2263
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,949
I don't think so.

2264
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,978
(While everyone's predicting different things, )

2265
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:06,689
(how will LaTrice dance?)

2266
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:17,629
There weren't memorable moves.

2267
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:20,269
There were too many similar hip moves.

2268
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:22,198
I thought those were the weak points.

2269
01:43:22,199 --> 01:43:24,500
It was so simple that it felt like freestyle dancing.

2270
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,139
This is a choreography mission.

2271
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:29,809
So I can't really understand that you didn't know the lyrics...

2272
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:30,880
when you're the choreographer.

2273
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:35,709
Because I didn't know much of the lyrics,

2274
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,879
I focused more on just the English lyrics,

2275
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,750
which is "Click like," and musicality.

2276
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,259
I couldn't understand...

2277
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,759
she had the attitude of "I couldn't help it."

2278
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,629
When I first heard the song,

2279
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:49,559
I didn't understand the lyrics,

2280
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,260
so I asked for a translation.

2281
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:54,499
(We want translated lyrics for all classes.)

2282
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,129
(TSUBA KILL asked the staff for translation for the lyrics.)

2283
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:57,769
You could have asked for it in advance.

2284
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:59,769
I think you could have been prepared.

2285
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:00,869
So that was disappointing a bit.

2286
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:05,778
I am desperate. Is she not desperate?

2287
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:07,608
She didn't even try.

2288
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:09,680
That makes me so angry.

2289
01:44:09,949 --> 01:44:11,648
(The sub-leaders decided to vote...)

2290
01:44:11,649 --> 01:44:13,089
(for the choreography they liked.)

2291
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:15,149
The choreography I liked the most...

2292
01:44:15,489 --> 01:44:16,920
was Redlic's, of course.

2293
01:44:17,319 --> 01:44:19,288
I liked her performance a lot, actually.

2294
01:44:19,289 --> 01:44:22,960
I don't have any bad comments because I liked her performance.

2295
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,059
I did a great job on the choreography...

2296
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:27,369
so that it could be picked.

2297
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,670
I'm confident.

2298
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:31,300
(Which one will be picked for the sub-leader class?)

2299
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:33,739
- Guess whose was picked. - Yours.

2300
01:44:33,939 --> 01:44:35,239
I'm sorry.

2301
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:36,539
What? No.

2302
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:39,210
Why are you apologizing? You don't have to.

2303
01:44:41,409 --> 01:44:42,479
How did it go?

2304
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:46,319
Mine went to the finals, but in the finals...

2305
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:48,449
Emma.

2306
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:50,659
Hey, how did it go?

2307
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:52,759
Yes. I got it.

2308
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,488
(I got it.)

2309
01:44:54,489 --> 01:44:55,489
- Did you get it? - You got it?

2310
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:56,658
- But... - Work.

2311
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:59,299
I was sad that I got treated in that way.

2312
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,929
I chose the easier choreography.

2313
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:03,300
It's simple and easy to memorize.

2314
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,198
Me too.

2315
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:07,738
I thought I could do it better.

2316
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:09,269
How is LaTrice's choreography?

2317
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:12,809
It's mainly a rhythm dance. It only requires basic skills.

2318
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,249
Almost like a freestyle,

2319
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:16,778
we just move the hip all the time.

2320
01:45:16,779 --> 01:45:18,078
I see.

2321
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:19,818
(It didn't even feel like a choreography.)

2322
01:45:19,819 --> 01:45:22,118
It was just a dance routine.

2323
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:24,288
She didn't even know the lyrics,

2324
01:45:24,289 --> 01:45:25,559
but hers got picked.

2325
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,028
She said she didn't know the lyrics.

2326
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:31,299
That she made the choreography based on the rhythm.

2327
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:34,100
That already sounds so irresponsible.

2328
01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:37,369
But she got picked, which is so upsetting.

2329
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:41,408
I know that they picked it because it looked simple.

2330
01:45:41,409 --> 01:45:42,969
Because, regardless,

2331
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,639
- that's your choreography. - Yes.

2332
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,179
- Regardless, it's going to be. - Yes.

2333
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:48,278
I don't think anybody else can do it better than me.

2334
01:45:48,279 --> 01:45:50,920
Then there you go. I don't think they can.

2335
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,288
So my way is winning...

2336
01:45:53,289 --> 01:45:55,618
this choreography challenge, the main dancer challenge.

2337
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:57,689
We'll prove ourselves.

2338
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:00,929
She didn't translate the lyrics...

2339
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:03,600
and made the choreography based on the rhythm.

2340
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:06,329
I thought she didn't try enough.

2341
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:08,029
(Smiling)

2342
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:11,499
Actually, dance is a universal language.

2343
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,909
So I didn't find a language barrier, really.

2344
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:17,680
Honestly, I thought, "Is she here to just chill?"

2345
01:46:19,909 --> 01:46:20,949
It's scary.

2346
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:23,719
It sounds like you didn't find her professional.

2347
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,818
Is that right?

2348
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:28,049
She taught us the choreography half-heartedly too.

2349
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:29,720
She didn't organize the counts.

2350
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:31,289
Was she lazy when teaching you?

2351
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,720
(Nodding)

2352
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:37,130
(When sub-leaders were practicing the choreography)

2353
01:46:37,699 --> 01:46:41,529
(LaTrice suddenly stops teaching.)

2354
01:46:42,899 --> 01:46:44,069
What is this?

2355
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:46,439
What is she going to do?

2356
01:46:46,710 --> 01:46:47,739
Wait. Hold up.

2357
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,938
(LaTrice stops teaching and starts thinking.)

2358
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:53,408
(She starts teaching them again...)

2359
01:46:53,409 --> 01:46:54,409
(but hesitates again.)

2360
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:56,109
I think we should do it again.

2361
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,050
Is it going to be okay?

2362
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,488
I mean, if her choreography was chosen,

2363
01:47:00,489 --> 01:47:04,419
she should memorize it and teach us.

2364
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,818
She didn't know how to count it.

2365
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,559
I thought, "What is this?"

2366
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,630
And a round. Hey?

2367
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,959
She didn't organize her moves at all.

2368
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,728
That made me so angry.

2369
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:15,299
I was actually nervous.

2370
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,799
I felt like I forgot my choreography.

2371
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,068
- I have a question. - Yes.

2372
01:47:19,069 --> 01:47:21,710
Do we turn the finger to the left?

2373
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,909
Well...

2374
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:24,510
Sorry.

2375
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,978
This.

2376
01:47:27,979 --> 01:47:29,148
(LaTrice flounders by the non-stop questions.)

2377
01:47:29,149 --> 01:47:30,379
Down. No?

2378
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:32,648
(LaTrice flounders by the non-stop questions.)

2379
01:47:32,649 --> 01:47:34,090
It was very uncomfortable.

2380
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,960
- We dance like this. - I know.

2381
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:38,960
You can memorize it when you see it once.

2382
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:41,528
I will steal the choreography and change it.

2383
01:47:41,529 --> 01:47:43,429
I will be the main dancer no matter what...

2384
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:44,599
and change it around.

2385
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,300
I can't do it because it's embarrassing.

2386
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:49,698
Okay. Let's find the best dancer among the sub-leaders.

2387
01:47:49,699 --> 01:47:52,469
- Let's go! - You can do it!

2388
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:53,710
- Harimu! - Okay!

2389
01:47:53,869 --> 01:47:55,769
- Sayaka! - Let's go!

2390
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,909
Let's go, Sayaka!

2391
01:47:57,279 --> 01:47:59,510
Let's go, Lala!

2392
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:02,149
It was a win for JAM REPUBLIC today.

2393
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:04,019
I want to prove myself here.

2394
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:07,020
In the main dancer audition, I'm going to hold my ground.

2395
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,750
I will go crazy in zebra prints.

2396
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:12,719
- You can do it! - Mini, let's go!

2397
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,228
- Ready? - Lusher, let's go!

2398
01:48:15,229 --> 01:48:16,259
Let's fight!

2399
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:17,300
(Main Dancer Audition Sub-leader Class)

2400
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,800
Yes!

2401
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,539
Harimu!

2402
01:48:37,149 --> 01:48:38,149
That's right!

2403
01:48:46,289 --> 01:48:48,430
Yes!

2404
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,130
She's so good with her body.

2405
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,309
Let's get it!

2406
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:01,909
- Lusher! - Lusher!

2407
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:07,250
Nice!

2408
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:13,719
(The first group showed off their uniqueness well.)

2409
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,590
Okay!

2410
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:17,020
Good job!

2411
01:49:17,289 --> 01:49:19,319
Why do I feel like Lusher was better?

2412
01:49:20,189 --> 01:49:21,729
There you go, LaTrice!

2413
01:49:22,329 --> 01:49:23,399
Good!

2414
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,759
- Let's go! - Good luck!

2415
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,800
- Good luck! - Gosh. She's very revealing.

2416
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,198
I didn't intend to lose,

2417
01:49:30,199 --> 01:49:32,639
so I brought 44kg of clothes from Japan.

2418
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,368
I want to be the center member.

2419
01:49:34,369 --> 01:49:37,108
- Let's go! - Sayaka!

2420
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:38,478
I will steal it at all costs.

2421
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:40,509
- Let's go! - Redlic!

2422
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,079
Check your facial expression!

2423
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:44,818
Good luck!

2424
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:46,850
(The second group for the main dance audition)

2425
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,288
(Biggy, Sayaka, Redlic, Downy)

2426
01:49:48,289 --> 01:49:49,850
(Stealing the spotlight)

2427
01:49:49,989 --> 01:49:51,019
That's insane.

2428
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,829
(Sayaka's sexiness surprises everyone.)

2429
01:49:57,529 --> 01:49:58,728
(That's so cool.)

2430
01:49:58,729 --> 01:50:00,100
Let's go, Redlic.

2431
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,539
Gosh. Let's go.

2432
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,938
(TSUBAKILL's Sayaka and MANNEQUEEN's Redlic)

2433
01:50:08,939 --> 01:50:12,340
(LADYBOUNCE's Biggy and Deep N Dap's Downy)

2434
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:15,749
You're so good.

2435
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:16,850
You'll make it.

2436
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:23,689
Look at Sayaka's moves.

2437
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:28,090
Let's go.

2438
01:50:35,329 --> 01:50:36,398
Gosh.

2439
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:38,339
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2440
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,009
I love you.

2441
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:42,770
You did it.

2442
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,538
This is 100 percent.

2443
01:50:44,539 --> 01:50:45,578
Girl, you made it.

2444
01:50:45,579 --> 01:50:46,810
You did it.

2445
01:50:46,909 --> 01:50:48,779
If I were a man, I'd ask you out.

2446
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:52,550
That was the nastiest thing ever.

2447
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,050
Those hips don't lie.

2448
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,520
That was fun.

2449
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,328
(They are judging more carefully than ever.)

2450
01:51:00,329 --> 01:51:01,890
This one. Okay?

2451
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:04,130
We have to see it one more time.

2452
01:51:04,359 --> 01:51:08,800
(Who are the two that will re-audition?)

2453
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:12,499
JAM REPUBLIC's LaTrice...

2454
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,969
(JAM REPUBLIC's LaTrice)

2455
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:17,179
and...

2456
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:18,880
MANNEQUEEN's Redlic.

2457
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:21,250
Let's go.

2458
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,649
That doesn't make sense.

2459
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:28,519
(The members are comforting Sayaka.)

2460
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,460
You got this. Focus more.

2461
01:51:30,689 --> 01:51:33,220
Eat the audition.

2462
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:37,399
Redlic. I kind of knew she would be my rival in this one.

2463
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:40,198
But I think she is...

2464
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:42,170
a bit younger in the dance life.

2465
01:51:42,869 --> 01:51:46,000
I will win this and bring the original choreography back.

2466
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:47,409
Please start the music.

2467
01:51:50,409 --> 01:51:51,840
(Exclaiming)

2468
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:54,909
Let's go, girl.

2469
01:51:58,619 --> 01:52:00,649
(Let's go, LaTrice.)

2470
01:52:03,989 --> 01:52:05,090
You're doing good.

2471
01:52:09,029 --> 01:52:10,300
You're so good!

2472
01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:17,239
They are good.

2473
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:25,478
Yes, finish up.

2474
01:52:25,479 --> 01:52:28,180
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2475
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:30,380
Until the last move.

2476
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,149
That was so sexy.

2477
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:34,849
You are strong at the actual match. You did well.

2478
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:36,149
Please go out with me.

2479
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:38,420
Click like, click like.

2480
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,529
Did I move and travel enough?

2481
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:42,329
You used the space very well.

2482
01:52:42,829 --> 01:52:44,199
Redlic's really good.

2483
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,159
She might win this.

2484
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:47,529
That will be fun to watch.

2485
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,430
I think it will definitely be LaTrice.

2486
01:52:49,529 --> 01:52:50,699
Anyone can win.

2487
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:52,969
- This person. - Okay.

2488
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,739
(Judges are considering everything more carefully.)

2489
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:57,709
- She was crazy. - Okay. Then...

2490
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:58,840
Please...

2491
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:00,079
I really want to win this.

2492
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:03,010
I'm sure they know you're good at making videos.

2493
01:53:03,079 --> 01:53:04,350
I know I can do it well.

2494
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:08,019
I will take this choreography no matter what.

2495
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:12,260
Choreography and performing, mostly performing, is my strength.

2496
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:14,228
So I would be upset...

2497
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:17,500
if somebody stole my choreography based on their performance.

2498
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,369
We'll announce the main dancer of the sub-leader class.

2499
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:21,729
Please...

2500
01:53:23,069 --> 01:53:24,198
Come on.

2501
01:53:24,199 --> 01:53:27,139
The main dancer we chose is...

2502
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,909
(Who's the main dancer that the fight judge chose?)

2503
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:34,078
JAM REPUBLIC's LaTrice.

2504
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:37,319
(The main dancer is JAM REPUBLIC's LaTrice.)

2505
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:40,289
(A standing ovation)

2506
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:41,949
You slayed.

2507
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,688
JAM REPUBLIC's LaTrice.

2508
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:47,729
(Redlic was close, but she lost.)

2509
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:49,060
You did well.

2510
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:54,269
Redlic tried to dance it with her emotions.

2511
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:56,569
It was a tough decision.

2512
01:53:56,869 --> 01:53:59,299
But it was almost unfair to her...

2513
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,770
because the choreography suited LaTrice so well.

2514
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:07,949
(After the audition, MANNEQUEEN)

2515
01:54:09,579 --> 01:54:12,778
Why do I always get there but can't win?

2516
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:15,049
- You'll do better next time. - That's right.

2517
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:17,688
- I think you showed who you are. - That's right.

2518
01:54:17,689 --> 01:54:19,119
Everyone already knows you are good.

2519
01:54:21,529 --> 01:54:23,389
(The audition for the main dancer continues.)

2520
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:25,329
Leaders, please come up to the fight zone.

2521
01:54:25,829 --> 01:54:26,829
Let's go!

2522
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,169
(Let's go, Kristen.)

2523
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:29,368
(You'll do well, leader.)

2524
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:34,709
(Each crew cheers for their leader in their own ways.)

2525
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,270
(The main dancer will be you.)

2526
01:54:37,739 --> 01:54:38,909
They are all outstanding.

2527
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:40,279
It's the fight between the leaders.

2528
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:42,680
These people are competing in the same place.

2529
01:54:43,619 --> 01:54:44,750
I'm excited.

2530
01:54:44,779 --> 01:54:46,619
It'll be super hard to judge.

2531
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:49,949
Who's choreography has been chosen?

2532
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:51,220
It's mine. Bada.

2533
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:54,728
As the leader, I wanted to show...

2534
01:54:54,729 --> 01:54:56,959
our physical strength and aura. The powerful side of us.

2535
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,898
I considered what I think is the most important,

2536
01:54:58,899 --> 01:55:01,600
which is the dance you want to try.

2537
01:55:01,729 --> 01:55:04,469
There's a move of lighting a lighter.

2538
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:06,840
I tried to put those kinds of things into the choreography.

2539
01:55:06,899 --> 01:55:08,868
And Kirsten.

2540
01:55:08,869 --> 01:55:11,978
Was there anything hard during the practice?

2541
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:14,209
Dance, again, is the universal language.

2542
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:16,310
There weren't any difficulties, I think.

2543
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:19,050
I'm keeping Kirsten in check.

2544
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:23,318
(During the rehearsal)

2545
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:24,960
(Glancing)

2546
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,488
(Exclaiming)

2547
01:55:27,489 --> 01:55:28,960
That's unbelievable.

2548
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,028
Did you see Kirsten?

2549
01:55:34,029 --> 01:55:35,699
- I got goosebumps. - I know.

2550
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:37,869
Kirsten was outstanding.

2551
01:55:37,899 --> 01:55:40,100
Her hips moved like this and that.

2552
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:41,409
She's different.

2553
01:55:41,609 --> 01:55:43,509
- I wasn't looking at Bada at all. - Bada couldn't be seen.

2554
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:44,979
How does she dance?

2555
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:47,109
She dances just like in the Royal Family videos.

2556
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:48,779
So she's dancing in earnest.

2557
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:52,350
Bada has every right to feel anxious.

2558
01:55:52,579 --> 01:55:54,420
- She might lose. - I know, right?

2559
01:55:54,449 --> 01:55:55,488
I felt good.

2560
01:55:55,489 --> 01:55:57,889
It just feels like you control the stage.

2561
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:58,960
I'm ready.

2562
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,829
I'm ready.

2563
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:02,889
I'm pretty confident.

2564
01:56:02,890 --> 01:56:05,159
I'll definitely be picked by the judges.

2565
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:08,868
(Bada is monitoring the rehearsal with her crew members.)

2566
01:56:08,869 --> 01:56:10,770
Kirsten is insane.

2567
01:56:10,939 --> 01:56:14,909
She was performing my choreography with her style.

2568
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,310
I need to do more.

2569
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:20,750
I need to do something.

2570
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:26,078
In the past season, the leaders...

2571
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:28,589
whose choreography was picked...

2572
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:30,390
became the main dancers.

2573
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,130
I will win no matter what and become the main dancer.

2574
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,260
We will find the best dancer in the leader class.

2575
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:39,059
You can do this.

2576
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,470
Let's go.

2577
01:56:40,529 --> 01:56:42,328
You've got this.

2578
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:43,600
Let's do this!

2579
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,970
Ready?

2580
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,099
Let's fight.

2581
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:48,108
(The first group for the audition of the main dancer)

2582
01:56:48,109 --> 01:56:50,139
(Mina Myoung, Bada, Funky Y, and NOB)

2583
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,278
(Deep N Dap's Mina Myoung and BEBE's Bada)

2584
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:52,279
That's cool.

2585
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,539
(MANNEQUEEN's Funky Y and LADYBOUNCE's NOB)

2586
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:14,699
(The first group is controlling their power well.)

2587
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:29,408
(Exclaiming)

2588
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:30,648
(You did great.)

2589
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:31,819
(She's copying the highlight move already.)

2590
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:33,050
I could only see Bada.

2591
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:34,989
Their physique is no joke.

2592
01:57:36,819 --> 01:57:38,789
Let's go, Lia Kim!

2593
01:57:38,819 --> 01:57:40,159
Let's go, Kirsten.

2594
01:57:40,529 --> 01:57:42,188
Akanen.

2595
01:57:42,189 --> 01:57:43,729
Let's go, Halo.

2596
01:57:43,899 --> 01:57:45,898
(The second group for the audition of the main dancer)

2597
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:47,899
(Akanen, Lia Kim, Halo, and Kirsten)

2598
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:50,939
Gosh.

2599
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,439
(Keeping them in check)

2600
01:57:55,369 --> 01:57:56,539
(TSUBAKILL's Akanen and 1MILLION's Lia Kim)

2601
01:58:15,989 --> 01:58:17,229
That's insane.

2602
01:58:25,399 --> 01:58:26,500
That's crazy.

2603
01:58:35,949 --> 01:58:37,250
She might win.

2604
01:58:43,819 --> 01:58:45,289
(What did I just see?)

2605
01:58:51,399 --> 01:58:54,769
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2606
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:56,228
(Unbelievable)

2607
01:58:56,229 --> 01:59:00,839
(The leaders did show their class.)

2608
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,368
(Kirsten did it!)

2609
01:59:02,369 --> 01:59:03,439
That was insane.

2610
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:05,210
They were so good.

2611
01:59:05,239 --> 01:59:06,779
They are leaders for a reason.

2612
01:59:06,909 --> 01:59:09,350
They all showed why they're the leaders.

2613
01:59:09,609 --> 01:59:11,149
They're on another level.

2614
01:59:11,279 --> 01:59:12,979
Kirsten is like a tank.

2615
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:14,890
She's like a bulldozer.

2616
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:18,390
I saw Bada, but Kirsten was...

2617
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:20,529
Is the floor okay?

2618
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:23,489
(Thankfully, it is okay.)

2619
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:25,629
(Shaking his head)

2620
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:27,130
This one's not easy.

2621
01:59:27,329 --> 01:59:30,399
There will be a re-audition.

2622
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,299
1MILLION's Lia Kim.

2623
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:34,538
- Let's go! - Let's go.

2624
01:59:34,539 --> 01:59:36,108
BEBE's Bada.

2625
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:37,879
(BEBE's Bada)

2626
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,578
JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten.

2627
01:59:39,579 --> 01:59:41,350
(JAM REPUBLIC's Kirsten)

2628
01:59:41,449 --> 01:59:42,680
TSUBAKILL's Akanen.

2629
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:45,079
(TSUBAKILL's Akanen)

2630
01:59:45,149 --> 01:59:46,978
It'll be two at a time.

2631
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:48,019
(The first group for the second audition)

2632
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:49,020
(Akanen of TSUBA KILL and Bada of BEBE)

2633
01:59:49,021 --> 01:59:50,519
It's my choreography. I need to win.

2634
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:51,618
I'm confident.

2635
01:59:51,619 --> 01:59:53,819
I will become the main dancer.

2636
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:02,068
Gosh.

2637
02:00:02,069 --> 02:00:03,670
(Bada of BEBE and Akanen of TSUBA KILL)

2638
02:00:24,090 --> 02:00:26,889
(The first group finished neatly.)

2639
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:28,629
- You did well! - Let's go, Kirsten.

2640
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:29,959
Let's go, Kirsten.

2641
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,198
Let's go, Lia Kim.

2642
02:00:32,199 --> 02:00:34,500
I'll make sure to tear up the stage.

2643
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,130
I was very confident.

2644
02:00:36,199 --> 02:00:37,599
(The second group for the audition)

2645
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:39,039
(Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC and Lia Kim of 1MILLION)

2646
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:44,039
(Exclaiming)

2647
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,010
(Lia Kim of 1MILLION and Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC)

2648
02:00:49,949 --> 02:00:51,149
(Keeping in check)

2649
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,868
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2650
02:01:07,869 --> 02:01:09,300
(They did it!)

2651
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:12,038
It's neck and neck.

2652
02:01:12,039 --> 02:01:14,369
I actually got goosebumps.

2653
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:16,710
That was so cool.

2654
02:01:16,939 --> 02:01:18,739
Are you going to join BEBE?

2655
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:20,140
Are they going to let me in?

2656
02:01:20,310 --> 02:01:21,750
You are probably too old to join them.

2657
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:24,619
I feel like I just got hit. It hurts.

2658
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:26,949
Gosh.

2659
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:29,719
They were different, but both were good.

2660
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:30,819
What's going to happen?

2661
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,460
How do you choose?

2662
02:01:33,289 --> 02:01:36,829
There's going to be another audition.

2663
02:01:36,859 --> 02:01:38,228
(The leader class will have the third audition.)

2664
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:39,799
I like that.

2665
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,029
We'd love that.

2666
02:01:41,369 --> 02:01:42,929
Bada of BEBE...

2667
02:01:42,930 --> 02:01:46,938
and Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC will be in the third audition.

2668
02:01:46,939 --> 02:01:48,140
That's insane.

2669
02:01:48,539 --> 02:01:50,779
I wanted to see them in a dance battle.

2670
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:52,079
Lia.

2671
02:01:52,210 --> 02:01:54,380
You did so well.

2672
02:01:54,449 --> 02:01:56,749
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2673
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,279
You were so cool.

2674
02:01:59,119 --> 02:02:00,279
Finally.

2675
02:02:00,689 --> 02:02:03,988
My whole intention of going in, especially for this challenge is,

2676
02:02:03,989 --> 02:02:05,260
to be the main dancer.

2677
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:08,229
This is my choreography. I must win.

2678
02:02:08,289 --> 02:02:10,489
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2679
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:11,760
Kirsten.

2680
02:02:11,761 --> 02:02:13,529
Okay, let's go!

2681
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:17,470
(Who will be the main dancer among the leader class?)

2682
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:18,539
(Focused)

2683
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:21,510
(Bada of BEBE and Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC)

2684
02:02:22,069 --> 02:02:24,140
(It's the final competition for the main dancer title.)

2685
02:02:37,819 --> 02:02:39,390
(This is insane!)

2686
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:55,109
That was hot.

2687
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:57,778
That was so cool. That's insane.

2688
02:02:57,779 --> 02:03:00,210
I think I'm in love.

2689
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:02,380
I give them my respect.

2690
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:03,849
(Automatically standing up)

2691
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:04,879
Seriously...

2692
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,119
(Touched)

2693
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:07,379
(Bada and Kirsten made everyone stand up.)

2694
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,920
Oh, my gosh.

2695
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:11,619
Gosh.

2696
02:03:11,989 --> 02:03:13,619
That was so cool.

2697
02:03:13,890 --> 02:03:15,760
It was like a movie.

2698
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,930
I got goosebumps.

2699
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:20,329
I know. I got goosebumps too.

2700
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:21,800
How did they do it?

2701
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:23,728
If you were the judge...

2702
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:24,769
I'd choose Kirsten.

2703
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:27,198
Kirsten is a really good dancer.

2704
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,339
I think it could be nice to get her directions.

2705
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:31,038
- I'm kind of excited. - It's exciting.

2706
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:33,479
She has to be the main dancer. There's no other way.

2707
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:35,309
I don't think so. I think Bada will win.

2708
02:03:35,310 --> 02:03:37,279
Bada was just as good.

2709
02:03:37,479 --> 02:03:39,219
She didn't lose to Kirsten.

2710
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:40,890
I couldn't see Kirsten.

2711
02:03:40,989 --> 02:03:42,289
What's going to happen?

2712
02:03:42,789 --> 02:03:45,090
- I have a lot of thoughts. - I know.

2713
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:48,829
Considering this performance only, I'd say this person is more...

2714
02:03:49,159 --> 02:03:51,999
She had more clear and clean moments.

2715
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,269
- You mean her? - Yes.

2716
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:56,269
That's what's troubling me too.

2717
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:58,599
I'm sure lots of things are going through their minds.

2718
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,140
Either one could win.

2719
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:03,909
We'll announce the main dancer of the leader class.

2720
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:06,979
The main dancer we chose is...

2721
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:10,818
(Bada of BEBE versus Kirsten of JAM REPUBLIC)

2722
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:15,850
(Who will be the main dancer of the leader class?)

2723
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:19,390
We'll announce the main dancer of the leader class.

2724
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:22,590
The main dancer we chose is...

2725
02:04:22,689 --> 02:04:23,728
(Who will it be?)

2726
02:04:23,729 --> 02:04:25,229
Please, BEBE.

2727
02:04:25,359 --> 02:04:29,399
(Who will be the main dancer of the leader class?)

2728
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:31,299
Bada of BEBE.

2729
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:34,269
(The main dancer of the leader class is Bada of BEBE.)

2730
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:35,368
It's Bada of BEBE.

2731
02:04:35,369 --> 02:04:36,970
(Scream!)

2732
02:04:37,069 --> 02:04:38,179
It's Bada of BEBE.

2733
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:39,710
(Kirsten was close, but she didn't get the spot.)

2734
02:04:40,609 --> 02:04:42,449
Well done. Congratulations.

2735
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:44,049
- Thank you. - You did really well.

2736
02:04:44,050 --> 02:04:45,648
Thank you for doing the choreography.

2737
02:04:45,649 --> 02:04:46,750
(You both did so well.)

2738
02:04:46,949 --> 02:04:48,449
I approve of this. I knew she'd make it.

2739
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:49,688
She took it.

2740
02:04:49,689 --> 02:04:50,859
That's cool.

2741
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,189
Bada was awesome.

2742
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:54,090
Kirsten was so cool at the end.

2743
02:04:54,329 --> 02:04:56,759
Nice, Kirsten.

2744
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:58,429
It's okay. I'm kind of glad.

2745
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:00,868
Her ideas of the way she created it,

2746
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:04,099
to me, I wanted to be a part of the piece.

2747
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:08,369
I'm actually really glad that Bada took the main dancer.

2748
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:09,738
That was so much fun.

2749
02:05:09,739 --> 02:05:11,179
I wish I could've watched it in the front row.

2750
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:12,710
I know.

2751
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:14,279
First of all, it was great.

2752
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:16,078
Honestly, I've thought...

2753
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:19,679
even if the choreography is bad, a dancer can dance it off nicely.

2754
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:22,818
But for the first time, I thought, because the choreography is good,

2755
02:05:22,819 --> 02:05:24,590
dancers can look better.

2756
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,319
That's what I felt.

2757
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:27,930
That's a high praise.

2758
02:05:28,189 --> 02:05:31,599
There weren't so many straightforward moves,

2759
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:34,199
but I could understand what the song was about.

2760
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:37,898
I got the impression that she put a lot of thought into this.

2761
02:05:37,899 --> 02:05:40,568
And she put that into moves well.

2762
02:05:40,569 --> 02:05:43,209
And another thing is, to be honest,

2763
02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:45,609
the song was unfair.

2764
02:05:46,609 --> 02:05:48,978
If it were a Kendrick Lamar song,

2765
02:05:48,979 --> 02:05:50,449
she could've won.

2766
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,519
The person who thoroughly understood the lyric...

2767
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,448
did a better job. That's obvious.

2768
02:05:55,449 --> 02:05:57,519
There was a language barrier,

2769
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,719
and of course, when dancing,

2770
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:01,859
there could be a slight difference.

2771
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:05,129
To be honest, I didn't know Bada before.

2772
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:06,760
We're meeting through the show.

2773
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,929
Now I know Bada.

2774
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,140
Do you know what I mean?

2775
02:06:12,939 --> 02:06:14,609
- That's cute. - I know.

2776
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:18,209
And I think that with an amazing dancer like Kirsten,

2777
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:20,680
we already know that you are going to use everybody. All the leaders.

2778
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,249
I'm not sure if I can say this,

2779
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:25,249
but I haven't seen any tall dancers make it in Korea...

2780
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,679
as a woman.

2781
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:28,719
They all prefer dancers around 160cm.

2782
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:31,618
When you want to use dancers taller than that,

2783
02:06:31,619 --> 02:06:33,259
they'd be on the sides and couldn't be the main dancer.

2784
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:34,859
I think it's a revolution.

2785
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:36,729
Thank you.

2786
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:39,658
We'll be expecting good performances.

2787
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:40,969
Thank you so much.

2788
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:42,228
(Her choreography has been chosen, and she also took the main dancer.)

2789
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:45,269
I can't describe it in just one word, "happiness."

2790
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:47,970
It's a sense of euphoria that I secured the spot.

2791
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:52,379
I'll show a performance that befits the leader class.

2792
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:55,350
I want to make the coolest video of the leader class.

2793
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:58,648
(Please vote for the crew song performance...)

2794
02:06:58,649 --> 02:07:01,090
(to determine the final winning crew.)

2795
02:07:01,149 --> 02:07:03,289
(Finally, the dance video of each class is revealed.)

2796
02:07:03,319 --> 02:07:04,520
(That was crazy.)

2797
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,289
(Revealing the dance video of the best quality)

2798
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:08,329
(That's intense.)

2799
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:10,060
(The filming site of the rookie class)

2800
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:11,898
(Rena took the main part.)

2801
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:13,559
(We must be shown in the video.)

2802
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:15,828
(I've never taken the main part.)

2803
02:07:15,829 --> 02:07:18,600
(I don't have any parts.)

2804
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:21,170
(Because I'm the main dancer, )

2805
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:24,380
(I can decide the parts, right?)

2806
02:07:24,579 --> 02:07:25,938
(Downy)

2807
02:07:25,939 --> 02:07:27,209
(Downy needs to be on the side.)

2808
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:28,349
(Downy's timing isn't right.)

2809
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:30,408
(Downy, be careful with your timing.)

2810
02:07:30,409 --> 02:07:31,549
(She kept pointing it out.)

2811
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,879
(I didn't even want to answer.)

2812
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,720
(Switch with Downy.)

2813
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:36,789
(No, I don't want to.)

2814
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:40,459
(She didn't fully trust me as a leader.)

2815
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:42,528
(It felt like she was ruling me out.)

2816
02:07:42,529 --> 02:07:45,028
(It made me so sad.)

2817
02:07:45,029 --> 02:07:47,359
(I want to go home.)

2818
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,828
(Choosing the worst dancer of the Class Mission)

2819
02:07:49,829 --> 02:07:52,139
(Who is the worst dancer that LaTrice picked?)

2820
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:53,438
(The worst dancer...)

2821
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:55,639
(who is unqualified for the leader class...)

2822
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,969
(It's her.)

2823
02:07:56,970 --> 02:07:58,809
(What's the result of choosing the worst dancer for each class?)

2824
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:00,339
(It was the worst.)

2825
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:01,880
(I was so upset by the result.)

2826
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:05,679
(The third mission, K-pop Death match Mission)

2827
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:08,919
(One of the crews will be eliminated for the first time.)

2828
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:10,019
(I should give it my all and win.)

2829
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:11,188
(We must not be eliminated.)

2830
02:08:11,189 --> 02:08:14,059
(The crews who chose the same agency...)

2831
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:16,729
(will have a one-on-one match.)

2832
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:18,499
- Goodness. - Oh, gosh.

2833
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,429
(We have to choose the agency we want.)

2834
02:08:20,430 --> 02:08:22,429
(Please let there be only one crew.)

2835
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,999
(Every crew might choose the same agency.)

2836
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,438
(What happens if every crew chooses the same agency?)

2837
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:29,839
(They'll pick the final two crews through the song-stealing battle.)

2838
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,009
(If we don't get to take the song we chose, )

2839
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:32,139
(we'll have to make a new choreography.)

2840
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,579
(We can never let them take our song.)

2841
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:35,608
(We're not here to fool around, )

2842
02:08:35,609 --> 02:08:37,408
(so we have to be serious about it.)

2843
02:08:37,409 --> 02:08:39,050
(You have to be more powerful.)

2844
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,750
(I almost broke down.)

2845
02:08:43,149 --> 02:08:44,560
(How come Lusher keeps getting in the way?)

2846
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:47,188
(Powerfully!)

2847
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:49,188
(Soweon and Cheche, )

2848
02:08:49,189 --> 02:08:52,729
(make it balanced.)

2849
02:08:53,829 --> 02:08:56,100
(I felt a sense of crisis.)

2850
02:08:56,369 --> 02:08:58,839
(The crew that got eliminated after losing in the song-stealing battle)

2851
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:00,839
(One crew got that many votes?)

2852
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:02,608
(It's this crew that got eliminated.)

2853
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:05,679
(Which crew got eliminated...)

2854
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:07,210
(after getting an overwhelming number of votes?)

2855
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:13,079
(We were in crisis.)
