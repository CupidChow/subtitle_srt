00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,890
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,959
(The cozy nests for the crews, the hideouts)

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,729
(We present to you their hideouts.)

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,399
(Six hideouts of the crews' characteristics)

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,699
I couldn't sleep.

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
Come to think of it...

8
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,938
(The queens get dolled up every time they get a chance.)

9
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,310
Redlic's "Get It Beauty."

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,779
- I'll show you my "Get It Beauty." - Okay.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,949
(A spray mist for moist skin)

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,048
Goodness.

13
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,749
My nose is getting higher.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,118
(A highlighter for a glowing face)

15
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,419
Did some powder get into your throat?

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,820
Her bold touches are her appeal.

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,989
(Finishing it off with glitter under her eyes)

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,020
Check it out.

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,629
- There's the camera. - There it is.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,959
(Looking attractive)

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,428
Yoonji's got make up on.

22
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,898
Goodness. I'm a hot girl now.

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,398
(I'll come back to your makeup shop.)

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,700
To me, Redlic is the best.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,639
(LADYBOUNCE's hideout is like a dressing room.)

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
How does it look?

27
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,810
(They take performances seriously.)

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,009
Help me out, NOB. I can't choose what to wear.

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,180
Should I wear this top or not?

30
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,109
- Sisters. - Does this look better?

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,979
(NOB can't decide what to wear.)

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,679
I recommend wearing a charismatic outfit...

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,390
rather than a dancing outfit.

34
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,590
(Like this?)

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,818
(Coughing)

36
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,958
It lacks charisma.

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,420
Why don't you wear this one?

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,590
Does it look charismatic?

39
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,689
This is rather...

40
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,599
Or something like this.

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
(Wolf'Lo's hideout is like a practice room for hip-hop.)

42
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,569
I've always wanted to dance something like this.

43
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,339
- I badly wanted to dance my way. - Exactly.

44
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,540
I'm exhilarated. This is so fun.

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,669
Turn up the volume.

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,780
Let's dance.

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,639
- Let's dance. - Check out these moves.

48
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,279
- Absolutely. - These ones.

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,848
(I dance to hip-hop when I'm tired.)

50
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:52,650
When would I ever dance like this?

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,790
You have to hold the hips.

52
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,620
We would never dance at a party like this.

53
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,818
Stand there. I'll take a photo.

54
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,059
In 1, 2, 3.

55
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,930
(The members of BEBE capture the moments in various poses.)

56
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,458
(Lovely photos of BEBE)

57
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,228
Let's take one with the camera.

58
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,800
- A peace sign. - Can we take a photo?

59
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,039
(BEBE's favourite camera)

60
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,099
Dance.

61
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,638
(Tatter acts cute in front of the camera.)

62
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,740
(The camera is falling in love with her.)

63
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,508
(BEBE is still collecting memories!)

64
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,079
Happy birthday to you.

65
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,579
Happy birthday to you.

66
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,319
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

67

(Here's 1MILLION's energizer.)

68
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,288
I bet you'll do the sensual moves the best.

69
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,318
- That's for sure. - Totally. She's so sensual.

70
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,559
(Excited)

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,628
(She dances sensually as she's glad to hear a compliment.)

72
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,900
(Used to it)

73
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,129
You're scaring her.

74
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,400
So sensual.

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,199
It's not too severe, but we're sensitive.

76
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,909
But we will.

77
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,109
Because we are the undertakers.

78
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,739

80

We need comfort.

81
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,219
We need comfort!

82
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,519
Hey, what's the name of...

83
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,889
(The members find comfort by hugging Mr. Smith.)

84
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,688
(Mr. Smith is there for them during interviews.)

85
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,060
It actually relieves my anxiety.

86
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,330

98

- Why can't I get it? - This is so tiring.

I brought this because you looked so tired.

104

You're the best.

105

113
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,499
Should we take this when we feel down?

114
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,729
- Sure. - Sure.

115
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,939
I'll take one now.

- What? - No way!

139

- There are so many. - Oh, my gosh.

140

This is the last performance before the Finals,

141
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,528

142
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,929

I bet they're battle dancers.

170

- Who? - Could it be Trix?

171
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,258

182
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,148
I never saw this coming.

183
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,688
The hip-hop queen with stylish moves...

184
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,688
from the winning crew of "Street Woman Fighter 1."

185
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,790
The leader of HolyBang, Honey J!

186
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,389
(Awesome)

187
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,730
(Honey J led HolyBang to the championship title.)

188
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,499
(She freely goes from the battle scene...)

189
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,638
(to the choreography scene.)

190
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,670
(The dancer with insane skills, Honey J)

191
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,739
Honey J!

192
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,578
The leader of the winner.

193
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,180
- Oh, my gosh! - No way!

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,850
The line-up is insane.

195
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,679
I thought it was an actual street dance event.

196
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,219
To be a fair judge,

197
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,588
I'll evaluate them objectively.

198
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,059
I won't rate yours that high...

199
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,529
if you make it lame by trying to be witty.

200
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,689
Okay. Great.

201
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,299
- He's scary. - He doesn't like it vague.

202
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,929
He's indeed a battle dancer.

203
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,930
I think he'll be very precise.

204
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,898
These six crews will take part...

205
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,398
in the Battle Performance Mission at the risk of survival.

206
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,039
Audience, are you ready?

207
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,138
- Yes! - Let's fight.

208
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,878
I won't let MANNEQUEEN win.

209
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,578
Definitely not.

210
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,009
I'm not scared at all.

211
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,619
Though Wolf'Lo is a great team,

212
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,749
we've got that young vibe, right?

213
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,948
Let's do this, girls.

214
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,849
- Let's go! - Let's go!

215
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,759
(Battle Performance Mission)

216
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,758
The first crews...

217
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,689
of the Battle Performance Mission are...

218
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
BEBE and Wolf'Lo.

219
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,169
(That's an amazing match-up.)

220
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,399
That sounds fun.

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,539
We can do this.

222
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,938
- Yes. - We've got this.

223
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,208
In 1, 2, 3.

224
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,310
- Woof! - Woof!

225
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,309
It's BEBE versus Wolf'Lo.

226
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,639
The first crews.

227
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,809
Oh, my gosh.

228
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,948
Oh, my.

229
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:29,949
I bet they're nervous.

230
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,120
Here they come.

231
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,620
(Cheering)

232
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,859
- They look like fighters. - An actual fight.

233
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,089
Fighters, enter the fight zone.

234
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,799
I'm scared. Let's look pretty when we get out there.

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,299
(BEBE and Wolf'Lo are on the stage.)

236
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,740
A dance-off with the crew's pride on the line.

237
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,069
It's BEBE versus Wolf'Lo.

238
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,178
The losing crew of the two will be an election candidate,

239
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,250
so you must be desperate to win this battle.

240
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,450
Since it's the first match-up, we'll win,

241
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,120
and you won't remember anything but BEBE when you go home!

242
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,759
(Some nerve.)

243
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,658
(So cute!)

244
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,759
(They copy it when it's cute.)

245
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,629
Oh, yes. I'm going to say the same thing.

246
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,299
Great. Thanks. I needed that.

247
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,869
Guys, you're all aware of how good BEBE is, right?

248
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,000
- Yes! - Yes!

249
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,769
I bet they're really good at battle dancing too.

250
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,808
So, I think they can be defeated by us...

251
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,950
and go to the Elimination Battle.

252
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,480
(She killed it.)

253
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,649
You can come back to watch them then. Okay?

254
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,649
You're welcome to come back for that.

255
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,360
Halo is so charismatic.

256
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,658
She's good!

257
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,830
It's so fun to watch other people fight!

258
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,199
(The day of deciding the match-up)

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,199
BEBE has decided to choose...

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,470
Wolf'Lo.

261
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,539
(BEBE chooses Wolf'Lo.)

262
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,009
They were smart, though.

263
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,779
Wolf'Lo has won individual battles, but not the group battles.

264
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,450
But BEBE dances in sync.

265
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,080
It's a good strategy.

266
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,619
They've been in many dance-offs so far,

267
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,719
so I bet they're out of sources.

268
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
- Right. - We did figure them out already.

269
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,658
(Wolf'Lo has been in two Elimination Battles...)

270
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,459
(plus the Battle with the Weakest Dancer.)

271
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,599
(They've shown many group performances using props.)

272
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,830
We're almost out of battle sequences.

273
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,028
We prepared group dance routines,

274
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,898
and we lost all three times.

275
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,600
That got me thinking.

276
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,839
I feel like it's more than we can chew.

277
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Right.

278
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:41,408
We were to have a dance-off against BEBE,

279
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,519
and it was the crew's song.

280
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,849
(They have to come up with a new performance for Part C.)

281
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,620
(BEBE's song is totally the opposite style of Wolf'Lo's.)

282
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,288
They made it look sexy.

283
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,830
The song is so sexy.

284
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,229
How are we supposed to dance to this?

285
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,700
- I don't know. - I have no idea what to do.

286
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,869
Why do I imagine this to become like "Shut Down?"

287
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,469
(Yeni Wang's shut down...)

288
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,339
I don't believe it.

289
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,808
Just close up.

290
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,239
I'll shut down.

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,279
(Haechi Wang is tired.)

292
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,538
(It is the day of the interim check before they know it.)

293
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,849
(Interim check day)

294
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,110
(Flapping sound)

295
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,648
Again.

296
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,750
(Flapping sound)

297
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,178
This sound came from behind us.

298
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,749
(Flapping sound)

299
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,259
I asked, "What is this flapping sound?"

300
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,319
(A mysterious sound fills the studio.)

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
What was that?

302
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
(The flapping sound gets bigger.)

303
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:31,028
- It comes out like this. - What is that sound?

304
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm so curious.

305
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,629
Ready, go.

306
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,798
(BEBE was behind the sound.)

307
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,870
(They are using umbrellas as props.)

308
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,669
We got the idea from Wolf'Lo's battle performance.

309
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,278
We were determined to make it look better.

310
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,178
(Paying homage to Wolf'Lo by using their song and signature prop)

311
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,648
We wanted to imitate a lot of Wolf'Lo's characteristics.

312
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,320
- Let's change. - Okay.

313
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,879
- Let's give it a try. - Okay.

314
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,719
(Wolf'Lo wore swaggy tracksuit sets.)

315
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,219
I think we'd look cool in windbreakers...

316
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,690
- like Wolf'Lo. - That's right.

317
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,729
We wanted to show them...

318
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,599
we were capable of looking cool in a dark way.

319
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,869
We wanted to show them we were good at this.

320
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,969
So we decided to become them...

321
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,499
and dressed up like them.

322
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
(Lusher channels the Halo in her.)

323
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:15,440
("BEBE'Lo" is ready to battle.)

324
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,278
This time, the interim check...

325
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,750
- will be done by the crews. - I see.

326
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,518
I'm really curious how they interpreted that song.

327
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,249
This is tough.

328
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,250
Shall we vote?

329
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,549
(They each guess which crew will be the winner or be eliminated.)

330
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,990
Wait a second.

331
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,889
This is the same as our pose.

332
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:38,058
(BEBE is perfect at copying the Group Battle intro.)

333
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,959
It's interesting that they are doing the same intro.

334
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,199
(That's not bad.)

335
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,499
They look like Wolf'Lo.

336
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,699
That's Halo.

337
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
(I'm Ha-Lusher.)

338
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,970
That's why they chose that outfit.

339
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,449
- This is what they were doing. - I see.

340
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,148
It was this sound.

341
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,220
(They finally figure out where the flapping sound came from.)

342
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,860
- It's hop-hop. - They're doing hip-hop.

343
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,759
They're good at this.

344
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,869
(Gosh, that's unbelievable.)

345
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,909
They're so good.

346
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,740
It's powerful and clean.

347
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,549
That's cool.

348
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,879
BEBE's performance is fun.

349
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,048
Wait. I think we need a new strategy.

350
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,120
Don't we need to change everything to compete with this?

351
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,518
(Sighing)

352
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,259
I have a conscience...

353
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,529
and I think we'll lose 4 to 0.

354
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,659
I wasn't confident.

355
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,330
We wouldn't get any votes with the current performance.

356
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,500
We have the result.

357
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,439
(Gasping)

358
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,739
- It's here. - It's time to face the result.

359
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,109
- One, two, three. - Okay.

360
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,309
(What is the result of the interim check?)

361
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,110
LADYBOUNCE expects the winner to be...

362
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,479
Wolf'Lo.

363
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,979
- Expects the winner to be Wolf'Lo. - What?

364
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,850
- What? - What?

365
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,449
- Why? - Why?

366
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,359
It was a novel performance that focuses on the music.

367
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,489
(Unbelievable)

368
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,690
It worked.

369
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,699
This isn't an event I'm doing...

370
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,699
just to have fun.

371
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,329
- This is... - It's for survival.

372
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,699
I think we should try harder...

373
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,668
to show people a refreshing side of us...

374
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,339
- for TSUBA KILL and Deep N Dap. - Right.

375
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,508
(Wolf'Lo's refreshing performance)

376
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,340
- Gosh. - They're using a chair.

377
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,309
This is new.

378
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,279
They look different today.

379
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,690
(Peek-a-boo.)

380
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,389
Is this really Wolf'Lo?

381
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,960
(Here I am.)

382
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,298
That was good.

383
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,059
So creative.

384
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,428
(Enthusiastic applause)

385
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,699
Okay.

386
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,168
I've never seen Halo wearing pants as tight as those.

387
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,139
- Sexy Wolf'Lo. - This is nice.

388
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,039
(Everyone gives positive feedback to the novel performance.)

389
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,949
MANNEQUEEN expects the winner to be...

390
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,678
(What is going on?)

391
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,878
Wolf'Lo.

392
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,918
(Not just MANNEQUEEN, but also JAM REPUBLIC.)

393
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,149
- This is nice. - Yes.

394
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,850
- Wolf'Lo. - All right.

395
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,418
- Okay. - Wait a second.

396
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,490
(All crews expect Wolf'Lo to be the winner.)

397
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,059
- Look at this. - All right.

398
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,759
We were in last place until yesterday.

399
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,928
We are capable of this.

400
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,139
I don't believe it.

401
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,739
I liked how the sequence...

402
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,969
was energetic and fluid.

403
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,609
They created various moves with the chair.

404
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,839
I feel like we've been waiting...

405
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,508
for this difference in Wolf'Lo.

406
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,019
- I think I appreciate that more. - Yes.

407
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,349
Maybe we should keep the chair.

408
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,749
We were going to change that.

409
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,689
- No. - No.

410
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,518
Develop.

411
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,658
Let's just change the shape of the chair.

412
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,658
- The shape? - It looks like an office chair.

413
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,659
Yes, it did.

414
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,798
This means BEBE received four elimination votes.

415
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,028
- Yes, they did. - Gosh.

416
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,628
They won't be able to sleep at night.

417
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,000
- They're in trouble. - It's Bada's birthday today.

418
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,940
You're right. It's Bada's birthday.

419
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,070
Wait a second.

420
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,179
(Gasping)

421
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,508
(All crews expect BEBE to be eliminated.)

422
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,579
They didn't live up to our expectation.

423
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,220
Their umbrella performance wasn't better than Wolf'Lo's.

424
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,479
When I opened the umbrella,

425
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,689
it wasn't as solid as I expected.

426
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,789
- We were just flapping it. - Right.

427
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,589
If BEBE decided to use umbrellas,

428
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,028
they should've put on a performance better than Wolf'Lo's,

429
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,829
but it felt like they were just doing their routine with umbrellas.

430
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,470
Their umbrella performance wasn't better than Wolf'Lo's.

431
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,570
All the crews chose us.

432
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,378
This suddenly reminds me of the Mega Crew Mission.

433
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,279
(We believed in our performance.)

434
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,408
(For the Mega Crew Mission, )

435
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,320
(all the crews expected BEBE to be eliminated.)

436
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,788
All the votes went to one crew.

437
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,788
I was sad because I was familiar with the situation.

438
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,729
I was very upset,

439
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,899
but I didn't have time...

440
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,999
to dwell on my sad emotions.

441
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,240
Since they gave us feedback about the umbrellas,

442
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,999
- we should work on that. - You're right.

443
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,969
We learned through the Mega Crew Mission.

444
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,538
This is what the public will think.

445
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,008
Let's admit we weren't good enough.

446
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,278
We don't have time to mull over that.

447
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,150
You're right. We have to quickly go and fix it.

448
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,219
After being disappointed during the Mega Crew Mission,

449
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,750
I've become better at accepting criticism.

450
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,028
I think they say these things for us to improve.

451
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,490
We need to apply the feedback to our performance.

452
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,798
We don't have to focus on winning, but on having no regrets.

453
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,899
You never know...

454
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
this might be our last stage.

455
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,769
Our goal is to show everyone our best effort.

456
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,169
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

457
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,369
- Get excited. - All right.

458
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,940
Will BEBE use the umbrellas? I think they won't, right?

459
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,608
They'll probably use it. They can't come up with a new idea.

460
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,279
They will have no idea we're using these fans.

461
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,519
(While listening to BEBE's crew song "Chemistry")

462
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,788
I suddenly imagined Cleopatra's fans...

463
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,258
being used in a dance.

464
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,788
- Is it like this? - Yes.

465
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,788
We can attach feathers to gloves and wear them.

466
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,858
That's a good idea.

467
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,028
- Feathers. - What's this?

468
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,098
(That's how they came up with the feathers in BEBE's colour.)

469
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,229
- They are feathers in BEBE's colour. - These are spangles.

470
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,500
- Yes, we'll use spangles. - This fake gem cost 1.5 dollars.

471
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,140
You look like a master craftsman making this here.

472
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,068
It's very eye-catching.

473
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,508
It also looks nice from afar.

474
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,808
We were open-minded and embraced dance itself,

475
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,308
which led us to complete the picture.

476
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,449
This is the most I've laughed while putting a dance together.

477
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,818
This isn't easy.

478
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,558
It's so red.

479
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,189
I really isn't easy.

480
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,700
I honestly felt like giving up.

481
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,858
If we're going to use the umbrellas,

482
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,599
we need something else that will surprise the audience.

483
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,169
We thought the umbrellas had played their part.

484
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,509
We decided to give up the umbrellas.

485
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,808
How is it going?

486
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,709
- Hi. - Hi.

487
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,739
The lyrics say "It's so red."

488
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,278
We thought of rubbing red paint...

489
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,880
- on our bodies. - Okay.

490
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,519
I love it. That's a good idea.

491
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,288
I told them to do what they wanted.

492
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,189
I just helped make decisions.

493
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,720
(Leader Bada watches the other members' choreography.)

494
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,189
That's very nice.

495
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,329
- Really? - Yes.

496
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,130
(She flaps her shirt with joy.)

497
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,169
The first part is good too. You put it together well.

498
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,068
We have to come up with new ideas for this mission.

499
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,268
I think that was why Bada gave us a chance to do that.

500
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,308
We'll come up with killer moves...

501
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,338
for Parts A and B.

502
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,409
(Kill it.)

503
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,879
- Let's go. - Let's go.

504
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,078
- Let's go. - Let's go.

505
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,079
(Battle Performance Mission Day)

506
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,249
- Hello. - Hello.

507
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,449
(The air is heavy in BEBE's green room.)

508
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,019
What time is the table arriving?

509
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,420
I'll give them a call.

510
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,159
We're using a prop in Part A.

511
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,359
It's a table.

512
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,730
We have to practice soon.

513
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,199
(They table hasn't arrived yet.)

514
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,930
They're very sorry.

515
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,599
What did they say?

516
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,039
It won't work.

517
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,869
Does that mean the table might not arrive?

518
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,239
We had so many things on our list and forgot about it.

519
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,379
Everyone was frazzled.

520
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,209
When I realized we wouldn't be able to put on the performance,

521
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,009
tears came to my eyes.

522
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,018
We were desperate.

523
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,249
It was an emergency. It was a total disaster.

524
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,219
We couldn't do our performance without the table.

525
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,960
It was our secret weapon.

526
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,460
(Bada and Lusher go out to look for a similar table.)

527
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,269
(A moment later)

528
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
We found a similar table.

529
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,108
I think this will work.

530
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,538
- This one? - Ours looked like this.

531
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,940
This one? Do we just have to attach the legs?

532
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,180
We went to the prop room and saw familiar-looking table legs.

533
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,649
(During the rehearsal)

534
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,950
Let's try this.

535
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,750
(The table they used for the rehearsal.)

536
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,018
Is this okay?

537
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,289
- Can we use this? - This table is better.

538
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,430
I think it's sturdier.

539
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,328
It was destiny.

540
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,528
We were so worried,

541
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,699
but heard they found the same table as ours.

542
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,838
- It's sturdy and stable. - Right.

543
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,309
It's also black, which matches us.

544
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,109
Yes, it's black.

545
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,778
This drove off any bad luck.

546
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,240
Yes, this was meant to be.

547
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,078
(They are all at peace except one person.)

548
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,380
It was a relief we had a table.

549
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,420
Are you okay, Soweon?

550
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,018
- Go use the restroom. - It's okay.

551
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,118
(Unable to fight the tears, Soweon gets up.)

552
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,259
It's okay.

553
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,319
Don't cry.

554
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,289
It isn't your fault.

555
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,130
I was in charge of getting the table.

556
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,869
I didn't want to worry the crew with something like this.

557
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,940
I wanted to be the trustworthy youngest member.

558
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,900
I felt bad...

559
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,440
about that to the other members.

560
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,608
It's really okay. It all worked out.

561
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,250
I believe it's the whole crew's responsibility.

562
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,880
I'm sure she feels bad,

563
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,680
but I hope she doesn't think it's her fault.

564
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,919
- Let's go. - Let's go.

565
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,019
Let's go.

566
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,660
Battle Performance Mission.

567
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,089
BEBE will go first.

568
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,028
Wolf'Lo will go next.

569
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,259
The winner will receive a benefit.

570
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,899
We'll receive a benefit?

571
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,199
You can choose the order to perform.

572
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,269
- I knew it. - Okay.

573
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,229
I think we should go second.

574
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,699
I believe it's important who goes second in a battle like this.

575
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,868
- It's better to go second. - It's better...

576
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,440
to leave a lasting impression at the end.

577
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:17,940
We can do well even if we go first.

578
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,508
This is the final step to the Finals.

579
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:21,679
It's the Battle Performance Mission.

580
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,809
It's BEBE versus Wolf'Lo.

581
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,778
We will now begin the battle between the two crews.

582
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:26,920
Are you guys ready?

583
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:29,490
(The audience is ready.)

584
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,548
Fight.

585
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,089
(The Battle Performance Mission between BEBE and Wolf'Lo begins.)

586
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,489
(BEBE prepared a table as their prop.)

587
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,059
What's that?

588
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They're using a prop from the start.

589
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,369
This is a hidden.

590
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
The height is intimidating.

591
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,240
I didn't see Bada.

592
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,068
I was wondering where she was,

593
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,980
then saw her waiting from below the stage.

594
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,078
The focus of Part A...

595
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,349
is the attack of the girls.

596
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,319
We were often called "Bada and the Girls."

597
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,819
Actually, we're able to dance with Bada because it's us.

598
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,858
You might be surprised after seeing that we have...

599
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,029
just as much power and energy as Bada.

600
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,299
(BEBE goes first in the free part.)

601
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,669
(They have high expectations.)

602
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,868
It's begun.

603
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,240
Cool off.

604
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,389
My gosh.

605
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,190
I've never seen BEBE do anything like that.

606
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,960
- It's a new look. - Yes, it is.

607
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,269
(Where are you looking?)

608
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,578
What is she doing?

609
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,480
Is she doing tumbling on top of the table?

610
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,609
I think she is.

611
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,059
There is a meme that was once popular.

612
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,619
I'm going to jump.

613
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,930
You thought I'd jump, didn't you?

614
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,430
That was cheeky.

615
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:17,659
You fell for it.

616
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,730
That's cute.

617
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,979
She's coughing.

618
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,578
She's pretending to cough.

619
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,740
- I got goosebumps. - She's coughing.

620
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,318
(It's Bada!)

621
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,319
Let's go, Bada!

622
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,518
Here we go.

623
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,519
I want to hear the song.

624
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,130
(In love)

625
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,108
We're in the spotlight,

626
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,509
so Wolf'Lo will have to try hard.

627
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,009
They have no idea what a battle is.

628
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,450
Next is Wolf'Lo.

629
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,578
We were going to create a stage...

630
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,720
that is organized, but allows the audience to enjoy it with us.

631
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,420
Let's go, Wolf'Lo.

632
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,720
Let's go, guys.

633
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,490
I even love the song.

634
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,130
(Charisma overload)

635
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,298
(Cheering)

636
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,368
They're scary.

637
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:32,539
They're even firing guns.

638
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,899
- What's that? - Is it a baseball bat?

639
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,960
Confetti.

640
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,858
Go, Baby Sleek.

641
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,028
Slit all their throats.

642
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,660
She slit everyone's throats.

643
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Nice.

644
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,579
They're good at shaking their hips now.

645
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,889
It's BEBE's dance.

646
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,519
This move?

647
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,660
(Wolf'Lo copies BEBE's signature move.)

648
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,670
(BEBE loves it.)

649
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,000
(She does the smoke dance.)

650
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,210
(She killed it!)

651
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,578
- Isn't she imitating Bada? - That's right.

652
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,349
She can only do that because they are same in height.

653
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,920
- We can't even do it. - And around.

654
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,719
(Excited)

655
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,859
That's right, Bada.

656
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,859
Do you think you're the only tall one here?

657
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,990
(Bada goes first in the improv part.)

658
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,900
I had to take away the spotlight.

659
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,529
She's starting right away.

660
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,499
- It's Bada. - Is it Bada?

661
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,539
- Yes. - Yes.

662
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,939
I won't let my crew...

663
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,339
get beaten up by the scary members of Wolf'Lo.

664
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,109
That's why I stepped up.

665
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,279
I expected Bada to perform.

666
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,259
(Marvelling)

667
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:29,679
She's provoking Halo.

668
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,848
Halo won't stand down.

669
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,019
Is it a battle between the leaders?

670
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,720
(Gasping)

671
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,889
Five, four,

672
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,589
three, two, one.

673
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,160
(You think you can steal the spotlight? I won't let you.)

674
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,539
(She loves the wit.)

675
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,298
Haechi Wang.

676
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,068
- She does that too often. - This is so entertaining.

677
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,269
I wonder which member of Wolf'Lo will go next?

678
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,440
I don't know. Maybe Baby Sleek?

679
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,950
One.

680
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,449
Switch, Wolf'Lo.

681
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,719
(Halo of Wolf'Lo goes next in the improv part.)

682
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,480
As the leader, I should battle their leader.

683
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,089
- Oh, Halo. - Okay.

684
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,699
(Screaming)

685
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,829
Gosh.

686
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,338
(Marvelling)

687
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,539
She's unbelievable.

688
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,119
(Getting goosebumps)

689
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,660
That's fire.

690
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,710
Four, three, two, one.

691
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,818
(I'm Halo, too.)

692
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:16,890
(I can't do this.)

693
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,319
- They're starting. - What?

694
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,019
- It's the crew song. - They're starting right away.

695
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,028
(Let's go!)

696
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,229
(Opposing crew song part)

697
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,930
(BEBE goes first.)

698
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,028
It's Wolf'Lo's crew song,

699
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,230
but BEBE can do a better job at interpreting it. Let's go.

700
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,469
They got rid of the umbrellas.

701
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,838
- They changed it to this. - You're right.

702
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,169
They decided to go with this.

703
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,539
They did Wolf'Lo.

704
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,609
(BEBE used Wolf'Lo's signature move.)

705
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,589
That's what you're doing? Interesting.

706
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,880
(That's insane!)

707
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,650
(Trix loves it.)

708
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,690
Gosh, that's some quality dance.

709
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,539
(Covering their mouths in surprise)

710
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,139
They changed it completely.

711
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,549
- It's better without the umbrellas. - Yes.

712
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,500
(Screaming)

713
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,098
(Impressed)

714
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,429
(Impressed)

715
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,470
A split jump.

716
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,749
(Screaming)

717
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,880
They're painting themselves red?

718
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:37,089
Four, three, two, one.

719
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,829
Switch. Wolf'Lo.

720
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,099
As for the prop, we're once again challenging ourselves.

721
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,099
What's that?

722
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,140
- Are those fans? - Feather fans!

723
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,868
We want to show people that we're capable of many things...

724
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,309
and that you can look forward to our performance.

725
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,009
What's that?

726
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,078
The music started when I was putting the glove on my left hand.

727
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,348
I thought, "This is terrible."

728
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:02,819
(The opposing crew song part, BEBE's "CHESMITRY")

729
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:06,220
Where did they get those fans?

730
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,559
They put feathers on their gloves.

731
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,400
I could see that they worked really hard for this.

732
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:21,569
(Impressed)

733
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,920
The sexy dance they learned from 1MILLION.

734
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,329
It looks like the "Adult Ceremony" dance.

735
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,779
(Thrilled)

736
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,220
Wolf'Lo's dance looks so pretty today.

737
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,099
Four, three, two, one.

738
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:31,010
Battle set.

739
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,078
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

740
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,578
(They killed it.)

741
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,509
- I couldn't decide. - That was insane.

742
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,980
This is so much fun.

743
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,178
The Battle Performance Mission,

744
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,018
BEBE versus Wolf'Lo.

745
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:48,419
The 60-second countdown for the vote will begin now.

746
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,428
Press A for BEBE who went first,

747
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,029
and press B for Wolf'Lo who went second.

748
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,799
Please vote for the crew...

749
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,968
whose dance you thought...

750
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,699
was better and more powerful.

751
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,409
The voting has ended.

752
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:07,908
First, let's find out...

753
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,650
the winner decided by the fight judges.

754
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,879
- Which crew would you pick? - Wolf'Lo.

755
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,549
- I'd pick Wolf'Lo too. - They prepared a great performance.

756
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,919
The way I see it, the tables have been turned.

757
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,118
Yes, BEBE did well.

758
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,618
They had a strong will to win,

759
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,558
and I could clearly see that.

760
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,190
They both did great.

761
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,928
It was a really good battle.

762
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,429
I don't know.

763
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,469
Fight judges, open your cards.

764
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:32,669
This is a dance battle,

765
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,908
and in that sense, I think we outplayed them.

766
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,468
Our performance had...

767
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,739
a clear progression which I think gave us the upper hand.

768
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,448
(Which crew will the fight judges pick?)

769
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:46,949
Three, two, one.

770
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,320
(They unanimously chose BEBE.)

771
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,089
(We did it.)

772
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,260
(Overwhelmed)

773
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,198
With a score of 3 to 0,

774
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,359
BEBE wins the battle.

775
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,670
(The fight judges chose BEBE as the winner.)

776
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,999
They did it.

777
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,269
I also thought they did better.

778
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,939
For the first part of the battle, I liked BEBE's performance better.

779
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,038
The way they used an object...

780
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,479
was much more impressive.

781
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,678
Their dance was more organized, so I gave them a higher score.

782
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,579
For the second part,

783
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,480
I thought Halo did better.

784
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,919
Her dance was more diversified,

785
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,589
and even in that heated moment,

786
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,690
she tried to show different kinds of moves.

787
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,689
For the third part,

788
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,058
BEBE did such a great job...

789
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:35,768
in terms of battle components and the performance itself.

790
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:38,868
Wolf'Lo's performance didn't involve much dancing,

791
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,139
which I thought was disappointing.

792
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,739
I think Wolf'Lo has got such a cool groove.

793
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,839
If they had interpreted the song with their groove,

794
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,979
it would've been better.

795
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,518
That's why I chose BEBE as the winner.

796
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,750
Thank you.

797
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:00,320
BEBE is in the lead with the fight judges' votes.

798
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,329
Let's find out the results of the live audience voting now.

799
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,099
Oh, my goodness.

800
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,629
- That's... - They're telling us right away?

801
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,868
They're revealing the number of votes.

802
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,569
I want to see if the audience's choice...

803
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,440
is the same as the fight judges'.

804
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,480
I can't wait.

805
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,379
Please.

806
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,650
If I collapse in shock, help me.

807
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,678
(BEBE versus Wolf'Lo, which crew did the audience choose?)

808
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,719
(We only counted the ballots voted within the 60 seconds.)

809
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,590
- Really? - Really?

810
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,859
(BEBE is chosen as the winner by the audience.)

811
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,388
With a score of 483 to 340,

812
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:37,529
BEBE wins the live audience voting...

813
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,599
and takes 70 points.

814
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:42,158
BEBE won!

815
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,369
- So they won 100 points? - They already got 100 points.

816
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,399
Putting together the results...

817
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,010
of the fight judges' and the live audience's votes,

818
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,909
BEBE wins the battle with a final score of 100 to 0.

819
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:58,649
We got really bad results in the interim check,

820
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,719
but while keeping our style, we also accepted the feedback.

821
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,420
I think I got the knack of it now.

822
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,150
I'm so proud of the girls.

823
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,988
We'll repay your support with a better performance.

824
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:09,989
Thank you for supporting BEBE.

825
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,090
(Bada, you can have me.)

826
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,098
We were shut out 3 to 0.

827
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,928
Still, I'm grateful that...

828
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:20,999
quite a lot of people thought...

829
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,010
we did better.

830
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,539
We got a lot of votes too.

831
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,010
I want to thank those 340 people.

832
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,579
- We got 340 votes! - Yes!

833
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,480
To us, that was the most meaningful score.

834
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,348
Here are the next crews...

835
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,050
for the Battle Performance Mission.

836
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,288
LADYBOUNCE versus...

837
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,459
(No way!)

838
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,860
JAM REPUBLIC.

839
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,730
(This is incredible.)

840
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,828
LADYBOUNCE AND JAM REPUBLIC,

841
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,300
please come up on stage.

842
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,069
(Both crews enter the stage.)

843
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,969
(LADYBOUNCE enters.)

844
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,940
(It's great to see you.)

845
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,479
(LADYBOUNCE may be a little too happy to see the audience.)

846
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,509
(They've loaded their love pistols.)

847
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,578
- What? They look so cute. - They're ballerinas!

848
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,420
- They're wearing tutus. - How cute.

849
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,349
(The audience heartily welcomes the two crews.)

850
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,888
(They've entered the stage with a hearty welcome.)

851
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,360
(Cheering)

852
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,230
(Scuttling)

853
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,029
Go, JAM REPUBLIC!

854
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,429
(JAM REPUBLIC's fans enthusiastically cheer for them.)

855
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,968
They're cheering loudly.

856
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,369
JAM REPUBLIC is so popular.

857
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,800
JAM REPUBLIC is so hard to beat.

858
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,440
Oh, boy.

859
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,078
(When the Battle Performance Mission was introduced)

860
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,678
I knew they'd pick us.

861
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,779
There's also the global voting.

862
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,178
It's about the number of views on our video.

863
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:40,348
That must be why they picked us.

864
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,488
I think so too. We're not as well-known as them.

865
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,619
They're strategic.

866
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,819
Picking a very popular crew...

867
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,260
- is stupid. - Yes.

868
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:50,489
(They chose LADYBOUNCE who's relatively less popular.)

869
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,500
How can we possibly beat JAM REPUBLIC in public voting?

870
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,459
How hard do we have to work...

871
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,070
to beat them in public voting?

872
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,538
This is going to be the most difficult mission.

873
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:00,900
(Will they be able to get through it?)

874
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,069
(Meanwhile, JAM REPUBLIC is celebrating winning 1st place.)

875
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,139
(We're number 1.)

876
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,439
Okay, we're ready to explode.

877
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,948
- Yes. - We like moving fast-paced.

878
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,549
- Next, C. - C.

879
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,618
It's the most important.

880
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,518
No one can really do what we can do.

881
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,948
There's a cool movement of the hips.

882
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:23,829
We kind of want to give the audience a live version...

883
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,629
and make them scream.

884
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,900
Hips don't lie.

885
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,300
We have an additional announce to make.

886
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,739
(Even when they heard Part C being the opposing crew's song)

887
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,769
- Yes! - Yes?

888
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,369
We could get tutus.

889
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,609
- Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my gosh.

890
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,078
We could just get tutus.

891
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,879
If we get tutus in a backpack?

892
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,709
Oh, my gosh. And change it up?

893
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,218
That would be so cool.

894
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,919
- And then we go... - Yes!

895
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,078
(Copying LADYBOUNCE's signature move)

896
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,749
We should do some of their choreography.

897
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,089
I think this is going to work to our advantage.

898
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,488
Now we're going to slay mama.

899
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:56,859
Slay mama.

900
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,828
Easy. We can sleep in peace tonight.

901
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:01,859
(JAM REPUBLIC leaves with light hearts.)

902
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,570
This is actually going to be a really fun mission.

903
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,268
(Meanwhile, LADYBOUNCE is...)

904
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:07,768
This could work out well for them.

905
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,069
They'll probably come up with another exotic dance.

906
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,280
I'm sure they'll do well as they always have.

907
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,809
We can do well too.

908
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:17,779
That's why we have to really pour all our energy into it.

909
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,879
We need to slay them with our energy.

910
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,050
Let's slay them with our energy.

911
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,178
(LADYBOUNCE is gathered to practice.)

912
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,348
I'm sure JAM REPUBLIC's dance is going to be simple.

913
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,589
- Their dance is so simple but good. - Exactly.

914
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,260
They're sleeping right now.

915
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,529
But that could be their strategy.

916
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,988
- To stay in top shape. - Of course.

917
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,359
We may not get much sleep, but we've got to do some groundwork.

918
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,399
We can sort out the details tomorrow.

919
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,569
Yes, let's build the frames.

920
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,499
I'm wide awake now. They'd better watch out.

921
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,569
Me too.

922
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,570
One and...

923
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:42,569
They catch people's eyes with their showy moves,

924
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,909
and we thought we could do that with other components.

925
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:49,249
We wanted to do what JAM REPUBLIC couldn't,

926
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,650
so we used some props...

927
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,678
and filled our performance with fun tricks.

928
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,719
What's wrong?

929
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:59,859
- What time is it? - It's 6am.

930
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,888
We should go get washed up and finish the rest.

931
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,190
We have to give it our all.

932
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
(Yawning)

933
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,158
- Do it like this. - It's too fast.

934
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,299
(LADYBOUNCE got here the earliest.)

935
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,299
- We can do this. - We can do it.

936
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,368
Let's keep going.

937
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:15,069
(They keep practicing in the empty studio.)

938
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,169
Hi, guys.

939
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,170
- Hello. - Hello.

940
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,839
(The other crews start to arrive.)

941
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
(All the crews are here now, including JAM REPUBLIC.)

942
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,948
Hi, guys. Welcome to our channel.

943
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,908
Please like and subscribe.

944
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,249
Hello, I'm Kirsten.

945
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,288
(They came late but seem relaxed.)

946
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:31,448
They came so late. They must be confident.

947
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,388
How are they so confident?

948
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,460
They know they're good.

949
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,959
(JAM REPUBLIC has started practicing.)

950
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,968
This is too easy, too nice, and too fun.

951
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,030
- Yes, why? - What's going on?

952
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,000
Is there a hidden mission that's about to happen?

953
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,669
Welcome to JAM REPUBLIC's vlog.

954
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,808
(They certainly seem relaxed.)

955
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,069
It really bugged me...

956
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,578
because they came so late,

957
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,250
but it felt like they were going to do well anyway.

958
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,610
(Sulky)

959
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:00,250
(LADYBOUNCE and JAM REPUBLIC's interim check begins.)

960
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,789
- That's LADYBOUNCE. - That's so like LADYBOUNCE.

961
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:04,250
Their facial expressions are insane.

962
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:10,289
They work so hard.

963
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,630
I just got chills.

964
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,299
(They also watch JAM REPUBLIC's work so far.)

965
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,329
- Gosh. - That's crazy.

966
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,069
(LADYBOUNCE watches JAM REPUBLIC's work so far.)

967
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,510
- It's simple. - It's really simple.

968
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,079
Maybe it's too simple.

969
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:28,980
Really? This is their choreography?

970
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,750
They must've taken good rest yesterday.

971
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:32,209
There wasn't much to see.

972
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,879
The whole thing was very loose.

973
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,749
It was too simple. I wondered, "What's going on?"

974
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,618
"Don't they want to win the benefit?"

975
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,190
I think we're going to win the benefit!

976
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:41,718
I hope so.

977
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,859
Please!

978
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,860
(Desperate)

979
00:43:43,861 --> 00:43:45,189
Here's the result.

980
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,860
I'm just going to see it now, okay?

981
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,868
(How did the other crews evaluate LADYBOUNCE's dance?)

982
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:51,029
(Nervous)

983
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,030
I'll just read it.

984
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:53,139
(Nervous)

985
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:55,699
The crew that 1MILLION thinks will lose is...

986
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,839
Is it us?

987
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,408
- LADYBOUNCE. - That's okay.

988
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:00,979
They think we should improve our transitions and use more space.

989
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,209
(Poor transitions and use of space)

990
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,449
Did we change our formations too much?

991
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,419
Did we go overboard? I guess they got us.

992
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Okay, next.

993
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
Okay.

994
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,218
We're the crew that MANNEQUEEN also thinks will lose.

995
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,420
- Really? - Really?

996
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,889
Okay.

997
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,429
We're the crew that BEBE also thinks will lose.

998
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,230
I don't get it.

999
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,098
We're the crew that Wolf'Lo also thinks will lose.

1000
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,400
- Seriously? That's a lot of them. - So all of them?

1001
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,439
- All of them picked us? - Yes.

1002
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,609
Gosh, this is...

1003
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,440
(All the other crews thought they'd lose.)

1004
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,050
This is so shocking.

1005
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:37,609
(NOB doesn't know what to say.)

1006
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,419
I can't believe this.

1007
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,780
I'm confused.

1008
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,550
It's really simple, but they're perfectly in sync.

1009
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,989
It's very clean.

1010
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,320
They use a lot of space with the formations.

1011
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,760
Capoeira?

1012
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:54,229
What the heck?

1013
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,500
She's a monster.

1014
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,169
The moves are so simple,

1015
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,569
but they still managed to create a wow factor out of that.

1016
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,539
It's like watching "Step Up," isn't it?

1017
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,339
- In 2, 3. JAM REPUBLIC. - JAM REPUBLIC.

1018
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,468
(Everyone thinks JAM REPUBLIC was better.)

1019
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:07,038
They wanted to do so well that they put too much in it.

1020
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,138
Exactly. It's like their dance is covering up the music.

1021
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,249
And it's like they forced those ideas into it.

1022
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,780
It looks very contrived.

1023
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:16,348
When we dance, we dance so hard, right?

1024
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:19,189
We're tired, out of breath, and so on.

1025
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,319
But JAM REPUBLIC is like...

1026
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,388
(Dancing effortlessly)

1027
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,558
- But they're still impactful. - They're like geniuses.

1028
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,529
It's even a little annoying,

1029
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,158
but I'd have to admit.

1030
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,369
They play it so cleverly.

1031
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:35,169
(No one thinks JAM REPUBLIC will lose.)

1032
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,809
It's so sweet of them!

1033
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:38,509
(They're thrilled.)

1034
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,480
- Thank you! - I love you!

1035
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,110
W's all around.

1036
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,178
No L's! We don't take L's.

1037
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,149
- Well done, girls. - Perfect choreography.

1038
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,179
This is so good.

1039
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:52,889
- We'd like to go second. - Second.

1040
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,589
End it with a bang.

1041
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,618
Boom.

1042
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,689
- Three, two one. - Three, two one.

1043
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,789
(We're going to blow your mind.)

1044
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,129
(The surprising result left LADYBOUNCE speechless.)

1045
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,469
We don't deserve to be so underrated.

1046
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:05,429
- This hurts my pride. - Seriously.

1047
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:09,169
Don't cry.

1048
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,840
I mean, JAM REPUBLIC got here at 5pm.

1049
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,638
- It's infuriating. - I know. It's infuriating.

1050
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,649
- We basically stayed up all night. - But...

1051
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,678
(Biggy couldn't hold back her tears.)

1052
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:20,518
- You can cry until today. - Yes.

1053
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,118
- Yes, you can cry. - You can be upset about this.

1054
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,118
How can you not be? We lost 4 to 0.

1055
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,189
That's right.

1056
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,960
I worked really hard.

1057
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:31,789
I know that...

1058
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,329
you can't make your dance perfect through one day's hard work,

1059
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,900
but the thing about our crew is that we're hard workers.

1060
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,198
It felt like there's a hurdle...

1061
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,309
we still couldn't jump despite all our hard work,

1062
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,710
and I felt...

1063
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,010
upset about that.

1064
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:55,380
They're so hard to beat, and I couldn't help worrying.

1065
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,189
(In the K-pop Death match Mission, )

1066
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,988
(JAM REPUBLIC crushed them with a score of 3 to 0.)

1067
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:02,859
(Also in the Mega Crew Mission, )

1068
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,158
(JAM REPUBLIC won the 100 bonus points.)

1069
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,959
(JAM REPUBLIC has defeated them in all missions.)

1070
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,158
I wanted to win.

1071
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,768
We wanted to win so badly that we overdid it.

1072
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:13,439
That's why we got this kind of result.

1073
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,670
We have no choice but to accept it and deal with it.

1074
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,839
What's important to us is the live performance.

1075
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,439
We thought...

1076
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,840
we should make it a lot different from what we showed them.

1077
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,218
I know it's important to dance in sync,

1078
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,780
but I think we should be bolder.

1079
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,749
Vessi, you've got nice, sexy moves.

1080
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,719
How about we find a good part to show them off?

1081
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,029
We could continue like this.

1082
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,698
(Biggy keeps suggesting new ideas, but they're unresponsive.)

1083
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:42,760
What do you guys think?

1084
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,268
We needed to change the choreography fast,

1085
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,038
but all the other crews thought we'd lose,

1086
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,769
and it really threw me off my game.

1087
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,238
(LADYBOUNCE was always in high spirits, )

1088
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:56,139
(and their dance studio was always full of laughter.)

1089
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:58,649
(But now, it's filled by silence.)

1090
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,749
I think it was the first time that all of us...

1091
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,619
broke down at the same time.

1092
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,319
Here's the thing.

1093
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,948
I came up with a bunch of ideas,

1094
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,689
but no one is trying...

1095
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,759
to build up on them with something fun.

1096
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,658
You all have a lot on your minds.

1097
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,828
I'm just saying that's the state we're in right now.

1098
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,658
We should refresh ourselves and start over.

1099
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,929
It's not going anywhere right now.

1100
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,038
This is supposed to be a dance battle,

1101
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:23,268
but none of our moves were targeted at the opposing team.

1102
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:26,209
For their dance to our crew song,

1103
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,480
- they copied this move of ours. - That's right.

1104
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,649
(JAM REPUBLIC copied one of LADYBOUNCE's moves.)

1105
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,319
- We should watch their video too. - Yes.

1106
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,448
- It might be fun to copy this move. - Yes, this one.

1107
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,789
We might actually do it better.

1108
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:38,949
More energetically.

1109
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:40,559
Right.

1110
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,518
- Let's do that. - We must do that.

1111
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,460
Who's going to do the acting?

1112
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,759
"Thank you. Oh, thank you."

1113
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,098
I should copy her smiley eyes.

1114
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:50,869
"Thank you."

1115
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,538
But when I think about JAM REPUBLIC,

1116
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:56,098
what comes to my mind is when Audrey...

1117
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,109
The dance-off?

1118
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,210
- She challenged Vessi. - That's right.

1119
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:06,349
(Audrey did some showy moves in her dance-off against Vessi.)

1120
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,019
I want to do that.

1121
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:11,689
In front of Audrey.

1122
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,750
(Grinning)

1123
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,590
You're even bendier.

1124
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,689
Once we decided to make it fun instead,

1125
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,928
ideas started to flow.

1126
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:23,099
Let's just keep going like this. If we do, the interim check result?

1127
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,130
We can totally turn it upside down.

1128
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,169
- Up! - Five, six, seven.

1129
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,638
We changed Part C to something that people would find...

1130
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,609
more fun and enjoyable.

1131
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,610
We changed it completely.

1132
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,678
Since the interim check, we've grown 200 percent.

1133
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:38,780
I feel confident.

1134
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,550
(The day of the Battle Performance Mission)

1135
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,479
- Let's go. - All right.

1136
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,590
Should we take a photo?

1137
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:46,149
(Time to take some selfies)

1138
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,689
(They begin rehearsing.)

1139
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,288
(Why are there only two of them onstage?)

1140
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:50,888
(The rest are cheering for them offstage.)

1141
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:52,429
Let's go!

1142
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,828
Part A is going to be a freestyle dance.

1143
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:59,029
You can decide on your own music and number of dancers...

1144
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,639
for the battle performance.

1145
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,768
Do you know what we should do?

1146
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:04,940
A duo.

1147
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:07,209
That we were wanting to do for battles.

1148
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,408
Kirsten and I originally made that choreography...

1149
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:12,078
to do a duo battle.

1150
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,348
We had it prepared in case we had to battle.

1151
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:17,988
I think a lot of the other teams would've done a group battle.

1152
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:20,259
We just had this idea to maybe...

1153
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,388
just evolve it even more.

1154
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:25,788
How cool would it be to show again different...

1155
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,530
parts of JAM REPUBLIC?

1156
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,968
Yes, they will probably be most afraid...

1157
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:31,968
- of Kirsten battling. - Yes.

1158
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:35,599
- NOB and the other person lost. - They lost against those two.

1159
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,839
(In the No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer, )

1160
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,149
(Kirsten and LaTrice defeated LADYBOUNCE.)

1161
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,649
If they were going to come at our crew,

1162
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,519
we would hurl it down with just us two.

1163
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,979
So, we can get our hot outfits...

1164
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,289
and show them some sexiness.

1165
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,489
With the...

1166
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,018
- As a prop? - Yes.

1167
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,459
Yes.

1168
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,559
(She can't help but clap at her idea.)

1169
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,929
This will be so unexpected.

1170
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,759
All we want to do is, again,

1171
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,070
the audience is there, and we want to entertain them.

1172
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,669
We want to give them a show.

1173
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,440
So, we have something a little special.

1174
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:19,650
(What's JAM REPUBLIC's prop that surprised everyone?)

1175
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,578
(They have a meeting about the improv part.)

1176
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,118
Who battled from LADYBOUNCE for No Respect?

1177
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,218
Vessi.

1178
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:27,158
Oh, yes. You took two out.

1179
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:28,320
(Audrey beat two of them.)

1180
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,328
(At the No Respect, Battle with the Weakest Dancer)

1181
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:35,999
(She surprised everyone with her battle dance skills.)

1182
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
(Audrey defeated them twice by herself.)

1183
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,469
That's right, Audrey.

1184
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,409
Maybe we can send you back in the 1-on-1 battle.

1185
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:47,780
Who can do Audrey other than Audrey?

1186
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,980
She will bring us the win.

1187
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,479
I don't think I'm really worried about any of the parts.

1188
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,519
They'd all just make me really excited.

1189
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,718
(The free part with the duet of Kirsten and LaTrice, )

1190
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,089
(the improv part by Audrey, the strong battle dancer, )

1191
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,919
(and the opposing crew song part approved by everyone)

1192
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,388
(Zero crews think you will be eliminated.)

1193
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:07,859
I don't know if this is too confident of me to say,

1194
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,230
but I think we are going to win all three sections.

1195
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,699
We're making it to the Finals!

1196
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:19,039
We're already at the Finals.

1197
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,039
I wonder what the final stage is like.

1198
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,308
- Like a full-on crowd. - Yes.

1199
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:26,209
- Like the hall. - Yes.

1200
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,619
Not like this one.

1201
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:30,049
JAM REPUBLIC is going to do what we do.

1202
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,320
Of course, we can beat LADYBOUNCE.

1203
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,190
And I know, for certain, that we will not be going home.

1204
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,759
This is the first time...

1205
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,759
that we're competing as a group with LADYBOUNCE.

1206
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,769
So, I think we're just excited to have some fun and,

1207
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,039
again, just celebrate dance in this arena.

1208
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:50,038
(You're so cool, JAM REPUBLIC!)

1209
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:51,609
LADYBOUNCE is...

1210
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,679
very confident in this mission.

1211
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,009
(Yes? NOB!)

1212
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,779
But JAM REPUBLIC must be good and confident as well.

1213
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,420
So, I'd like to give you a show.

1214
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,819
We know that we can tear it up this time!

1215
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,348
(We know we can tear it up!)

1216
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,219
(Go, LADYBOUNCE!)

1217
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,699
(The dancers warm up before the dance-off.)

1218
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,800
JAM REPUBLIC is going barefoot.

1219
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:18,199
(LaTrice gets ready in barefoot.)

1220
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,400
She's barefoot.

1221
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,598
Seriously?

1222
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,300
I wonder what they'll do.

1223
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,670
- They're wearing something under. - Right.

1224
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,710
They're going all out.

1225
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,010
I can't wait.

1226
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:29,879
LADYBOUNCE versus JAM REPUBLIC.

1227
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,779
JAM REPUBLIC versus LADYBOUNCE.

1228
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,178
The battle between these two crews will begin now.

1229
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:35,219
Are you guys ready?

1230
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,149
Fight.

1231
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,618
(The Battle Performance Mission of LADYBOUNCE and JAM REPUBLIC)

1232
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:39,820
Don't underestimate us.

1233
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,260
We pull it off when we need to.

1234
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,019
Yes, we'll wait and see.

1235
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:45,130
(LADYBOUNCE goes first with the free part.)

1236
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,529
It's like JAM REPUBLIC's Mega Crew Mission.

1237
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,738
"Thank you!"

1238
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:55,469
- "Thank you!" - "Thank you!"

1239
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,538
(LADYBOUNCE used...)

1240
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:01,880
(Kirsten's part from the Mega Crew Mission.)

1241
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,349
(Oh, my gosh.)

1242
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,368
(Squealing)

1243
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,869
(Cheering)

1244
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,909
(BEBE is surprised.)

1245
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,510
(NOB looks amazing!)

1246
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,289
They're targeting Audrey.

1247
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:52,760
They're seriously trying to provoke them.

1248
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,859
(LADYBOUNCE copies Audrey's dance from No Respect.)

1249
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,300
I was surprised.

1250
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:09,110
That's so clean. Amazing.

1251
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,210
- Is that Capri on top? - Yes.

1252
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,510
It must be tough for Naro.

1253
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,329
Check out how in sync they are.

1254
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,429
They seriously went all out.

1255
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:53,349
Three, two, one.

1256
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:55,619
Switch! JAM REPUBLIC.

1257
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:04,428
(The crowd is flustered to see only two of them.)

1258
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,130
(Surprised)

1259
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,670
What is happening?

1260
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:08,869
Here comes a big one.

1261
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,138
Only two of them?

1262
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:11,269
That's how they'll do it?

1263
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,539
It's game time. It's attack time.

1264
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,920
(Make some noise!)

1265
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,070
(Covering her mouth)

1266
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,809
(Covering his mouth)

1267
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,709
(Surprised)

1268
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,078
(Focused)

1269
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,239
I want to see it in person!

1270
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,079
I could sense their confidence.

1271
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,059
So sexy.

1272
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:07,329
(Drawn in)

1273
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,380
We have something a little special.

1274
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:29,320
(What's JAM REPUBLIC's secret weapon?)

1275
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,530
(Shocked)

1276
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,959
They're pouring water!

1277
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,860
They turned it into the Waterbomb Festival.

1278
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:44,670
Seriously? It's actual water?

1279
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:52,308
(Cheering)

1280
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:54,440
I realized that they were serious about it.

1281
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,219
(Amazed)

1282
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,750
I got chills.

1283
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,589
How do you do that?

1284
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,959
Just the two of them...

1285
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,090
They're killing it.

1286
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,969
Three, two...

1287
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,269
(LADYBOUNCE teases them back.)

1288
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,469
One!

1289
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:26,469
I knew that we won.

1290
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:28,710
I am confident that we will win.

1291
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,349
Switch! LADYBOUNCE.

1292
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,550
(Biggy of LADYBOUNCE goes first.)

1293
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,820
I meant to be as calm as possible.

1294
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:46,760
(Exclaiming)

1295
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,260
(Grinning)

1296
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,529
That's insane.

1297
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,030
Let's go, Biggy!

1298
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,280
(I love it!)

1299
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,449
She's good.

1300
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:21,058
Five, four,

1301
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:23,699
three, two, one.

1302
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,598
The crowd went crazy,

1303
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:28,469
and I thought I stood a chance.

1304
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:31,070
Switch! JAM REPUBLIC.

1305
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,110
We are going to put out our secret weapon.

1306
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:39,110
(Her eyes change.)

1307
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:40,380
She's here.

1308
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,619
Oh, my gosh.

1309
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,718
- She's so scary! - So scary!

1310
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:45,849
She put on that look again.

1311
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,019
Battle mode.

1312
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,099
(Screaming)

1313
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:08,210
(That's Audrey to you.)

1314
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:21,489
(That is insane.)

1315
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,429
Oh, shoot.

1316
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,900
(Amazed)

1317
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:37,038
(Getting goosebumps)

1318
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:38,510
She's so well-balanced.

1319
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,170
Do whatever you want, Audrey.

1320
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,589
(The audience is shocked to see it in real life.)

1321
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,960
(The judge is also shocked.)

1322
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,929
She has such various routines.

1323
01:00:58,389 --> 01:00:59,429
(Amazed)

1324
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:01,130
(Surprised)

1325
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,928
It certainly catches my attention.

1326
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:03,969
That's crazy.

1327
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,809
Three, two, one.

1328
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,718
I'm pretty confident I can win.

1329
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,250
Switch! LADYBOUNCE.

1330
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:27,219
We're so confident in the opposing crew song part.

1331
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,659
(LADYBOUNCE is preparing something.)

1332
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:31,360
- What is it? - What is it?

1333
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,960
(The opposing crew song part, "CRAZY OUT THERE")

1334
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:40,539
(LADYBOUNCE put jam on a piece of bread.)

1335
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:41,638
Jam!

1336
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,099
(Bursting into laughter)

1337
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,169
(1MILLION loves it.)

1338
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,468
I love it!

1339
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,139
- That's funny. - I love it.

1340
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,880
How quick-witted.

1341
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:53,010
(We put jam on our bread.)

1342
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:56,649
Oh, "jam."

1343
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,750
(I approve.)

1344
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:10,429
They're eating it!

1345
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,000
They're eating it!

1346
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,099
They ate jam.

1347
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,679
(Acknowledging their wits)

1348
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,750
- That's their choreography. - It is.

1349
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:37,789
(LADYBOUNCE pays homage to JAM REPUBLIC's crew song.)

1350
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,469
(Not yes, but NOB)

1351
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,698
(Let's go, LADYBOUNCE!)

1352
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:16,730
I love how detail-oriented it is.

1353
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,099
They're desperate to win.

1354
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,510
(The crowd goes wild.)

1355
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,380
It's so entertaining!

1356
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,050
I want to be there.

1357
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:58,308
Five, four, three, two, one.

1358
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:00,839
(Cheering)

1359
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,239
They responded so loudly that it gave me chills.

1360
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,880
That's when I thought that we might win.

1361
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:08,250
Switch! JAM REPUBLIC!

1362
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,349
It's game time.

1363
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:14,820
(Opposing crew song part, "Baby Back Home")

1364
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,090
- They imitated it. - They did.

1365
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,800
(JAM REPUBLIC pays homage to LADYBOUNCE's signature moves.)

1366
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,239
(Chills)

1367
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:42,448
Oh, my goodness.

1368
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:43,750
They're wild.

1369
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:05,569
It's so clean that it's flawless.

1370
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:07,279
The fact that all members can do that...

1371
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,639
I know, right?

1372
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,429
(Make some noise!)

1373
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,809
One! Battle set!

1374
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,550
LADYBOUNCE.

1375
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:47,880
Or for "loser?"

1376
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:50,279
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1377
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,489
One! Battle set!

1378
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,658
(Both crews were amazing.)

1379
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,789
Yes.

1380
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,159
We tried our best.

1381
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,329
I'm just hoping we win.

1382
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,059
We honestly did our best.

1383
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,899
It was so fun.

1384
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,269
They both did great.

1385
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,570
I actually...

1386
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,769
This is so entertaining.

1387
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:13,069
That's the end of the Battle Performance Mission...

1388
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,940
between LADYBOUNCE and JAM REPUBLIC.

1389
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:19,109
From now on, we will give you 60 seconds to vote.

1390
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,779
Comparing the two crews, vote for the crew...

1391
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,118
that you think made a bigger impact...

1392
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:26,619
and gave a better show.

1393
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,259
I can say for sure...

1394
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,229
that the crowd cheered so loudly for us.

1395
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,190
We had a winning chance.

1396
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,499
It was creative, though. It was smart.

1397
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,368
The energy was a little bit intimidating, but not too much.

1398
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,500
We're here to win.

1399
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,539
The voting will end.

1400
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:44,638
The Battle Performance Mission, LADYBOUNCE versus JAM REPUBLIC.

1401
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,479
Let's check out the winner...

1402
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,339
- chosen by the fight judges. - I'm nervous.

1403
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,710
This is too hard.

1404
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,408
I think LADYBOUNCE absolutely killed it.

1405
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,149
I could tell that they were desperate.

1406
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,419
And when they used strawberry jam to describe them...

1407
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,150
How did they come up with that?

1408
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,218
I think JAM REPUBLIC's show was better in quality and balance.

1409
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,059
Audrey did way too well.

1410
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,329
- This is a tough one. - It is.

1411
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,598
Fight judges, open your cards.

1412
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:09,999
I'm so nervous.

1413
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,469
We have to win. I hope we win.

1414
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,868
I feel pretty confident that they're going to choose us.

1415
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:18,038
Fight judges, open your cards.

1416
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:20,670
Three, two, one.

1417
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:26,280
(The score is 2 to 1 for JAM REPUBLIC and LADYBOUNCE.)

1418
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:27,949
Oh, my gosh!

1419
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,518
(Sad)

1420
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:34,988
With a score of 2 to 1, JAM REPUBLIC...

1421
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:36,589
- Thank you so much. - has won.

1422
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,859
Thank you so much.

1423
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,788
I can't help feeling sad, though.

1424
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,629
Because we needed to get a head start...

1425
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,030
by beating them by 3 to 0...

1426
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,729
to have a fighting chance even when we scored...

1427
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,340
lower from the audience.

1428
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:51,209
I believe that LADYBOUNCE showed us the textbook routine...

1429
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,609
of a group battle dance at first.

1430
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:56,738
They had great teamwork as they were an old group.

1431
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,178
It was a round where you showed us...

1432
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:01,550
the essence of LADYBOUNCE.

1433
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:03,379
In the 1-on-1 battle,

1434
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,989
Audrey just did herself.

1435
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:09,260
She did what we all expect from her.

1436
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:11,288
I've only seen it in videos,

1437
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:13,529
but you literally tore it up.

1438
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,159
So, I had to give you some points for that.

1439
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,828
I was in a dilemma with the last round.

1440
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,969
Both crews had completely different appeals.

1441
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,209
LADYBOUNCE had diversity.

1442
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,409
There were many spectacles. I loved it.

1443
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,238
But most of JAM REPUBLIC's parts...

1444
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,710
consisted of dance.

1445
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:36,118
LADYBOUNCE gave up on some parts of the dance...

1446
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:37,818
and utilized the props, right?

1447
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:41,019
But I think that dance is more important...

1448
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,919
than other entertaining aspects.

1449
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,188
I liked JAM REPUBLIC's more in that sense,

1450
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:49,000
so chose them.

1451
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:55,038
JAM REPUBLIC won the fight judges' vote.

1452
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,470
Here is the vote count from the audience.

1453
01:08:58,869 --> 01:08:59,869
Oh, my gosh.

1454
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,010
Let there be a miracle Please let us win.

1455
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:04,039
(Please)

1456
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,709
I'm hoping for a good score...

1457
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,750
because we're kind of relying on it now.

1458
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,750
- Let's see. - Who won?

1459
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,049
I'm curious about the difference.

1460
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,419
(Tense)

1461
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,060
(We only counted the ballots voted within the 60 seconds.)

1462
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,269
By 460 to 364...

1463
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,828
(The audience chose LADYBOUNCE.)

1464
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,470
By 460 to 364...

1465
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:32,670
(Automatically standing up)

1466
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,339
(Clapping)

1467
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,009
(A jaw-dropping result)

1468
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,479
LADYBOUNCE won.

1469
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:40,349
(Yeni and Haechi are frozen.)

1470
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,948
By 460 to 364,

1471
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:45,188
the 70 points from the audience...

1472
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:47,520
go to LADYBOUNCE.

1473
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:50,489
- Thank you. - Well done.

1474
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,158
Thank you.

1475
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,299
A crew finally beat JAM REPUBLIC.

1476
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,728
That's incredible.

1477
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:57,529
- I just got goosebumps. - So did I.

1478
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:59,929
The final score, including the scores...

1479
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,799
from the fight judges and the audience...

1480
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,769
is 80 to 20.

1481
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,970
LADYBOUNCE wins.

1482
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:09,109
(Touched)

1483
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,739
(Congrats, LADYBOUNCE.)

1484
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:12,479
It's unbelievable.

1485
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,680
(NOB gets choked up by the unexpected result.)

1486
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,920
Don't cry!

1487
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,720
- You're making me want to cry. - Don't cry.

1488
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,390
Why is she crying? Don't cry.

1489
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,089
First...

1490
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,130
(Holding her tears)

1491
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,659
JAM REPUBLIC is an amazingly good crew, and...

1492
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,199
(NOB is too choked up to speak.)

1493
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:34,568
- She's so cute. - So cute.

1494
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:37,238
She's so happy to beat a good crew.

1495
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,869
Don't cry!

1496
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,438
That's a horrifying crew to compete against.

1497
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:42,439
Right.

1498
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,309
So when we were preparing for this battle,

1499
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:46,879
we gave our all to each move and each segment.

1500
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,078
It really was a big challenge for us.

1501
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,849
But we were rewarded with such good results.

1502
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,688
I'm just very grateful.

1503
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:55,689
It was a good battle.

1504
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,729
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1505
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:01,499
To be honest, I think we could all felt...

1506
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,898
their energy on the stage watching you guys.

1507
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:05,999
This is the first time we battled together.

1508
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,198
So it was a great battle.

1509
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:08,899
Thank you!

1510
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,669
The Battle Performance Mission...

1511
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,868
between JAM REPUBLIC and LADYBOUNCE...

1512
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:15,578
ended with LADYBOUNCE taking the win.

1513
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,809
Both of the crews can now get off the stage.

1514
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,810
Good job, everyone.

1515
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:20,749
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1516
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:23,379
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1517
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,618
LADYBOUNCE got everything...

1518
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,249
- they could possibly need. - I agree.

1519
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,350
They must have no regrets today.

1520
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:30,560
Thank you!

1521
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,788
- Thank you. - Wait up.

1522
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,060
Let's go together.

1523
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:36,529
- In 1, 2, 3. I love you. - In 2, 3. I love you.

1524
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:37,699
- We did it. - We're all the same.

1525
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,399
I wasn't going to cry.

1526
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,339
I can't believe this.

1527
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,269
If we lost, we wouldn't have cried.

1528
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,639
How could I not cry when we won?

1529
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,368
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1530
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:49,078
- I really like you. - Don't cry.

1531
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:50,309
- We felt the energy. - Yes.

1532
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,648
- It was nice. - Honestly, it was really nice...

1533
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:52,978
- to battle and just dance. - Yes. It was good.

1534
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:54,578
- It was creative. So great. - I had fun.

1535
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,880
- You guys deserved it. Seriously. - Bye.

1536
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,549
Nothing is impossible when you're desperate.

1537
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:00,919
We worked so hard.

1538
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,519
I wanted to give our crew a round of applause.

1539
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,059
(Good job, my crew.)

1540
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,028
Here are the crews who will be battling next.

1541
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:07,090
1MILLION versus...

1542
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,529
(I love you, 1MILLION!)

1543
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:11,969
MANNEQUEEN.

1544
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,228
(Good luck, MANNEQUEEN!)

1545
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,270
1MILLION. MANNEQUEEN. Come up to the stage now.

1546
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:24,379
(The audience is cheering intensely to welcome the two crews.)

1547
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:28,279
(1MILLION and MANNEQUEEN come up as the audience cheer for them.)

1548
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,819
(The two crews are now on the stage.)

1549
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,318
- 1MILLION. - Their outfits are so different.

1550
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:35,259
I've never seen 1MILLION wear such outfits like that.

1551
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,960
- They are our kind of outfit. - Yes.

1552
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,759
We wanted to show them a new side of our crew.

1553
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,698
We went with a real hip-hop outfit.

1554
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:43,129
"Descent of Warriors" wasn't their motif, right?

1555
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:46,368
(Back to 1996)

1556
01:12:46,369 --> 01:12:47,969
We wore heels, our secret weapon.

1557
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,538
Given the outfits,

1558
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:51,810
it won't be that hard to beat them.

1559
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:54,069
1MILLION will crush this battle again today.

1560
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:56,180
You can look forward to it.

1561
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,209
This mission isn't about a regular performance.

1562
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:01,078
It's called the Battle Performance Mission.

1563
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:02,079
(So what?)

1564
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,549
You all know that we're the strongest crew...

1565
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,719
when it comes to battles, right?

1566
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,720
- Yes! - Yes!

1567
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:08,318
(I'm the queen of battles.)

1568
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,090
(I'm the battle who dominated the world!)

1569
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,060
Today, we, MANNEQUEEN, will tear up this place!

1570
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,599
(Full of confidence)

1571
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Their rivalry started...

1572
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:18,270
- from the Mega Crew Mission. - Their rivalry is unbreakable.

1573
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:22,470
First of all, we have a record of beating MANNEQUEEN once.

1574
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,538
(They went up against MANNEQUEEN with the structure theme.)

1575
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:30,409
(They beat MANNEQUEEN and won the extra points.)

1576
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:32,809
As for the Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

1577
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:34,978
Hwasa chose our crew.

1578
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:37,788
So we have 100 extra points.

1579
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:40,849
I bet MANNEQUEEN will do everything they can to beat us.

1580
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,890
Part C will be really important.

1581
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:44,419
(MANNEQUEEN must come up a performance...)

1582
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,658
(with 1MILLION's crew song, "Naked Gold.")

1583
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:48,460
This word crossed my mind. "Doomed."

1584
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:50,299
(On the other hand...)

1585
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,568
(This is a festival!)

1586
01:13:51,569 --> 01:13:53,869
Gosh. I love it. This song is great.

1587
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,299
We'll be able to win the crowd with this song for sure.

1588
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,669
I'm not worried about the choreography at all.

1589
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,809
We can take a completely different take on this.

1590
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,409
We can make it look better than them.

1591
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,278
This is a great song, by the way.

1592
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:05,279
It's perfect for battles.

1593
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,749
Thank you, MANNEQUEEN.

1594
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,679
- Thank you. - Thank you, MANNEQUEEN.

1595
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,818
(The atmosphere is different. They seem to be in despair.)

1596
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:13,089
"What's this? Gosh, we're in trouble."

1597
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,658
It felt like getting struck by lightning.

1598
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:15,688
"We're doomed."

1599
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:18,029
"We'll need to prepare a lot for this mission."

1600
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,090
- Let's try it from the top. - Yes.

1601
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,329
(Is that a hula hoop?)

1602
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,868
The song for Part C isn't as exciting.

1603
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,769
Why don't we make use of some props?

1604
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:30,639
The song is about determination and coming of age.

1605
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,869
We can use mirrors as our props.

1606
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,009
But they don't have to be rectangular.

1607
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,108
- Right. - Why don't we use...

1608
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:37,310
something round like hula hoops?

1609
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:39,549
- What? - Is it too funny?

1610
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,318
- No, it's great. - That's a pretty good idea.

1611
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:43,578
(You know what I mean, right?)

1612
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,590
Yes.

1613
01:14:44,989 --> 01:14:47,149
It's not a bad idea. There's a hole too.

1614
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,618
(They're checking their choreography with the hula hoop one last time.)

1615
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,589
One, two, kick. It goes like that.

1616
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,788
All of us have to be able to stop at two.

1617
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,899
One, two, kick.

1618
01:14:56,329 --> 01:14:57,560
Wrap it around your leg.

1619
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,398
- Did you get a cramp? - Yes.

1620
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:00,430
No!

1621
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:03,599
We always practice hard for every mission.

1622
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,510
We can't go any lower than now.

1623
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,579
(MANNEQUEEN lost the K-pop Death match Mission to JAM REPUBLIC.)

1624
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:11,778
(They lost to 1MILLION during the Mega Crew Mission.)

1625
01:15:11,779 --> 01:15:14,778
(They had a taste of bitter defeat after losing consecutively.)

1626
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:16,578
We may look like a strong crew,

1627
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,448
but we haven't won any missions yet.

1628
01:15:18,449 --> 01:15:20,749
On top of that, we're up against a very strong crew.

1629
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,989
I want to take this chance to beat them this time.

1630
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:25,389
(1MILLION is practicing before the interim check.)

1631
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,500
Oh, yes.

1632
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,960
Why are you acting cute?

1633
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:34,329
(Even if they mess up, they seem to be in a good mood.)

1634
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,198
"I'm the wrist, Lia Kim."

1635
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,039
(I'm the wrist, Lia Kim?)

1636
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,038
(Harimu's lyric-writing skill makes them laugh.)

1637
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:41,039
(Nice)

1638
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,478
"I, Lia Kim, am single."

1639
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:43,778
(That was a nice comeback.)

1640
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:44,810
What?

1641
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:46,148
"I, Lia Kim, am single."

1642
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:48,479
Why me? Why am I single?

1643
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:50,420
No.

1644
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,590
(The more she thinks about it, she can't stop laughing.)

1645
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:56,858
We did well with the Mega Crew Mission.

1646
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:58,988
We also won the Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

1647
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:00,358
So I'm feeling confident.

1648
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:03,198
(Which crew will come out a victor after the interim check?)

1649
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,228
There it is.

1650
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:05,669
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1651
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,670
- This is it. - I'm scared.

1652
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:08,698
I thought I wasn't nervous, but I'm nervous.

1653
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:10,139
- Gosh, no! - Me too.

1654
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,970
- I haven't seen it yet. - Same here.

1655
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,210
(She checks the results of the interim check.)

1656
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:17,078
(There's a serious look on Funky Y's face.)

1657
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:20,078
(Their nervousness is at its peak.)

1658
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:21,109
Let's start with a round of applause.

1659
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,319
- Why? What is it? - What?

1660
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:27,119
(We won the interim check!)

1661
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,988
- We won! - Yes!

1662
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:32,089
- I told you! See? - Really?

1663
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,188
- Gosh. - I told you so.

1664
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:34,228
- I got goosebumps. - Gosh.

1665
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:35,398
I can't believe we beat them.

1666
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:37,198
All right. "The crew that LADYBOUNCE predicts to win."

1667
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,629
"Despite the fact that it was their song,."

1668
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,799
"MANNEQUEEN made the song theirs."

1669
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,698
Gosh. Isn't that the highest compliment?

1670
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:45,010
Gosh. They managed to include their identity in the song.

1671
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,908
- It suits the song really well. - Yes, it does.

1672
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:50,038
- This song... - Exactly.

1673
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,850
turned out to be perfect for Funky Y.

1674
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,478
Funky Y did this.

1675
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:54,549
- That one. - Yes.

1676
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,778
The song suits the identity of MANNEQUEEN really well.

1677
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,988
MANNEQUEEN did a better job with 1MILLION's crew song.

1678
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,889
And they used props.

1679
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:01,959
- This was nice. - Right.

1680
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,288
I saw the movement of the hula hoop.

1681
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:05,060
- Like this. - It was nice.

1682
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,089
I want to watch this again. I love it.

1683
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,698
I want to watch them perform on stage now.

1684
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,199
- I agree. - Right. Their performance...

1685
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,328
I guess we were thirsty for compliments.

1686
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:13,800
(It's funny and sad at the same time.)

1687
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,538
First of all, I'm really happy...

1688
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:17,738
that the feedback about the hula hoop is very positive.

1689
01:17:17,739 --> 01:17:18,739
This is crazy.

1690
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,340
I think Yoonji is going to cry.

1691
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,310
Take a picture of her. We have to.

1692
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,239
I was really worried...

1693
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:26,609
that I might mess up the performance.

1694
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:29,778
I didn't do the hula hoop even when I was in elementary school.

1695
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:31,890
I liked to jump rope.

1696
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:35,158
We got good feedback and they liked our props.

1697
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:36,919
So we were in a great mood.

1698
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,760
We don't want to lose to 1MILLION at a battle mission.

1699
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:42,158
I'd rather lose to them at a choreography mission.

1700
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,499
Let's stake our honour and beat them at this battle mission.

1701
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,229
- Yes. - Let's do this!

1702
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:51,068
(On the other hand, 1MILLION is feeling down.)

1703
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:53,908
"The crew that LADYBOUNCE predicts to be eliminated."

1704
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:57,209
"The performance, just good enough for the intern check."

1705
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,779
"They will need more time to practice."

1706
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:01,649
- That's totally 1MILLION's style. - Yes.

1707
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:02,919
They did a good job...

1708
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,279
- showing their style. - Yes.

1709
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,148
They have to beat MANNEQUEEN's performance...

1710
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:07,618
with the same song, right?

1711
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:11,089
But it looks like MANNEQUEEN's crew song.

1712
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,158
It was just good enough for an interim check.

1713
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:14,328
That was all it was.

1714
01:18:14,329 --> 01:18:17,459
- They need more time. - Yes. They need to clean this up.

1715
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,728
- The song is definitely too fast. - Yes. Right.

1716
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,799
They can't do anything at this pace.

1717
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,999
Something does seem off.

1718
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,669
They're supposed to battle with this performance.

1719
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,238
But I wonder if they can beat MANNEQUEEN with this.

1720
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,038
To be honest, after watching our performance,

1721
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:30,809
some parts were off.

1722
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:34,408
Our transitions weren't finalized, so we bumped into each other.

1723
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,719
We should practice a lot.

1724
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,679
It doesn't matter how cool the choreography is.

1725
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,049
If our movements aren't in sync,

1726
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:42,559
it will be difficult to leave an impression on the audience.

1727
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,858
Let's accept the feedback.

1728
01:18:44,859 --> 01:18:46,788
We will need to practice hard.

1729
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,629
- All right. - I got it.

1730
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,299
They're motivating us to practice harder.

1731
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,300
To be honest,

1732
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:54,969
it was true that we needed to practice more.

1733
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,368
We'll need to practice a lot.

1734
01:18:57,369 --> 01:18:59,209
(1MILLION's practice studio)

1735
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,238
As for this part, I actually thought...

1736
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:02,938
"We must give it our all to prepare for this mission."

1737
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:06,149
That's what I got out of the interim check.

1738
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,649
(Their unsynchronized moves stood out after the feedback.)

1739
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:12,019
(Messy)

1740
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,749
This part looks very messy.

1741
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,818
(I agree.)

1742
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:16,389
We'll nail our choreography down to the details,

1743
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,988
so our moves are in sync.

1744
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:21,288
(1MILLION starts from the top to work on their routine.)

1745
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,358
Our legs don't match.

1746
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:23,828
(Left leg, right leg)

1747
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:24,929
The left leg was supposed...

1748
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,328
to be in the front. Should we change it?

1749
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:27,329
The left leg.

1750
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,369
(They continue to get the routine down to the last detail.)

1751
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:34,609
(1MILLION works on their routine while discussing it.)

1752
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:36,738
(Checking the clip)

1753
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:38,550
- That's great. - That's much better.

1754
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:40,078
We're somewhat ready.

1755
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,978
I think we're ready to crush it on the stage.

1756
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,948
We couldn't keep our moves synchronized because of time.

1757
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:47,919
Once we put our minds to it, we can do a good job.

1758
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,560
I think we can show a great performance on stage.

1759
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,060
I'm so restless right now.

1760
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:54,930
This is the part, right? It goes like this, right?

1761
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:56,630
It's so confusing.

1762
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,898
I had never seen Cera get that nervous.

1763
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:02,100
Let's begin. Are you guys ready?

1764
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:03,698
MANNEQUEEN versus...

1765
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,009
(What's going on?)

1766
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,568
Seriously. I rarely go up against my crew members.

1767
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:09,579
We're going up against each other.

1768
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:12,449
Why are we battling?

1769
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,818
We're done coming up with Parts A and C.

1770
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:17,978
We need to choose who's going to do the 1-on-1 battle.

1771
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,519
We have a lot of battlers in our crew.

1772
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,520
(Battles?)

1773
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:21,789
(She responds to the word, "battle.")

1774
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,358
- That was sudden. - You both started a battle.

1775
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:24,959
(That's how their own battle came about.)

1776
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,090
Are you guys ready?

1777
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,130
- Fight. - Fight.

1778
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:30,828
(Turning into a battler)

1779
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:32,698
(Buckey and Redlic, the battle judges)

1780
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:34,000
Oh, my gosh.

1781
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,239
(Things get heated as if it's a real battle.)

1782
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,068
(Oh, my gosh)

1783
01:20:39,069 --> 01:20:42,379
(Yoonji appeals to the blonde judges to catch their eye.)

1784
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,408
Our battler friends...

1785
01:20:44,409 --> 01:20:45,850
were all very ambitious.

1786
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,549
As soon as we began,

1787
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,680
the only person I could see was Cera.

1788
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,090
Our theme is centered around heels,

1789
01:20:52,189 --> 01:20:54,319
which Cera pulls off very well.

1790
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,389
For MANNEQUEEN,

1791
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,119
the person going out to solo battle for Part B is...

1792
01:20:58,189 --> 01:20:59,329
Ten Million Hoorays Cera!

1793
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,429
(It's me?)

1794
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,858
- You do it! - I totally acknowledge that.

1795
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,129
Cera is really...

1796
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:05,970
an intense battler.

1797
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,569
Recently, she went to Italy...

1798
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,199
and won a battle.

1799
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:12,369
She's truly an amazing battler.

1800
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,210
Cera plays a big role for us.

1801
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,850
She wears heels and does moves that are very difficult.

1802
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:21,278
Cera has been doing a lot...

1803
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:23,750
of the more technical moves in our routines.

1804
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,390
(Screaming)

1805
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,050
That's why she must feel a lot of pressure,

1806
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:30,989
and she must be using even more stamina than the rest of us.

1807
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,158
Should we take a break?

1808
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,589
Yes, please.

1809
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:35,559
(There are pained moans coming from the MANNEQUEEN studio.)

1810
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,560
My gosh.

1811
01:21:36,561 --> 01:21:37,800
Everyone, you should take a break.

1812
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,270
I'll keep practicing.

1813
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:41,368
Good luck!

1814
01:21:41,369 --> 01:21:43,839
(The youngest, Cera, keeps practicing on her own.)

1815
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:49,140
I was chosen as the one battler to represent MANNEQUEEN.

1816
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:52,078
I felt a lot of pressure, thinking that whether or not...

1817
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:55,079
my crew would advance to the Finals depended on me.

1818
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:57,380
I fought against myself every night.

1819
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,220
"What should I do? I have to do well."

1820
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:00,890
"I can't cause harm to the crew."

1821
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:04,159
(1MILLION has begun choreographing their free part.)

1822
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:06,390
This looks a little...

1823
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:09,699
This mission is a Battle Performance Mission.

1824
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,899
So I thought it might be good to put in a diss to the other crew.

1825
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,640
That person was here too,

1826
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:17,500
and did this one more time, making it feel like this.

1827
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,608
Cera, from MANNEQUEEN,

1828
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:23,739
is famous for the move where she raises one leg.

1829
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,049
But...

1830
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:27,250
we have Debby on our team.

1831
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,579
I'm in charge of the technical moves.

1832
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:34,550
(Debby showed off many acrobatic moves.)

1833
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,959
Debby crossed then raised her leg...

1834
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,189
to target Cera.

1835
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,728
"Cera, you might raise a leg,"

1836
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:43,199
"but I can raise mine and flip backwards."

1837
01:22:43,699 --> 01:22:45,868
I feel some pressure there...

1838
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:49,938
because all eyes are on me while I'm doing that move.

1839
01:22:49,939 --> 01:22:52,710
That makes me a bit worried, and makes me feel pressure.

1840
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,209
(Debby keeps making mistakes, maybe because of the pressure.)

1841
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:57,140
- Put it on top. - And 7, 8!

1842
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:59,479
I have to do well.

1843
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,579
I just don't want to make a mistake.

1844
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:04,078
(The Battle Performance Mission D-Day)

1845
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,250
(1MILLION has begun their rehearsal.)

1846
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,788
(The part with Debby's acrobatic moves)

1847
01:23:08,789 --> 01:23:10,288
(Swaying)

1848
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:12,459
(She loses her balance from the start and sways a bit.)

1849
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,158
(But Debby keeps going with her moves.)

1850
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:16,658
(Off balance)

1851
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:19,970
(To make matters worse, her back flip is late on timing.)

1852
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:23,769
(Her timing is visibly different from her practice run.)

1853
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,170
(Taken aback)

1854
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,710
We made so many mistakes.

1855
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:32,380
We practiced for 12 hours out of a 24-hour day.

1856
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,750
I'm here to practice again.

1857
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:39,249
(Debby worked harder than anyone to pull off the technical move.)

1858
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:42,020
(What about this time?)

1859
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,659
(Easy)

1860
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,329
Now it looks totally natural.

1861
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:48,859
If I don't perform well,

1862
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,000
I won't be able to look my crew members in the eye.

1863
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,930
I want to perform without any mistakes.

1864
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,199
Now the battle between these two crews will begin.

1865
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:58,470
Are you guys ready?

1866
01:23:58,539 --> 01:23:59,839
(We're ready!)

1867
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,908
They're going.

1868
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:01,909
- Let's go! - Yes!

1869
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,209
Let's go!

1870
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,210
Fight!

1871
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:06,449
(Battle Performance Mission 1MILLION versus MANNEQUEEN)

1872
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,479
These songs are all from when I was growing up.

1873
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:13,819
I'm bringing sexy back.

1874
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:15,358
Today,

1875
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:16,488
we'll smash them to pieces.

1876
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:18,760
(1MILLION goes first with their free part.)

1877
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,329
That's it! Sexy backs!

1878
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,198
They're literally showing sexy backs.

1879
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,738
(Look at those backs)

1880
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:34,169
They always use their clothes

1881
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,680
- as props. - You're right.

1882
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:38,779
All they did was take their jackets off, but they look so pretty.

1883
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,220
They prepared a lot.

1884
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,829
Lia Kim's expression was scary.

1885
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:08,339
It's the Cera move!

1886
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,139
- Cera! - Cera!

1887
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,210
She's good at this.

1888
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,409
(The balance queen Cera's signature move)

1889
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,819
(The original move)

1890
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,659
(Debby perfectly adds a back flip to Cera's signature move.)

1891
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,999
(However?)

1892
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,368
(What is that?)

1893
01:25:34,369 --> 01:25:35,369
(Focusing)

1894
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:36,369
Oh, no.

1895
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,770
Maybe something got stuck.

1896
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:40,068
I messed up.

1897
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:41,408
I didn't even get a move wrong,

1898
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:43,010
I got the direction wrong, which is really bad.

1899
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,380
(Screaming)

1900
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:49,078
(Debby made a directional mistake when they had to face the judges.)

1901
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:51,050
Gosh, we might win this one.

1902
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,328
In 5, 4...

1903
01:26:01,329 --> 01:26:03,899
and 3, 2, 1.

1904
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,029
- Switch! MANNEQUEEN is up. - You ready?

1905
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,770
(MANNEQUEEN goes next with their free part.)

1906
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,108
(Raise your energy.)

1907
01:26:15,109 --> 01:26:16,509
They've made the room their own.

1908
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,140
- This song is made for waacking. - This is it!

1909
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,478
Their song is amazing.

1910
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:21,250
I'm looking forward to MANNEQUEEN.

1911
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:27,119
We'll win no matter what, with MANNEQUEEN's honour on the line.

1912
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:31,989
(Exploding with tension)

1913
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:35,500
(Moved)

1914
01:26:37,029 --> 01:26:38,770
This is waacking.

1915
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:48,470
They added in so many techniques.

1916
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:51,310
How can they do that in heels?

1917
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,908
I feel like they used whatever will hype the crowd up,

1918
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,720
- which is fair. Smart. - Yes.

1919
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,020
MANNEQUEEN ground their teeth while preparing this.

1920
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:20,469
(Time for some great entertainment as they're targeting 1MILLION)

1921
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:21,908
- Here it is! - Gosh!

1922
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:24,140
- 1MILLION, yes! - Let's go!

1923
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,649
They're doing this. They have to.

1924
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:30,750
(The neck strap performance by 1MILLION at the K-pop Death match)

1925
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:34,749
(Waackxxxy failed to grab her neck strap.)

1926
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,019
So you guys made a mistake too.

1927
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,859
It could be an even match.

1928
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:53,809
(MANNEQUEEN uses all 360° of the stage.)

1929
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,038
(Moved)

1930
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:56,380
(Moved too)

1931
01:27:57,409 --> 01:27:59,879
They made use of all parts of the stage.

1932
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,579
Experience makes them different.

1933
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:04,648
They're using all four directions.

1934
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:05,989
They're definitely battlers.

1935
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,500
(I'm holding up a V too.)

1936
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:28,679
In 5, 4...

1937
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,239
and 3, 2, 1.

1938
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:35,720
Switch! 1MILLION.

1939
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,679
In 3, 2, 1.

1940
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:41,118
(The 1-on-1 improv part)

1941
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:42,920
(Lia Kim goes first for 1MILLION.)

1942
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:46,260
All the dancers looked down on me.

1943
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:49,698
Her battle experience is incredible,

1944
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:52,329
but the ones chewing up the battle scene today...

1945
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,629
are us.

1946
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,899
With Lia Kim's skill now,

1947
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,500
isn't it impossible for her to freestyle?

1948
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:06,709
I'll show everyone how I dominated the world...

1949
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,310
with locking and popping.

1950
01:29:10,619 --> 01:29:12,720
(Lia Kim from 1MILLION goes first.)

1951
01:29:12,989 --> 01:29:14,149
It's Lia Kim.

1952
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,390
I'm looking forward to this.

1953
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:24,159
(Here she goes!)

1954
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,299
(This is insane!)

1955
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,369
(Redy)

1956
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,840
This is great!

1957
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:37,380
It's been so long since I saw her dance so hard.

1958
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,789
She practiced a ton.

1959
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:56,899
She's scary.

1960
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,130
I just got chills, for real.

1961
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,499
Since she's our leader, she came and kicked her feet up...

1962
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,739
into Funky Y's face, and that made me so angry.

1963
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,908
(Focused)

1964
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,619
That's it! That looks good, Lia!

1965
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:18,279
(Simply moved)

1966
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:19,520
That's insane.

1967
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:20,948
Is this the "Judge Show?"

1968
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:24,119
(An easy "Judge Show")

1969
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:29,729
(Glaring)

1970
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,060
In 3, 2, 1.

1971
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:35,270
Switch! MANNEQUEEN.

1972
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,209
(Cera from MANNEQUEEN goes next.)

1973
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,538
(This song is...)

1974
01:30:40,539 --> 01:30:41,938
(I'm going crazy now.)

1975
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:43,639
(Screaming)

1976
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:46,350
This is insane. "Abracadabra."

1977
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:48,920
(High expectations)

1978
01:30:49,949 --> 01:30:51,349
I was really nervous.

1979
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,988
But I knew I couldn't give in to the jitters,

1980
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:55,989
and needed to show off my skills calmly.

1981
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,960
(A shocking move)

1982
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:06,528
(Imitating Cera)

1983
01:31:06,529 --> 01:31:07,699
Let's go, Cera.

1984
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:12,340
(Becoming absorbed)

1985
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,809
(I'm going crazy now)

1986
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:19,478
(I was so soft and nice)

1987
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,279
(I'm going crazy too.)

1988
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,649
(Cera's signature move)

1989
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:26,750
(Whooping)

1990
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:30,259
(Cheering)

1991
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,158
- She's so good at that. - So stable.

1992
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,359
Always, and on a heel too.

1993
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,839
(This is thrilling.)

1994
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,509
She's so clever.

1995
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,109
- Cera just tore it up. - Yes.

1996
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:01,619
In 3, 2, 1.

1997
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:02,890
Switch!

1998
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:07,889
(The opposing crew song part)

1999
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,059
(1MILLION goes first.)

2000
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:11,229
- Did they complete it? - I think they did develop it.

2001
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,028
You saw us doing the Mega Crew Mission.

2002
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:14,698
I'm confident in our ability to be totally in sync.

2003
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:16,569
We'll show you an insane performance.

2004
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:22,579
(The opposing crew song part, MANNEQUEEN's "EZ")

2005
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:23,840
(1MILLION goes for it.)

2006
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,049
(What's with all the power 1MILLION is showing?)

2007
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:30,750
(They're insane.)

2008
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,439
(Speechless)

2009
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:54,569
This is so great.

2010
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:57,279
- Go, Redy! - Go, Redy!

2011
01:32:57,409 --> 01:32:58,840
It looks cleaner already.

2012
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:12,529
They got it in sync. They're coordinated now.

2013
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:20,670
(Harimu and Redy's time to shine)

2014
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,239
(Bursting with pleasure)

2015
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:35,180
(This combination is insane.)

2016
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:38,680
(Grinning)

2017
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:48,189
- This is it. - The K-pop?

2018
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:51,399
(The highlight choreography from the K-pop Death match Mission)

2019
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:54,770
(Waackxxxy's warmup is targeted.)

2020
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,479
In 3, 2, 1.

2021
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:09,649
Switch!

2022
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:11,550
MANNEQUEEN.

2023
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,948
(The mood changes.)

2024
01:34:13,949 --> 01:34:14,988
(My goodness)

2025
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:16,119
(Anticipation at 10,000 percent)

2026
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:19,289
This time, we'll really show you.

2027
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:22,090
We'll show you how strong MANNEQUEEN is in a battle.

2028
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,529
(The opposing crew song part, 1MILLION's "Naked Gold")

2029
01:34:32,439 --> 01:34:34,710
(Amazed)

2030
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:36,078
- This is great. - They're so good.

2031
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:37,238
They're doing great.

2032
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:39,079
It's so clean.

2033
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:40,979
They're insane.

2034
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,529
(Hoop magic)

2035
01:34:53,489 --> 01:34:55,289
(Cheering)

2036
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:56,960
(They nailed it.)

2037
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,118
(Cheering)

2038
01:35:16,119 --> 01:35:18,019
They're even sexier than 1MILLION doing this.

2039
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:19,448
MANNEQUEEN is sexier than 1MILLION for sure.

2040
01:35:19,449 --> 01:35:20,948
Yes.

2041
01:35:20,949 --> 01:35:22,220
They're so sexy.

2042
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:41,068
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2043
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:42,270
Battle set!

2044
01:35:42,739 --> 01:35:44,078
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2045
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:45,509
(That was the best.)

2046
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:48,050
(Clapping and cheering)

2047
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,479
They have to trust each other to do that.

2048
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,789
They must be insane.

2049
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,350
Are they Cirque Du Soleil or what?

2050
01:35:55,489 --> 01:35:57,659
They said the Mega Crew split was a diss.

2051
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,788
(MANNEQUEEN'S last move targeted Debby's split.)

2052
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:01,589
They created a work of art.

2053
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,999
MANNEQUEEN is really insane.

2054
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,800
They really ground their teeth for this one.

2055
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,170
What's wrong? She must be hurt.

2056
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,569
No!

2057
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:11,938
(After all the performances are over)

2058
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:14,439
(Limping)

2059
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:17,779
(Cera looks like she's having trouble with her leg.)

2060
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:21,249
(It doesn't look good.)

2061
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:22,310
Are you all right?

2062
01:36:23,149 --> 01:36:25,219
Please get us a light.

2063
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,488
Thank you.

2064
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,489
(Cera left the stage to receive emergency medical care.)

2065
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:32,420
Actually, all of the techniques were my responsibility.

2066
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:36,729
I must've been so nervous since I had to do everything.

2067
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,858
At the start of Part C,

2068
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:41,999
I had a terrible cramp.

2069
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,640
I just endured it.

2070
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:47,239
(The results must be announced without Cera.)

2071
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:50,809
The Battle Performance Mission performances...

2072
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:53,578
by 1MILLION and MANNEQUEEN are now over.

2073
01:36:53,579 --> 01:36:56,420
We will now begin the voting over the next 60 seconds.

2074
01:36:56,619 --> 01:36:57,948
Compare both crews,

2075
01:36:57,949 --> 01:37:00,449
and vote for just one crew.

2076
01:37:00,489 --> 01:37:02,188
Even though we made a mistake,

2077
01:37:02,189 --> 01:37:04,889
I think we should have some hope.

2078
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:06,688
We'd love every vote that comes in.

2079
01:37:06,689 --> 01:37:08,430
Can we please win this once?

2080
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:10,658
We will soon close the voting.

2081
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:13,569
In 3, 2, 1.

2082
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:16,000
The voting is now over.

2083
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,068
We will reveal the winners...

2084
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,640
of the fight judge evaluations first.

2085
01:37:22,739 --> 01:37:24,109
Who do we think got this?

2086
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,340
1MILLION?

2087
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:27,349
I think MANNEQUEEN did better.

2088
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:28,879
I think MANNEQUEEN won this one.

2089
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,149
(Nervous)

2090
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:31,449
(Gulping)

2091
01:37:31,649 --> 01:37:33,589
Fight judges, open your cards.

2092
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:36,220
In 3, 2, 1.

2093
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:43,000
(Amazed)

2094
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,600
(Who did the fight judges pick?)

2095
01:37:49,069 --> 01:37:50,140
(Regretful)

2096
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,139
Because of my mistake,

2097
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:54,270
it turned out this way.

2098
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,909
I'm so sorry to the members.

2099
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,640
(Shocked)

2100
01:37:58,641 --> 01:37:59,849
(MANNEQUEEN is shocked by the unexpected results.)

2101
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:00,908
My gosh.

2102
01:38:00,909 --> 01:38:02,309
With a score of 3 to 0,

2103
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:05,420
- MANNEQUEEN has won. - My gosh.

2104
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,319
(She can't easily talk through all of her tears.)

2105
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:14,159
(Cera heard the result from the waiting room.)

2106
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,729
We finally did it!

2107
01:38:19,869 --> 01:38:22,769
Don't cry!

2108
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:24,538
Don't cry!

2109
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:26,709
It was our first victory,

2110
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,408
so we felt acknowledged for the first time.

2111
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:29,810
We felt great.

2112
01:38:30,439 --> 01:38:33,009
Trix, what did you think of today's battle?

2113
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:36,148
For 1MILLION, you danced to "Sexy Back."

2114
01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:37,978
At first, it was great.

2115
01:38:37,979 --> 01:38:41,219
The performance really suited the song.

2116
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,358
But because many of the moves involved clothing,

2117
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:46,629
some of your mistakes looked very significant,

2118
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:47,929
and that made me lose focus.

2119
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:49,759
I thought that part could've been better.

2120
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,459
On the other hand,

2121
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,728
MANNEQUEEN showed us the proper way to use a prop.

2122
01:38:54,729 --> 01:38:57,100
Because of that,

2123
01:38:57,170 --> 01:39:00,639
I thought they did very well.

2124
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,038
It was clear that the crew...

2125
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:04,938
that was prepared to use all four sides of the stage...

2126
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:08,148
was MANNEQUEEN.

2127
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:09,618
In terms of Cera,

2128
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:12,948
it's actually harder to dance to songs everyone knows,

2129
01:39:12,949 --> 01:39:14,818
because the beat and the lyrics are so familiar to everyone.

2130
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:18,288
But the way she handled it was so skilled and experienced.

2131
01:39:18,289 --> 01:39:21,488
When Cera does her leg lift,

2132
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:23,559
I get the sense...

2133
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,728
that she's the only one who can pull it off like she does.

2134
01:39:24,729 --> 01:39:26,630
That's why I gave the vote to Cera.

2135
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:28,799
For the final round,

2136
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,898
I watched the videos for all of the crew songs.

2137
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:34,068
I was really fascinated by the MANNEQUEEN video too,

2138
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:35,938
and found it very impressive.

2139
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:37,679
When 1MILLION danced to that song,

2140
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,010
I thought it would've been awesome if 1MILLION had that crew song too.

2141
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:43,879
In particular, the energy of the two dancers was great.

2142
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,749
It was so good that I thought the decision would be hard.

2143
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,850
But when I watched MANNEQUEEN,

2144
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:52,619
it was like watching a performance in Las Vegas.

2145
01:39:52,989 --> 01:39:57,199
The performance was so fully developed,

2146
01:39:57,329 --> 01:40:00,328
and you were so well-coordinated.

2147
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:02,430
Honestly, I really want to see more of you.

2148
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:06,209
Although this is irrelevant to winning or losing,

2149
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,010
Cera was injured at the end.

2150
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,209
All three of us have experienced that,

2151
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,679
so it didn't feel like it was happening to a stranger.

2152
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,549
That's how important this performance is to you,

2153
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:18,919
and how precious every second, every minute of it is.

2154
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:22,249
To all the crews up here,

2155
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:26,129
I want to convey my respect.

2156
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:28,959
To all the crews, you've all worked so hard.

2157
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,000
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

2158
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,429
The fight judges have chosen MANNEQUEEN as their winner.

2159
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:37,369
We will now reveal the results of the live audience vote.

2160
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,770
(What are the results of the live audience vote?)

2161
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:43,140
I can't watch this.

2162
01:40:43,479 --> 01:40:45,738
I wonder what the audience thought.

2163
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:46,749
Who do you think?

2164
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,880
- 1MILLION. - 1MILLION.

2165
01:40:48,109 --> 01:40:49,849
- It will be MANNEQUEEN, right? - It will be MANNEQUEEN.

2166
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:52,549
- I bet the vibe played a big role. - That's right.

2167
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:55,019
1MILLION took the bonus points.

2168
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,890
MANNEQUEEN needs to win this round to be evenly matched.

2169
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:00,759
"What will I do if MANNEQUEEN takes..."

2170
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,329
"the live audience vote as well?"

2171
01:41:03,699 --> 01:41:04,699
(Sighing)

2172
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,500
The audience cheered for us loudly, so I am expectant.

2173
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,239
Please.

2174
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:12,499
(Which crew with the live audience vote for?)

2175
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,139
(We only counted the ballots voted within the 60 seconds.)

2176
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:19,139
(To be continued)

2177
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:23,779
(Which crew with the live audience vote for?)

2178
01:41:27,819 --> 01:41:30,020
(Disappointed)

2179
01:41:31,289 --> 01:41:32,318
(1MILLION succeeded in coming from behind.)

2180
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:35,129
- The score was 423 to 398. - Thank you.

2181
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,499
- 1MILLION takes 70 points... - Thank you.

2182
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,259
for the live audience vote.

2183
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:41,898
- Thank you. My goodness. - Thank you.

2184
01:41:41,899 --> 01:41:42,969
Congratulations.

2185
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,739
We were neck-and-neck.

2186
01:41:45,069 --> 01:41:48,969
Combing the fight judge score and the live audience vote score,

2187
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:52,478
the final score is 70 points to 30 points.

2188
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:54,049
1MILLION won.

2189
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:56,318
(Tearing up)

2190
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,318
We made a mistake on the stage earlier.

2191
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,818
What we prepared... Regardless of the result...

2192
01:42:02,819 --> 01:42:04,960
(Emotional)

2193
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:06,259
(The younger members become emotional upon seeing her.)

2194
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:08,288
Regardless of the result,

2195
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:11,799
the fact that we couldn't show what we prepared was upsetting.

2196
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,868
I want to thank the crew members...

2197
01:42:13,869 --> 01:42:16,939
for trying hard until the end without having a mental breakdown.

2198
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:20,839
I think a dance battle is all about...

2199
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,309
exchanging energy.

2200
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:25,938
It was so nice to experience that feeling together.

2201
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:26,949
Thank you.

2202
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:29,409
I...

2203
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:31,849
(She becomes emotional as well.)

2204
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:33,390
(Don't cry.)

2205
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,719
Oh, no.

2206
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,789
We were really happy while preparing for this mission.

2207
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:42,759
So we were determined to enjoy ourselves on the stage...

2208
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:45,059
and give a performance we wouldn't regret.

2209
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,429
Everyone did well...

2210
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:49,698
even though Cera got hurt. After Cera gets better,

2211
01:42:49,699 --> 01:42:53,039
we will work hard to give better performances.

2212
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:59,778
Nothing changes the fact...

2213
01:42:59,779 --> 01:43:02,309
that we were happy and satisfied with our performance.

2214
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,648
Even though the result was very disappointing,

2215
01:43:04,649 --> 01:43:08,119
I truly believe that we did well today.

2216
01:43:08,489 --> 01:43:10,589
(He will announce the result to determine the 4 final crews.)

2217
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:12,889
(A more cut throat rule will be applied.)

2218
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:14,429
(I think it will be...)

2219
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:18,328
(What's the new rule that surprised everyone?)

2220
01:43:18,329 --> 01:43:19,398
(For the crew that...)

2221
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:20,970
(Elimination will be final.)

2222
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:26,509
(Which 2 crews will leave the fight zone?)

2223
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:29,470
(The day of the announcement of the final result)

2224
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,639
Today's result...

2225
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,709
will get two crews eliminated.

2226
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:34,749
- Seriously. - That's right.

2227
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,978
I find it hard to believe.

2228
01:43:35,979 --> 01:43:37,818
It's the worst.

2229
01:43:37,819 --> 01:43:39,179
We are getting a lot of views.

2230
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,350
- That's right. - Good.

2231
01:43:40,649 --> 01:43:42,349
I am so happy.

2232
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:44,158
How do we feel? Let's hold hands.

2233
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,858
Do you think you are going to be doing the Elimination battle?

2234
01:43:46,859 --> 01:43:48,158
- No. - No.

2235
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,499
- But we are prepared for... - Watching.

2236
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,060
(Laughing)

2237
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,169
Let's do the Elimination Battle.

2238
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:56,469
- Totally. - Please let us do it.

2239
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:59,169
- Please. - It became our wish.

2240
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:00,769
We won't have any regrets...

2241
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:02,139
if we fight until the end.

2242
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,809
Now, we have the attitude of battlers.

2243
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:06,448
Anything could happen.

2244
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:08,408
Let's think that we might do the Elimination Battle.

2245
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:10,380
What will become our fate?

2246
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:14,219
(Today's fight zone will determine survival and elimination.)

2247
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:15,318
(The votes have been counted with observers in attendance.)

2248
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:16,459
(Street Woman Fighter 2)

2249
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,460
I am scared.

2250
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:19,389
I get scared every time I come here.

2251
01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:21,188
Oh, my goodness.

2252
01:44:21,189 --> 01:44:22,229
What a vibe.

2253
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:25,629
I feel nervous whenever I sit here.

2254
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:26,630
I am nervous.

2255
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:28,600
It has begun once again.

2256
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:30,969
Two crews will get eliminated.

2257
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:32,899
We might be one of those crews.

2258
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:34,510
We should be on our guard.

2259
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:38,209
The scores are neck-and-neck.

2260
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:39,309
There is no way of knowing the result.

2261
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:43,118
There are crews on the upper level and crews on the lower levels.

2262
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,179
- They compete fiercely. - Yes.

2263
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,278
They compete fiercely within the clusters.

2264
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:48,919
Gosh, I am so nervous about the battle.

2265
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,260
- Maybe it's too dramatic. - Maybe. Yes.

2266
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,028
We are ready to enter the fight zone today.

2267
01:44:53,029 --> 01:44:54,229
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2268
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:55,390
(The battle mode is on.)

2269
01:44:55,391 --> 01:44:56,500
We are ready.

2270
01:44:56,899 --> 01:44:58,999
Hello. This is Mnet's Street Woman Fighter 2.

2271
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,430
I am the host, Kang Daniel.

2272
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,769
Dancers, you worked hard...

2273
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:07,139
with Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...

2274
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:08,738
and Battle Performance Mission.

2275
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:11,509
- Well done. - Thank you for your hard work.

2276
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:12,839
- Thank you. - Yes.

2277
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,880
Well done.

2278
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,879
With eight crews, we began the journey of dance competition.

2279
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:20,189
But only six crews remain now.

2280
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:23,688
What remains is the final stop of Street Woman Fighter 2,

2281
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:24,789
the grand journey.

2282
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,959
It's the Final Live Broadcast.

2283
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,988
- Finally. - The time has come.

2284
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,858
When I announce the final result today.

2285
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:33,828
the crews that will get eliminated and end their journeys...

2286
01:45:33,829 --> 01:45:36,000
on Street Woman Fighter 2 will be decided.

2287
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,800
And two crews will be eliminated.

2288
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:40,669
(2 crews will be eliminated.)

2289
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,670
(Screaming)

2290
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:44,239
The font is so big. "Two crews."

2291
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:46,108
The font is broken too.

2292
01:45:46,109 --> 01:45:47,478
Suddenly, I feel nervous.

2293
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:49,749
Since it's the last step toward the Finals,

2294
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,448
a more cut throat rule will be applied to the bottom crew.

2295
01:45:53,449 --> 01:45:56,149
The crew that ranked sixth according to today's result...

2296
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,629
will get eliminated without the Elimination Battle.

2297
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:02,728
They will be asked to leave the fight zone immediately.

2298
01:46:02,729 --> 01:46:04,528
Don't do that.

2299
01:46:04,529 --> 01:46:05,630
I am close to tears already.

2300
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:07,100
So quick.

2301
01:46:07,329 --> 01:46:09,528
After the last Elimination Battle,

2302
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,999
which four crews...

2303
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,538
will advance to the Finals?

2304
01:46:14,539 --> 01:46:17,738
The final score will be decided by combining...

2305
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:19,978
six hundred points from Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...

2306
01:46:19,979 --> 01:46:22,148
and 600 points from the Battle Performance Mission.

2307
01:46:22,149 --> 01:46:23,549
As for Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

2308
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:25,478
one crew that got picked by Hwasa...

2309
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:28,049
will receive 100 bonus points.

2310
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:30,889
Online Public Evaluation score can go up to 400 points.

2311
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:33,788
The crew that ranked 1st will receive 400 points.

2312
01:46:33,789 --> 01:46:37,398
From the 2nd rank down, 30 points will be deducted per rank.

2313
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:39,328
And the crew that brought on...

2314
01:46:39,329 --> 01:46:41,799
the highest number of challenges will receive 100 bonus points.

2315
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,340
These three types of scores will make up the final score.

2316
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:48,010
The challenge makes up a big portion. One hundred points.

2317
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:49,778
Online Public Evaluation score...

2318
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:55,009
was taken from 12am, October 3 to 12am, October 10.

2319
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:58,278
The combined views of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission...

2320
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:00,389
and Battle Performance Mission videos...

2321
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:04,358
were 30,721,445.

2322
01:47:04,359 --> 01:47:05,988
It proved the global love and interest...

2323
01:47:05,989 --> 01:47:07,959
in the show once again.

2324
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,328
The show became a hit.

2325
01:47:10,329 --> 01:47:11,599
- We are cool. - I know.

2326
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,898
The dancers are cool.

2327
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:15,528
Amidst the interest of the viewers around the world,

2328
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:18,068
one crew had the highest number of views...

2329
01:47:18,069 --> 01:47:20,270
with their Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission video.

2330
01:47:20,369 --> 01:47:22,438
On the day the videos got uploaded,

2331
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:25,209
JAM REPUBLIC, 1MILLION, and BEBE's videos...

2332
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:28,380
ranked 1st, 3rd, and 7th among the trending videos.

2333
01:47:28,579 --> 01:47:30,948
The crew that received the highest number of views was...

2334
01:47:30,949 --> 01:47:32,380
JAM REPUBLIC.

2335
01:47:32,619 --> 01:47:33,619
Nice.

2336
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,089
Thanks.

2337
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:38,019
When the vote ended at 12am, October 10,

2338
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:41,188
the video had 7,303,001 views.

2339
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:44,728
It broke 1MILLION's record for the Mega Crew Mission.

2340
01:47:44,729 --> 01:47:47,398
They made history by reaching the highest number of views...

2341
01:47:47,399 --> 01:47:48,999
- in the entire season. - I can't believe it.

2342
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,739
Amazing.

2343
01:47:50,869 --> 01:47:53,738
JAM REPUBLIC's performance video went beyond Korea.

2344
01:47:53,739 --> 01:47:57,009
It ranked 1st in the Philippines, 2nd in Peru, and 10th in the US.

2345
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:58,809
In 12 countries,

2346
01:47:58,810 --> 01:48:01,948
it ranked within the top ten trending videos.

2347
01:48:01,949 --> 01:48:05,179
In Canada, Germany, New Zealand, UK, France, etc.,

2348
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:08,389
it became a trending video in 23 countries.

2349
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:10,890
It went viral globally.

2350
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,059
That's incredible.

2351
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:14,759
- They proved themselves. - Seriously.

2352
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,828
How impressible.

2353
01:48:15,829 --> 01:48:17,460
They ruled the world.

2354
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:20,769
I feel very blessed and supported again...

2355
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,429
from the public.

2356
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:24,499
We couldn't have done it without them, so...

2357
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,499
I am just really happy that they can see...

2358
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,568
what we are putting out...

2359
01:48:27,569 --> 01:48:29,238
and appreciate what we are putting out.

2360
01:48:29,239 --> 01:48:31,539
Again, we are very grateful for the love and support.

2361
01:48:33,449 --> 01:48:36,478
On the other hand, one crew had the lowest number of views.

2362
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:40,318
As this crew's video got 2,046,489 views,

2363
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:43,288
they ranked at the bottom among the six crews.

2364
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:44,460
It's LADYBOUNCE.

2365
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:47,289
What? Isn't it us? I thought it was us.

2366
01:48:47,489 --> 01:48:49,728
Firstly, even that is...

2367
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:52,299
a high number of views for us.

2368
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:53,599
So we are satisfied with the result.

2369
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,999
We put our passion into the performance...

2370
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,438
and left no regrets,

2371
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:00,340
so we are satisfied. Thank you.

2372
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:02,368
- They did well. - Well done.

2373
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,179
You are cool, LADYBOUNCE.

2374
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:05,339
(You are cool, LADYBOUNCE.)

2375
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:08,078
But only the views got revealed.

2376
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:10,278
The number likes and votes will be the most important key...

2377
01:49:10,279 --> 01:49:12,118
of the Online Public Evaluation.

2378
01:49:12,119 --> 01:49:13,590
The number of votes.

2379
01:49:13,789 --> 01:49:15,019
(I am so scared.)

2380
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:17,889
Now, I will announce the final result...

2381
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:20,089
of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2382
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:21,988
(Please.)

2383
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:23,800
- You are shaking. - You are right.

2384
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:25,500
Are you okay?

2385
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,999
I am suddenly nervous again.

2386
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,769
First come the bonus points...

2387
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:32,799
for the crew that got picked by Hwasa.

2388
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,769
The crew that got picked by Hwasa...

2389
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:37,738
and received 100 bonus points was 1MILLION.

2390
01:49:37,739 --> 01:49:39,409
(1MILLION received 100 bonus points.)

2391
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:42,408
(Doing 1MILLION's dance for "Chili")

2392
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:43,618
I am jealous.

2393
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:46,749
Now comes the crew that acquired the additional points...

2394
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:47,818
for the challenge.

2395
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:48,948
(Screaming)

2396
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:51,260
This is the real deal. We don't know who won them.

2397
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:53,020
- Which crew is it? - It's special.

2398
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:55,028
(Additional points for the "Chili" Challenge)

2399
01:49:55,029 --> 01:49:58,328
We combined the videos TikTok and Instagram Reels...

2400
01:49:58,329 --> 01:50:02,068
and found that 49,828 challenge videos were made.

2401
01:50:02,069 --> 01:50:04,500
It created the "Chili" boom.

2402
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:05,569
Forty thousand?

2403
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,039
That's a lot of love.

2404
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:10,238
For fairness, only the videos...

2405
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:14,310
with the crews' challenge filters were counted.

2406
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:16,449
We thank the public for participating in the challenge.

2407
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:17,648
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2408
01:50:17,649 --> 01:50:19,220
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

2409
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,419
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2410
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:24,119
- When will we get to do this? - Seriously.

2411
01:50:24,289 --> 01:50:25,389
Thank you.

2412
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:26,728
Thanks, everyone.

2413
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:27,729
(Making a heart)

2414
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:30,499
Which crew won the additional points...

2415
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:34,300
by bringing on 12,204 challenge videos?

2416
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:36,028
Did he say 12,204?

2417
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,698
- Did he say 12,204? - Is that even possible?

2418
01:50:37,699 --> 01:50:39,840
There were 40,000 videos, so it's 1 4th of the total.

2419
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:41,509
Which crew do you think it will be?

2420
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:43,109
- My guess is 1MILLION. - JAM REPUBLIC.

2421
01:50:43,609 --> 01:50:45,010
- BEBE? - JAM REPUBLIC.

2422
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,179
JAM REPUBLIC?

2423
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,250
- BEBE. - BEBE.

2424
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:49,448
Please let it be BEBE.

2425
01:50:49,449 --> 01:50:50,550
Please tell us.

2426
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,020
Which crew will it be?

2427
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:53,220
Which crew will it be?

2428
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:55,919
It's BEBE.

2429
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,420
(Cheering)

2430
01:50:58,390 --> 01:50:59,560
Amazing.

2431
01:50:59,659 --> 01:51:01,359
Did people do this the most?

2432
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:03,800
It's incredible that 12,000 videos were made.

2433
01:51:03,829 --> 01:51:05,060
They ranked high on both platforms.

2434
01:51:05,229 --> 01:51:06,969
It wasn't just one platform.

2435
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:09,028
About BEBE's performance, the public said,

2436
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:11,339
"BEBE is the only crew that shows both the song and the dance."

2437
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,510
"The master of the trends made the perfect highlight."

2438
01:51:13,569 --> 01:51:15,068
"The wow factor makes the dance electrifying."

2439
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:16,108
"It's a dance you want to copy."

2440
01:51:16,109 --> 01:51:18,309
"The addictive dance was made by diving up the rhythm well."

2441
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:19,879
Those were some of the comments.

2442
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:22,309
Firstly, when we first received...

2443
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:24,919
Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission,

2444
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,988
we did our best to show our style,

2445
01:51:26,989 --> 01:51:28,988
Hwasa's different side,

2446
01:51:28,989 --> 01:51:33,059
and something the public will enjoy. Those three were important to us.

2447
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:35,858
I feel like we were recognized for our effort.

2448
01:51:35,859 --> 01:51:39,059
I want to thank everyone who participated in the challenge...

2449
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,899
and loved our dance.

2450
01:51:41,899 --> 01:51:43,369
Congratulations.

2451
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:44,500
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2452
01:51:44,569 --> 01:51:46,100
I can't predict the result.

2453
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,739
- The first place? - Yes.

2454
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:49,069
(Nervous)

2455
01:51:49,109 --> 01:51:51,538
Now, I will announce the final rankings...

2456
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:53,550
of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2457
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:56,850
(The final rankings of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission)

2458
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:58,819
The font for the sixth place is broken.

2459
01:51:58,949 --> 01:52:00,419
(6th place)

2460
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,489
The font for the 1st place is shiny. The 6th place is like...

2461
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,819
Sixth place.

2462
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,859
That hurts my feelings.

2463
01:52:07,229 --> 01:52:08,288
(Wolf'Lo: 4th place in views, no additional points)

2464
01:52:08,289 --> 01:52:09,329
This is a bit scary.

2465
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:10,799
There will be no hope if we place sixth.

2466
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,259
(There will be no hope if we place 6th.)

2467
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,630
- Was there ever hope? - Was there ever hope?

2468
01:52:13,869 --> 01:52:15,199
We will find hope.

2469
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:18,039
We can't even hope.

2470
01:52:18,369 --> 01:52:20,640
That happens every time we sit here.

2471
01:52:20,739 --> 01:52:21,970
The competition will be fierce among the top three crews.

2472
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:24,478
Hwasa picked 1MILLION.

2473
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:26,908
The public picked us with the challenge.

2474
01:52:26,909 --> 01:52:30,049
JAM REPUBLIC will rank first in Online Public Evaluation.

2475
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:31,719
With 100 additional points,

2476
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,649
we can move up about three ranks.

2477
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:36,720
BEBE might place first.

2478
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:38,759
- That might happen. - Right?

2479
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,059
- Yes. - BEBE,

2480
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:41,729
- JAM REPUBLIC, 1MILLION, - JAM REPUBLIC, 1MILLION...

2481
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,829
MANNEQUEEN...

2482
01:52:43,659 --> 01:52:44,728
(Yoonji is hopeful.)

2483
01:52:44,729 --> 01:52:46,000
Giggle.

2484
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:49,229
I will announce the crew that ranked first.

2485
01:52:49,369 --> 01:52:50,470
Which crew ranked first?

2486
01:52:50,539 --> 01:52:51,569
1MILLION?

2487
01:52:51,699 --> 01:52:52,869
I think it's BEBE.

2488
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,209
I am sure it's JAM REPUBLIC.

2489
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:56,140
1MILLION? BEBE?

2490
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,239
Probably BEBE.

2491
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,880
Because they got the points, and they are pretty popular, right?

2492
01:53:00,609 --> 01:53:01,750
I think it's BEBE.

2493
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:03,448
The crew that ranked first...

2494
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:04,979
in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2495
01:53:05,319 --> 01:53:08,319
(Which crew will it be?)

2496
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:11,158
It's BEBE.

2497
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:14,159
(BEBE members are shocked.)

2498
01:53:14,829 --> 01:53:15,930
That's insane.

2499
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,100
- Bada. - I can't believe it.

2500
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:22,569
I am tearing up. Seriously.

2501
01:53:22,829 --> 01:53:24,000
Bada.

2502
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:26,300
I knew it.

2503
01:53:26,439 --> 01:53:27,470
Okay.

2504
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:29,340
Congratulations.

2505
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,679
(BEBE's total score: 470 points)

2506
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,340
They only got 370 points for the Online Public Evaluation.

2507
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,479
- It isn't the perfect score. - Really?

2508
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:35,649
I guess they ranked second.

2509
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:39,078
They moved up a rank thanks to the additional points.

2510
01:53:39,079 --> 01:53:41,589
- Congratulations. - Those points make a difference.

2511
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:43,020
They must be really happy.

2512
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:48,889
BEBE's video had 4,582,895 views...

2513
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:51,800
and 306,295 likes.

2514
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:56,069
And they also received 135,147 votes.

2515
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,839
Bada of BEBE,

2516
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,510
your crew ranked first. How does it feel?

2517
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,938
Firstly, words can't describe how happy I am.

2518
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:09,578
The members and I lost sleep over this choreography,

2519
01:54:09,579 --> 01:54:13,078
so I am very happy that it was loved by the public.

2520
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:16,188
Many people did the challenge and liked our choreography,

2521
01:54:16,189 --> 01:54:19,118
so I am really thankful. We will work hard...

2522
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:23,189
and show cooler and better performances.

2523
01:54:23,359 --> 01:54:24,858
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2524
01:54:24,859 --> 01:54:26,329
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

2525
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:28,069
Congratulations.

2526
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:30,199
We ranked first.

2527
01:54:30,369 --> 01:54:31,800
- It's unbelievable. - It's the best.

2528
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:33,738
Mom, are you watching this?

2529
01:54:33,739 --> 01:54:34,970
(We ranked 1st.)

2530
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:36,510
I really can't predict the result.

2531
01:54:36,539 --> 01:54:37,539
Now comes the crew...

2532
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:39,439
that ranked second in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2533
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,908
Is it JAM REPUBLIC?

2534
01:54:40,909 --> 01:54:41,909
I think it's 1MILLION.

2535
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:42,979
One hundred points make a big difference.

2536
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:44,020
JAM.

2537
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:45,978
Maybe it's 1MILLION that took 100 additional points.

2538
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:47,549
Please let us rank second.

2539
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:48,589
(1MILLION got 100 additional points by getting picked by Hwasa.)

2540
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,788
- Second. - Please.

2541
01:54:49,789 --> 01:54:50,959
Who ranked second?

2542
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,359
- JAM REPUBLIC. - JAM REPUBLIC.

2543
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,390
- It has to be us. - Yes.

2544
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:55,889
The competition is fierce among the upper crews.

2545
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:57,328
(Between 1MILLION and JAM REPUBLIC, which crew ranked 2nd?)

2546
01:54:57,329 --> 01:54:58,399
The crew that ranked second is...

2547
01:54:58,930 --> 01:55:01,028
1MILLION.

2548
01:55:01,029 --> 01:55:02,670
(Satisfied)

2549
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:05,899
Additional points.

2550
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:08,269
(Copying Lia Kim's signature gesture)

2551
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:09,909
(Thank you.)

2552
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:12,479
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2553
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:14,710
(1MILLION' total score: 440 points)

2554
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:16,608
The difference was 30 points.

2555
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:17,978
The competition is really fierce.

2556
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:22,019
1MILLION's video had 4,940,512 views...

2557
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,858
and 311,283 likes.

2558
01:55:24,859 --> 01:55:28,489
And they also received 45,715 votes.

2559
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,000
The crews without additional points fell in terms of rankings.

2560
01:55:32,029 --> 01:55:33,559
Regardless of the rankings,

2561
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:36,129
we felt the public's support and love...

2562
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:39,100
as we watched many people film the challenge videos.

2563
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:41,809
We want to thank everyone...

2564
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:43,739
who participated in the challenge.

2565
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:46,779
(Congratulations!)

2566
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:48,479
She has a way with words!

2567
01:55:49,979 --> 01:55:53,119
It's time to announce the crew that ranked third.

2568
01:55:53,149 --> 01:55:54,289
The crew that ranked third...

2569
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:55,648
Which crew will it be?

2570
01:55:55,649 --> 01:55:57,020
- JAM REPUBLIC. - JAM REPUBLIC.

2571
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:58,890
The crew that ranked third is...

2572
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:01,260
Drum roll.

2573
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:02,988
JAM REPUBLIC.

2574
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:05,260
(JAM REPUBLIC ranked 3rd.)

2575
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,799
(JAM REPUBLIC's total score: 400 points)

2576
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:07,970
- Our score is the highest. - Yes.

2577
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:10,300
My goodness, they received 400 points.

2578
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:11,470
It's the perfect score.

2579
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,600
(My goodness.)

2580
01:56:12,601 --> 01:56:16,340
JAM REPUBLIC's video had 7,303,001 views...

2581
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:19,339
and 629,832 likes.

2582
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:22,979
And they also received 154,584 votes.

2583
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:24,278
That's crazy.

2584
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:25,680
We feel really great.

2585
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:29,720
Again, I want to thank the viewers,

2586
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:31,890
the audience, and the voters...

2587
01:56:32,119 --> 01:56:35,488
for voting for us, loving our work, and really,

2588
01:56:35,489 --> 01:56:37,228
just being present and being there for us.

2589
01:56:37,229 --> 01:56:39,828
Congratulations to the rest of the crews as well.

2590
01:56:39,829 --> 01:56:40,970
Thank you.

2591
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:42,869
Thank you.

2592
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:44,439
(Kirsten is cute.)

2593
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:46,339
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2594
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:47,510
She can speak Korean now.

2595
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:49,908
I will now announce the crew...

2596
01:56:49,909 --> 01:56:51,840
that ranked fourth in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2597
01:56:52,109 --> 01:56:53,880
The competition is fierce for the 4th, 5th, and 6th places.

2598
01:56:53,979 --> 01:56:55,149
Now comes the real deal.

2599
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:56,210
It's a fight for the fourth place.

2600
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:57,478
It won't be us.

2601
01:56:57,479 --> 01:56:59,249
It's a fight for the fourth place. You never know.

2602
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,279
It won't be us.

2603
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,250
MANNEQUEEN? Wolf'Lo?

2604
01:57:02,590 --> 01:57:04,319
Many people did Wolf'Lo's dance challenge.

2605
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:08,760
We don't tend to score well with the public evaluation,

2606
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:12,100
so we shouldn't be too hopeful.

2607
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:14,229
I emptied my mind of false hope today.

2608
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:16,829
Which crew ranked fourth in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission?

2609
01:57:16,899 --> 01:57:17,899
MANNEQUEEN?

2610
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,000
Please.

2611
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:21,608
Wolf'Lo.

2612
01:57:21,609 --> 01:57:22,670
(Wolf'Lo ranked 4th.)

2613
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:24,238
- It's impossible. - Wolf'Lo.

2614
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:25,840
(What seemed impossible became possible.)

2615
01:57:25,909 --> 01:57:28,278
(Wolf'Lo's total score: 310 points)

2616
01:57:28,279 --> 01:57:29,350
Wolf'Lo.

2617
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,979
(Wolf'Lo members become emotional over the unexpected result.)

2618
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:34,590
Well done.

2619
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:37,760
We always ranked last. How did this happen?

2620
01:57:37,789 --> 01:57:40,020
- It's the best. - Yes.

2621
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:42,259
We are sorry about being too happy.

2622
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:43,729
(We understand how you feel.)

2623
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,829
It's okay.

2624
01:57:44,859 --> 01:57:46,800
It's our 1st time placing 4th. I am so happy.

2625
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:50,368
Wolf'Lo's video had 2,540,841 views...

2626
01:57:50,369 --> 01:57:53,170
and 127,162 likes.

2627
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:56,909
And they also received 31,257 votes.

2628
01:57:57,010 --> 01:57:59,538
To be honest, we are so flustered.

2629
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:04,720
We are so happy that we placed fourth.

2630
01:58:04,779 --> 01:58:06,818
And Misa...

2631
01:58:06,819 --> 01:58:10,050
did the perfect job with her role.

2632
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:13,289
The result is thanks to her.

2633
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:15,260
Dip it, swirl it.

2634
01:58:15,689 --> 01:58:17,859
I feel so happy. Seriously.

2635
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:20,828
We didn't rank first, but I want to give a performance.

2636
01:58:20,829 --> 01:58:22,069
Come back.

2637
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:23,129
Don't do it.

2638
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:25,100
Thank you so much. Thank you.

2639
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:28,340
- You are cool. - Yes.

2640
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:31,939
Now comes the crew that ranked fifth in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2641
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:33,738
Will we rank sixth this time as well?

2642
01:58:33,739 --> 01:58:36,210
MANNEQUEEN totally beat us in terms of the view count.

2643
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:37,520
Did we place fifth in terms of the view count?

2644
01:58:37,579 --> 01:58:38,720
(Yes, we placed 5th.)

2645
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:39,880
The fifth place is...

2646
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:41,989
Please let us rank fifth.

2647
01:58:42,489 --> 01:58:43,889
Please.

2648
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:45,789
(Which crew ranked 5th?)

2649
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,289
- LADYBOUNCE. - What?

2650
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:49,229
Are you serious?

2651
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:50,999
- Is it us? - Is it us?

2652
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,229
(NOB is confused.)

2653
01:58:53,029 --> 01:58:54,169
Is it us?

2654
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:55,800
We got ahead by the Online Public Evaluation.

2655
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:57,500
Did we have fewer views?

2656
01:58:57,569 --> 01:58:58,599
We had more views.

2657
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,670
- Then why did we rank sixth? - I guess we got fewer likes.

2658
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:02,569
We got fewer likes and less points in Online Public Evaluation.

2659
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:07,380
LADYBOUNCE's video had 2,046,489 views...

2660
01:59:07,449 --> 01:59:10,179
and 106,168 likes.

2661
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:13,279
And they also received 22,820 votes.

2662
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:15,889
Your reactions tell me the result was unexpected.

2663
01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:17,289
Yes.

2664
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:20,890
Firstly, we had the lowest number of views.

2665
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:22,488
We had the mindset...

2666
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:24,799
of "Let's have fun. Let's enjoy ourselves."

2667
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,028
So we had zero expectations.

2668
01:59:26,029 --> 01:59:28,599
We had a good result,

2669
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:30,969
so we are very happy.

2670
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:32,569
Thank you.

2671
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:34,569
- How cute. - Congratulations.

2672
01:59:34,609 --> 01:59:36,340
Congratulations.

2673
01:59:36,439 --> 01:59:38,739
Let's move up one level at a time.

2674
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:40,879
Thus, the crew that ranked sixth...

2675
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,449
in Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission is MANNEQUEEN.

2676
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:46,179
(MANNEQUEEN's total score: 250 points)

2677
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:50,448
MANNEQUEEN's video had 2,475,991 views...

2678
01:59:50,449 --> 01:59:53,089
and 86,421 likes.

2679
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:56,658
And they also received 36,427 votes.

2680
01:59:56,659 --> 01:59:58,960
Isn't it the first time MANNEQUEEN placed last?

2681
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,599
We didn't expect much,

2682
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,869
but it's shocking to actually place last.

2683
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:08,069
It will help MANNEQUEEN become a sturdier crew.

2684
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:10,439
(Emotional)

2685
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:12,210
Don't cry.

2686
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:15,850
I'm not crying.

2687
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,978
Personally, I learned a lot.

2688
02:00:18,979 --> 02:00:20,619
We will work hard.

2689
02:00:21,319 --> 02:00:23,419
- We did well. Accept the result. - Accept the result.

2690
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:24,858
- Accept the result. - We can do it.

2691
02:00:24,859 --> 02:00:27,560
This is the final result of Hwasa's New Song Preview Mission.

2692
02:00:27,659 --> 02:00:29,828
Currently, BEBE is in first place...

2693
02:00:29,829 --> 02:00:32,329
and MANNEQUEEN is in last place.

2694
02:00:32,729 --> 02:00:35,770
For the crew that places sixth, elimination will be final.

2695
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,300
My heart aches.

2696
02:00:38,699 --> 02:00:40,499
But this isn't the end.

2697
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,970
Battle Performance Mission score remains.

2698
02:00:43,369 --> 02:00:47,039
The score could change the final rankings.

2699
02:00:47,479 --> 02:00:49,349
The rankings might change.

2700
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:52,618
Will BEBE be able to defend the current ranking?

2701
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:55,589
Will MANNEQUEEN be able to move up the ranks...

2702
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:58,789
and escape the cliff of elimination?

2703
02:00:59,289 --> 02:01:01,430
I will announce the results of the Battle Performance Mission...

2704
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:05,099
that will determine the six crews' fate.

2705
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:06,800
I don't like it.

2706
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:08,629
Let's beat LADYBOUNCE.

2707
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:10,269
(What will become of LADYBOUNCE?)

2708
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:11,969
(With the Battle Performance Mission score, )

2709
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:13,238
(what will be the final result?)

2710
02:01:13,239 --> 02:01:15,909
- Let's do this next week. - I'd want that too.

2711
02:01:16,039 --> 02:01:18,679
(The final result of the Battle Performance Mission...)

2712
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:19,680
(gets revealed.)

2713
02:01:19,681 --> 02:01:20,710
(The final result)

2714
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:24,880
(The shocking result leaves the dancers flabbergasted.)

2715
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,978
(There is a big difference between the numbers of likes.)

2716
02:01:26,979 --> 02:01:28,219
(They took so many points.)

2717
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,818
(The rankings might change.)

2718
02:01:29,819 --> 02:01:31,688
(I don't know what the result will be.)

2719
02:01:31,689 --> 02:01:33,289
(I can't predict the result.)

2720
02:01:33,689 --> 02:01:36,658
(The final result with the combined scores..)

2721
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:39,829
(gets announced.)

2722
02:01:39,930 --> 02:01:43,329
(2 crews will get eliminated.)

2723
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:48,510
(As for the crew that ranks 6th, elimination will be final.)

2724
02:01:48,539 --> 02:01:51,039
(The final ranking)

2725
02:01:51,109 --> 02:01:55,078
(I am ready to accept the result no matter what it is.)

2726
02:01:55,079 --> 02:01:57,648
(We got this far by doing our absolute best.)

2727
02:01:57,649 --> 02:01:59,419
(We want to show people one more time.)

2728
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:01,419
(MANNEQUEEN's goal for today was, )

2729
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:04,560
("Let's participate in the Elimination Battle.")

2730
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:10,659
(The eliminated crew is...)

2731
02:02:13,229 --> 02:02:15,228
(The thought of letting another crew go...)

2732
02:02:15,229 --> 02:02:19,039
(makes the dancers emotional.)

2733
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:21,840
(Which crew will rank 6th and leave the fight zone?)

2734
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:24,209
(Both JAM REPUBLIC and 1MILLION became...)

2735
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:27,649
(the candidates for the Elimination Battle.)

2736
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:29,909
- What? - What?

2737
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:33,420
(Isn't that insane?)

2738
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:36,350
(Where did that come from?)

2739
02:02:37,189 --> 02:02:40,420
(I am very confused right now.)

2740
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:43,460
(I don't want to go home.)

2741
02:02:43,529 --> 02:02:47,398
(We really didn't expect this.)

2742
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:49,999
(We will grit our teeth and do our best...)

2743
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,399
(so that we can move on to the Finals.)

2744
02:02:53,239 --> 02:02:56,510
(The dancers are shocked. What will be the final result?)

2745
02:02:56,909 --> 02:03:00,038
(It's the last chance before the Finals!)

2746
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:04,119
(Which crews will get included in the last 4 crews?)
