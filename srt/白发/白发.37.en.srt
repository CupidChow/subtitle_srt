00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,602
Episode 37

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,548
I have but one advice for you.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,640
Maybe your feelings for Rong Le...

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,362
are just the same as mine for you.

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,329
This is not true love.

7
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,549
You just wanted to best Prince Li.

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,318
Let it go.

9
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,288
Going astray on this path...

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,121
will make you suffer
the same consequences as mine.

11
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,848
You are not me.

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,417
Don't draw your own conclusion.

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,280
Live well...

14
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,117
and focus on recuperating yourself.

15
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,580
Only by taking a good care
of yourself...

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
can you have a chance.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Just like you've expected,

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,759
General Fu has sent Chang Jian
and the others to track us.

19
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:37,415
He too send someone at once to...

20
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:39,593
check on the mad woman
we met on the street just now.

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,824
Fu Chou is over-suspicious. He won't
let me get out from the manor easily.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,640
He has eyes on my every move...

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,614
when I'm outside the manor.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,960
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.

25
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,322
When I came back just now,
the guards in the manor look anxious.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,467
What happened?

27
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,315
General Fu was looking
for the Imperial Jade Seal.

28
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,824
He had searched the whole palace.

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,240
And he even searched the manor of
the royalties and important ministers.

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,414
But he ended up empty-handed.
So, General Fu...

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
is furious now.

32
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,355
Crown Prince once did
the same thing as well.

33
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,638
But he came back empty-handed as well.

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,960
Your Majesty, I'm going to
bring you away from here.

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,854
Yun's...

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Tomb.

37
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,010
Yun's Tomb.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,160
Jade...

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,840
Insolent fool!

40
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,576
I want to leave.

41
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,170
How dare you stop me!

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,240
Did you have any respect for me?

43
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:58,455
Please spare my life, Crown Prince.

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,840
-Don't hit me.
-Crown Prince.

45
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,791
-Who are you calling Crown Prince?
-Crown Prince, don't hit me.

46
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,471
-Don't hit me.
-Who are you calling Crown Prince?

47
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,570
-Save me.
-What are you doing?

48
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,664
What are you doing?

49
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,173
Do you know who am I?

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,080
I'm the Son of Heaven.

51
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:17,898
I am the emperor.

52
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,205
I'm the Son of Heaven!

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,400
Save me.

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Go!

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,560
Get the Crown Prince here.

56
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:28,933
Go!

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,714
All of you...

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,178
have shown no respect towards me!

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,680
Alright then.

60
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,147
I am the emperor.

61
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,294
Nobody can stop me...

62
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,422
from killing anybody as I please!

63
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,579
Is it painful?

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,370
Do you know who am I now?

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,920
Who are you calling Crown Prince?

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,200
I am the emperor.

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,693
Remember that.

68
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,753
I am the emperor.

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Who are you?

70
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,928
I think that...

71
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,032
Crown Prince has lost his mind...

72
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,761
because he's too upset
about losing his throne.

73
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,718
He has gone mad.

74
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,495
He has contacted an illness...

75
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,714
called insanity.

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,729
Before this,

77
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,377
I heard about a treatment.

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,309
-Guards.
-Yes, Master.

79
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,941
Go to the hill at the back...

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,760
to capture some insects.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,920
-Feed it to the Crown Prince.
-Yes, Master.

82
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,726
-No!
-What is it?

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,350
Are you saying that
you are not insane...

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,499
or that my treatment is wrong?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
You!

86
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,640
Who are you?

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,200
How dare you play me.

88
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:01,521
I can sentence you to death...

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,482
together with your family.

90
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,335
Until now,

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,589
you are still like this.

92
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,474
You are still as pampered
and peremptory.

93
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,288
When I was in Senyan Palace...

94
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,593
serving the empress who had fallen
into disgrace and was jailed,

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,080
you were there,
hitting on me when I'm down.

96
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,506
You humiliated and tortured me.

97
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,211
But I thought that, for the empress,

98
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:29,401
I had to endure it.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,444
I never thought that you...

100
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,841
will become more and more insatiable.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,285
You...

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,191
You are...

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,127
Important people have short memories.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,475
How would you remember me?

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,563
Back then, you were in power and
you were in the emperor's favour.

106
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,773
You were so high and above.

107
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,120
For someone like you,

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,099
others were just like weed.

109
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,120
Now,

110
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,444
you've been reduced to this state.

111
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:11,108
This is called the karma.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,000
You'll have to pay for what you did.

113
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,746
The sufferings that I
had endured back then...

114
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,326
will be...

115
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,611
given back to you today.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,933
Just wait while death comes to you.

117
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,240
Don't come near me!

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,880
Where are you bringing me to?

119
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:33,173
You!

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,280
Let go of me!

121
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,628
Who are you?

122
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,160
I am Agent Wu.

123
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
Princess Rong Le
came here this morning.

124
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,588
Did she ask you to
pass something to me?

125
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:59,289
It's you. You've given me a fright.

126
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:02,412
You can just come in normally.
Why do you have to move like a shadow?

127
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,805
Where is it?

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,920
Do you know what it is?

129
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,597
A fan.

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Move aside.

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,760
This is the one, right?

132
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,653
<i>He's in Senyan Palace.
In three days' time,</i>

133
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,598
<i>I'll pass the General's Pass to you.</i>

134
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,469
Here you go.
I think it will be of use to you.

135
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,280
You trust me that much?

136
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,175
Princess Rong Le has put in so
much effort to pass this fan to you.

137
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,160
It means that you are
someone she trusts.

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,520
If she trusts you,
then I'll trust you too.

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,686
Besides, Princess Rong Le
has described...

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,080
your looks to me.

141
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,238
Thank you. Goodbye.

142
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,680
Agent Wu.

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,160
Wu You.

144
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,105
Brother.

145
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:22,816
Here.

146
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,065
This ointment is specially
crafted by Xiao Ke.

147
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,885
It's can boost up your
recovering speed to heal your wounds.

148
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,930
How is she?

149
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,943
Don't worry. Nobody has
had it worse than you.

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,524
Brother, how's the arrangement?

151
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,201
Wu Yu is gathering the troops.

152
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,320
The retrieve-and-retreat team
is ready.

153
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,655
We are just waiting for you
to leave this place.

154
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,707
But now, Fu Chou has heavily
surrounded the palace with soldiers.

155
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,362
And Senyan Palace is guarded
by experts in martial arts.

156
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,220
Without Fu Chou's General's Pass,

157
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,589
we'll have to fight our way out
of we want to save you.

158
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,909
You are severely wounded right now.

159
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:09,609
If we take a detour,
not only it'll take a toll on you,

160
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,075
we'll be hunted down for sure.

161
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:13,228
Only by using the General's Pass
can we use the...

162
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,923
shortcut to get to the official route
and have a clear passage.

163
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:18,662
Is Man Yao risking her safety...

164
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,122
to get the General's Pass?

165
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:22,841
She passed a message to Xiao Ke.
In three days' time at night,

166
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:25,557
she'll meet up with us after
she gets the General's Pass.

167
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
Wu You.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,813
She is no ordinary lady.

169
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,387
She is very meticulous.

170
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,588
She must have had
a certainty of success.

171
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,934
Don't worry. I'll send someone
to protect her in secret.

172
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,560
Brother.

173
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,507
You have to make sure
that she is safe.

174
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:46,331
Don't worry.
I know the score.

175
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
Ya Li.

176
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,264
Guard the palace from the outside.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,318
-Your Majesty.
-Ya Li.

178
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,080
It must be hard on you these few days.

179
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:09,452
I never thought that Fu Chou will
turn out to be someone like that.

180
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,462
He had brought shame
and ruin upon Wu You.

181
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
And we are not sure
if he's dead or alive.

182
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,074
I heard that he promised
to marry you in public.

183
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:19,631
But now, he puts you
under house arrest here.

184
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,640
Save me, Your Majesty.

185
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,080
I don't want to be
trapped here forever.

186
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,480
And I don't want to be
used by Fu Chou.

187
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,725
Now, in this palace,
the only one who can save me...

188
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,882
is you, Your Majesty.

189
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,495
Ya Li.

190
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,479
I have no children.

191
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,645
You are the only one who
came to visit me usually.

192
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,156
I've already regarded you
as my daughter.

193
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,571
In the past,

194
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,362
in order to have someone to rely on...

195
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,002
for the rest of my life,

196
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,520
I had insisted for you
to marry Wu You.

197
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,973
I did it for your own good.

198
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,363
But I had never once
considered your own feelings.

199
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,521
I'm ashamed to face you.

200
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,880
It's not like that, Your Majesty.

201
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm the one who is too naive.

202
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:06,757
If I had listen to you back then...

203
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
and gave my heart to Prince Li,

204
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,097
even if I have to suffer together
with him now,

205
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,579
it'll still be better than being
tricked and used by Fu Chou.

206
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:17,791
I understand.

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,552
It's alright.
It's all in the past.

208
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:22,409
Don't be scared. I have a way.
Let's go.

209
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,495
I've sent someone to lure away
the guards from this palace.

210
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,461
You have to leave now.

211
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,200
The guards in southern door
are my men.

212
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,724
Go out from the southern door
and leave this palace at once.

213
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,360
What about you?

214
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,360
Escape together with me.

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
No.

216
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,751
I can't leave.

217
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,680
You are still young.

218
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,697
You can still start over.

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,360
But I,

220
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:50,584
I've given the best period
of my life to this palace.

221
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,159
All of my memories are here.

222
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,371
I can't leave this place anymore.

223
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,928
You have to go.
Go now.

224
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,104
I will never forget about
your kindness today.

225
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,600
Please take care of yourself.

226
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,920
Enough. Go now.

227
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,560
Take care, leave now.

228
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,895
-Your Majesty.
-Quick!

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,052
Go.

230
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,563
Ya Li.

231
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,840
In this life,

232
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,029
we won't be able to
meet each other again.

233
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:30,960
For the rest of your life,

234
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,694
you have to be safe and happy always.

235
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,237
There's sound over there!
Go and take a look!

236
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
Let's go.

237
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,000
Let me bring you some clean water.

238
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,680
Why?

239
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,169
Why did you want to
treat me like this?

240
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,052
Do you know...

241
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,086
how much courage it took...

242
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,496
to believe in a person
who had used me...

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,960
and hurt me?

244
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,824
And do you know that...

245
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,440
I almost...

246
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,000
I almost fall in love with you?

247
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,560
What did you say?

248
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,840
It's too late now.

249
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,276
You've betrayed my trust.

250
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,182
You've used your own way...

251
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,240
to push me into other's hands.

252
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,281
You've used your actions...

253
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,755
to teach me a lesson
more cruel than death.

254
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,680
Hate.

255
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,600
I never utter this word easily.

256
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,082
But today,

257
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,970
I'm going to give this word...

258
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,040
to you.

259
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,699
Yes.

260
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,039
Everything is too late now.

261
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,440
Rong Le.

262
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,276
If you are willing to
give me one more chance,

263
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,834
I can let Zongzheng Wu You go.

264
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,775
If you want him to go
to the southern fringe,

265
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,851
I can give him the whole
of southern fringe.

266
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
I promise you.

267
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,946
From now on, I won't use you
or hurt you anymore.

268
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,338
I'll love you with all my heart...

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,794
and live a good life with you.

270
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,720
Zongzheng Wu You.

271
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,180
Wu You.

272
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,024
You are the one who locked him up.

273
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,420
I want to meet him.

274
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,796
I want to meet him now.

275
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,960
Rong Le.

276
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,430
I've gave in more and more.

277
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,648
But why are you
still thinking about him?

278
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,660
You can't see me even though
I'm right in front of you.

279
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:32,354
You have only Zongzheng Wu You
in your heart.

280
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,800
Why can't you forget about him?

281
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,560
Rong Le.

282
00:19:57,788 --> 00:19:59,532
You've tricked me.

283
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,670
Now, we don't owe each other anymore.

284
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,910
I know that you are over-suspicious.

285
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,581
I can't fool you easily.

286
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
So, I put some harmless and odourless
powder on your zither first...

287
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,664
without you knowing about it.

288
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,665
But as soon as that powder...

289
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,806
comes in contact with my blood,

290
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:26,330
it'll become the
strongest tranquillizer.

291
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,960
Fu Chou.

292
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,579
Since you've treated me
with affection,

293
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,480
I won't kill you.

294
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,008
In this life,

295
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
I'll love only Wu You.

296
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,070
But I have to thank you for it.

297
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,360
You...

298
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,465
made me realise...

299
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:03,399
who is the one...

300
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:06,393
that treated me wholeheartedly.

301
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,433
This is a futile effort.

302
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,520
Rip off one's robe as sign
of breaking off all ties.

303
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,736
Tonight, we are done.

304
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,706
We don't have any ties anymore.

305
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,054
Let me out!

306
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,300
Let go of me!

307
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,365
Let me out!

308
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,545
How dare you!

309
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,751
Anybody here?

310
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,028
Anybody here?

311
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,846
Are you human or are you a ghost?

312
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,856
Say something.

313
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,645
Say something.

314
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,720
Father.

315
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,519
Father, you are still alive!

316
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,974
I thought that...

317
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,126
I thought that...

318
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,600
Father.

319
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,408
Hit me, father!

320
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,978
Hit me and scold me, father!

321
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:37,519
Father, please give me a scolding!

322
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,760
Father.

323
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,136
How did you become like this, father?

324
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,595
I'm going to get you out now.

325
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,677
I'm going to get you out now!

326
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,375
I'll get you out.

327
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,473
I'll get you out!

328
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,089
You! Let go of my father.

329
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,699
Let go of my father!

330
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
Father.

331
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,235
Father. I'm an unfilial son!

332
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,169
I'm unfilial and I'm dumb.

333
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,455
I shouldn't have trusted
that low-life, Fu Chou.

334
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,120
He's the one who
had reduced you to this.

335
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,845
By the way, father.

336
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,360
Father.

337
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,876
Fu Chou is the son of
the late Empress Fu.

338
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,293
So, he deliberately
planned all of these...

339
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,872
in order to get his revenge, father.

340
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,113
What should we do?

341
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,600
What should we do, father?

342
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,520
I know.

343
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:04,382
You put great care
about your appearance.

344
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,755
I'm going to tidy you up now.

345
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,356
I won't let you lose your dignity.

346
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,959
Father I know that...

347
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,655
you have only Wu You in your heart.

348
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:28,445
I want to get some love from you too.

349
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,760
I did all of those...

350
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:33,375
because I want to proof myself to you.

351
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:34,827
But...

352
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,332
But I've harmed you instead.

353
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:43,059
Father.

354
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,323
Father, I'm willing to
kneel and beg Fu Chou...

355
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:50,654
to exchange my life with yours.

356
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
I'm going to protect you!

357
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,609
I'm going to protect you, father!

358
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,691
My life is worthless.

359
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,916
As long as you still
have me in your heart,

360
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,169
I will not hesitate to do it.

361
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,400
Father.

362
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
I see my mistake now.

363
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,990
I see my mistake now.

364
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,935
Father.

365
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,080
Father.

366
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,427
Who is it?

367
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,400
General Fu has ordered me to transfer
the criminal to Ministry of Justice.

368
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Transfer the criminal to the
prison of Ministry of Justice?

369
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,087
Shouldn't Sir Chang,
Head of the Guards be the one...

370
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
to give out this kind of secret order?

371
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,520
My order is to carry out
this emergency mission.

372
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:57,909
And I have to transfer the criminal
within two hours' time.

373
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,360
You are not General Fu's man.

374
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,399
You are very attentive.

375
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:06,267
I used to serve Princess Rong Le.

376
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:09,808
But now, Northern Realm is
under General Fu's control.

377
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:12,567
A wise man understands and
submits to circumstances.

378
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,960
Now, I serve the General.

379
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,518
But I am a trusted man of General Fu.

380
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:18,865
That's why he entrusted me
with his General's Pass.

381
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:22,258
From now on, please take care of me.

382
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
The prison cart of Ministry of Justice
is just outside of the Cold Harem.

383
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,040
You have to trust me.

384
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,212
If you are still suspicious,

385
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,271
you can go to the Ministry of Justice
to ask General Fu.

386
00:27:34,507 --> 00:27:36,387
But if I am late...

387
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,403
and General Fu found out that
his pass didn't work on both of you,

388
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,752
I'm not sure how are you
going to explain to him then.

389
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,056
Since it's General Fu's pass,

390
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:47,549
his pass represents him.

391
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:48,915
Quick. Open the door.

392
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,832
Master, it's clear outside.

393
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,282
Let's go.

394
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,365
General Fu.

395
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,000
Go to the palace now.

396
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:13,547
If you see Zongzheng Wu You,

397
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:15,208
kill him on the spot.

398
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,520
Yes, General.

399
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,920
I'm here to transfer the criminal
under General Fu's command.

400
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,960
Open the city gate!

401
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,628
-Stop!
-Help!

402
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,795
-Stop!
-Somebody help!

403
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,981
-Help!
-How dare you run!

404
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,969
I'm going to teach you a lesson!
How dare you run!

405
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:45,082
-Help!
-Stop running!

406
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,819
-Stop!
-Your Highness, we have to stay put.

407
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,501
Save her.

408
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,680
Release the arrows.

409
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,219
Leave now!

410
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,173
<i>Rong Le.</i>

411
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
<i>You forced my hand.</i>

412
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,900
General Fu.

413
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:00,854
What happened?

414
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:03,900
Xiao Sha took your pass and saved
Zongzheng Wu You together with...

415
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,360
a group of well-trained fighters.

416
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,901
-There's a girl with him as well.
-Is she Lady Rong Le?

417
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,520
General Fu, due to my carelessness,
I didn't get a clear picture of her.

418
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,339
-Does she have black or white hair?
-She doesn't have white hair.

419
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:18,233
Zongzheng Wu You,
you've pushed me too hard.

420
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,037
-Chang Jian.
-Yes, General.

421
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,006
-Bring him back.
-Yes, General.

422
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,598
Wu You.

423
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,375
Where is Man Yao?

424
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:40,777
Princess Rong Le has went to
Yun's Tomb to get something vital.

425
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,995
Let's go to Yun's Tomb.

426
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:00,043
Don't worry.

427
00:35:00,444 --> 00:35:01,764
You are safe now.

428
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:11,719
Come to think of it, both of us
are really fated to meet each other.

429
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,142
When we were in Qingzhou,
both of us were utterly helpless.

430
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,240
Now,

431
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,904
we are both cast away from the world.

432
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,880
Wu You.

433
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,440
How's your body? Can you take it?

434
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,080
Don't worry, brother.

435
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,600
Here.

436
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,462
Your Highness, your wounds...

437
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
I'm fine.

438
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,560
Lady Yun.

439
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,425
Because of me, Wu You...

440
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,270
gave up his country...

441
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,840
and gave away his dignity.

442
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,460
He almost lost his life as well.

443
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,080
Once, I had rejected...

444
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,388
his vow at this very place.

445
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:23,539
Today,

446
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm going to make a vow here.

447
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:29,859
No matter how much time
I have left from now on,

448
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,419
I'll treat Wu You...

449
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,282
wholeheartedly.

450
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,080
I won't fail him.

451
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,125
I rather sacrifice myself...

452
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,000
to save him.

453
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,440
Please allow me...

454
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,895
to protect him for you.

455
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,388
That old man...

456
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,021
has indeed given the seal to you.

457
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,627
I've underestimated you.

458
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,759
It's you again.

459
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
Don't waste your energy.

460
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:49,987
You won't be able to fight me.

461
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,404
But you've improved a lot.

462
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:54,387
Improved a lot.

463
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,880
You know me?

464
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,080
Do you think you can escape?

465
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,474
Your love for Zongzheng Wu You
is really true and genuine.

466
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,774
But it'll still be a waste
even if you give your all.

467
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,737
The things and people that I want...

468
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,344
have never slipped past my grasp.

469
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,000
Today,

470
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:50,188
I'm afraid that
you won't be able to...

471
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,464
-get the thing that you want.
-For Zongzheng Wu You,

472
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:55,843
you are willing to sacrifice yourself?

473
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,926
I don't care who you are to Fu Chou.

474
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,480
And I don't care what
conspiracy you have.

475
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,557
But if you want to
threaten Wu You's life,

476
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,156
then I rather...

477
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,480
burst into flame
together with this seal.

478
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,161
Burst into flame together
with the seal indeed.

479
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,960
I won't let you die.

480
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:44,114
The Creed of Vengeance
is so shameless.

481
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,840
There are so many of you against
a woman and you have her cornered.

482
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,250
I was still wondering who you are.

483
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,303
So, you are the almighty Agent Wu
who was once defeated by me.

484
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:58,182
I never thought that...

485
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,809
you are the master of The Hidden Ones.

486
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,144
It's too bad that you've
chosen the wrong master.

487
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,881
You chose to serve under
Zongzheng Wu You.

488
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,169
Now, he's just a stray cur.

489
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:11,897
Everybody wants his head.

490
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,706
It's up to me for the one
I choose to serve.

491
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,146
But there's one thing.

492
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,105
I'll never be associated with a rude
and shameless eunuch like you.

493
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,102
A capable man never brags.

494
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:30,667
Agent Wu.

495
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,510
Do you think that you will be able...

496
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,278
to stop me just by yourself?

497
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,560
Do you think Zongzheng Wu You
will be able to escape...

498
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,360
and return to power?
