Episode 27

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,200
What is that smell?

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
It's so itchy!

5
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,840
-What did you do to me?
-Nothing.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,160
I just sprayed some of my newly
invented poison powder on you.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,240
You shouldn't have disrespected me.

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
My brother said boys and girls
should not touch each other.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,400
A man that touches me is a bad guy!

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,320
-Give me the antidote!
-No!

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,280
Give me the antidote!

12
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,880
-It's so itchy! Stop right there!
-What do you want?

13
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,920
Stop! Stop right there!

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,520
Give me the antidote!

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,560
Give me the antidote!

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,880
It's so itchy!

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,520
Hurry up!

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,320
It's so itchy!
It's killing me.

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,960
It's so itchy!

20
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,720
It's so itchy!

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,960
Ke?

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
Ke?

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,320
-It's so itchy!
-Ke?

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,560
Ke?

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,920
It's so itchy!

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
Wu Yu, what's wrong with you?

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
I didn't do anything and
she just passed out.

28
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,880
It's so itchy! Man Yao!

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,480
Man Yao, save me!

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,120
It's so itchy!
I can't stand it anymore.

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,880
You pinched my face,

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
and now you are holding
the Princess' hand!

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Do that again and I will use
an even more powerful poison!

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,600
You are threatening me?

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,960
You'll pay after the effect wears off.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,760
Just you wait, you'll see!

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
-It's so itchy!
-Ke.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,600
Prince Chen is not the bad guy.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,720
He is my friend,
he doesn't mean you harm.

40
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,120
Why don't you give him the antidote?

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
He is your friend?

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,280
But this poison is newly brewed.

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
I don't have the antidote yet.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Don't worry, the effect will
wear off after a few hours.

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
What? A few hours?

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,520
Give me the antidote, now!

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
Fine.

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
-I lied just now.
-It's so itchy!

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
The Princess wants me to help you,

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,440
I will let it slide this time.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,080
Hurry up!

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Insolent girl! Apologise now!

53
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
Why should she apologise?

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,680
You disrespected her first.

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,920
I...

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes! Princess Rong Le,
you must help me out.

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
My brother told me not
to get disrespected by men.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Otherwise I will never get married.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,680
Don't be such a big head.
I am already in love with someone.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
I thought...

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,400
you would be frustrated
by Zhao Yun's marriage.

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
But seeing you are
laughing so gleefully,

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
you don't seem to need consolation.

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Zhao Yun?

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,320
I do feel better now.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
Fine.

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,960
I am a generous prince.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,800
I shall forgive you this time.

69
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,320
What do you mean you forgive me?
That should be my line!

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,360
You are getting all worked up!

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
Insolent girl, if it
wasn't for Man Yao,

72
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,200
I will make...

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,200
Stop talking.
Eat this snack.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,720
Ling Yue made them.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,760
This is Ke's favourite, right?

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Xiao Sha, why did Ke
pass out just now?

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
Ke suffers from a incurable sickness.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
She always faints without any reason.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
But isn't her master
the Lone Frost Sage?

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,440
Not even her can heal Ke's sickness?

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
It's not that.
My master is amazing.

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,160
But my sickness is so rare...

83
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,680
that my master spent her life
only to find one cure.

84
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
But she couldn't find one of
the herbs she needs.

85
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
That is her greatest regret.

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,480
Can't you cure yourself?

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,720
I was supposed to die
after five years old.

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
I shall live every day I can.

89
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,320
But my brother insists to
cure my illness.

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,240
But you fate on your side
to find the herbs.

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,560
It can't be helped.

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
This girl may look silly,

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,560
but what she said does make sense.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
The remedy requires the
Leave of Seven Locutions.

95
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,920
Leave of Seven Locutions?
Where do we find that?

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Leave of Seven Locutions?

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,400
-I think I know about it.
-Tell me what it is.

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,320
As long as we can cure Ke,

99
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
I am willing to do anything.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,160
I only know even if you find the herb,

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
it's hard to preserve it.

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,000
If you want an exact location of it,

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
you need to ask my brother.

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,760
See? You are just the same
as my brother.

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,320
You are clearly in love
but you can't face each other.

106
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,320
Very well, I can be on my way now.

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait.

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
Give this to your brother.

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,640
Wu You actually gave this to you?

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,360
Why? What does it mean?

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,080
This Inked-Jade Fan is
the greatest item for the Hidden Ones.

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
You can use it to deploy
the elites of Hidden Ones.

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,880
As long as you want it,

114
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,280
you can even overthrow
the entire kingdom.

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,200
Do you mean I can trade
this fan for the herb?

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
If my brother is willing to
give you this,

117
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,280
he will give you the
Leave of Seven Locutions.

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,360
But that leave means something
special for my brother.

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,440
If you really want the leave,

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,320
it wouldn't hurt to bow down for once.

121
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
Yun.

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,680
I am here for you.

123
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,280
I have made up my mind...

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,600
to lead the army against Wei.

125
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,240
I may be old,

126
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,280
but my spirit is still strong.

127
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,840
You can understand me, right?

128
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,240
As you watch from heaven,

129
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,720
I pray to you so the Northern Realm...

130
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
can thrive on forever.

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
We must win this war.

132
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,880
Wu You doesn't understand my pain.

133
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,920
But you,

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,960
you understand better than anyone.

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,840
In order to rebuild this nation,

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,440
I had to marry Fu Yuan.

137
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,200
You agree despite
the pain it caused you.

138
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,920
But I never thought...

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,440
my son would have such
a similar experience as ours.

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
I may be the ruler of this land,

141
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,520
but there are times when
I couldn't make the decision,

142
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,400
I felt so hopeless and helpless.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,080
My heart has been
filled with regret...

144
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
and it's been haunting me.

145
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
When Wu You...

146
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,720
brought that woman and
lock themselves up in here,

147
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
I wonder if they bothered your rest.

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,840
That day, I felt so furious...

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,440
but then I started to understand.

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,040
Rather than being mad at his mistake,

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,240
I should be mad at myself...

152
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,280
for not having the courage
he had that day.

153
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,680
The whole world is saying that...

154
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,240
I let Wu You do as he pleases.
But only I know...

155
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
the pain he has been
suffering all these years.

156
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,800
At night, the pain is so excruciating.

157
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,560
My mind is haunted by the nightmares.

158
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,520
He may have walked out
from the sorrow of past,

159
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,160
but he is shackled by love.

160
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,880
He can't love who he loves.

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,520
Yun.

162
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,600
What should I do...

163
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,080
to wipe away the pain in
Wu You's heart?

164
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,760
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

165
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,880
I am sorry but I cannot let you pass.

166
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,760
His Majesty is in Lady Yun's tomb.
I am ordered to keep watch here.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,080
No one can pass through there.

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,520
Thank you, Captain Xiang.

169
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,400
I shall wait here.

170
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
You should go home.

171
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,680
His Majesty spends hours in here.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
I don't know when he will come out.

173
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,320
Is Prince Li inside the tomb as well?

174
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Prince Chen told me to
wait for Prince Li at this place.

175
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,080
I am...

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
not at liberty to say anything.

177
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,840
I understand.

178
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,440
You can leave me be.

179
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
I shall wait here.

180
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,480
Every time I came to pay my respect,

181
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,440
it reminded me of my childhood.

182
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
My mother was gentle and kind.

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,560
She taught me about gratitude...

184
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
and kindness.

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
My father was merciful and generous.

186
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,320
He taught me how
to ride a horse and archery.

187
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,640
My teacher was a man of knowledge.

188
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
He taught me how
to be a good person.

189
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,680
Everything was perfect back then.

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,560
It made me feel like
the world is filled with light,

191
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,800
that darkness never existed.

192
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,440
But after the case
with Shilixiang Wine,

193
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,680
my mother was murdered.

194
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,040
My teacher's whole family
was executed.

195
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
Whatever happiness I had,

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,000
the same tragedy came right after.

197
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,960
This is a good wine.

198
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,480
The Shilixiang Wine from
Minister Qin's family...

199
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,880
is indeed amazing.

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,120
Your Majesty puts a lot of trust
in Yu Shi Hai and his men.

201
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,480
They go against Minister Qin's
reformation on every corner.

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
That also go against the
interest of Northern Realm.

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
Your Majesty,

204
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,360
now that you had their wine,

205
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,160
you should understand how
loyal Minister Qin is to you.

206
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
Your Majesty must never
suspect him again.

207
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Your Majesty!

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,680
Your Majesty, what happened?

209
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,760
I am feeling dizzy.

210
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,840
Let's get some rest.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
Come on.

212
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,840
Lie down.

213
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,960
Your Majesty.

214
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
Your Majesty?

215
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,360
-Help!
-This headache!

216
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,240
Your Majesty, I am calling
for the royal physician.

217
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,760
Someone, help!

218
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,760
Help!

219
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
Fu Yuan!

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,560
-Your Majesty!
-I will kill you!

221
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
I will kill you!

222
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
-Your Majesty!
-Fu Yuan!

223
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
Mother!

224
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
Yun?

225
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,240
-Your Majesty.
-Yun.

226
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,600
-Yun!
-Your Majesty.

227
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
Yun?

228
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,280
Yun?

229
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,880
Your Majesty.

230
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,520
Why?

231
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
Yun?

232
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,920
Yun!

233
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,560
I blamed you.

234
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,080
But I didn't blame you...

235
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,400
because of the crime you committed
after being drugged.

236
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
It's because...

237
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
you never face what you have done.

238
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,760
You keep making excuses
for your mistake.

239
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,000
I couldn't face your mother's death.

240
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,600
I always thought you are a coward.

241
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,720
I swear I will never be like you.

242
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,400
But when I locked myself
and Man Yao in here,

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,760
when I can never win her
heart no matter what I try,

244
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,920
I finally realised that...

245
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,760
loving someone doesn't mean...

246
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,680
you get to spend you life with her.

247
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
As we live,

248
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,560
there are moments
when nothing could be done.

249
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,760
Perhaps I don't have the right
to blame you.

250
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,120
After all, I weren't you...

251
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,000
and I know nothing about your reasons.

252
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,760
It's just like how the world...

253
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,320
never knew about my past with Man Yao.

254
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,440
Yet they insist to judge us
for what we did.

255
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,480
Wu You.

256
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
Does Rong Le...

257
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,400
really mean so much to you?

258
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,640
I know.

259
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,240
Your Majesty, Lady Rong Le is here.

260
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
She has been waiting for a long time.

261
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,920
Your Majesty.

262
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,960
Your Majesty.

263
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,760
Why are you here?

264
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Are you here for me or Wu You?

265
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,600
Tell me,

266
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,200
do you love Wu You?

267
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,000
If you do,

268
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
why did you choose
to marry General Fu?

269
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,200
If you don't,

270
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,600
why are you here for him again?

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,240
Your Majesty,

272
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,880
whether I love him or not,

273
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
for me, it's all in the past.

274
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,280
I came to Prince Li because
there is something...

275
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
that absolutely needed his help.

276
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,920
But how do you know...

277
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,080
all that happened...

278
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,880
are left in the past for him?

279
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,320
I wouldn't draw any conclusion
about His Highness' thought.

280
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,440
I only know to follow my heart.

281
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,320
A girl that made Wu You
fall in love so deeply...

282
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,200
will never be a woman of vile schemes.

283
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Fine.

284
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,640
I believe you.

285
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,160
You follow your heart
and know not to cross the line.

286
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
You are a smart person.

287
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,040
I hope you can see the big picture.

288
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Thank you for the teachings.

289
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,720
Very well.

290
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Go to Wu You if you want.

291
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,160
Be nice to him.

292
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,000
I owe him too much.

293
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,040
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

294
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,040
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

295
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,000
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

296
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,520
<i>to melt it.</i>

297
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,520
Your Highness.

298
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,200
The last time you are here...

299
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
was like a lifetime ago.

300
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
Those are memories of the past,

301
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,000
there is no need to bring it up.

302
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,640
This is my mother.

303
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,680
Mann Yao, will you pay your respect?

304
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,160
<i>I endure all the loneliness
just for you.</i>

305
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,480
<i>I will be your hearth in
the coldest of places.</i>

306
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,800
Don't you want to know why I am here?

307
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,960
I don't want to
and there is no need to.

308
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,640
Your Highness, I am...

309
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,280
There is no need to return
what I gave you.

310
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,800
<i>The winter may be cold, but I will
watch from afar and keep you warm.</i>

311
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,840
<i>I'm willing to wipe away
your blood and wounds for you.</i>

312
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,960
This was a meeting gift
from my mother.

313
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,680
Keep it.

314
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,240
See? I told you.

315
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,360
As long as you ask,
my brother will give you the leave.

316
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Why is the Leave of Seven Locution
inside Lady Yun's tomb?

317
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
When my brother was just a kid,

318
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
someone poisoned him.

319
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,520
Lady Yun went through a lot of hassle
to get this herb for him.

320
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,680
I don't know what happened back then.

321
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,760
But when my father heard about this,

322
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,800
he was mad at Lady Yun
for the first time.

323
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
He didn't talk to her
for three whole months.

324
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
This herb really is precious.

325
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,520
If this leave was used
to cleanse the poison,

326
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,640
why is it still kept here?

327
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,480
The leave was originally much thicker.

328
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,200
The poison can be cleanse
with just half of its fluid.

329
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
The other half was
too hard to preserve.

330
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,520
So it was kept inside the
ice chamber of the palace.

331
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,440
Then, my brother placed it
inside Lady Yun's tomb.

332
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,120
For my brother,

333
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,480
this leave represents
his mother's love for him.

334
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,680
This is the most precious belonging
she left for my brother.

335
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,520
I can't keep this herb.
It means too much to him.

336
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,920
You should take it.

337
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,280
Never mind.

338
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,600
Once this herb leaves the ice chamber,

339
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
it won't be easy to preserve it.

340
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,800
Since you are using it to save a life,
you should use it.

341
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't let my brother's
kindness go to waste.

342
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,480
After all, you mean the world to him.

343
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,480
I must ready the medicine for Ke.

344
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,600
Take it as Prince Li
is saving her life.

345
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,640
Man Yao.

346
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,480
This is not about my brother
saving Ke's life.

347
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,800
This is about his love for you.

348
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
Till the end of time,

349
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,320
he will always be there for you.

350
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,080
<i>Our hearts are lifetime apart.</i>

351
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,520
<i>No one was here for us.</i>

352
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
<i>How to we keep living this life?</i>

353
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,920
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

354
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,280
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

355
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,840
<i>We have thrown away the fate
that we got by chance.</i>

356
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,080
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes..</i>

357
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,120
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

358
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,640
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

359
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,080
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

360
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,400
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

361
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,560
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

362
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,840
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

363
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,320
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

364
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,040
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

365
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,960
<i>It never ends, love will fade.</i>

366
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,360
<i>The blossoms fall,
and I waited in silence.</i>

367
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,720
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

368
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,080
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

369
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,480
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

370
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,720
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

371
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,920
<i>We are not holding hands,
but you are holding my heart.</i>

372
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,720
Wu Yu, you can see yourself out.

373
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,360
I have other work to be done.

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,120
It's okay.
I am not in a hurry.

375
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,520
I recall I have something
to discuss with Lady Rong Le.

376
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,440
Please wait, Prince Chen.

377
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,800
I was simply passing by.

378
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
I'll be on my way now.

379
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,080
Man Yao, are you two...

380
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,480
Wu Yu.

381
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
You should go.

382
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,480
I wish to be alone.

383
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,720
Okay.

384
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,200
Ke, I did as you said...

385
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,040
and used the leave as remedy
along with your prescription.

386
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
I made sure the ingredients
are used perfectly.

387
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,240
You will get well after
you take this medicine.

388
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,280
-You will live a long life.
-Princess Rong Le.

389
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,120
I don't want a long life.

390
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
My master tried everything she could
to keep her beauty.

391
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
She wasted so much time on it.

392
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,360
If I have the time,
I should see the world...

393
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,560
and have all that
are delicious and fun.

394
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
So many people are
afraid of getting old...

395
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,200
and wanted to stay young.

396
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,440
Even a sage like your master
could escape from that fear.

397
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,560
But you are so innocent.

398
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,520
Time will never stop you
from doing anything.

399
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,720
Princess Rong Le.

400
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,480
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

401
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,960
You know it the best.

402
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,800
Your Highness saved our lives.

403
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,000
We will never able to
repay your kindness.

404
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,120
From now on,

405
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,880
I swear to follow Your Highness
to the day I die.

406
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,840
-I will never betray you.
-Please, get up.

407
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,200
Xiao Sha, I didn't save Ke to ask
for you to repay me.

408
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,600
Long Yue stayed loyal to the end.

409
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
I hope you can uphold
your loyalty as well.

410
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,800
I...

411
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,080
understand Your Highness.

412
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,640
Brother, why are you crying?
Let's go to the House of Fragrance.

413
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,720
Sir Xiao, are you still meddling
with the people there?

414
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,240
I do hate that place.

415
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,080
But the people there said...

416
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,400
men love to hangout at that place.

417
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,920
Ke, enough of this nonsense.

418
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,160
It's not nonsense.

419
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,000
I misunderstood.

420
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,040
Lady Rong Le.

421
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,040
You look absent-minded recently.

422
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,360
Is something bothering your mind?

423
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,960
I want to spend some time
living in the teahouse.

424
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,320
Ling Yue told me that...

425
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,400
you and General Fu are
having a cold relationship.

426
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,240
He should have known that...

427
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,840
ever since the attack by the lake,

428
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,680
all the false kindness and gentle
gestures he gave...

429
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,520
are all exposed.

430
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,880
But he couldn't face it.

431
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,800
He is trying to make up for it.

432
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,880
And now,

433
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,440
it seems like his pretentious love
has met its limit.

434
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,440
Lady, are you sure about this?

435
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
Just because you are angry,

436
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,720
this decision cannot be made lightly.

437
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,160
After you got used to this place
and the people here,

438
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,760
it won't be easy to
leave everything behind.

439
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,520
Keeping what should be deposed of
will cause more harm.

440
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,960
Chen Yu, I envy the life
you are having.

441
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,240
It's simple and plain.

442
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,280
You have no desires.

443
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,400
Right.

444
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,960
I keep having headache.

445
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,640
I keeping seeing flashes of memories.

446
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
They are so vague...

447
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,960
yet so real.

448
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,280
Ke said I might recover my memories.

449
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
I was thinking...

450
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,040
if these memories...

451
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,560
are reminding me that...

452
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,600
it's time to leave this place.

453
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,720
Lady, I owe my life to you.

454
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,000
If you are leaving,
please take me with you.

455
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,840
Princess Rong Le.

456
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,760
Miss Chen Yu, you are here too.

457
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,920
Princess, let me read your pulse.

458
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,480
Let's see if you are getting better.

459
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,280
Ke, can you do me a favour?

460
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,960
A person I know is hurt.

461
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,880
But he wouldn't let me see it
or let the others know.

462
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,040
Can you treat his wound for me?

463
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,680
The wound is at his shoulder.

464
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,760
There might be some
old injuries beneath it too.

465
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,800
I hate this kind of people.

466
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,920
A doctor needs to observe
the patient for diagnosis.

467
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,680
If he won't let anyone
see or touch him,

468
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,200
he clearly wants to die.

469
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
I am not going to help him.

470
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,920
I afraid he never wanted
to live a good life.

471
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,920
Otherwise...

472
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,600
he wouldn't get
himself hurt so easily.

473
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,560
Your Highness, you are all here.

474
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,640
-Miss Chen Yu.
-Ling Yue, just in time.

475
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,840
Can you take Ke to General Fu?

476
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,240
Tell him I sent her.

477
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,480
Let Ke tend to his wound.

478
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
General Fu is hurt?

479
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,520
How do you know? Didn't you...

480
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,880
Yes, I shall go right away.

481
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,040
Lady Rong Le, if you are
in a bad mood,

482
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,160
let me play you a song.

483
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,560
I learned every song in the
score you gave me.

484
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,280
Music calms the mind.

485
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
It might help you realise something.

486
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,480
I thank Your Majesty
for my grandmother.

487
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,280
As for the jade sculpture of
Long Life and Prosperity,

488
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,280
my grandmother placed it
at the main hall.

489
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
She prays to it every day.

490
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,960
Good. Ya Li, at ease.

491
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,440
Formality is not needed here.

492
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,240
Your mother was like a sister to me.

493
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,760
I see your grandmother as
my own since I was a child.

494
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,480
Now that her birthday is behind us,

495
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,560
what do you plan to do next?

496
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,120
I am waiting for a reply
from my father.

497
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,360
If his men come from the south,

498
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,960
I must return to Qingzhou.

499
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
I thought you finally saw it through.

500
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,520
But you are still mindless as ever.

501
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,120
The campaign will be launched soon.

502
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,120
His Majesty is in a good mood lately.

503
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Both you and Wu You
are in the capital.

504
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,120
Allow me to be your witness...

505
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,720
and grant you two the marriage.

506
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,640
You won't need to
return to Qingzhou...

507
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
and you may stay
by my side all the time.

508
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
I thank Your Majesty
for the kind offer.

509
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,760
But Prince Li...

510
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,960
Ever since the proposal
from Prince Zhen Bei of Chen,

511
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,360
the two of us haven't met.

512
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,680
Really?

513
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,760
I heard...

514
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,360
Wu You and the General's wife
have a suspicious relationship.

515
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,320
Was it my mistake...

516
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,080
for letting them meet
each other again?

517
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,120
This has nothing to do
with Your Majesty.

518
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,160
I do share a friendship with
Lady Rong Le.

519
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,080
I know she is not the kind of person.

520
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,440
When Zhao Yun got married,

521
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,720
both she and I kept
Zhao Yun company in the inn.

522
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,200
She kept her distance from Prince Li.

523
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,520
What?

524
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,960
They met at the inn?

525
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Ya Li, fear not.
I will speak for you.

526
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,880
I must severe all of their past ties.

527
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
I won't allow that woman
to ruin Wu You's future...

528
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,200
and your marriage.

529
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,200
But Prince Li is...

530
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,360
With his temper, we can't
force him to do anything.

531
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,000
It's all right.
I won't work on Wu You.

532
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,400
Guards, ready the sedan
to the General's Manor.

533
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,640
Yes.

534
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,400
-Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

535
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,160
-At ease.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,240
I have some free time with me today.

537
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,120
I can go to General Fu's
manor with you...

538
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,400
and show my caring to the General.

539
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,920
-Your Majesty, I was...
-Enough chatter.

540
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,120
Ready the sedan to General Fu's manor.

541
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,720
Yes.

542
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,120
The General Fu is not
seeing anyone. Get lost!

543
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,440
Bad guys.
You are all bad guys!

544
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,000
The man inside is even worse!

545
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,080
Lady Rong Le asked me to
tend to his wound.

546
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,880
But he sent his dogs on me.

547
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,080
What did you say?

548
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,360
I said, he set his
watch dogs loose on me!

549
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,040
Ke, are you all right?

550
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
I am fine.

551
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,840
What about you?
Are you all right?

552
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,040
I am fine.

553
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,640
But General Fu is...

554
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,480
He needs more than
medicine for his heart.

555
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
The Princess couldn't
get him the cure.

556
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,240
Ke, we might as well
just leave him be.

557
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,840
Let's go.

558
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Brother.

559
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
The Princess herself is ill,

560
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,600
why would she care about
another person's life?

561
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Ke.

562
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,560
Everyone in this world has
their own way of living.

563
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
For the Princess,
if someone helped her,

564
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,600
she will do her best to repay them.

565
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,440
She did the same for us.

566
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,760
Right, Ke. Didn't you say
you have a cure for the Princess?

567
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,960
Yes. I will give it my all
to save her life.

568
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,680
Miss Ling Yue, can you please
tell me about her condition?

569
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,680
Chen Yu.

570
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,160
I feel like...

571
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,680
playing a lute wasn't so hard at all.

572
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,040
Judging by the way you played it,

573
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,840
perhaps you knew how
to play it back in the days.

574
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,600
I am glad you are here to
keep me company and cheer me up.

575
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
What is taking Ling Yue
and the others so long?

576
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,400
Did Ke get herself into trouble again?

577
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,440
I am worried.
I should go check on her.

578
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,480
His Majesty arrives!

579
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
I didn't know Your Majesty
and the Empress are visiting.

580
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,080
I apologise for not
welcoming Your Majesty.

581
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,400
Lady Rong Le, at ease.

582
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,840
While we were having a conversation,

583
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
I thought about you.

584
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
His Majesty is in the mood...

585
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,440
wanted to pay General Fu a visit.

586
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,600
He won't let anyone inform you,
so we came uninvited.

587
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,000
I hope you are not offended.

588
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,480
At your service, Your Majesty
and the Empress.

589
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,840
Greetings, Miss Sun.

590
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,400
At ease, General Fu.

591
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

592
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,640
My wife came from a foreign country.

593
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,760
She never welcomed
Your Majesty here.

594
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,120
If there was any lack of manner,

595
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,520
I am willing to take
the punishment for her.

596
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,920
I was suddenly in the mood
to pay you a visit.

597
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,520
Your wife showed us good manner,

598
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,040
befitting that of a noble.

599
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,920
She didn't cause you any trouble.

600
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,200
Recently, there are
some rumours in the palace.

601
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,560
Rumour has it General Fu
and Lady Rong Le...

602
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,200
are having a cold relationship.

603
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,800
Now that I see it for myself,

604
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,760
you two have great respect
for each other,

605
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,440
a loving couple indeed.

606
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,800
It seems to me
those rumours are all lies.

607
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,440
Your Majesty is right.

608
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,360
The matters between
husband and wife...

609
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,120
can only be known by
the couple themselves.

610
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,480
Besides, the matter of my family...

611
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,320
is not something an outsider...

612
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
should judge us for.

613
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,800
After the parting at the inn,
how are you, Lady Rong Le?

614
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,600
Thank you, Miss Ya Li.
I am fine.

615
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,240
If you are feeling unwell,

616
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
continue as always.
Formality is not needed here.

617
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,560
Have your seats.

618
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,120
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Yes.

619
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,520
I heard the melodies
of a lute just now.

620
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,360
It seems like Lady Rong Le
is feeling very well.

621
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,960
You have quite the
quality time in your life.

622
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,280
General Fu has great skills
when it comes to music.

623
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,960
It's known by all.

624
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,000
Can you play a song together?

625
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,000
I haven't had any song
in such a long time.

626
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,800
I wouldn't dare to make a scene here.

627
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,000
The song from earlier
was just part of the learning.

628
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,000
I am just a beginner,
I am no expert in this.

629
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,680
If Lady Rong Le insists,

630
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,920
we shouldn't make it hard for her.

631
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,800
Perhaps I can play a song?

632
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,040
I know you learned from the master
musician since your childhood.

633
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,720
You have great talent for music.

634
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,360
Why don't we let Ya Li
present a song for us?

635
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,920
Let us witness her marvellous music.

636
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,440
I apologise. I wouldn't want
to disrespect the hosts.

637
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
I have an idea.

638
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,440
Maybe General Fu can start playing.

639
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,080
I can play to his accompaniment.

640
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,360
Together, we can present
Your Majesty a song.

641
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,640
Good. I have only ever heard about
General Fu's talent in music.

642
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,680
But I have never seen it in person.

643
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
Your Majesty.

644
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,080
General Fu is an officer
with high rank.

645
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,320
He cannot lower himself
to be a mere performer.

646
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,600
His hands are supposed to
wield swords and slay our enemies.

647
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,120
Even if he is playing the lute,
a proper ceremony is needed.

648
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,960
He cannot play music for the sake
of mere entertainment.

649
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,480
Lady Rong Le, you won't agree
to any suggestions.

650
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,240
That is rude of you.

651
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,240
Don't you have any respect
for the Emperor and me?

652
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,800
Your Majesty, please calm down.

653
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,320
I hope Miss Ya Li would play for us.

654
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,440
I may just be a beginner,

655
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,560
but I am willing to play
to her accompaniment.

656
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,880
Very well.

657
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,480
I have heard about how crude
and rude the people of Qi are.

658
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,560
They pay no attention
to manners at all.

659
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,560
But to witness the music played
by a lady from Western Qi...

660
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,120
could be rather interesting.

661
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,080
The people of Western Qi live
on a barren land.

662
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,520
They learn about farming
and martial art...

663
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,360
in order to keep the land safe.

664
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,920
Compared to them,

665
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,040
I am but a noble that
contributed nothing to the land.

666
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,000
I learn to play a lute
because of interest.

667
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
I have no right to speak for them.

668
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,400
I live in a foreign land and had
no choice but to please the lords.

669
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,800
You...

670
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,120
What you said just now...

671
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,560
does carry the courage of turning down
Prince Li at the main hall.

672
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,600
A pearl may be cover in dust,

673
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,120
but the shines will never fade.

674
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,600
Much appreciated, Your Majesty.

675
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,080
Miss Ya Li, if you may.
