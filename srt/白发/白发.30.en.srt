00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
Episode 30

3
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
In order to have the upper hand,

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,040
I've decided to attack them first.

5
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,880
And this time,
I'll lead the troops myself.

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,960
You can't do that, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,760
It's a long journey to Wei.

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,680
The battlefield is dangerous
and unpredictable.

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,200
You are the master of this country.

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,640
You can't just go into war.

11
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,160
Sir Yang is right.
Please reconsider your decision.

12
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,000
Please reconsider your decision!

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,320
I've already made up my mind.
No need to advise me against it.

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
For the war this time,

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,320
I'll bring along a
right-hand man with me.

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,320
Father, I recommend Wu You.

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,960
Wu You has studied hard since young
and is an expert in the art of war.

18
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,400
If you bring Wu You along,
you'll gain a speedy success.

19
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm willing to go into war
to be of service as well.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,360
Please allow me to do so.

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,680
No, father. Although Wu You
is good in the art of war,

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
he lacks experience in an actual war,
rather than bringing him along,

23
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,200
it's better to bring along a general
who has fought countless battle.

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,240
Please reconsider.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,520
If so, in your opinion,

26
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,520
who will be the best choice?

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Father, I recommend...

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,440
Father,

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,160
I've been out from military affairs
for too long.

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,520
I don't know about the conditions
of our generals.

31
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,760
How about you ask General Fu
for his opinion?

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Your Majesty,

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
I think that...

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,400
Prince Chen is very right.

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,680
Prince Li is an expert
in the art of war.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,760
And he had led the war
in the southern fringe.

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,520
And he knows the situations of
every wars like the back of his hand.

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
He's a fast learner.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
I feel inadequate compared to him.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
So I think,

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,680
it's best to bring along Prince Li...

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,280
for the war this time.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,800
Even General Fu has
recommended Prince Li.

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
Alright.

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,920
Wu You, you'll come along with me
for the war against Wei.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm not willing to.

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
I already said that...

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,800
we need to pacify the people first
before we attacks others.

49
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Now, there are pirates running wild
along the coast.

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,200
Western Qi and Chen
are eyeing us covetously.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
We suffer from natural continuous
calamity and we are out of money.

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
The south-west region is
in a state of famine.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
We have both domestic
and foreign troubles.

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,800
It's better for us if we wait
until we are strong again...

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,240
and our people are well-rested
and are in unity.

56
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,120
Only then can we
send out our troops...

57
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,840
to bring peace to our country.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
Nonsense. Northern Realm...

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,000
has enjoyed propitious weather
and good harvest constantly.

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,360
The people are living peacefully
and we are in unity.

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,960
We don't have calamity.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,240
And we don't have domestic unrest
or famine problem.

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,200
What nonsense it is. Guards!

64
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,520
Prince Li has disobeyed my order.
The war is almost upon us.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
He has exaggerated things
to cause alarm to the people.

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,560
Throw him out.

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
You sit in your precious palace
all year long and you have...

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
no regards for the
people's sufferings.

69
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,200
You just know how to praise yourself
and try to cheat the people.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
My teacher was right back then.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
People like you will never
be a brilliant emperor.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,040
Insolent fool! How dare you say that
I'm not a brilliant emperor?

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,920
Unfilial son.

74
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
You are indeed the
best student of Qin Yong.

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,720
You never listen to me.

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,880
He has gone for so many years.

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,400
But you still remember each
and every words he uttered.

78
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
Why are you standing there for?
Throw him out!

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
No need!

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,320
I've never wanted to be here
in the first place.

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,640
From now on, don't think that
I'll ever come back again!

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
You!

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Get lost! Go back
to your southern fringe!

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,040
Don't come back every again!

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,760
-Father, Wu You is just...
-Shut up!

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
I'll throw you out
if you say another word.

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
Please calm down.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,400
Since Wu You is not willing
to go into war with you,

89
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,080
I would like to recommend
General of Defence to go with you.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
General Fu is very experienced in
battlefield and has never lost in one.

91
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,960
He can help you achieve victory.

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,320
We'll go with Prince Fan Yang's
advice then.

93
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,120
General Fu.
Get yourself prepared immediately.

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,880
You'll come along with me
for the war in three days' time.

95
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,680
When I'm in war,

96
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,440
all public affairs...

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,840
will be handled by the crown prince
with Prince Chen as assistant.

98
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
The court is dismissed.

99
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,120
Thank you, father.

100
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,840
Farewell, Your Majesty!

101
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,440
I heard that...

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,600
you are tagging along with him
for the war against Wei.

103
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
He had moved 300,000 soldiers from
all over the place to join the war...

104
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,400
except my Armour Troops.

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,640
He ordered me to go into war
with him on my own.

106
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
Of course I know...

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
the real reason behind his action.

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,440
Looks like we have to
move our plan forward.

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,800
We've waited for so many years.
Finally, we have our chance.

110
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
When do you plan to make a move?

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
The entire plan is in my head.

112
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,280
I know what to do.
As for you,

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,160
you just need to act
according to my orders.

114
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,560
Hen Xiang told me that you want
to change your plan for a woman.

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,640
Is it true?

116
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
We have been planning
for many years...

117
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,160
to get this far.

118
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,560
Victory is in sight.

119
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,600
We have to go with the plan.

120
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
I address you as Uncle Lin...

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
because you are my mother's...

122
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,920
most loyal servant.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,680
You've saved me before.

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,560
And you've taken great pains
to teach and train me.

125
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,800
The bone-piercing pain that
I suffered every year...

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,120
is a burning reminder of
my mother's hatred.

127
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,280
They are burnt into my mind.

128
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,560
But I want to remind you.

129
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,360
You are just an assistant to
help me complete this revenge.

130
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
As for the how,

131
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,120
it's entirely up to me.

132
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,680
Looks like you have
deep hatred against me.

133
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,480
I wasn't trying to make
the decision for you.

134
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm just reminding you that...

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
our master has been...

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,680
waiting for too long in the dark.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,160
Don't worry.

138
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,840
For those who've hurt my mother,

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,320
I'll make them pay
a terrible price for it.

140
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
Good.

141
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
This is the Young Master that I know.

142
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Only by doing so,

143
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,280
can you repay our master who had
suffered in order to protect you.

144
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,080
If we want to take revenge,

145
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,960
we have to get rid of
Zongzheng Wu You.

146
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,560
Rong Le is his biggest weakness.

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
Only by using her,

148
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,040
can we make sure that
nothing will go wrong.

149
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't need to use Rong Le...

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,040
to get rid of Zongzheng Wu You.

151
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
Is that so?

152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,760
From the surface,
you are in an advantage.

153
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,960
But Zongzheng Wu You's strength
lurks in the shadow.

154
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
If you want to fight him in the open,

155
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,520
you'll ruin the plan...

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,720
that we've spent so many years on.

157
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,480
You have always been
the illegitimate son...

158
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,800
who lives in darkness.

159
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
Why do you want to
fight him in the open?

160
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you think that...

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
Rong Le will like you by doing so?

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Stop dreaming.

163
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,160
As long as Zongzheng Wu You lives,

164
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,600
you won't stand a chance.

165
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,040
Go.

166
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
Go and feel...

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,880
the bone-piercing pain that
your mother had once suffered from.

168
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
Remember that suffering...

169
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,560
and you'll remember your identity.

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,920
At the same time,
it'll clear your mind.

171
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,240
Guards!

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,360
Young Master.

173
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,120
Master, Young Master
had done nothing wrong.

174
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,000
Why do you want to punish him again?

175
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,240
Hen Xiang.

176
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,680
You've healed so quickly
in such a short time?

177
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Don't think that I know nothing
just because you kept it a secret.

178
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,480
In order to save Rong Le,

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Young Master had hurt
one of his own seriously.

180
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,800
And he tried to change the plan.

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,720
I know everything.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,240
How did you know...

183
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,160
when I've never told you about it?

184
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,840
Since you are already hurt,

185
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,920
I won't punish you today.

186
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,960
But remember.

187
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm the one who saved you
from the gate of hell.

188
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
I taught you martial arts...

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,920
and trained you into
a remarkable assassin.

190
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,320
You like Young Master.

191
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,720
I don't mind it if you want to
keep his secrets for him.

192
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,760
But if it'll affect the
plan of our revenge,

193
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,160
I...

194
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,840
will not forgive you easily.

195
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
I won't dare to do so.

196
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,280
In order to initiate this plan sooner,

197
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,080
I have a task for you.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,280
Disguise yourself as Rong Le...

199
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,560
No.

200
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,360
No. I can't do that.

201
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
-I can't do that.
-Only by doing so,

202
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,920
will you able to avenge your family.

203
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,120
Maybe after that,

204
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,480
you'll have a chance to
marry the person you like.

205
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,720
-Two birds in one stone.
-I can't do that.

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,400
You already know about my plan.

207
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
If you are not going to do it,

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,160
then I can't let you live.

209
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,120
Guards.

210
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,360
-Take her out!
-Let go of me.

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,280
You can't kill me now.

212
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,680
I need to help Young Master
control the crown prince.

213
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,120
If I die now,

214
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,080
it'll affect his plan for revenge.
He won't forgive you for that.

215
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,760
He's just a useless crown prince.

216
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,920
It's not that hard...

217
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,240
to control him.

218
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,880
Let me tell you truthfully, Hen Xiang.

219
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,640
I've already planned this...

220
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,640
for quite some time.

221
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,240
If you don't want to do it,

222
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,280
there will be others to do it.

223
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,840
Rather than letting others do it,

224
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,160
it's better for you to do it instead.

225
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
Brother,

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
although Fu Chou will be
joining you in the war,

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,360
his Armour Troops is still
here in Zhongshan.

228
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,240
And there is a sudden influx
of refugees to the city.

229
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,840
I think that something
is not right with it.

230
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,360
Would you reconsider to delay the war?

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,240
We have the Royal Army here.

232
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
I'll leave behind a secret decree.

233
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,920
If something is amiss
with the Armour Troops,

234
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,120
the Royal Army will be
under Wu Yu's command.

235
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
Besides, the generals
of the Armour Troops...

236
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,080
are under the close surveillance
of Wu You.

237
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,920
There won't be any problems.

238
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,680
As for the refugees,

239
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,200
something is not right with it indeed.

240
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,840
Wu You will take care of it.

241
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Wu You?

242
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,160
He was already banished
from this city by you, right?

243
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,880
The date for war is already set.

244
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,600
We'll agitate our soldiers
if we delay it again.

245
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,960
We can't change our plan
for the war against Wei.

246
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,640
What about crown prince?

247
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,600
When Fu Chou is gone,
crown prince can't much alone.

248
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,280
He's under Wu Yu's surveillance.

249
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,360
And Wu You won't be too
far away from Zhongshan...

250
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,600
to give them a loophole to exploit.

251
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Wu You!

252
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
Wu You.

253
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,280
This is not for me.

254
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,760
Are you really going to go back
to southern fringe at times like this?

255
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,400
Today, father said those words
in a fit of rage.

256
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,280
Don't take it to your heart.

257
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Besides, are you really not going
to join father in the war?

258
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,880
If you go with him and
come back with victory,

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,720
you'll be welcomed by the officials
and cheered by the people.

260
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,960
And everyone will forget about
Fu Chou's contributions.

261
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
When that time comes, naturally,
you'll hold the military power.

262
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Why did you refuse to do
this kind of beneficial thing?

263
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
I...

264
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,200
Did I say something wrong again?

265
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,560
You might be right if you tell me...

266
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,560
about this one year ago.

267
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,520
That time, Fu Chou was still
at the frontier pass...

268
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,760
and didn't have real power
in the court yet.

269
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,920
But now, Fu Chou
has expanded his clique...

270
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,960
and he has ganged up
with crown prince.

271
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,360
Besides, he's cooperating
with Rong Qi,

272
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,960
the emperor of Western Qi in secret.

273
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,720
All the generals in the Armour Troops
are his trusted aides.

274
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,960
If I join the war together
with father now...

275
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,920
with only crown prince and Fu Chou
in command of the capital,

276
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,680
what do you think will happen?

277
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,200
Are you saying that they'll revolt?

278
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,440
Crown prince is not that brave.

279
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
He is not.

280
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,560
But Fu Chou is.

281
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,640
Wu You. Since you've already known,
why did you fight with father then?

282
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,480
I get it now.
Both of you did it on purpose.

283
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,040
No. What happened today...

284
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,440
is just a show that you've
planned together with father, right?

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,040
I'm just afraid that
Fu Chou won't be...

286
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,040
so easily fooled like the others.

287
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,880
Impossible that he'll go against order
to stay out from the war.

288
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Father has left you in the capital
to spy on crown prince anyway.

289
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,520
Make sure to keep a close eye on him.

290
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,760
About that, I was still puzzled about
why father trusted me so much...

291
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,160
to let me help crown prince
with the public affairs.

292
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
So, he wants me to keep watch
on the crown prince.

293
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,440
Now, there are more and
more refugees in the city.

294
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Find a way to lure them
out to the city.

295
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,800
Open up more food relief centres
and give out food all day long.

296
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,960
Keep a close eye on the
response of the refugees.

297
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
If you see someone suspicious,

298
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,680
find a reason to lock them up
for interrogation.

299
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,680
But don't use force.

300
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,840
I understand.

301
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,640
Wu You, don't you have anything else
for me to help out with?

302
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,960
For example, Man Yao?

303
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,560
Don't make things difficult for her.

304
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,520
I wouldn't dare to do so.
She is the one you like.

305
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,760
When I'm not here, look out for her.

306
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,760
If there's anything,

307
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
report to me at once.

308
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,760
Alright. I get it.

309
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,760
This way please, generals.

310
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
<i>The Royal Army?</i>

311
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
This way please.

312
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,000
Princess Rong Le, take this medicine.

313
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,640
Although it's just a supplement,

314
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,760
at least it can replenish your energy.

315
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,560
-Thank you.
-Princess.

316
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
-Actually, His Majesty...
-Don't mention about him.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,440
If he so much thinks of me
as his sister,

318
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,560
he won't try to control me
with poison.

319
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
He even lied to me saying that
it's the aftereffect of my escape.

320
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,960
The cure that he gave me...

321
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,480
can only suppress the effect
of the poison temporarily.

322
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,640
It can't neutralise the poison at all.
If I beg him now,

323
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
I'll be his string puppet for sure
to do his bidding forever.

324
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,280
I don't want that.

325
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
Maybe...

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
you won't be controlled forever.

327
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,920
After we get the medicine,
Xiao Ke can study about it.

328
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,560
If she can find the original
prescription for the poison,

329
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,560
she might be able to find a cure.

330
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,160
-He's right.
-Princess, I realised that...

331
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,920
many people are led into...

332
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,760
the general's studies by Chang Jian
for a secret discussion.

333
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Among them are the generals
from the army.

334
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
And they are wearing...

335
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,720
-the plates of the Royal Army.
-Royal Army?

336
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,200
The Royal Army answers to His Majesty.
Why are they here with Fu Chou?

337
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,560
I don't know.

338
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,760
Recently,
that place is heavily guarded.

339
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,840
It's hard for me to spy on them.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,360
War against Wei is
going to start soon.

341
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,320
What is the reason for Fu Chou
to meet these generals...

342
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,160
in secret?

343
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,280
I have to get into his studies.

344
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,120
Xiao Sha, go back to Western Qi
to get the medicine.

345
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,440
Tell my brother that
I'm at the death door.

346
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,440
If he still wants me to work for him,

347
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
-give me the cure immediately.
-Roger that.

348
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,680
-Be careful.
-Alright.

349
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Why are you here?

350
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm here to get some food
from the kitchen.

351
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,720
General's Manor is so strange.

352
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,760
Why are there so many people
guarding the kitchen?

353
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,520
This is General's Fu studies.
Nobody can come near it. Leave now.

354
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,080
This is a study room?
It's not the kitchen?

355
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,880
Then, do you know
where the kitchen is?

356
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,760
I'm starved.

357
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,320
It's that way.
Leave at once.

358
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,120
That way?

359
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,920
Leave now.

360
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,360
What happened to you? Wake up!

361
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,240
<i>The candle in the manor
is changed every day.</i>

362
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,600
<i>From the stub,</i>

363
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,920
<i>they must be here for the whole night.</i>

364
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,720
<i>Fu Chou knows how to play zither only.</i>

365
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,000
<i>When did he learn
how to play the flute?</i>

366
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
" Zhongshan City "

367
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,920
<i>Distribution map for armed forces.</i>

368
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,040
-General Fu.
-General Fu.

369
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,320
Princess Rong Le.

370
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,480
" Granary "

371
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,320
" Armoury "

372
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,880
" Prince Li's army "

373
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,240
General Fu!

374
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,680
-What is it?
-Lady Rong Le has fainted.

375
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,640
What?

376
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
" Tranquil Garden "

377
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
Rong Le.

378
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Rong Le.

379
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,800
Rong Le.

380
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
-What happened?
-General Fu.

381
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't know why
but she fainted suddenly...

382
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
and she hasn't been awake since.

383
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,600
Princess Rong Le fainted because
of her worries that made her ill.

384
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,880
General Fu. We need to get her
the medicine at once.

385
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,400
Or else, if she continues to sleep,

386
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,280
her body might be damaged
and she might never wake again.

387
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,080
What kind of medicine you need?

388
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,200
This kind of herb grows only
in deep mountains.

389
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,480
It's very rare, valuable and
only I can recognise it.

390
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,880
Let me out. I'll get the herb
for Princess Rong Le now.

391
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,560
Wait.

392
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,280
If you go out,

393
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
who will take care of my wife?

394
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
How about this?

395
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,360
Write down the name of the herb.

396
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,720
I'll send someone to get it.

397
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,680
I already said. It's a rare herb
and only I can recognise it.

398
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,200
General Fu, let Xiao Ke go.

399
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,560
Just write it down for me.

400
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,120
There are so many
physicians in the city.

401
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,040
Even if they don't know,

402
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
we still have the royal physicians
from the palace.

403
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,520
Take good care of Lady Rong Le.

404
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,560
Don't always think about
escaping from here.

405
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,360
Outside is not a safer place
compared to here.

406
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
Remember.

407
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,040
All lands belong to His Majesty.

408
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,920
And all soldiers are our men.

409
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,520
Even if you manage to go out
from this door, you might not...

410
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,840
be able to survive the outside world.

411
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,040
Maybe this is...

412
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,120
the safest place for you to be in.

413
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,280
Ling Yue. Get me a piece of
white handkerchief now.

414
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,840
Your Highness, General of Defence
wants to meet you.

415
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,320
Why is he here?

416
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I'm not going to meet him.

417
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
He said that he has a
very important gift for you.

418
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,920
What can he give me?

419
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,520
-Bring him in.
-Yes, Your Highness.

420
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,960
Greetings, crown prince.

421
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,840
Aren't you going to join
my father in the war?

422
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,800
Do you still have time for me?

423
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,920
From the way you say it,

424
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,520
looks like you are still mad at me...

425
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
for the incident at
the court yesterday.

426
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
I wouldn't dare to be mad at you.

427
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,720
It's fine that Wu Yu recommend him.

428
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,520
But how can you recommend him as well?

429
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,840
What do you mean by that?

430
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
If Wu You is victorious,
he'll hold the military power.

431
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,120
What good will it do to you?

432
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,000
Luckily, father is wise...

433
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
and banished Wu You
to the southern fringe.

434
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,720
Or else, there will be no place
for me in this court anymore.

435
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,360
What are you laughing at?

436
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,800
Do you think that His Majesty
will bring Prince Li along...

437
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,320
to fight in the war just
because I recommended him?

438
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,720
Do you really think that...

439
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,760
Prince Li has disobeyed the order...

440
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,520
and by making His Majesty mad,

441
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,840
they'll turn against each other
from now on...

442
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,760
and your position as
crown prince will be secured?

443
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,400
If you really think so,
then you are too naive.

444
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,040
It's such a miracle that you are able
to sit on this position...

445
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
as crown prince for so long.

446
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,800
What do you mean by that?

447
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
That day, in the court,

448
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,680
the fight that His Majesty
and Prince Li had...

449
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,840
was just a show they made...

450
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,920
in order to fool you.

451
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,200
Do you really believe it?

452
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Just now, you asked me
why am I laughing.

453
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,720
I'm laughing...

454
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,520
because you are already
under the guillotine...

455
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,560
and you are in imminent danger.

456
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,880
But you are still drinking
your celebratory wine here.

457
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,120
Do you really think that
it's a good thing...

458
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,120
for me to go out for war
while Prince Li is here?

459
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,800
Don't you know that...

460
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,920
it'll be our death warrant?

461
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,000
What did you say?

462
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,920
Father has left Wu You behind
to finish me off?

463
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,000
Impossible. Don't try to scare me.

464
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,640
If you don't believe me,

465
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,600
then don't blame me when your head
is on the ground one day.

466
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,760
Please wait!

467
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,040
General Fu.

468
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,000
You are right.

469
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Their fight was too sudden that day.

470
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,040
Father didn't even punish Wu You
when he rejected...

471
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,960
the marriage in public back then.

472
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,440
This time, why are they
in such a fit...

473
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,640
just because of some disagreements?

474
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,440
But what is the purpose of this show
between my father and Wu You?

475
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,320
If father wants to kill me, he doesn't
need to put in so much trouble.

476
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,160
He even entrusts me with the country.

477
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,840
That's the most vital step
in their plan.

478
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,280
You are chosen as crown prince...

479
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,360
because Lady Yun is in debt
with your mother.

480
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,800
But this kind of loving-kindness
will burn out eventually.

481
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,640
Prince Li used to be
very tolerant to you.

482
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,320
Now, he treats you worse than
he treats a stranger.

483
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,920
Same goes for His Majesty.

484
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,120
Ever your failed in
the war against Wei,

485
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,520
His Majesty has been wanting
to strip you of your position.

486
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,440
I think you know this
better than anyone.

487
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,880
Otherwise, you won't hire
the Creed of Vengeance...

488
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,760
to assassinate Prince Li at all cost.

489
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
Continue.

490
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,920
He needs a reason to
strip you of your position.

491
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,640
He can't do it without any reason.

492
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,440
All these years,
you've done your duty well.

493
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,280
And you haven't done
any major mistakes.

494
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,960
Even if you did, His Majesty...

495
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
has no solid proof about it.

496
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,720
If he wants to strip you
of your position,

497
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
he has to find...

498
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,480
a concrete reason to do so.

499
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,320
What kind of reason?

500
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,040
His Majesty knows that...

501
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,680
we have ganged up
with each other in secret.

502
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,640
That's why he'll put on this show...

503
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,320
to make sure that I have no choice
but to join him in war.

504
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,040
His real purpose...

505
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,400
is to separate us and
attack us one by one.

506
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I have to join His Majesty for the war
without my Armour Troops.

507
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,680
He falsely banished Prince Li...

508
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,320
so that he can go back to southern
fringe to send his troops here.

509
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,320
He asked you to take care
of the nation with Prince Chen's help.

510
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,520
If you put it nicely, it's help.
But he's actually here to spy on you.

511
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,280
If something is amiss,

512
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,120
you'll be labelled as a rebel.

513
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,880
And by then,

514
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,920
Prince Li will send
his army into the city.

515
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,320
You won't even have
the chance to explain.

516
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,960
-I...
-And you'll die in vain and in unjust.

517
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,360
Then I'll do nothing so that they
won't have a reason to kill me.

518
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,520
It's still be the same
whether you do it or not.

519
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,040
All of them has spent
so much effort to set this trap.

520
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,360
They won't let you get away easily.

521
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,800
If I'm not wrong,

522
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,120
someone must be working for
His Majesty in the Armour Troops.

523
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,720
They'll make trouble in your name.

524
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,000
When that time comes, you'll be dead.

525
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
And I won't fare any better than you.

526
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Father is so ruthless.

527
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,920
General Fu.

528
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,400
You have to save me, General!

529
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,000
No. We are on the same boat.

530
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,400
Saving me means
saving yourself, General.

531
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,880
What should we do?

532
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,080
No need to panic.

533
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,600
I'm here today to do exactly that.

534
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
This...

535
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
What do you mean by this?

536
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,960
Now, nobody else can save us.

537
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,760
We are the only one who
can save ourselves.

538
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,520
We are our own salvation.

539
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,880
Are you saying that...

540
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,520
we should rebel for real?

541
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,840
Please think carefully, Crown Prince.

542
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
This is the only way...

543
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,920
for both of us to survive this.

544
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,400
No.

545
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,320
You said it yourself. Father has
planned this out so meticulously.

546
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,000
We won't succeed.

547
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,480
We won't if it's just you alone.

548
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,000
But I already told you.

549
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm doing this to save myself too.

550
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,200
How confident you are?

551
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,920
If it fails,

552
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,880
it'll be a done deal for us.

553
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,680
We are done for anyway.

554
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,520
Since we will be dead anyway...

555
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,880
and we'll be labelled as rebels,

556
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,800
why not we take a risk
to save our lives?

557
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,560
If we want to get
the things we desire,

558
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,960
we have to pay for it.

559
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,040
What is your desire?

560
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,560
When you wear this dragon robe...

561
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,240
and sit on that almighty dragon chair,

562
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,560
you'll know what to do.

563
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,200
I just hope that when the time comes,

564
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,200
you'll be kind to me.

565
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,760
Alright.

566
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Since you've proposed this,

567
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
I'm sure that you've already
had a plan in mind.

568
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,840
I believe in you.

569
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,320
As long as you can help me
become the emperor,

570
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,120
I promise you,

571
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,720
aside from the throne,
I can give you...

572
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
whatever you desire.

573
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,640
I'll take my leave then.

574
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,880
Your Majesty.

575
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,640
This is such a handsome robe.

576
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
It's way better than any other robes
that you have.

577
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,880
I can't wait...

578
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
to see your dashing appearance...

579
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,080
in this robe while you stand
in front of the Xuande Hall...

580
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,960
to receive your support and love
from the officials and the people.

581
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Xiang.

582
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Xiang.

583
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,240
I've waited so long for this day.

584
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,160
I've had enough of this crown prince
title which is all name and no power.

585
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,720
Xiang.

586
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,720
How long have you known General Fu?

587
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,960
What kind of a person he is?

588
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,760
I didn't know him for long.

589
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,680
He is...

590
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,720
a gentle...

591
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,200
and modest gentleman.

592
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,640
Why did you ask me this suddenly?

593
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,120
Could it be that you are suspicious...

594
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,000
about General Fu?

595
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,800
Suspicious?

596
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,720
How could I suspect General Fu?

597
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,920
General Fu is my
most trusted ally now.

598
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,320
I'm counting on him...

599
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,360
to make me into an emperor.

600
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,240
That's right.

601
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
It's good that you understand.

602
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,800
You are in a difficult situation now.

603
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,200
And you have no one to rely on.

604
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
As long as you have General Fu's help,

605
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,000
you'll get what you wish for.

606
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,040
When that time comes,

607
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,360
no one in this world will dare raise
their voices against you anymore.

608
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,240
And no one...

609
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,400
will dare disobey you ever again.

610
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,720
Xiang, you are right.

611
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,400
But what if I fail?

612
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Xiang. Will you leave me if I fail?

613
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,680
You are destined to be an emperor.
You are born for it.

614
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
It is your destiny.

615
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,400
-You will not lose.
-I mean what if?

616
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,920
There will be no what ifs.

617
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,160
I believe in you...

618
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,160
and I believe in General Fu.

619
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
Alright.

620
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,240
Alright!

621
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,760
Xiang.

622
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,480
If you say I won't lose,
then I won't lose.

623
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,880
For you, I'll take this risk.

624
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,680
After I sit on the throne and
sentenced Zongzheng Wu You to death,

625
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,920
I'll confer you the title
as Imperial Consort.

626
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,560
When that time comes,

627
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,400
you'll rule over the imperial harem.

628
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,320
Besides you,

629
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,600
I want nobody else.

630
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,480
You have to keep your word then.

631
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
Don't worry.

632
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,840
I won't go back on my words.

633
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,120
" Dezheng Door "

634
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,120
Arrival of His Majesty!

635
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

636
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,240
Rise.

637
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,760
March forward!

638
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,840
Victory!

639
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,920
Victory!

640
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,560
Victory!

641
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,240
Victory!

642
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,920
Victory!

643
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,680
Victory!

644
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,680
This is bad! Help!

645
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,960
Lady Rong Le has fallen ill again!

646
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,160
-What happened?
-Lady Rong Le is sick again.

647
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,000
She is already unconscious.
I need to get her the medicine.

648
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,640
Last time, General Fu has
brought her the medicine, right?

649
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,480
That was last time.
Her illness is more serious now.

650
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,120
The one we used last time
can't cure her now.

651
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
I'll go to the apothecary house
to get it then.

652
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,360
This is not a normal medicine.

653
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,240
I need the Dragon Flower.

654
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,280
This flower is the
rarest among the rare.

655
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,240
You can't find it in normal
apothecary house. Let me out.

656
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,840
Tell me what the flower looks like.
I'll get it for you.

657
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,680
You can find the flower only on
the moss that grows on dragon stone.

658
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,920
It's colour is different for
every season of the year.

659
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
It's entirely up to your luck
to be able to find it.

660
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,360
And you have to be careful
when you pluck it.

661
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,960
You can't pluck the newly bloomed
and you can't pluck the newly wilted.

662
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,120
You can only take the petals,
not the nectar.

663
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,040
If there's any nectar on it,

664
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,200
it'll become poison and the person
who takes it will die for sure.

665
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,320
Do you have the skill to
pluck this kind of flower?

666
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,480
-No.
-Let me out now.

667
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,480
I'll go to the eastern suburb to
get the medicine for her now.

668
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,400
But General Fu has ordered us
that no one can leave the manor.

669
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,920
You give us no choice.

670
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,560
Let me tell you.

671
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,040
If something happens to the princess,

672
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,280
you'll be responsible for it
when the general is back.

673
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,840
This way, please.

674
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Both of you stay here.
The rest, follow me.

675
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,760
Princess, they are gone.

676
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,720
I hope that she will
be successful this time.
