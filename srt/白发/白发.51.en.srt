1
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,358
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,842
Episode 51

3
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,700
Gunpowder.

4
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,260
-Chase after him.
-Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,380
" Qingtian Chamber "

6
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,378
Princess.

7
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:17,906
This is the hangover soup sent here by
the consort of Prince Zhen Bei.

8
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:19,061
Here.

9
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,060
Drink it.

10
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,180
Ling Yue.

11
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,412
The incense burner's smell over there
is making me ill. Take it away.

12
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,300
Princess.

13
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,781
-Princess, are you alright?
-Ling Yue.

14
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,418
Why do I feel like...

15
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,477
I'm a little bit unwell?

16
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,167
Are you alright, Princess?

17
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:09,545
Princess.

18
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,416
Princess.

19
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,260
Princess!

20
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,104
Leave her to me.

21
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,889
You don't have to worry about
what will happen next.

22
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,539
I have an order from my master.

23
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,570
I have to send her to
Qingtian Chamber.

24
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:50,572
Your master is cooperating
with our prince.

25
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,711
We had agreed to follow
our prince's orders.

26
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,588
You don't trust our prince?

27
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,820
How could I ever doubt
Prince Zhen Bei?

28
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,140
But this is my master's order.

29
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:00,738
I can't disobey him.

30
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,660
Help her up then.

31
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,167
Your master asked for one result only.

32
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,596
As for how to get that result,

33
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,377
our prince is the one
who will make that call.

34
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,782
Xiao Sha.

35
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,633
I'm so scared.

36
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,254
I thought I'm going to die.

37
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,365
Luckily you are in
Prince Zhen Bei's manor.

38
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,780
You knew everything already?

39
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,940
You didn't even drink
the hangover soup.

40
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,260
No.

41
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,980
You aren't even drunk.

42
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,460
You just pretended to be drunk.

43
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,740
Qian Yi had given me
the same kind of wine before.

44
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,830
I know that I won't get drunk
no matter how much I drink it.

45
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,180
When did you start
to guard against me?

46
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,782
You approached Sun Ya Li,

47
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,524
provoked her...

48
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,036
and intensified the
conflict between us.

49
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,368
You secretly let an outside man...

50
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,100
to come into my manor.

51
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,019
You killed Chun Ni...

52
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,046
so that the man can disguise
as her to come into my room.

53
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,998
And then you accused me
for having a beau.

54
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:23,287
You hid fake evidence under my bed...

55
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:26,487
and pretended to defend me
in the great hall.

56
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,148
But actually,

57
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:31,209
you put the blame of
Sun Ya Li's death on me in public.

58
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,169
Let go!

59
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,940
You thought that...

60
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:48,173
you had done these things flawlessly.

61
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,366
You thought that I suspected nothing.

62
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,657
Earlier on,

63
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,060
in order to cover for yourself,
you framed Lian Xin.

64
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,959
And you repeatedly advise
Princess Rong Le to submit to Fu Chou.

65
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,620
Unfortunately,

66
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,096
we didn't get to see through
your façade earlier.

67
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,700
Who is the master that
you were talking about just now?

68
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,082
What plan does he have
by ganging up with Ning Qian Yi?

69
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,103
Tell me.

70
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:28,357
Because of her,

71
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,532
you lied to me.

72
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,311
And now, you want to kill me.

73
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,462
I already gave you a chance.

74
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,380
I told you that...

75
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,741
we are in debt with Princess Rong Le
and none of us should betray her.

76
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,513
I've never been loyal to her.
So, how can there be a betrayal?

77
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:51,894
Xiao Sha.

78
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,299
Actually, we are the same.

79
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,682
We are sent to her side
by others to spy on her.

80
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,371
Why do we need to be loyal to her?

81
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,410
I'm different from you.

82
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,136
Back then, she was forced to marry
Fu Chou in order to protect you.

83
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,780
She still tried to find a way out for
you even when her life was in danger.

84
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,315
Even if you don't treat her
as your mistress,

85
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,551
you should be grateful for the
kindness that she had shown you.

86
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,513
Since young, the person who had
trained me told me that...

87
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,172
love is the best weapon.

88
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,531
Do you think she is
any different from me?

89
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,789
But Zongzheng Wu You and
Fu Chou had her fooled all around.

90
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,140
So, she has lost her own weapon.

91
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,420
You don't have feelings.

92
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:42,758
You don't know the value of
a relationship between two people.

93
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,524
When the time comes,
use this to knock her out...

94
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,263
and bring her to Qingtian Chamber.

95
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,140
After this is done,

96
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,181
can you let Xiao Sha off?

97
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,973
Are you trying to bargain with me?

98
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,180
Don't forget about
your other identity,

99
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,220
Qing Hu.

100
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,300
What evil plot do the one behind you
and Ning Qian Yi has?

101
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,020
What are you trying to do by
bringing me to Qingtian Chamber?

102
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:38,118
I won't tell you.
Don't waste your energy.

103
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:42,089
You think that I won't kill you?

104
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,945
Xiao Sha.

105
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,068
I know that it'll kill you
to have to kill me,

106
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,660
right?

107
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,702
You said that you like me.

108
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,620
You want me to become your wife.

109
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,860
Let's knock her out...

110
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,449
and bring her to Qingtian Chamber.

111
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,045
Help me complete my mission.

112
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,940
And then I'll marry you.

113
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:08,864
That way, we can live
happily every day...

114
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,140
and we don't need to serve
under anybody anymore.

115
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,500
Alright?

116
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,700
Alright?

117
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,780
You put this at the entrance
of the kitchen, right? Thank you.

118
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
I'm giving it back to you now.

119
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,833
Your Highness,
Princess Rong Le is gone.

120
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,163
-What happened?
-I waited outside...

121
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,509
Qianlin Garden with a carriage.

122
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,161
But Princess Rong Le wasn't
brought to me after a long while.

123
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,660
I sent someone to check on it...

124
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,630
and found out that Princess Rong Le's
maidservant, Ling Yue...

125
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,500
and the person we sent were murdered.

126
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,549
But Princess Rong Le is
nowhere to be found.

127
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,738
Who brought her away?

128
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,711
Is it Zongzheng Wu You
or is it Fu Chou?

129
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,940
Could it be...

130
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,519
Send someone to check on
Zongzheng Wu You and Fu Chou.

131
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,513
I'll pay Rong Qi a visit.

132
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,740
Yes, Your Highness.

133
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,152
Prince Zhen Bei, please stop.

134
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,499
Prince Zhen Bei, please stop.

135
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,141
Prince Zhen Bei, please stop.

136
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,660
Where is the emperor of Qi?

137
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:56,641
He is asleep already.
Please stop here.

138
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,076
He is already asleep
although it's so early?

139
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:02,848
But never mind. I've brought along
my royal physician to read his pulse.

140
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,321
We just need to be quiet.

141
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,466
No, Prince Zhen Bei.
I don't think this is appropriate.

142
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,589
His Majesty is already asleep.

143
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,368
Little Xun.

144
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,847
Let him in.

145
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,460
I'm terribly sorry, Emperor of Qi.

146
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,060
I've disturbed your sleep.

147
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,718
I heard that you are ill.
I am very anxious about it.

148
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,743
If I don't bring along my
royal physician to treat you tonight,

149
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,108
I think I won't be able
to fall asleep tonight.

150
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:34,287
Prince Zhen Bei.

151
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,460
His Majesty's old illness
attacks again.

152
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,820
He can't be exposed to wind.

153
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,724
How could that be?

154
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,910
You look so pale.

155
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,845
I can see that it's not
a common illness.

156
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,642
Royal physician,
come and read his pulse now.

157
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:05,306
Make sure that he is alright.

158
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,511
Yes, Your Highness.

159
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,265
Prince Zhen Bei,

160
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,060
thank you for your kindness.

161
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,176
This illness has stuck
with me since young.

162
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,980
It's not anything serious.

163
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,812
I just need to rest.

164
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,976
Although you say so,

165
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,107
I can't stop worrying about it
until your pulse is read.

166
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:25,949
If that's the case,

167
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,900
I'll have to trouble you then.

168
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,060
Don't worry, Your Majesty,

169
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:41,794
he is our best physician in Chen.

170
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,921
There is no illness
that he can't treat.

171
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,209
How is it? His Majesty is fine, right?

172
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,801
I have read pulses for
more than 10 years.

173
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,435
But I've never read such
complicated pulse before.

174
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,616
Forgive me for my incompetence.

175
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,648
I don't dare to simply
give him any medicine.

176
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,589
-You may leave now.
-Yes, Your Highness.

177
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:15,544
Even the royal physician says that
there's no need for medicine.

178
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,683
Looks like it's really
not that serious.

179
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,757
If that's the case,
I'll take my leave now.

180
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,847
-Sorry for troubling you.
-I won't be sending you off then.

181
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,590
Get me some tea.

182
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:39,908
-How is it?
-From his pulse, he might die soon.

183
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,217
This is the effect of
medicinal overdose.

184
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:44,597
I'm afraid that he won't be
living for long.

185
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,850
Have you searched everywhere?

186
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,780
I've turned almost all of
Qianlin Garden upside down.

187
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,460
But I couldn't find any traces of her.

188
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,919
-Leng Yan.
-Yes, Your Highness.

189
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,340
-Go and check out Rong Qi's chamber.
-Yes, Your Highness.

190
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,231
Prince Li, Prince Regent has
asked me to send this letter to you.

191
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,492
<i>If you want to meet Rong Le,
come to Qingtian Chamber now...</i>

192
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:29,028
<i>and let's have a showdown.</i>

193
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,260
Your Highness, I found
the person who set up the bomb.

194
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,820
He went to meet Prince Li.

195
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,700
Zongzheng Wu You?

196
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,020
What is he trying to do?

197
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:50,672
On my way back just now,
I heard the guards said that...

198
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,984
Princess Rong Le is impossibly drunk
and she has gone to Qingtian Chamber.

199
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,100
She wants to meet Prince Li
to know why he abandons her.

200
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,740
" Qingtian Chamber "

201
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,660
His Majesty wants to meet you.

202
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

203
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,300
You are the one...

204
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:51,383
who bombed away
Qingtian Chamber, right?

205
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,500
You've put Rong Le into
death trap again and again.

206
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:58,684
Aren't afraid that you'll
cross my baseline?

207
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:00,588
You know that...

208
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,156
I'm just following orders.

209
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:06,781
You've already used Fu Chou
to take away the throne.

210
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,460
And you used Rong Le...

211
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,540
to make the two brothers
destroy each other.

212
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,420
Is it not enough yet?

213
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,660
For our master,

214
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,761
as long as there's a survivor
in the Zongzheng royal family,

215
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,450
this grudge...

216
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
will never end.

217
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,781
Zongzheng Wu You has to die.

218
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:29,163
And he has to die in Fu Chou's hands.

219
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,900
When Zongzheng Wu You
and his brother are dead,

220
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,500
I'll announce Ning Qian Yi's crimes...

221
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,117
to the public.

222
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,493
Then, there'll only be a
child emperor in Chen.

223
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,136
He won't be a problem.

224
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,140
When that time comes,

225
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,074
this world...

226
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:47,971
will belong to you.

227
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,771
When the time really comes,

228
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,650
I think I'll be the one
who has to die then.

229
00:19:58,313 --> 00:19:59,873
That won't happen.

230
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,220
Our master has done
all of these for you.

231
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,278
All these years,

232
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,469
the pains that you have suffered...

233
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:10,010
are because of Zongzheng Yun He.

234
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,153
We did all of these...

235
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
to take revenge for you.

236
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,540
Do you think I am Fu Chou?

237
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,868
Do you think I'm him who you had
pumped with hatred since young...

238
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,849
and one who will fall
for your words easily?

239
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,778
How can he be comparable to you?

240
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,518
You've been smarter
than others since young.

241
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:40,097
Unlike Fu Chou.

242
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,377
Until now, he still doesn't know
who his real biological mother is.

243
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,020
Tell me.

244
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:48,954
If he knows that Lady Yun
is his real mother...

245
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,707
and Zongzheng Wu You is his
twin brother of the same mother,

246
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,775
what will he look like...

247
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,580
when he loses all the hatred
that he had held on?

248
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,500
" Qingtian Chamber "

249
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,780
Don't come here!

250
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,020
Stop!

251
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,639
<i>I think of you when the moon is full,
when it's a crescent...</i>

252
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,757
<i>and when it's white.</i>

253
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,794
<i>You who came to a strange land
to build our lands together.</i>

254
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,031
<i>I think of you when
night has fallen...</i>

255
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:56,532
<i>and when the fog has parted.</i>

256
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:01,995
<i>My yearning for you has
turned you into my reason.</i>

257
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,220
I'm such a fool.

258
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,060
I'm really a fool.

259
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,288
How could I be so naive
to think that...

260
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,300
both of you have really broken apart?

261
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,630
Zongzheng Wu You,

262
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,111
you've been...

263
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,660
wanting to avenge your mother, right?

264
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,780
Come. I'm right here.

265
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,210
Come over here.

266
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:41,384
Come over here. Come at me!

267
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,460
You can't kill each other.

268
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,265
Because you are twins
with the same mother.

269
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,620
How are you, Young Master?

270
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:17,617
Lin Shen.

271
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,940
Why are you here?

272
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:22,263
For the past one year and more,

273
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,690
I couldn't find your trace at all.

274
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,220
So,

275
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,597
you had been wreaking havoc in Chen.

276
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,540
Why do you say so?

277
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,953
I came to Chen because of you.

278
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,922
Zongzheng Wu You is your sworn enemy.

279
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,820
If you don't want to kill him,

280
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:40,337
I'll help you to do it.

281
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,020
Don't believe him.

282
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,064
He ganged up with Ning Qian Yi
to plot against us.

283
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,700
He wants to use my life...

284
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,180
to make two brothers kill each other.

285
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:53,318
Fu Chou, Wu You is not
your sworn enemy at all.

286
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:54,927
And you are not Fu Yuan's son.

287
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,140
You are Lady Yun's son.

288
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:02,217
Impossible. Rong Le,
you are lying to me again.

289
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,340
I heard it with my own ears.

290
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
This is the truth.

291
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,910
If he knows that Lady Yun
is his real mother...

292
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,191
and Zongzheng Wu You is his
twin brother of the same mother,

293
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:20,085
what will he look like...

294
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,771
when he loses all the hatred
that he had held on?

295
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,180
I was standing behind the
folding screen just now.

296
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,860
I've heard your conversation
with my brother.

297
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,693
Back then, you and Fu Yuan...

298
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,439
bribed the midwife...

299
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,380
and when Lady Yun was
unconscious after giving birth,

300
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,140
you used a dead baby...

301
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,369
to replace one of her children.

302
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:56,235
You made him into
a weapon for your revenge.

303
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:59,025
You used him to usurp the throne.

304
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,317
And you want to use him
to destroy his own brother.

305
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,140
And you'll tell him
the truth in the end.

306
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,789
You want him to be filled with grief
to push him into the abyss.

307
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,380
And that is your
final goal in the end.

308
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,300
Come, tell me.

309
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,140
What Rong Le said,

310
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,183
are they true?

311
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,234
Of course they are not.

312
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,820
You knew that...

313
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,782
only Fu Yuan's son...

314
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:37,034
was raised and tortured
in the Cold Harem...

315
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,580
while Lady Yun's son...

316
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,625
was the apple of everyone's eye.

317
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,056
Think about it.

318
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,180
Whose son are you?

319
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:49,449
Back then, my mother...

320
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,746
was too exhausted after giving birth.

321
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,620
Before she was unconscious,
she saw with her own eyes that...

322
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,900
her twins...

323
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,696
have dragon-shaped birthmark
on each of their forearms.

324
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,408
When she woke up,

325
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,038
she realised that the dead baby
beside her has no birthmark.

326
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,625
She believed in herself that...

327
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,903
her other son is still alive.

328
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,836
So, father had sent people to search
the country for a child with...

329
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,848
dragon-shaped birthmark
but to no avail.

330
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,391
He strongly believed that
Fu Yuan did it.

331
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,729
Thus, he locked her
in Senyan Palace...

332
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:30,242
to grill her for answer. But...

333
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,060
But I don't have a birthmark
on my forearm!

334
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,620
I have none!

335
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,980
How is it possible that we are...

336
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,500
You personally cut off...

337
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,900
this birthmark from me?

338
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,177
Yes, I personally cut off
this birthmark from you.

339
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,740
But Young Master,

340
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,340
can you really believe it?

341
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:13,353
Can you really believe that the hatred
you lived on all your life is fake?

342
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,100
Think about...

343
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:17,253
that five years where
you had run for your life.

344
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:19,105
The ten years of killing
in the battlefield.

345
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,180
The bone-piercing pains that
you had suffered repeatedly.

346
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,420
Those are your conviction for revenge.

347
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,650
If this hatred is fake,

348
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,565
then the ones that you had hurt
at all cost will be your closest ones.

349
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:31,219
Can you accept this truth?

350
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,580
Do you want to let your life
become a complete joke?

351
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,820
Fu Chou.

352
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:44,014
Don't fall for their words.

353
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,914
They had plotted
all of this to hurt you.

354
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,500
This woman...

355
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:54,787
doesn't love you at all.

356
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,180
If it was Zongzheng Wu You,

357
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,047
she wouldn't be so cruel
and heartless to him.

358
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,780
Young Master,

359
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:04,946
you've already made
this terrible mistake.

360
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,176
You can't go back anymore.

361
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,421
The only thing you can do...

362
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,645
is to follow the original path.

363
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:14,534
He...

364
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,239
is still your enemy.

365
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,860
Kill him.

366
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,128
And you can get back everything that
belongs to you from the very start.

367
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:23,423
No matter how cruel the truth is,

368
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,140
it's better than continuing to make
more mistakes because of a lie.

369
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,367
So, you and Fu Yuan...

370
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:33,198
are the real culprits
behind all of these.

371
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:35,262
You took away others' child...

372
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:37,346
and killed others' parents!

373
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,079
You controlled other's life
as you please...

374
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,060
and build your happiness
on other's sufferings!

375
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,700
You are the evil incarnation!

376
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,966
Do you want to die here?

377
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,151
This is weird.

378
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:32,593
I saw her came in just now.

379
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,420
How come it's you?

380
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,900
No need to look at me like that.

381
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,780
I don't have that kind of relationship
that you think with His Highness.

382
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,246
Then what kind of
relationship do you have?

383
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,698
Why can you go in and out
from his study room as you please?

384
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,381
And what is the purpose
of this secret room?

385
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,220
You ask me so many questions at once.

386
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:28,982
How am I going to answer you?

387
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,500
Then first, tell me why
are you here in Chen.

388
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,873
I have always been a citizen of Chen.

389
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,901
During the civil strife
in Chen back then,

390
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,436
my father was not willing
to bow down to those in power.

391
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,279
So, he was killed.

392
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,816
And my mother escaped with me.

393
00:35:46,012 --> 00:35:47,252
We ran into a war...

394
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,165
and in order to protect me,

395
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:51,811
she was stabbed to death.

396
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,900
And then?

397
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,980
And then, I met His Highness.

398
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:57,642
He saved me.

399
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,201
And he sent me to
Northern Realm for a mission.

400
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,140
What mission?

401
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,820
Have you heard about
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?

402
00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:12,607
His Highness asked me
to kidnap Rong Le...

403
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:14,846
and force Prince Li
to give me the book.

404
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,860
Impossible.

405
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,260
If I tell you that...

406
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,971
not only he asked me
to kidnap Rong Le,

407
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:25,203
he even ganged up with
the Creed of Vengeance...

408
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:26,877
to kill Rong Le...

409
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,449
in order to cause a fall out
between Fu Chou and Prince Li,

410
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:31,604
will you believe me?

411
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,380
The one you saw in the study room
is the leader of Creed of Vengeance.

412
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,679
That day, I was in the secret room.

413
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,071
And I heard every word
in their conversation.

414
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,388
They have an alliance letter between
them and it's in the secret room.

415
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,620
But I couldn't find it when
I go in to do so just now.

416
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,764
They are going to act tonight.

417
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,127
Qian Yi is not a person like that.

418
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,520
It's impossible that he will hurt
Brother Wu You and Princess Rong Le.

419
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,442
I don't want to believe it too.

420
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,992
But he has changed.
Do you know that...

421
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,654
before I came here,
he had already sent his Elite Guard...

422
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
to surround the whole of
Qianlin Garden.

423
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,299
If you want to save
your Brother Wu You,

424
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,980
there's only one way to do it.

425
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,609
Find the alliance letter.

426
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,580
Rong Le.

427
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
I wonder how it is in
Qianlin Garden now.

428
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,820
Look, Chen Yu.

429
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,060
What a show.

430
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:11,409
I had already seen Prince Li
and Prince Regent in battle before...

431
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:13,431
and they had blown my mind.

432
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,064
I never thought that all of you here
are so impressive as well.

433
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:20,386
But now, all of you
should be exhausted already.

434
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:23,026
So, a word of advice.
Please just surrender to me.

435
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,678
Don't trouble me further.

436
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:28,819
Finally, you've shown
your true colour.

437
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,980
I've never tried to hide
anything from you.

438
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,020
You are the one who
ignored my advice...

439
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:36,902
and fought at the side garden
in the royal mansion of Chen.

440
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,041
You even destroyed
my Qingtian Chamber.

441
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,659
If I don't take you down,

442
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:42,379
how am I going to
explain to the others?

443
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,940
No need to give such
highfalutin excuses here.

444
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:46,671
You have...

445
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,740
plotted all of these with Lin Shen.

446
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,002
Lin Shen asked Ling Yue
to lure me to Chen.

447
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,540
Then, he disguised as the
Seven Asuras to chase after me.

448
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:57,719
You brought me to Chen
in the pretence of saving me...

449
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,888
in order to rope in
Wu You and Fu Chou.

450
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,820
You pretended to be a mediator...

451
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,038
but actually, you want them
to turn against each other.

452
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,576
You let me and Fu Chou watch
while Man Yao was bombed to pieces.

453
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,460
You made us thought that
the other party had done that...

454
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,620
so that you can achieve your goal
by making us destroy each other.

455
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,164
Too bad you don't know that I already
have my guard up against Ling Yue.

456
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,078
I didn't drink the hangover soup
that she gave me.

457
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:24,396
After that, I heard her conversation
with your subordinate.

458
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,460
I was taken away secretly
by my brother.

459
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,771
Then, I found out that they are twins
and I came to stop them.

460
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,980
Now that you've been exposed,

461
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,900
you want to kill every one of us.

462
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,820
Looks like I've guessed correctly.

463
00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:38,609
Tonight, Rong Le...

464
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,876
is indeed in Emperor of Qi's chamber.

465
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,187
Even I had been thrown into your plot.

466
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,169
I'm sure that this is a
delighted surprise for you.

467
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:50,784
If we can't break this,

468
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:53,689
I'm afraid it'll be difficult for me
to get out from here alive.

469
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,878
Rong Le. I need to let them believe
that you are the one bombed to pieces.

470
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:00,348
That's why I had spent all night to
send a person who dresses like you...

471
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,969
to go into Qianlin Garden.

472
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,458
I had put in so much effort for you.

473
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:06,905
Because I have already
treated you like a friend.

474
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,622
You are lying.

475
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,557
You didn't kill Rong Le...

476
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,772
because I lie to you saying that
she is the descendant of Qin family...

477
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,016
and the only one who knows
about the secret of the book.

478
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,620
Luo Yan.

479
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,340
How dare you trick me.

480
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,009
Yun.

481
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
Yun.

482
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,358
Are you alright?

483
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,780
Didn't I warn you...

484
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:50,907
not to tell her?

485
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,533
I found out about it myself.
Don't blame her.

486
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,179
Zhao Yun, come here first.

487
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:03,807
Do you know?

488
00:42:04,297 --> 00:42:07,137
Brother Wu You and Princess Rong Le
are the ones I care for the most.

489
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,260
If you still care about me,

490
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:11,607
care about our child,

491
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,642
you will let go of them.

492
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,020
Zhao Yun.

493
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:17,672
You are willing to
sacrifice your life...

494
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,015
for two outsiders?

495
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:22,292
You are going to risk
our child as well?

496
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:24,413
They are not outsiders.

497
00:42:25,654 --> 00:42:27,774
They are my closest family.

498
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,772
Without them, I would have died.

499
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,966
Same goes to you.

500
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,265
They had saved your life once.

501
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:39,041
Zhao Yun.

502
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,041
Prince Li.

503
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,140
Zhao Yun is your sister.

504
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,098
Don't think of using her life
to threaten me.

505
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,502
Zhao Yun, leave now.
It's dangerous here.

506
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:52,103
I'm not going to budge.

507
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,460
Qian Yi.

508
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,100
Don't set yourself against Brother
Wu You and Princess Rong Le anymore.

509
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:02,614
Give them back the book and
return the power to our emperor.

510
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,192
Let's live a quiet life together,

511
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:09,079
alright?
