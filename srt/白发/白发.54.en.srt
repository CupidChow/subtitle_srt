" Princess Silver "

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,520
Episode 54

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,080
This is why you carved this statue?

4
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,003
So that in the future...

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,494
I could tell him...

6
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:25,171
his mother has died?

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,537
Is that it?

8
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,710
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,198
We are running out on the medicine.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,360
If Her Majesty still
doesn't come back,

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,949
-your body...
-This is not the first time.

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,400
When did my body...

13
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:20,837
ever belong to me?

14
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,229
When it's time to come back,

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,267
she will be back.

16
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:31,093
You may leave now.

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,480
I won't wait anymore.

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,920
Since you are so heartless...

19
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,647
and wouldn't let go of us,

20
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:18,396
when you come back, let's see...

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,998
who is the more ruthless one.

22
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
Impossible.

23
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,755
Impossible. He must be Wu You.

24
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:29,286
He must be Wu You.

25
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Brother.

26
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,065
He treated me like that.

27
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,827
Impossible that it'll be him.

28
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,944
Impossible.

29
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
Impossible.

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
" The Book of Mountains and Rivers "

31
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,920
Wu You.

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,863
No matter what danger
we will face in the future,

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,258
I'm willing to bear it alone...

34
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,852
for you and our child.

35
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,640
Ke.

36
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
Ke.

37
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,863
This is weird. Where is she?

38
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,056
She's the one who has
asked me to come here, right?

39
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,080
Wu Yu.

40
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
-Ke.
-I like you.

41
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,132
I want to marry you.

42
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,722
I was supposed to die when I was five.

43
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,104
So, I've always had
this theory that...

44
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,553
one more day in life
is another gain for me.

45
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,236
And I've always felt that my life
is fulfilled when I saw...

46
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,502
the morning sunlight of
each and every day.

47
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:09,984
But,

48
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,560
ever since I know about
Princess Rong Le's situation,

49
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,697
only then did I know that
fate in this world...

50
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,362
can come to an end just as easily.

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Let me finish.

52
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,970
I know that Princess Rong Le will
definitely sacrifice herself...

53
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,578
for her child.

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,206
Prince Li and Princess Rong Le
love each other so much.

55
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
But they have to be
separated by death.

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,960
Wu Yu.

57
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:34,885
I don't want to waste time anymore.

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,856
I want to tell you about my feelings.

59
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,476
I want to be with you.

60
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,820
I...

61
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,483
I...

62
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,720
It doesn't matter
if you don't like me.

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,120
After all, I'm the one who
have fallen in love with you.

64
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,695
I already feel better after
my confession to you.

65
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:00,940
I like you too.

66
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,220
I want to protect you.

67
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,500
We will be together with
each other for sure.

68
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,840
" Man Yin Chamber "

69
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,800
Somebody.

70
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:55,458
Where is Consort Rong Le?

71
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,570
She left a while ago by herself.

72
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,790
She wouldn't let us follow her and
she didn't tell us where she is going.

73
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,200
Consort Rong Le.

74
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,211
I need to go out for
some urgent matter.

75
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,566
Sir Xiang will escort me. No need
to report this to His Highness.

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,840
Alright, Your Highness.
I'll do as you say.

77
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,280
" Royal Manor of Qingzhou "

78
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,529
Can you follow me along
to go and meet a person?

79
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:31,936
She asked me to give this to you...

80
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,040
and said that you'll understand
when you see it.

81
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,560
Consort Rong Le.
I promise that she won't hurt you.

82
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,679
Xiang Ying, I trust you.
I'll go with you.

83
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,757
Maybe this thing...

84
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,396
is the only chance I have
to know about my real identity.

85
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,044
I can't miss this chance.

86
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,701
<i>Actually, Hen Xiang is
Qin Yong's daughter.</i>

87
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,704
<i>Her real name is Qin Xiang.</i>

88
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:11,238
Xiang Ying, speed up.

89
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,613
Yes, Your Highness.

90
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,853
Your Highness, I've already found her.

91
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:24,259
She the maidservant who came with
Empress Fu more than 20 years ago.

92
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,029
After Empress Fu
was sent to Cold Harem,

93
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,779
everybody else was
silenced with death.

94
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,720
She was kicked out before that
because she made some mistakes.

95
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,321
And she has been living among
the people with fake name.

96
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,109
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,473
Don't be scared. I just want
to ask you some questions.

98
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,731
I am the son of Fu Yuan.

99
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,810
-You don't look like him.
-I don't look like him?

100
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,771
Do you mean that I don't look like
His Majesty or Rong Yi?

101
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,970
Your Highness, please spare my life.

102
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:02,390
I don't know anything.

103
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,585
But I remember that...

104
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,128
more than 20 years ago,
when Northern Realm was rebuilt,

105
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,779
His Majesty had invited the emperor
of Western Qi, Rong Yi...

106
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,221
to Zhongshan to form an alliance.

107
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:15,986
After the alliance meeting,

108
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,655
His Majesty was so disgusted with
Empress Fu Yuan suddenly...

109
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,349
and he sent her into the Cold Harem.

110
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,818
After that, Empress Fu Yuan gave birth
to a son in Cold Harem. Am I right?

111
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,497
I...

112
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:29,056
Nobody should have known about it.

113
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,394
And Empress Fu should have
forgotten about it as well.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
His Majesty had killed off everybody
that came with Empress Fu.

115
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,957
And he forced her to drink poison...

116
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,848
so that she can forget
about everything.

117
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,684
He wiped off her memories with poison?

118
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,951
Starting now,
tell me everything you know...

119
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,640
from the beginning to the end.

120
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,685
If I find out that you are lying,
you won't be getting out alive.

121
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,520
-Do you hear me?
-Yes.

122
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,833
I wouldn't dare to lie to you.

123
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,394
Tell me.

124
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:07,013
Empress Fu was once
the princess of Chen.

125
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,793
The father and brothers of His Majesty
were too incompetent until...

126
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,850
Northern Realm was
swallowed up by Chen.

127
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,211
So, His Majesty and the rest of
the royalties from Northern Realm...

128
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,222
had to serve under Chen instead.

129
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,440
After that,

130
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:21,135
His Majesty met Empress Fu
who was still a princess at that time.

131
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,567
She insisted to marry His Majesty.

132
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,324
And from then on,

133
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,678
His Majesty gained the recognition
of the emperor of Chen...

134
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,264
and was entrusted with
the military power of Chen.

135
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:35,658
After that,

136
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:39,101
His Majesty started a rebellion
with Rong Yi and Chen was broke apart.

137
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,665
His Majesty got Northern Realm...

138
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,631
and Rong Yi got Western Qi.

139
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,211
As for Fu family, after the family
was annihilated,

140
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,600
it had been replaced by the
Ning family we see now.

141
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,185
They plotted and managed
to usurp the throne to Chen.

142
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:58,864
And because of that,

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,654
His Majesty had...

144
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,440
invited the emperor of Western Qi,
Rong Yi after that...

145
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,616
to Zhongshan to form an alliance.

146
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,703
But he never thought that
something will happen...

147
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,960
during the alliance meeting.
Am I right?

148
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,491
Yes.

149
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,715
Rong Yi saw the beauty of
Lady Yun by chance...

150
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,629
and he asked His Majesty for her.

151
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,320
His Majesty and Lady Yun had
love each other since young.

152
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,310
And they managed to get back together
only after the country was rebuilt.

153
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,218
Of course he wouldn't let go of her.

154
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:26,924
But Northern Realm was too new.

155
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,140
He didn't dare to turn down
Western Qi just like that.

156
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,306
So, he fed Empress Fu poison...

157
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,354
and gave her to Rong Yi.

158
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,000
His Majesty had always
seen Empress Fu...

159
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,609
as the witness to his humiliation
for surrendering to Chen.

160
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,978
He had never treated her
wholeheartedly.

161
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,029
After she was abased by Rong Yi,

162
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,440
His Majesty sent her straight
into the Cold Harem.

163
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,436
In order to conceal the ugly truth,

164
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,269
His Majesty had killed off
all the people that served her.

165
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
And he gave her a poison called
the Destined Poison...

166
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,370
so that she will lose
all of her memories.

167
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,349
It's alright. You can leave now.

168
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,473
It's him! Don't kill me,
Zongzheng Yun He!

169
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,028
Because of Lady Yun that wench,

170
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,077
he's going to give me to the emperor
of Western Qi to be humiliated!

171
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,720
You've fooled for more than
20 years in order to...

172
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,823
In order to take revenge
on my real parents.

173
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,001
If I'm not your son,

174
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,210
then who is the child that
you had given birth to...

175
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,871
in the Cold Harem?

176
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,385
Is he still alive or is he dead?

177
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:49,047
What other evil plots you have
that you haven't told me yet?

178
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,265
I really pity you.

179
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,494
Until now,

180
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:58,195
you still don't know
who your real enemy is.

181
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,489
I feel really sad for you.

182
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,592
Your Highness.

183
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,275
Write a secret letter to
the emperor of Western Qi.

184
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,200
Now, Rong Qi might be the only one...

185
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,641
who knows the truth.

186
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,097
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Go.

188
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,964
Hen Xiang. You have some questions
for Consort Rong Le, right?

189
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:40,190
Xiang Ying.

190
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,840
Can you go out for a while?

191
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,034
I have something that
I need to ask her in private.

192
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:57,378
Long time no see.

193
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,484
What is the purpose of you...

194
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:02,484
asking for me?

195
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:07,141
Nian.

196
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,353
Nian. Good girl, don't cry.

197
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,953
Don't cry, Nian.
Be a good girl.

198
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,459
-Nian.
-Can you let me hold her?

199
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:23,168
Come.

200
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,280
There now, don't cry.

201
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,720
There now, don't cry.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,560
Such a good girl.

203
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:38,932
She is very naughty.

204
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
Besides Xiang Ying,

205
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,813
you are the second person
who can handle her.

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,890
I heard that you are pregnant as well.

207
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,751
You'll be a good mother.

208
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,748
Unlike me.

209
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:55,987
I don't know.

210
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,288
I just hope that our children
can grow up safely.

211
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,162
I don't want them to
drift around the world like us...

212
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
without family and friends.

213
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Can I ask you a question?

214
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,752
The old manor of Qin family,

215
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:32,094
that became Yu's family fort
after that has a secret room.

216
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,483
You went into it before, right?

217
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,690
The woman who had fought
with me back then...

218
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
is you?

219
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:52,306
So, not only you know the strategies
for the People-Based Transformation,

220
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:54,543
you know about the secret
of Qin family's old manor.

221
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:57,913
How did you know?

222
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,405
This wind bell.

223
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,662
Somebody gave it to you,

224
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,415
right?

225
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,934
Xiang!

226
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,453
What is it, sister?

227
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,024
This is for you.

228
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,328
So pretty.
Thank you, Sister Man.

229
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,960
I like it a lot.

230
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,694
You are Qin Yong's daughter,

231
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,744
Qin Xiang?

232
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
Yes.

233
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:40,097
I am Qin Xiang.

234
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,313
Qin family has another daughter.

235
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,909
Her name is Qin Man.

236
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,421
Although I've lost my memory,

237
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,307
ever since I reached Northern Realm,

238
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,976
I've always dreamt about...

239
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,596
two little girls in my dream,

240
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,554
playing swing together,

241
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,646
sitting on the wooden horses...

242
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,883
and reciting a poem.

243
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,474
When I was young,
father always told me that...

244
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,311
daughters are not
necessarily inferior to sons.

245
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,889
So, we should study about books,
music and have our own aspirations.

246
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,910
So, others had learnt about...

247
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,720
Guan Ju's poems first...

248
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,760
while we...

249
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,200
had studied about...

250
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:26,843
the Grace of Emperor Wen first.

251
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,855
Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,

252
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,680
shining bright and brings us light.

253
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:40,637
The Zhou kingdom has it's age,

254
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,960
but the fate of nation
is yet to be known.

255
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,880
How glorious Zhou Kingdom is.

256
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,520
It has done as the heaven says.

257
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,681
Emperor Wen walks up to the heaven.

258
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,927
And how mighty he is,
standing beside God.

259
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:56,407
The reputation of the
diligent Emperor Wen...

260
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,613
spreads far and wide forever.

261
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,841
God awards him with Zhou kingdom...

262
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
and blesses all of his descendant.

263
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:07,498
All of Emperor Wen's descendants are
blessed with unbreakable bloodline.

264
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:12,021
And the ministers who work for Zhou
are honoured and respected forever.

265
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:16,364
They are honoured, respected and
with great vision and farsightedness.

266
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:20,826
Many people with great talents
are born in this kingdom.

267
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,153
The kingdom grows into power
because of them as the pillars.

268
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:30,015
With so many capable people around,
Emperor Wen can finally be in peace.

269
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:37,883
Sister.

270
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:43,623
Finally, I've found you.

271
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,780
Sister.

272
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,987
" Spirit Table of Qin Family "

273
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:11,275
<i>Father, mother.</i>

274
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,532
<i>Finally, I've brought back my sister.</i>

275
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,618
<i>Wu You.</i>

276
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
<i>I want to be alone...</i>

277
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,322
<i>to think about the future
of our child.</i>

278
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,918
<i>I have to leave your side
for a while...</i>

279
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,090
<i>to make a decision...</i>

280
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,393
<i>that only I can make.</i>

281
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,825
<i>I have someone with me...</i>

282
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,531
<i>who will protect me.</i>

283
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:25,416
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

284
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,035
<i>And don't look for me.</i>

285
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,651
<i>When it's time to come back,</i>

286
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,168
<i>we will meet each other again.</i>

287
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,845
" To: Wu You "

288
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:47,697
Wu You, I just heard that
Man Yao is gone.

289
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,760
-What is she...
-I'm worried that after this,

290
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,428
she is going to end
her life alone in peace.

291
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,016
What?

292
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,760
Send someone to look for her
at once then.

293
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:58,573
Wu You, you always did as she said.

294
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,978
But this is a life and death matter.

295
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:02,821
She can't be so wilful about it.

296
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,168
That's right.

297
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:06,062
I'll send someone to look for Man Yao.

298
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,455
Wu Yu, look for Ke now.

299
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:10,509
If Man Yao's body
can't take it anymore,

300
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,421
I'm afraid that she will
ask Ke for her help.

301
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,111
We can't let Xiao Ke keep
Man Yao's secret from us anymore.

302
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,174
Yes, Wu You. Don't worry.

303
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,560
Ke has become more mature.

304
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,513
She knows what is serious
and what is not.

305
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:48,824
How about...

306
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:50,786
you stay here tonight?

307
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,644
Do you want me to ask Xiang Ying to
send a message to the royal manor...

308
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:55,545
so that they won't worry about you?

309
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:05,507
I don't want to go back yet.

310
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,444
When I leave,

311
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:10,742
I've already left him a letter.

312
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
I asked him not to look for me.

313
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:16,127
Sister, is something
weighing you down?

314
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:18,341
Whenever you look at the child,

315
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:20,767
your eyes look so solemn.

316
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,303
That's not true.

317
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:27,366
I just feel bad that I couldn't...

318
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,214
remember everything
from the past still.

319
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
How about you tell me...

320
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,115
something from our past...

321
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:38,221
and about how you've
survived all these years.

322
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:40,213
I...

323
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,829
In a nutshell,

324
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,703
I didn't fulfil any of
the hopes that father...

325
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,654
had put on us back then.

326
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,192
Creed of Vengeance has turned me
into a scary person.

327
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:55,417
It even made me hurt you
like that back then.

328
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:00,645
You've done very well already.

329
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:02,680
The world is not a kind place.

330
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,880
It's good that you can live well
like this with your own family...

331
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:07,607
and your own child.

332
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,381
If our parents were still alive,

333
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,421
I'm sure that they would be
happy for you.

334
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:16,040
But until now, I still haven't
avenge our parents yet.

335
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,857
The royal family of
Northern Realm has...

336
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,746
annihilated our family
and separated us.

337
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:23,578
I had the chance to kill that useless
emperor while I was in the palace.

338
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,478
But I was too soft-hearted.

339
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
I never thought that he'll die
in other's hands.

340
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,881
He has been let off lightly.

341
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,628
Luckily you didn't commit
the crime of murder.

342
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,112
Actually,

343
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,397
although His Majesty is
the master of the nation...

344
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,176
and in control of others' lives,

345
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,834
he never thought that...

346
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,780
he's actually the same as us.

347
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,102
All of us are fooled by destiny.

348
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:49,766
He is separated from
his child as well.

349
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,680
His real son...

350
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:53,754
is just beside him.

351
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,291
But he had treated him like an enemy.

352
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:01,037
I just heard that the north and south
are going to negotiate for peace.

353
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,801
Are you saying that Fu Chou...

354
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:09,545
He and Wu You...

355
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,460
are actually twins who
belong to Lady Yun.

356
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,030
Qin family was exterminated...

357
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:22,232
as a part of Fu Yuan's
revenge as well.

358
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:26,384
His Majesty was the one who gave
the order, but he was tricked as well.

359
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:29,567
And even as to why
we were separated...

360
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,484
and why I lost my memories,

361
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm afraid that they were the doings
of Fu Yuan and Creed of Vengeance.

362
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:36,994
They are our real enemies.

363
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,145
What?

364
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:47,393
How could it be like this?

365
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,974
If I had targeted the
wrong enemy for half of my life,

366
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:56,134
then I had been living in the
biggest joke ever in this life.

367
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:58,196
Fu Chou as well.

368
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,607
He had suffered so many years
of bone-piercing pain.

369
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:05,194
If he knows about the truth,

370
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:07,011
how is he going to face it?

371
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,968
How could it be like this?

372
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,232
How could it be like this?

373
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,882
How could it be like this?

374
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:22,463
Xiang.

375
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,265
We should be grateful that...

376
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:31,048
we get to know the truth before
it's really too late, right?

377
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,288
Come.

378
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,624
If you are worried about Fu Chou,

379
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:44,139
have you ever thought about...

380
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,968
bringing your child
to go and meet him?

381
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:49,938
No.

382
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:51,722
It's already the end between us.

383
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,841
I won't pester him anymore.

384
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:56,611
I can live very well by myself.

385
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,309
Now, I've found you again.

386
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,696
God has already been very kind to me.

387
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,027
Don't worry about me, sister.

388
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,503
The most important things now...

389
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,632
is for you to take care of yourself
and the child in your womb.

390
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,628
Rest earlier.

391
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:45,472
Suddenly, I remember the time when
we were both drunk in General's Manor.

392
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,402
We had slept together
without our guards on.

393
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:53,366
Maybe this is our destiny
as sisters in the unseen world...

394
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,308
that has brought us together
without us realising about it.

395
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,001
Arrival of Her Majesty!

396
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,924
Greetings, Your Majesty.

397
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:38,049
Where is His Majesty?

398
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:42,469
I left the palace for
one year already.

399
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,650
Is His Majesty still avoiding me?

400
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,427
Your Majesty.

401
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:50,725
His Majesty has a message
to be passed on to you.

402
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,412
He said that...

403
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:01,624
he will no longer be a part
of his parents' revenge.

404
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,198
He doesn't fear death.
He just wishes for his freedom.

405
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:06,836
He won't allow you...

406
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,744
to create another half-dead person...

407
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,181
just like him anymore.

408
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,496
He is my son.

409
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,200
Nobody knows him better than I do.

410
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
" To: Wu You "

411
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:39,834
Your Highness.

412
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:42,616
Still no news from Western Qi?

413
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,680
Yes, I had urged them a few times.

414
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,360
But the person we sent there
heard some news.

415
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Word is, the emperor of
Western Qi is not in the palace.

416
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:52,506
And nobody knows
if he's still alive or dead.

417
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,327
Your Highness, about His Majesty
and Fu Yuan's disappearance,

418
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
should we inform Qingzhou about it?

419
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,840
I understand.

420
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,280
I'll continue to
search for His Majesty.

421
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,741
Have you sent half of the...

422
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,838
medical book to the person
who needed it?

423
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,106
Yes.

424
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,474
I think Zongzheng Wu You...

425
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:36,283
knows how to neutralise
the poison now.

426
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,524
The most painful thing...

427
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,879
in this world...

428
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,922
shouldn't be experience by me alone.

429
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,182
I want to see...

430
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:06,028
what kind of choice...

431
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:08,013
will Zongzheng Wu You make.

432
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,230
I'm afraid that this good show...

433
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:13,258
will be ruined by Rong Qi.

434
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,920
He has left the palace. I'm sure
it's because of that girl again.

435
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:18,609
It's your fault...

436
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:20,634
for being so incompetent.

437
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,955
You let him destroy our plan in Chen.

438
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:27,796
I already told you that...

439
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,941
there are a lot of things
that we need to do behind his back.

440
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,671
Since our previous plans
are not successful,

441
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,869
how about we do something
more straightforward?

442
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:39,591
Use a life to force Zongzheng Wu You
and Fu Chou fight against each other.

443
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,491
We have more than one...

444
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:43,821
bargaining chips in our hands.

445
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,413
I'm tired.

446
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:51,471
You can go ahead...

447
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,761
with your plan.

448
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:21,341
Miss Ke, it's me.

449
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,046
Why are you here, Xiang...

450
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,190
Miss Ke, you have to come with me.

451
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:32,368
Consort Rong Le has relapsed again.
She has been unconscious for one day.

452
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:34,744
Please go and check on her in secret.

453
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Don't alert His Highness.

454
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:38,043
-But...
-Say no more.

455
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:39,697
This is an emergency. Let's go.

456
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:49,068
Just now, I want to tell you that...

457
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,931
you won't be able to keep it a secret.

458
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:21,407
Xiang.

459
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:23,205
Sister.

460
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,577
You are awake, sister.

461
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:26,981
Sister.

462
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:30,253
Finally, you are awake.

463
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,654
You've given me a fright.

464
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,591
You've been unconscious
for a whole day.

465
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,690
I don't know what to do.

466
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,641
Xiang Ying has gone out
to get a physician.

467
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm fine.

468
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:43,588
I just have hypersomnia...

469
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,313
because I'm pregnant.

470
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:47,750
Sister, don't lie to me.

471
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:49,607
I'm a mother too.

472
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,975
Even pregnant women
won't sleep so long like that.

473
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:54,234
Before this, I already heard that
you have an old illness.

474
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:56,272
Now, you insist on not
going back to the royal manor.

475
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,047
What had actually happened?

476
00:33:58,284 --> 00:33:59,766
Are you sick?

477
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,518
Or there's something wrong
with the child in your womb?

478
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:11,307
Tell me. What happened?

479
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,549
I was in the Creed of Vengeance
for so long.

480
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,772
You won't be able to fool me.

481
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,440
Alright.

482
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,354
I'll tell you then.

483
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:35,888
What did you say?

484
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,920
Why don't you proceed with that cure?

485
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,561
He is right.
You can still have children later.

486
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:44,696
But your time has run out.

487
00:34:44,872 --> 00:34:46,126
Xiang.

488
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:48,014
You are a mother too.

489
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,297
If you are in my shoes,

490
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,459
are you going to
risk your child's health...

491
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:54,565
for your own survival?

492
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,857
-But...
-Enough.

493
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:59,134
Don't be sad.

494
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,570
I'm hungry.
Go and get me something to eat.

495
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:04,552
Hurry.

496
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,597
Go. I'm hungry already.

497
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,080
Go now.

498
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,434
Hurry on.

499
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,520
Go now, quick.

500
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,341
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

501
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,089
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

502
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,301
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

503
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,475
<i>to melt it.</i>

504
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:11,648
<i>I am destined to fail as I met you.</i>

505
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,843
<i>I miss you but I can only gaze
at you in silence.</i>

506
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:18,604
I will send someone
to guard this place.

507
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:22,238
-Take good care of her.
-Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:29,896
<i>I will wait even if it takes forever.</i>

509
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:34,502
<i>I endure all the loneliness
just for you.</i>

510
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:39,193
Princess Rong Le.

511
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,723
I miss you so much. I'm going to
come in and read your pulse now.

512
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:48,557
<i>I will wipe away your sorrows.</i>

513
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:50,461
Wu You.

514
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,025
I don't dare to see you...

515
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,630
because I scare that I will give in...

516
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
to do as you say...

517
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,051
and ruin the life of our child.

518
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,273
Is Rong Qi the one who put...

519
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:11,042
the poison into Man Yao?

520
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,208
I really don't know.

521
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,395
But the cure that she
had taken before this...

522
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,160
was indeed found in Western Qi only.

523
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:22,085
There is another thing that I...

524
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,341
didn't dare to tell you and
Consort Rong Le before this.

525
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:25,812
What is it?

526
00:37:26,104 --> 00:37:27,866
When Princess Rong Le
fainted in Chen...

527
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,763
and was diagnosed with pregnancy,

528
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:32,668
His Majesty had cut his own palm
to feed Consort Rong Le...

529
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,560
with his blood when
you were not looking.

530
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,745
-He gave her his blood?
-Yes.

531
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:38,998
Not long after that, she woke up.

532
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,563
And by then, you were already back.

533
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,531
At that time, I thought that
it's just a coincidence.

534
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:45,839
Now that I think of it,
I wonder if she woke up...

535
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:47,642
because she was fed with his blood.

536
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,399
Don't be a nuisance. Of course I want
to bring her back to Western Qi...

537
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,660
-to neutralise...
-Wu You.

538
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,000
Man Yao. You are awake.

539
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:07,718
I'm glad that you are fine.

540
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:10,010
What is his purpose?

541
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:13,589
Now, it's confirmed that Man Yao is
my late teacher's daughter, Qin Man.

542
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,002
So, how did she become Rong Le,
the Elder Princess of Western Qi?

543
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:19,533
Wu You.

544
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:21,196
If that's the case,

545
00:38:21,438 --> 00:38:23,562
even if the Destined Poison
in Miss Man Yao...

546
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,951
is not Rong Qi's doing,

547
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:28,047
he is closely related to it for sure.

548
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:31,708
How about I bring a few members of
The Hidden Ones to Western Qi...

549
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:34,177
to investigate on this
mysterious Emperor of Qi.

550
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:37,542
Maybe we'll be able to find
another way to neutralise the poison.

551
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:40,453
I'll have to trouble you then.

552
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:46,211
Teacher.

553
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,217
Both of your daughters
are living well in this world.

554
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,754
If you can hear me
from the underworld,

555
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,600
you can be rest assured now.

556
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,188
I'll do my best...

557
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:58,967
to protect your daughter, Man.

558
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,582
No matter the cost.

559
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:18,652
Why are you careless.
I asked you to get a physician.

560
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,906
But you get me a girl who
has a loose tongue.

561
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,830
Finally, we managed to send her away.

562
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,935
But now, we've made my sister sad.

563
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,807
What are both of you
talking about in secret?

564
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,520
It's nothing, sister.

565
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,189
We are discussing about how
are we going to take care of you.

566
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:38,560
That's right.
Ke has given us a prescription.

567
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,644
She reminds you to take your medicine
on time and don't sleep too much.

568
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,046
I'll go out and get some medicine.

569
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,952
Be careful, Hen Xiang!

570
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,756
You like my sister, right?

571
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I...

572
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,800
If you like her, chase after her then.

573
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,580
Go now.

574
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,899
Be careful then, Consort Rong Le.

575
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,720
If they are together for real,

576
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:19,546
I'm sure that you'll be happy too,

577
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,232
right?

578
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
Why are both of you back again?

579
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:35,742
Why are you here?

580
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:39,583
Rong Le.

581
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
Come with me.

582
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:44,875
I'm sure you already know that...

583
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:47,620
the poison you have contacted
is Destined Poison.

584
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,724
And you should already know that...

585
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,088
I'm the only one who can neutralise
the poison in your body completely.

586
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:56,057
What are you trying to do this time?

587
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,200
I already told you.

588
00:40:59,308 --> 00:41:00,871
I'm here to bring you away...

589
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,800
to neutralise the poison for you.
