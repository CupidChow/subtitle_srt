Episode 5

3
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,180
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.

4
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,460
What do we do with this lady?

5
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,100
Bring her to the inn.

6
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,460
Yes.

7
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,020
Get a doctor.

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,540
Yes.

9
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,140
Brother!

10
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,740
Brother!

11
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,620
Don't touch me!

12
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,420
Brother.

13
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,900
I think you can tolerate
the touch of a woman now.

14
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,300
You and the mistress
of Moon Embrace...

15
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,100
were so intimate and
holding each other's hands.

16
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,220
I am not sure either.

17
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Brother, in order to prove
if you can let a lady touch you...

18
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,340
A handsome reward awaits
after it's done.

19
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,020
Mother!

20
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,020
Get out!

21
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Brother? Are you all right?
Calm down.

22
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,060
You said everything is set.

23
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,660
How did it fail?

24
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,100
Your Highness, I received news.

25
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,100
Prince Li was ambushed
at the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

26
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,180
Is this somehow connected
to Your Highness?

27
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,060
You told His Highness
about this foul plan?

28
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,060
Did you learn nothing
from the last mistake?

29
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,700
How could you be so reckless?

30
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,580
If Prince Li can be so easily killed,

31
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,340
he would have been dead long ago.

32
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Minister, do not blame
Wen Jie for this.

33
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,060
Wen Jie does have a point.

34
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,700
Zong Zheng Wu You is ambitious
and that is known by all.

35
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,620
If we hadn't come prepared...

36
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,260
and got rid of those related
to the rank-selling case,

37
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,540
I am afraid...

38
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,540
we would have been
put on trial for this case.

39
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,500
Which is why...

40
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,740
Zong Zheng Wu You...

41
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,380
must be eliminated.

42
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,820
Father, rest assured,

43
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,100
the assassination attempt
may have failed,

44
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,180
but the Creed of Vengeance
acts in secrecy.

45
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,660
Everything will be fine.

46
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,980
The Creed of Vengeance?

47
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,900
It's an organization
that came to rise in recent years.

48
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,980
It has many capable assassins
under its employment.

49
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,580
They are hired to get rid
of trouble and gather information.

50
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,820
They do their job in a subtle way.

51
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,660
Even if something went wrong,

52
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
-we will not be exposed.
-So,

53
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,260
you told His Highness about the Creed
and kept me in the dark?

54
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,340
Don't you understand?
Whether we failed or not,

55
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,340
if this information reaches
His Majesty,

56
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,660
he will suspect this is
the Crown Prince's doing.

57
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,100
As long as we have no evidence,

58
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,820
the Crown Prince will be
in danger all the time.

59
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,500
What if we do have the evidence?

60
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,940
Wen Jie, get it done now.

61
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,380
Seal off Moon Embrace,
arrest them and gather evidence.

62
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,140
Yes.

63
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,620
Brother.

64
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,180
Brother.

65
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,660
Brother.

66
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,340
I am sorry.

67
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,380
I should have thought about
the consequences.

68
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,020
I shouldn't have taken
the risk to test you.

69
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,980
I am sorry, Brother.

70
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,460
Brother.

71
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,500
You were ambushed by assassins
at the teahouse.

72
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,140
I am sure you know who planned it.

73
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,580
Other than the Crown Prince
and his ilk,

74
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,580
no one would try so hard
to have you killed.

75
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,140
They were in hiding for years.

76
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,820
They are finally making a move.

77
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,820
Brother, what do we do next?

78
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,980
The killers are no ordinary thugs.

79
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,940
Should we send our men to
Moon Embrace to investigate...

80
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,020
and see if there is any clue?

81
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,220
Don't bother.

82
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,940
The teahouse is nothing but emptied.

83
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,420
We won't find anything there.

84
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,700
You should get a good
night sleep instead.

85
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,220
Perhaps tomorrow...

86
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,540
something big might happen.

87
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,780
Tomorrow?

88
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,740
That was nice.

89
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,420
You are awake.

90
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,500
I was attacked by thugs last night.

91
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,980
Fortunately, you saved me.

92
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,460
I am deeply grateful.

93
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,540
It's no big deal.
You are welcome.

94
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,740
I got you a doctor.

95
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,420
He read your pulse.

96
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,580
The wounds are dressed.

97
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,020
But you did suffer from
some inner injury.

98
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,780
You need a couple of days to heal.

99
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,860
Are you feeling better now?

100
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,660
I am fine now.
Thank you for your concern.

101
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,980
If it's inconvenient in any way,

102
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,900
I apologize in advance.

103
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,300
You passed out back there.

104
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,300
I brought you here
without your permission.

105
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,420
I hope you are not offended.

106
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,060
You saved my life.
I should be grateful.

107
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,900
I listened to the melody
you were playing.

108
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,660
It's rather unique.

109
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,660
Judging by your tone,

110
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,740
do you play instrument yourself?

111
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,500
Only on paper.

112
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,100
Only on paper?

113
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,740
So, what do you think about this song?

114
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,100
The melody...

115
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
is far-reaching and tranquil.

116
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,860
It's actually a lighter tone
on the outside.

117
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,940
But it carries a
certain sorrow with it.

118
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,260
You could tell there were sorrow...

119
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,020
just by listening to the tranquility
behind the tunes?

120
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,260
It seems like you know a lot
more than you claim to be.

121
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,100
I named this song 'The Past'.

122
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,620
I wrote this song seven years ago.

123
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,260
You look to be in your early twenties.

124
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,620
You were just a teenager
seven years ago.

125
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,780
But you could already
feel such degree of sorrow?

126
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,780
I was simply asking.

127
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,380
I mean no disrespect.

128
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,020
You have my thanks for saving my life.

129
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,900
I will never forget your kindness.

130
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,420
I shall repay you one day
when I have the chance.

131
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,420
I have been here long enough.
I should be on my way now.

132
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,980
I ordered the cook
to prepare breakfast for you.

133
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,500
My lady,

134
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,500
stay for breakfast before leaving.

135
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,380
I appreciate the offer.

136
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,660
I have some urgent matters to see to.

137
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,620
I wish to go home.

138
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,380
In that case, I shall
not make you stay.

139
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,260
Guards.

140
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,260
Yes, Master.

141
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,740
See this lady off for me.

142
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,340
Yes.

143
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,060
Thank you, sir. So long.

144
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,700
How are you lately, Father?

145
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,100
Much better.

146
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,860
Good, I am glad to hear that.

147
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,140
Thank you for the concern.

148
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,180
Have a seat.

149
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,380
Slowly.

150
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,180
Your Highness, this way.

151
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,060
His Highness is here?

152
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,620
This way.

153
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,940
-Your Highness.
- Prince Li and Prince Chen.

154
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,940
At ease.

155
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,260
I heard you are ill,
so I came to pay a visit.

156
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,300
Thank you for the concern.

157
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,300
Your Highness has never been
interested in politics.

158
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,660
You avoided meeting with
all the other officers.

159
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Yet, Your Highness still
cares about my well-being.

160
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,900
I am grateful for it.

161
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,020
I was under your teachings for years.

162
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,820
I know you are a man with
knowledge and honour.

163
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,140
I can't compare you with those men.

164
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,460
I simply taught you
how to read and write.

165
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,420
It was my duty as your teacher.

166
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,180
I can never replace
Chief Minister Qin.

167
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,980
I understand.
Sir Qin holds a place in your heart...

168
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,180
as your true mentor.

169
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,140
Teacher, that is not entirely true.

170
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,100
My brother has a lot
of respect for you.

171
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,820
When he learned that you are ill,

172
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,380
he came here to visit you.

173
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,300
Seeing that you are still in
good spirit, you seem to be fine.

174
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,900
That is a relief for us students.

175
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,340
I am old.

176
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,380
Sickness is nothing unusual for me.

177
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,780
Your Highness need not
be worried about me.

178
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,100
I haven't been to the
Imperial Court for days.

179
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,140
But I did hear about
the marriage you turned down.

180
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,100
Your Highness refused to marry
Princess Rong Le.

181
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,900
What is your plan for the future?

182
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,540
I have no plan in particular.

183
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,140
I simply refuse to become a pawn
for the game of power.

184
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,740
Your Highness hold onto
your belief and follow your heart,

185
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,540
that is truly respectable.

186
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,860
But Your Highness is still young.

187
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,100
You need not be burdened by the past.

188
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,100
Spring is here and the
blossoms are blooming.

189
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,740
Maybe Your Highness can
talk a stroll outside.

190
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,500
Indeed. The scenery at
Clearwater River is beautiful.

191
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,420
It's the best time to enjoy
some songs and wine.

192
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,540
Well, why not take Ya Li with you?

193
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,820
She is the only child I have.

194
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,580
Her mother passed away
while she was young.

195
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,620
She is not a very outgoing girl.

196
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,060
Great, can I tag along?

197
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,060
I love to see the scenery.

198
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,340
-Your Highness.
-What is it?

199
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,300
General Fu returned victorious
from the battle.

200
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,340
Your Highness is summoned
by the Emperor.

201
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,060
Brother, is this what
you mentioned last night?

202
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,540
-It's General Fu!
-General Fu is back.

203
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,020
General Fu is back.

204
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,140
It's General Fu.

205
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,780
This is great!

206
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,300
As decreed by His Majesty,

207
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,580
General Fu is ordered to enter
the palace at once.

208
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,540
I shall do as I am ordered.

209
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,700
At your service, Your Majesty.

210
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,180
Your Majesty,

211
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,580
the mutiny at the southern
border is pacified.

212
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,620
The leader of mutiny is beheaded.

213
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,940
From now on,

214
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,340
no one shall disrespect
Your Majesty's authority.

215
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,820
Well done.

216
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,300
I knew I was right
about you all along.

217
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,580
General Fu, you are young and capable.

218
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,180
You always return victorious.

219
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,380
The borders of Northern Realm
shall be free from all skirmishes.

220
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,540
Send my words.

221
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,180
The battle at the south is a victory.

222
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,140
All the soldiers and warriors
shall be rewarded.

223
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,820
General Fu Chou is a fine commander.

225
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,300
He returned victorious.

226
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,340
He will now be granted the title of
'General of Defence',

227
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,660
promoted to first rank
and a thousand tael of gold.

228
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,820
I thank Your Majesty for the reward.

229
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,980
Your Majesty.

230
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,460
I was able to secure a victory...

231
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
all thanks to Prince Li's tactics.

232
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,380
The credit is not mine alone.

233
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,260
That is not an issue.

234
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,140
General, at ease.

235
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,780
I reward you for
the feat you achieved.

236
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,300
As for Prince Li,
I know what must be done.

237
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,340
He will be rewarded as well.

238
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,820
Very wise indeed, Your Majesty.

239
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,140
Your Majesty is wise.

240
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,460
The skirmishes at the south...

241
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,060
were caused by officers that
neglected their duties.

242
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,620
In order to prevent such incident,

243
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,900
I was planning to let Wu You...

244
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,180
be in charge of the three provinces
in the south.

245
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,220
What are your thoughts on this?

246
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,260
Father, that is a wise decision.

247
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,900
Prince Li has an brilliant mind.

248
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,340
If Prince Li is in charge of
the southern provinces,

249
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,780
there will be no more mutiny
at the borders.

250
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,540
Very wise indeed, Father.

251
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,980
If Wu You is here,

252
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,260
I am sure he will be grateful.

253
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,780
I have always had
my trust in General Fu.

254
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,140
I remember the first time I met you.

255
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,820
You remind me...

256
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,620
of who I was when I was at your age.

257
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,700
I have always believed...

258
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,980
you will be the pillar
for the army of Northern Realm.

259
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,100
It seems like you have lived up
to my expectations.

260
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,620
It's all thanks to
Your Majesty's guidance.

261
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,780
A moment, General Fu.

262
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
Greetings, Crown Prince.

263
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,220
The campaign has been a long journey.

264
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,980
I will hold a feast
at the Eastern Palace...

265
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,820
as a token of welcoming your return.

266
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,020
Do I have the honour to invite you?

267
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,580
I appreciate the offer, Your Highness.

268
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,980
However,

269
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,780
I went through bloodshed
from the battles.

270
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,460
I am still carrying wounds.

271
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,900
My presence might bother
the serenity of Eastern Palace.

272
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,500
May I revisit the manor
when my injuries are healed?

273
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,820
Sure.

274
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,740
I shall await your visit
at the Eastern Palace.

275
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Brother!

276
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,460
Brother!

277
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,700
Brother!

278
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,380
Brother! Great news!

279
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,900
It's a shame you weren't
at the court this morning.

280
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,260
Let me have some water first.

281
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,300
Father is putting you in charge
of the three provinces...

282
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,740
in the south while
the officers just watched.

283
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,100
The Crown Prince and his ilk
were so shocked.

284
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,700
The south is a land of prosperity.

285
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,060
Father is giving you the land
as your reward.

286
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,860
Brother.

287
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,500
Once you have the land,
you can have your troops.

288
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,020
Even if the Crown Prince
got the throne,

289
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,820
it won't be easy for him
to make a move on you.

290
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,620
That is nonsense.

291
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,380
Brother.

292
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,820
I know you have no interest
in getting the throne.

293
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,900
But the victory at the south
is thanks to your tactics.

294
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,700
Luckily, Fu Chou is a man of decency.

295
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,380
He was still humble after he
got the title of General of Defence.

296
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,140
He praised you in front of Father.

297
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,980
Then, Father gave...

298
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,540
What else did he say?

299
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,900
What else can he say?

300
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,980
You know him well enough.

301
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,940
He has no background
in the Imperial Court.

302
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,940
But he is disciplined and cautious.

303
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,180
Thanks to you,
he got a promotion of two ranks.

304
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,460
He is sure to support Father's
decision to put you in charge.

305
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,620
Those officers have nothing
to say about this.

306
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,500
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

307
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Are you the mistress of
Moon Embrace Teahouse?

308
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,620
Sir, what is the crime
I am charged with?

309
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,980
What is your crime?

310
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,780
Prince Li was ambushed
at your premise.

311
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,260
His Majesty is now furious.

312
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,060
Ministry of Justice is investigating.

313
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,780
Any who is connected to the case
must be brought in for questions.

314
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,500
-Take her away!
-Yes.

315
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,940
Move!

316
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,780
The Princess is arrested?

317
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,180
Ministry of Justice
arrested Her Highness.

318
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,100
I knew it, she was out there
all night because she is in trouble.

319
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,580
What do we do now?

320
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,500
Prince Li is His Majesty's
favourite son.

321
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,300
We might be in deep trouble this time.

322
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,340
Brother Xiao, think of something
to help the Princess.

323
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,580
Or...

324
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,940
Or we can tell His Majesty
about her true identity.

325
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,140
No.

326
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,980
Revealing her identity
is the last resort.

327
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,060
Otherwise we will put Her Highness
in greater risk.

328
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,380
What do we do then?

329
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,420
Calm down and
keep watch at the manor.

330
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,020
I will find a way to meet
the Princess.

331
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,020
I know. If someone
is here for Her Highness,

332
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,620
I will tell them she is
startled by the accident.

333
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,980
She is having headache
and needs to rest.

334
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,420
She can't see any guests.

335
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,180
Come in.

336
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Sir Xiao, order from the palace.

337
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,820
The Empress heard about
Princess Rong Le's illness.

338
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,700
Her Majesty will be here
for a visit this afternoon.

339
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,420
Please, be ready for it.

340
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,900
Very well, you may go now.

341
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,260
Yes.

342
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,580
Oh no, what do we do now?

343
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,620
We can't possibly refuse
to let Her Majesty in.

344
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,980
What do we do now?

345
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,420
This way, Princess.

346
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,460
Greetings, Princess.

347
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,380
How is Princess Rong Le?

348
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,580
I have been here for a few times.

349
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,140
I want to thank her for
helping me out that day.

350
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,140
I heard she is ill because
she was frightened.

351
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,540
She can't meet any guests.

352
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,940
I was so happy when
Sir Xiao let me in just now.

353
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,820
Princess Rong Le couldn't
bear to disappoint your kindness.

354
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,180
But, Her Highness is suffering
from a weird sickness.

355
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,780
She is bedridden.

356
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,700
Even Ling Yue is infected.

357
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
I am the only one
left to look after them.

358
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,540
We can't let that happen.
We need a doctor now!

359
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,380
-You must not go any closer!
-Princess Rong Le!

360
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,540
-Sister?
-Your Highness.

361
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,300
Sister.
Sister?

362
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,780
Your Highness?

363
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,940
Sir Xiao's incense is amazing.

364
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,660
I was so scared just now.

365
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,300
Help! Princess Zhao Yun fainted!

366
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,500
Princess Zhao Yun!

367
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,660
I sent words to the palace.

368
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,340
Princess Zhao Yun
might be infected with illness.

369
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,580
The Empress is the lady
of this nation.

370
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,340
She must not risk coming here.

371
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,900
Get in!

372
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,380
Close the door!

373
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,180
Mistress, your hand is hurt.

374
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,820
I am fine.

375
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,940
What happened to Chen Yu?

376
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,780
She is ill.

377
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,180
The officers came
to arrest us at dawn.

378
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,460
They said we are all suspects
of the assassination.

379
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,940
But they beat Chen Yu
without any reason.

380
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,860
They were even trying to
kill everyone in the teahouse.

381
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,500
I had no choice but to stand out.

382
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,860
However,

383
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,420
I was brought here nonetheless.

384
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,820
What happened last night after I left?

385
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,900
After you left,

386
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,340
I was investigating the scene.

387
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,260
All the people in the
teahouse passed out.

388
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,660
Those assassins came prepared.

389
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,420
They were targeting
our teahouse for some time.

390
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,940
But don't worry about it.

391
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,860
I got everything
in the teahouse settled.

392
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,780
I told Wei and the others to leave.

393
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,980
Only servants that know
nothing were left behind.

394
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,580
The officers won't get
anything from them.

395
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,460
Well done.

396
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,780
I was too sloppy.

397
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,340
These killers...

398
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,980
must have someone unknown
to back them up.

399
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,100
They are cunning and skilled.

400
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,900
They are hired to kill
Prince Li in our teahouse.

401
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,620
Who else could it be?

402
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,740
They want us dead because
we were in their way.

403
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,860
When Sir Zhao was killed,

404
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,900
I should have seen this coming.

405
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,460
I doubt the people out there
is going to put us on trial.

406
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,380
This matter is more
complicated than it seems.

407
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,100
They are looking for a scapegoat
for the failed assassination.

408
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,420
If they do put us on trial,

409
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,580
if we are in danger,
maybe we can tell them...

410
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,820
No.

411
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,340
We cannot be compromised.

412
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,580
We might be charge with
even greater crime.

413
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,100
-Qi might be caught up in this.
-But your safety...

414
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,580
It doesn't matter.

415
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,860
I regret I couldn't
be of help for my brother.

416
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,140
I don't want to cause him
even more trouble.

417
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,620
Remember what I said.

418
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,020
Take them out of here.

419
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,220
Yes.

420
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,100
Let's go.

421
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Your Majesty.

422
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,380
This is urgent, I must come here
without your summon.

423
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,940
Did something happen to the Physician?

424
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,500
It's about him.

425
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,500
The Kite bears news.

426
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,660
Prince Li was ambushed at
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

427
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Long Yue and the others
are nowhere to be found.

428
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,820
Anything about the Princess?

429
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,940
They didn't send any news about her.

430
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,740
Everything seems normal at her manor.

431
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,340
Your Majesty need not be worried.

432
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,620
If Prince Li was in
Moon Embrace Teahouse,

433
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,340
with Her Highness brilliant mind,

434
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,220
she will avoid being in contact.

435
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,420
Inform the Kite.

436
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,220
Find out if Princess Rong Le is safe.

437
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,540
Meanwhile,

438
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,460
find Long Yue and the others.

439
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,020
Yes.

440
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,100
Rong Le.

441
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,380
Move!

442
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,780
Chen Yu?

443
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,340
This is the charge of hiring
assassins to kill Prince Li.

444
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,980
Be smart and sign this paper.

445
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,260
You don't have to suffer any pain.

446
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,260
Not even a trial?

447
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,860
You are forcing me to surrender?

448
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,620
This is the fact.

449
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,580
There is no need for a trial.

450
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,940
Fact?

451
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,660
Prince Li is a noble royalty.

452
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,220
He is my regular customer.

453
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,180
I am but a businesswoman.

454
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,460
Why would I want to kill him
and ruin my own business?

455
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,420
Why would I cut off
my source of income?

456
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,300
Because you are a spy from Wei.

457
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,860
You have no evidence,
you are framing me.

458
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,860
I don't need evidence to accuse
a spy from Wei.

459
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,900
You run a teahouse.

460
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,020
That is just for your cover.

461
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,500
You real objective is to
bring about war to our land.

462
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,100
You want the Northern Real to lose
the fight before it even starts.

463
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,340
Stop!

464
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,180
You scoundrels step on
the people's lives.

465
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,860
Insolent fool!

466
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,940
-Long Yue!
-Tie them up!

467
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,460
-Yes.
-You!

468
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,300
-Mistress!
-Beat her!

469
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,420
Let go of me!

470
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
-Let go of me!
-Let them go!

471
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,060
-Let me go!
-Beat them up!

472
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,140
Let me go, you scoundrel!

473
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,340
Still not yielding?
Admit your crime!

474
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,620
Stop it!

475
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,980
Stop!

476
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,780
Isn't this the famous Miss Chen Yu?

477
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,300
Your delicate figure is
only suited to play music.

478
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,460
Stop!

479
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,020
Let her go! Stop!

480
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,020
-Stop!
-Yield!

481
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,740
You want to save her?

482
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,260
Admit your crime now!

483
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,660
Mistress, no.

484
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,780
Miss, I promise you I'll hold on.

485
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,900
I can't stand here while
they are beating you!

486
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,180
Let them go!

487
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,580
Stop!

488
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,780
Sir Yu.

489
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,380
This concerns the life
and death of Prince Li.

490
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,540
Why are you still wasting
your time on them?

491
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,540
Understood. I will make them
sign the paper now.

492
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,740
Go!

493
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,020
Your Highness!

494
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,420
Moon Embrace is sealed off.
Mistress and the shopkeeper...

495
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,740
-were taken by the guards!
-What?

496
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,220
They sure are acting fast.

497
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,580
They just couldn't wait
to get a scapegoat.

498
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,900
Brother!

499
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,260
Brother!

500
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,700
Are you not going to save them?

501
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,340
Why should I save them?

502
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,300
I thought you like...

503
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,700
You knew Moon Embrace Teahouse
is connected to all of these?

504
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,300
As for what to do next,

505
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,460
I am sure you know.

506
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,820
Yes.

507
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,220
The people from the
teahouse confessed.

508
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,900
The interrogation was too much
for them. They died.

509
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,500
You imbeciles!

510
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,100
You framed the good people!
You are worse than demons!

511
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,340
Mistress!

512
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,060
Mistress!

513
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,580
Wait!

514
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,900
The mistress of Moon Embrace...

515
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,980
is actually a beauty?

516
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,100
I heard Prince Li is
your regular customer.

517
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,020
What a shame.

518
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,700
He has no interest in
women and wine.

519
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,140
-What a waste for your pretty face.
-Don't touch me!

520
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,260
You have quite a temper too!

521
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,420
This is the kind of lady I like.

522
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,660
If you die in here...

523
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,220
that would be a shame.

524
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,260
-What a shame.
-Let go of me!

525
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,740
If Your Highness like her,

526
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,500
we can take her outside.

527
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,700
She can serve you
before we execute her.

528
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,540
Don't you dare!

529
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,580
Yes, I do.

530
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,860
Stop!

531
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,580
You fiends! Stay away from her!

532
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,900
If you violate me,

533
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,460
one day...

534
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,740
I will make you pay in blood!

535
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,140
Is that so?

536
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,860
This might actually worth my time...

537
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,620
if I make use of her now!

538
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,420
Let go of me! Let go!

539
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,140
Your Highness!

540
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,220
Who is it? Guards!

541
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,900
Your Highness, are you all right?

542
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,300
Wu You?

543
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,420
The girl you are carrying...

544
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,700
is the major suspect of the
assassination attempt!

545
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,660
She confessed about her crime.

546
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,500
And now you are taking her away?

547
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,300
What exactly do you want?

548
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,980
So,

549
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,460
the ambush last night was just
part of your plan?

550
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,220
You can tell that
to everyone if you want.

551
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,500
But I know well enough
who is trying to kill me.

552
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,940
Wu You!

553
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,700
What was that supposed to mean?

554
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,740
Explain yourself!

555
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,140
This is but a small case.

556
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,140
Do they really need you
for investigation?

557
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,460
My mother's dying will
won't protect you forever.

558
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,980
This is the last chance
you will ever have.

559
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,980
If you insist on going against me,

560
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,980
I won't show any mercy.

561
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,140
Wu You!

562
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,460
Brother.

563
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
You...

564
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,860
You are carrying her again.

565
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,140
Is she all right?

566
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,780
Brother, you just openly
challenged the Crown Prince.

567
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
You are leaving him
in the prison alone?

568
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,140
Find out what happened from
the ladies of Moon Embrace.

569
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,860
Supreme Court,
Ministry of Justice or His Majesty,

570
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,540
you will explain to them.

571
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,460
Brother.

572
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,860
You are starting to get nosy.

573
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,820
Did you fall for her?

574
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,780
-Nonsense.
-That is not nonsense.

575
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,060
Any women that touches you
ended up getting punched.

576
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,100
If you didn't fall for her,

577
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,220
why would you hug or even carry her?

578
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,660
I wish I know.

579
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,300
Brother, this is a good news.
Don't run away from it.

580
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,100
Prince Chen.

581
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,060
-Just now...
-Miss Long Yue, say no more.

582
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,380
I will get my men to the doctor.

583
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,100
Then, you can explain
to me what happened.

584
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,660
Thank you, Prince Chen.

585
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,820
Zong Zheng Wu You!

586
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,900
Zong Zheng Wu You!

587
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,460
How dare he do that to me!

588
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,700
All of you, get out!

589
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,860
-Yes.
-Scram!

590
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,140
Get lost!

591
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,700
Your Highness, what happened?

592
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,500
You just came back.

593
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,260
Why are you so mad?

594
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,980
Get out!

595
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,540
I am the wife of the Crown Prince.

596
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,540
I must not neglect my duty.
I must give you my advice.

597
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,820
Your Highness is the Crown Prince.

598
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,380
Anger harms the body.

599
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,100
It taints the reputation of
the nation.

600
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,820
The Crown Prince?

601
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,620
Zong Zheng Wu You
has no respect for me at all!

602
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,420
The throne of the Crown Prince...

603
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,220
would have been his
if he ever tries to take it!

604
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,900
Crown Prince?

605
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,060
If my place in the
Eastern Palace is taken,

606
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,180
you will no longer
be a consort either!

607
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,260
Don't worry, Your Highness.

608
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,700
My father will muster
the strength of my clan...

609
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,820
and help Your Highness
in securing the throne.

610
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,260
With your family that is
growing weaker by the day?

611
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,820
You are nothing in face of
the whole nation of Qi!

612
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,820
Marrying a failure like you...

613
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,940
is my greatest regret!

614
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,380
If I were to marry the Princess of Qi,

615
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,860
Zong Zheng Wu You
would be a speck dust to me!

616
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,340
Where are Long Yue and Chen Yu?

617
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,260
You are barely out of danger yourself.
Mind your own health.

618
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,820
Don't worry.
Wu Yu is with them.

619
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,580
They are in safety.

620
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,620
As for your wounds...

621
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,580
It's just some scraps.

622
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,860
I am fine.

623
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,900
I thank you for saving me today.

624
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,500
For what?

625
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,140
Do you mean...

626
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,860
you weren't innocent?

627
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,620
Of course I am innocent.

628
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,700
In order to save me,

629
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,660
you have a fallout with
the Crown Prince.

630
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,140
People might take it wrongly
if words got out.

631
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,620
What they think is none
of your concern.

632
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,620
But for me, you are...
