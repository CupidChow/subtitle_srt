Episode 29

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,660
Even if you kill me today,

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,740
I won't let you go.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,780
But if I die,

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,900
there'll be no one in this world...

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,460
who will treat you sincerely.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,980
I lost my family since young.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,300
Our master took me in...

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,420
and I went through the most
cruel training together with you.

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,380
There were so many days and nights...

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,220
where we relied on each other.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,540
We've spent the
toughest time together.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,820
I thought that I'm
different from others.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,300
You once told me that I'm
your most trusted person.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,260
Because of that, all these years,

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,780
no matter what you asked me to do,

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,580
I did all of them willingly.
Because I believe that...

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,660
I'm very important to you.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,940
But recently,
you've been disappointing me...

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,180
-with the task that you are given.
-That's because I'm afraid.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,900
I'm afraid to see you falling
deeper and deeper for Rong Le.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,060
I'm afraid that she'll
one day harm you.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,820
I don't wish to see you suffer
from the bone piercing hurt again.

25
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,540
I don't wish to see you
suffer from any harm.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,980
I don't want you
to be tortured by hate.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,580
Even for our master,

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,900
I won't give him any excuses
for him to hurt you.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,500
The pain that you've
suffered in the past...

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,580
should be repaid by all the
best things in the world.

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,500
But now,

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,820
I want to have more.

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,340
Do you mean Rong Le?

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,260
She is not worth it.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,060
She was once betrayed by her family.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,380
And she was used by
the people she trusted.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,940
But she is still so kind and generous.

38
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,020
She is different from me and you.

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,420
That's because she's not hurt enough.

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,460
If everything is
taken away from her...

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,460
and she can only survive by
fighting in blood and sweat,

42
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,380
I don't believe that she can still
keep her hands clean.

43
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,700
So,

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,980
I won't turn her into another you.

45
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,780
We have the same enemy.

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,740
All these years,

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,580
we have the same goal.

48
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,020
So, everything that you did today...

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,420
is not only for me.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,220
It's for yourself as well.

51
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,220
Because you want this revenge too.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,380
Hen Xiang.

53
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,260
I don't want to kill the person
that you want to.

54
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,380
And I won't let you kill her either.

55
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,020
I'll disappoint you sooner or later.

56
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,940
Will you betray me?

57
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,460
The feelings and loyalty...

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,740
that you've mentioned...

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,820
are just something very shallow.

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,980
You are no longer my match.

61
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,900
I've never wanted
to become your match.

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
I just want to try my best...

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,300
to help you with everything
within my power.

64
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,260
You constantly remind me
about revenge.

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,020
But she...

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
has always given me the light.

67
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,460
<i>Where am I?</i>

68
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,860
<i>Why am I here?</i>

69
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,780
Why are you laughing?

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
I'm just laughing at
my own foolishness.

71
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,500
I've always wanted to protect you.

72
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,420
I never thought that you
will be malicious towards me.

73
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,340
Chen Yu.

74
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,380
What do you want from me?

75
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,940
I won't hurt you.

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,540
My goal is just
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

77
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,780
So, you are here for the book as well.

78
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,500
Looks like you are not the
real descendant of Qin.

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,420
You are indeed very smart.
A hint is all you need.

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,420
I'm not Chen Yu.

81
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,420
And I'm not a descendant of Qin.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,900
My only purpose in Northern Realm...

83
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,100
is to get my hand on this almighty,
remarkable book.

84
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,540
And here I am,
seeing you as my friend...

85
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,940
and trying my best to protect you.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,780
Looks like you don't need it at all.

87
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,580
You used your hand
in exchange for my life.

88
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,580
You gave me the zither music score...

89
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,820
and give me refuge in
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

90
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,900
The sincerity that you had shown me
is something so rare.

91
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,100
Actually, I've already considered you
as my close friend.

92
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,020
But this book is with Prince Li now.

93
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,980
It's too hard to get it from him.

94
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,700
I don't have any other choices.

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,220
This is the only way.

96
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,620
The only way.

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,180
Who are you working for?

98
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,700
You are neither the people of
Northern Realm...

99
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,580
nor the people of Western Qi.

100
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,020
Stop asking me.
I won't tell you.

101
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,700
You have no choice because
you are under someone's thumb.

102
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,380
Tell me.

103
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,380
Maybe I can be of help.

104
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,740
Look at yourself.
How can you help me?

105
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,580
You are stuck in this situation today
because of that book too, right?

106
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,340
Although our identities are different,

107
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,660
our fate is very similar.

108
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,420
Both of us are here for
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

109
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,060
But I'm doing it on
my own free will...

110
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,620
while you were forced to do it.
And you were betrayed by others.

111
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,860
All pawns will be sacrificed
sooner or later.

112
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,660
You are of no exception.

113
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,300
Maybe you are right.

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,180
Now,

115
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,460
no matter it's to be...

116
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,500
controlled by others
in the name of mission...

117
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,100
or to live our lives freely,

118
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,900
we have no say in it.

119
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,460
At least I'll fight
for my right to choose.

120
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,820
I won't be a string puppet forever.

121
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,340
I'll remember...

122
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,340
what you say today.

123
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,420
I've already informed Prince Li.

124
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,780
As long as he is willing
to give me the book,

125
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,220
I'll release you at once.

126
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,620
You've calculated wrongly.

127
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,260
He won't come.

128
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,860
Onlooker sees most of the game.

129
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,500
You are too blind to it
because you are a part of it...

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,820
but I see it very clearly.

131
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,100
Although Fu Chou is very
gentle and attentive to you,

132
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,700
he bears a deep grudge.

133
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,260
He might not derail his plan for you.

134
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,980
Prince Li on the other hand...

135
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,620
is very cold towards you,

136
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,540
but he's a sentimental
and righteous man.

137
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,180
He won't even hesitate
to sacrifice himself for you.

138
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,700
Let alone The Book of
Mountains and Rivers.

139
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,860
What if he doesn't come?

140
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,140
He will.

141
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
Ever since he came back to Zhongshan,

142
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,900
he had saved you repeatedly.

143
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,140
He still loves you.
Even the blind can see it.

144
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,380
And you still love him too.

145
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,220
But you are not willing to admit it.

146
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,620
That's right.

147
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,900
All of you can see it very clearly.

148
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,420
That's why all of you
have a reason to use me.

149
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,020
And you said that you
have no other choices.

150
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,380
Fine.

151
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,220
You have your own standing.

152
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,900
I understand.

153
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,180
I was once like you.

154
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,020
But Chen Yu,

155
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,060
no matter what's your reasoning is,

156
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,780
you've used me.

157
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,940
And it's a fact that
you've betrayed me.

158
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,260
We can't be friends anymore.

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,220
The nation's affair
is not a child's play.

160
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,980
Where did Wu You go?

161
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,500
Father, I...

162
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,820
You want to be sent to royal tomb?

163
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,500
Please calm down.

164
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,340
A report from southern region came.

165
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,220
It's an emergency about an outbreak
of rebellion in Qingzhou.

166
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,380
Wu You had gone back
to take care of it.

167
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,140
This is bad.
Come back quickly, Wu You.

168
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,860
I can't cover up for you much longer.

169
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,660
What did you say?

170
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,260
-I...
-Your Majesty.

171
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,380
Your Majesty, Prince Fan Yang
has requested to meet you.

172
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,420
-Let him in.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,420
You may leave first.

174
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,420
Yes, father.

175
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,660
Uncle.

176
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

177
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,860
Be at ease.

178
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,180
Xuan Ming.

179
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,500
You'll be in charge of
the war against Wei.

180
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,700
But Wu You is respected...

182
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,980
for his brilliance in leading an army.

183
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,500
He's way better in the
art of war than me.

184
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,460
Wu You...

185
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,060
is indeed bold and talented.

186
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,100
But he has always opposed to
the war against Wei.

187
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,620
He won't agree to go into war with me.

188
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,460
I plan to...

189
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,700
bring along Fu Chou with me.

190
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,100
And I'll leave the crown prince behind
to take care of the country.

191
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,140
You want to bring General Fu away...

192
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,220
and leave behind crown prince.

193
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,140
Are you trying to separate the two?

194
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,820
Although Fu Chou...

195
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,860
looks very gentle,
respectful and cautious,

196
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,780
he is a cunning person.

197
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,420
He's like a tiger or wolf.

198
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,860
He used the banquet as an excuse...

199
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,060
to give a girl to the crown prince.

200
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,540
He must have wanted to use the
crown prince's status to his benefit.

201
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,700
So, it's better to
keep him by my side.

202
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,100
If he so much as blinks wrongly,

203
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,980
I can punish him at once.

204
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,500
You are indeed thorough
and far-sighted.

205
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,780
You have my admiration.

206
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,100
Prince Li, long time no see.

207
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,060
How are you?

208
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
The thing that you want is here.

209
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,620
Release her.

210
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
Why are you here?

211
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,300
No need to care about me.

212
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,740
Instead of using my life as leverage
to harm another innocent,

213
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,780
I rather you just kill me.

214
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,140
I told you before.

215
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,100
I can see clearly the feelings
you have for each other.

216
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,940
Prince Li, do you know that...

217
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,220
Man Yao wasn't married
to General Fu willingly?

218
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,500
She did it...

219
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,580
because Emperor of Qi
threatened her...

220
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,020
with the lives of everyone.

221
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,900
You are the only one
she has every loved.

222
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,620
Stop the nonsense!

223
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,060
Is it nonsense?

224
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,420
You clearly haven't
forgotten about him.

225
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,980
You'll be depressed whenever
you think of him.

226
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,820
She says all of these...

227
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,300
because she wants you to give
the book to her quickly.

228
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,220
That's right. I'm here for
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

229
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,260
But what I said is true.

230
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,780
While you were away from Zhongshan,

231
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,220
she often went to
the teahouse alone...

232
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,180
to spend most her time there.

233
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,060
She'll sit at the place where both
of you first play chess together.

234
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,900
And she'll look at the
plants in the garden...

235
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,300
while reminiscing the time
you had together.

236
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,900
Sometimes, she'll be brought to tears.

237
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,340
Man Yao.

238
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,340
Is she telling the truth?

239
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,940
Chen Yu.

240
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,100
You were indeed my best friend.

241
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,380
I'll kill her if you take
one more step forward!

242
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,100
She saved your life before.

243
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,740
Is this how you'll repay her?

244
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,380
Who sent you?

245
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,260
What's your purpose here besides
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?

246
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,460
-Cut the nonsense.
-Stop it!

247
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,460
If you want to save her life,
hand me the book.

248
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,020
Or else, I'll jump off from here
together with her.

249
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,100
I'll be dead anyway if I fail
my mission. I rather die with her.

250
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,940
-At least I'll have a companion.
-Alright!

251
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,380
-I'll give it to you.
-No!

252
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,780
I'm the one who found the book.
You have no rights to give it to her.

253
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,180
You want to die, right?
If you're not afraid,

254
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,300
-why should I be?
-Man Yao!

255
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,180
Do you know how much effort
I put to get this book?

256
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,540
Because of this book, I had used you.

257
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,100
And because of this book,
you had tricked me.

258
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,540
But you can't let this book...

259
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,060
fall to the wrong hands
just because of me.

260
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
Are you done yet?

261
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,180
You don't believe what
I said just now, right?

262
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,260
I'll proof it to you now.

263
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,100
Mistress.

264
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,980
Although you no longer
treat me as your friend,

265
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,980
I still want to give you
a word of advice.

266
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,500
Flee to a faraway place with him.

267
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,100
Because in this world, nobody else
will treat you better than he does.

268
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,820
Farewell.

269
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,180
Can you come up by yourself?

270
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,700
Is she telling the truth just now?

271
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,020
This is not the time for you to think
about it! Your life is at risk here!

272
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,940
Don't let go of your hand!

273
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,300
Is it true?

274
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,820
Yes! I think of you every day and
I can't forget about you! Satisfied?

275
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,900
<i>I don't want distance
but I stayed away from you.</i>

276
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,580
<i>I want to do it but I can't.</i>

277
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,020
<i>I just want to watch you
in this cold world.</i>

278
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Everybody sees very clearly...

279
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,860
the feelings we have for each other.

280
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,940
But we ourselves...

281
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,580
are too afraid to be sure of it.

282
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,260
Man Yao.

283
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,620
I've always been
confident and arrogant.

284
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,820
But when it comes to you,

285
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
I'm afraid that it's just
an unrequited love.

286
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,780
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,980
I've made you suffer.

288
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,020
Aren't I the one who had
put you into troubles?

289
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,300
Their target is me.

290
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,180
You are dragged into it...

291
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,340
because I've fallen in love with you.

292
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,100
It's my fault...

293
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,980
for putting you into constant danger.

294
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,580
Man Yao, remember this.

295
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,180
It's my choice...

296
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,100
to like you.

297
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,820
And it's my decision...

298
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,820
to hand over the book.

299
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,020
You did nothing wrong.

300
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,700
Chen Yu is right.

301
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,140
You should flee to a
faraway place with me.

302
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,980
Leave Fu Chou.

303
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,140
I can only protect you well...

304
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,420
when you are by my side.

305
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,940
I'll make sure that
no one will harm you...

306
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,500
and use you every again.

307
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,460
I can give you an unrestrained life.

308
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,140
I can give you the freedom you crave.

309
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,580
Unrestrained life.

310
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,420
Freedom.

311
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,100
Southern fringe has spring
all year round.

312
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,860
It's brimming with flowers.

313
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,540
You'll like it there.

314
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
But I...

315
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,100
Do you know...

316
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,980
how happy I am when...

317
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,780
I saw this chess piece?

318
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,940
You've kept it by your side
all these while.

319
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,220
It's a proof that you've
never forgotten about me.

320
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,820
Finally, we are together again.

321
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,060
Man Yao.

322
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,060
As long as you are willing
to come with me,

323
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,260
nothing in this world
will be a problem for me.

324
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,220
Are you willing to come with me?

325
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,700
I'm willing.

326
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,100
But...

327
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,460
But I made a promise with Fu Chou.

328
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,620
We have a one-year marriage contract.

329
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,340
I don't want to break my promise.

330
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,300
I owe him an explanation.

331
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,060
Don't worry.

332
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,980
I'll wait at the hunting ground
for you at eight morning tomorrow.

333
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,780
If you are not there,

334
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,980
I'll settle this personally
with Fu Chou.

335
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,500
Are you alright, Rong Le?

336
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,220
You are hurt.

337
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,900
Looks like you've known
what had happened to me.

338
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,980
This is not my doing.

339
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,980
I know.

340
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,180
When I heard that you were gone,
I had searched for you everywhere.

341
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,740
I wanted to save you.
But I never thought that...

342
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,340
someone will beat me to it.

343
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,620
You should know that...

344
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,700
no matter how many people
are there to stop me,

345
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,180
I won't leave you alone
to fend for yourself.

346
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,980
I believe you.

347
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,820
But now, there's no point for you
to tell me that anymore.

348
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,140
I know.

349
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,260
Chen Yu is the perpetrator.

350
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,820
I will send someone to kill her.

351
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,180
This is between me and Chen Yu.
Don't stick your hands into it.

352
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,180
You are Chen Yu's saviour. Not only
she didn't repay your kindness,

353
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,940
she had tricked and hurt you.
People like her...

354
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,140
is not worthy for you to
plead on her behalf.

355
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,500
Chen Yu had indeed
hurt and tricked me.

356
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,580
But now, she's not the only one
who had tricked and used me.

357
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,380
If you want her dead just
because she did this,

358
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,860
it'll be more danger for you.

359
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,940
In your heart,

360
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm the same as Chen Yu?

361
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,980
No, it's not the same.

362
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,020
At least, you've treated
Chen Yu sincerely...

363
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,660
while you've treated me coldly
and you're always on your guard.

364
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,020
Forget it. Since you are back,

365
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,860
have some rest.

366
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,860
Fu Chou.

367
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,820
I don't want you and me to
turn out like me and Chen Yu.

368
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,220
How about we stop it here?

369
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,300
Such a cruel thing for you to say.

370
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,100
You want to leave me for him, right?

371
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,860
During our wedding night, I already
saw your handwritten divorce paper.

372
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,300
You hid it in the wedding suit...

373
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,500
so that one day,

374
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,820
I can choose the answer that you want
from the two choices you gave me.

375
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,180
You've never cared about the
two choices that I gave you.

376
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,740
Because in your heart,

377
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,700
you already have the answer, right?

378
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,980
You had given me
your true love before.

379
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,620
And I'm thankful for it.

380
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,220
But so much had happened. There's no
turning back for us anymore.

381
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,220
How can you act as if
nothing had happened?

382
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,460
I don't care if you think
that I'm insensible,

383
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,700
that I behave capriciously...

384
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,420
or even think that...

385
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,740
I'm a villain who goes back
on my word.

386
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,380
From now on,

387
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,100
I won't allow you to leave me again.

388
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,300
When I searched for you
everywhere like a lunatic,

389
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,980
I swore to myself.

390
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,300
Our fate is still not over...

391
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,540
as long as our promise is still valid.

392
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,300
From now on,

393
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,820
I won't let you leave me.

394
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,980
Chang Jian.

395
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,540
General Fu.

396
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,980
Zhongshan is quite chaotic recently.

397
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,060
Take good care of Lady Rong Le.

398
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,980
If she takes a step outside
of this manor...

399
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,700
or if she has another wound on her,

400
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,340
I'll have your head.

401
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,980
Yes, General Fu.

402
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,980
-Lady Rong Le.
-Fu Chou!

403
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,380
I've already sent someone to bring
Ling Yue and Xiao Ke here.

404
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,420
If you dare leave this manor
without permission,

405
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,220
I can't guarantee their safety.

406
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,940
-Princess Rong Le.
-Xiao Sha.

407
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,780
Have you found a way to go out?

408
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,500
Just now, General Fu has given
his order to tighten the security.

409
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,660
I've checked. Only Tranquil Garden and
the front yard are heavily guarded.

410
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,540
Not so much for the rest of the place.

411
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,060
Maybe at night,
when they change their shift,

412
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,740
we might be able to find an opening.

413
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,980
Alright.

414
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,380
At first, I want to end this
in good terms.

415
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,340
He's the one who forces me to do this.

416
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,100
No matter what, we have to get to the
hunting ground at eight tomorrow.

417
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,380
Roger that.

418
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,780
Prince Li.

419
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,580
Where is Man Yao?

420
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,580
Did something happen to her?

421
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,340
As soon as she went back to the
manor yesterday, she was grounded.

422
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,020
She has asked me to tell you that
we'll have to plan this out first.

423
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,540
" General's Manor "

424
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,060
Who dares barge into
the General's Manor?

425
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,740
Prince Li.

426
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,140
General Fu.

427
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,740
I thought that you'll
rein yourself in after...

428
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,700
your introspection
in the southern fringe.

429
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,820
I never thought that you'll still
act with such arrogance.

430
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,180
This is the third time
you barged into my manor.

431
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,860
Looks like you don't have any respects
for this General of Defence.

432
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,180
Cut the nonsense.
Give me Man Yao.

433
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,380
I don't have a Miss Man Yao here.

434
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,220
Rong Le is the
Elder Princess of Western Qi.

435
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,900
She is the legal wife of the
General of Defence.

436
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,380
If you want to see her,
I'll have to say sorry.

437
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,660
She is not feeling well today.

438
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,460
She's not fit for a visitor.

439
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,100
Princess!

440
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,660
Princess!

441
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,140
Princess.

442
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,420
Prince Li is here.

443
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,700
Didn't I tell you to pass on
my message to him?

444
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,660
I've failed my duty. Prince Li is...

445
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,500
confronting General Fu
in the front yard now.

446
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,740
Don't think of using the
imperial order to threaten me.

447
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,580
You know I have no care for it.

448
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,380
Fu Chou.

449
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,420
You talked about imperial order
and status repeatedly.

450
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,620
Is there anything else
between both of you...

451
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,180
besides that?

452
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,540
What a foolish question it is.

453
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,940
We have the mutual affection
of husband and wife,

454
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,580
the time we spent together
for half a year...

455
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,100
and more than 200 nights of
sleeping together between us.

456
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,540
Not to mention that these are false,

457
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,900
but even if they are true, so what?

458
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,700
Do you think I'm like the others...

459
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,860
who will give up just because of that?

460
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,020
Fu Chou, you are a somebody.

461
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,900
It doesn't matter that
you lie to me with those.

462
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,220
But isn't it ridiculous that
you're trying to kid yourself?

463
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,860
You've had her once
and then you lost her.

464
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,660
You did all of those by yourself.

465
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,020
Now, she's been married
to me for months.

466
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,740
And you want to take her back now?

467
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,700
Who is being more ridiculous?

468
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,620
Looks like you are set on
keeping her to yourself.

469
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,420
Don't blame me for being rude then.

470
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,140
I've always been
courteous towards you.

471
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,940
But you've become even rude to me.

472
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,820
You barged into my manor several times
and treated me as a nobody.

473
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,780
I can tolerate it, but...

474
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm already at my limit.

475
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,540
This is the real Fu Chou.

476
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,820
Today, let us fight like a real man.

477
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,940
I'm curious to see how
capable you are as well.

478
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,820
-Princess Rong Le.
-Princess Rong Le.

479
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,580
What's wrong, Princess?

480
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,420
Did the poison in her body
attack her again?

481
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,540
Tell me.

482
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,660
You are without cure for too long.

483
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,460
Without the cure to suppress it,

484
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,380
the poison has eaten through your
organs and has gone into your blood.

485
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,620
If it attacks again,
you'll faint if it's mild.

486
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,020
And you'll die...

487
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,860
if it's serious.

488
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,580
How much time...

489
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,580
do I have?

490
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,420
Maximum half a year and
minimum three months.

491
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,220
Aren't there any other ways
to neutralise the poison?

492
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,940
This is a complex poison.
Without the prescription,

493
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,700
it's hard for me to create the cure.

494
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,980
But I'll try my best to find a way
to neutralise the poison.

495
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,420
Worst comes to worst...

496
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,380
<i>There was once...</i>

497
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,780
<i>when we were so happy together.</i>

498
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,980
<i>Although we haven't known each other
for long, I already miss you so.</i>

499
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,660
<i>Do you dare to...</i>

500
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,540
I'm set on standing against fate.

501
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,020
But why do I have...

502
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,380
no control on my life?

503
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,540
-I'll get the cure form His Majesty.
-Xiao Sha!

504
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,820
Princess.

505
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,540
I don't want to beg him.

506
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,260
And don't tell anybody...

507
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
about this either.

508
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,340
<i>After all of those hardships,
we are no longer young.</i>

509
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,980
<i>I'm doomed to live
in loneliness forever.</i>

510
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,740
<i>It's bad but I can't help it.</i>

511
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:52,620
<i>Are you suffering just like me?
Are in turmoil as well?</i>

512
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:59,620
<i>After all the boom and bust,
I have lost all hope.</i>

513
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,860
-Princess.
-Princess Rong Le.

514
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,180
Princess.

515
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,940
Man Yao.

516
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,380
Why?

517
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,740
Do you know how dangerous it was?

518
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,780
You can't hurt him.

519
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,100
He is my husband.

520
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,820
He set you up for marriage,

521
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,420
he used you,

522
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,700
put you in constant danger and now,
he imprisoned you...

523
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,220
and took away your freedom.

524
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,380
You still see him as your husband?

525
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,620
This is between me and him.

526
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,500
It's best if you stay out of it.

527
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,380
You barged into my manor today...

528
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,860
with an army...

529
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,940
and you almost hurt my wife.

530
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,580
I don't think it'll do you any good...

531
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,220
if His Majesty knows about it.

532
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,140
Since I dare come here,

533
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,980
I won't be afraid of that.

534
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,380
Man Yao.

535
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,180
Did something happen?

536
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,460
It's nothing.

537
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,980
Are you still going to leave with me?

538
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,140
No.

539
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,620
Fu Chou.

540
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,060
What did you do to her?

541
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,900
He didn't do anything to me.

542
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,460
I'm the one who are not
willing to leave this manor.

543
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,820
Although he had made some mistake,
he is sincere towards me.

544
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,860
I'm not willing to betray him.

545
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,020
Do you think I'll believe you?

546
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,260
Man Yao.

547
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,740
I know clearly...

548
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,260
what kind of a person you are
and what kind of a life you want.

549
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,420
It's fine if you are not willing...

550
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,220
to leave with me.

551
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,540
But I want to hear the truth.

552
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,740
I don't want to ruin my reputation...

553
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,580
and I'm not willing give up
my identity as the princess.

554
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,540
Because I think that...

555
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,420
you are not worth it.

556
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,380
Prince Li, please leave.

557
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,780
I don't want to see you again.

558
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,540
I'm not worth it.

559
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,780
Man Yao.

560
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,980
If you really mean it...

561
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,540
Of course I mean it.

562
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,380
I'm at fault for today's incident.

563
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,140
It's my fault for not making things
clear between us before this.

564
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,020
I've troubled you to
come here for nothing.

565
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,180
If His Majesty wants to blame someone,

566
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,100
I'll take full responsibility on it.

567
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,540
No need.

568
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,740
I've always borne the consequences
of my own action.

569
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,220
No need trouble yourself,
Lady Rong Le.

570
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,860
That's right.

571
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,100
I'm the wife of General Fu.

572
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,020
Please keep firmly in mind.

573
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,260
From now on,
if someone else threatens my life,

574
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,940
please remember...

575
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,700
to mind your own business.

576
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,620
My husband will save me.

577
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,260
Mind my own business.

578
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,340
I'll make sure to keep it in mind.

579
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,060
Why did you say that?

580
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Are you telling the truth
or are you lying?

581
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,620
I lied.

582
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,740
Everything that you did...

583
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,900
is indeed for the good
of Zongzheng Wu You.

584
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,740
You are worried that I'll gather up
the officials and generals...

585
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,060
to exert pressure on His Majesty
together with the crown prince.

586
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,900
Of course, you can take
full responsibility for it.

587
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,140
And for His Majesty,

588
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,340
he'll be glad to punish you alone...

589
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,820
given that I'm not hurt.

590
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,860
You know clearly that...

591
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,620
his attack won't kill me.

592
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,540
He'll only hurt me.

593
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Of course,

594
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,300
you don't care about whether
I'll be hurt or not.

595
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,660
The only thing that
you care about is,

596
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,860
if I'm hurt,

597
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,500
others will say that Zongzheng Wu You
has no regards for the law,

598
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,980
that he barged into the manor
fully armed to take you by force.

599
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,140
And I almost lost my life
while protecting my wife.

600
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,740
If this spreads among the soldiers,

601
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,140
someone will be indignant
with the unfair treatment.

602
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,740
And by that time,

603
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,380
His Majesty won't be
able to protect him...

604
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,100
in case there's a mutiny
among the troops.

605
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,660
Although you've thought ahead for him,

606
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,300
have you ever thought that what if
he didn't manage to stop his attack?

607
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,220
It's very possible that
you'll die at his hand.

608
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,580
He won't do it.

609
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,300
You are right about
everything but one.

610
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,260
It's very possible that he knows
about your sinister intentions.

611
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,060
If he wants to kill you,

612
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,580
he won't bring along normal guards
but The Hidden Ones instead.

613
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,900
You didn't give your best
and so was he.

614
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,300
Or else, how could he stop
his attack so quickly?

615
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,140
He came to find me today...

616
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,820
just to make sure that...

617
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,940
I'm fine.

618
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,340
If that's the case,

619
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,100
why don't you leave with him?
It's possible that...

620
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,940
he'll be able to give you the
happiness and freedom...

621
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,300
that you crave for.

622
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,220
Freedom.

623
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,140
What freedom?

624
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,940
My life is on other's hands.

625
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,380
My craving is just a wishful thinking.

626
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,660
I'm just a heavy burden.

627
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,100
What did you say?

628
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,700
Fu Chou, don't put your hopes in me.

629
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,020
I can't give you...

630
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,220
what you want.

631
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,060
You are back, Wu You.

632
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,220
Where did you go, Wu You?

633
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,500
What happened, Wu You?

634
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,020
What's wrong with Wu You?

635
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,940
What happened?
Why is he so angry?

636
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,700
It's Man Yao again, right?

637
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,580
-Let me confront her.
-It's better if you don't.

638
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,900
-Why not?
-You still don't get it after so long?

639
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,260
She is the one Prince Li loves.
No matter what she did,

640
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,060
nobody can touch her without
Prince Li's permission.

641
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,300
What should we do then?

642
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,340
Are we going to sit here and watch
while he dwells in depression?

643
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,260
Your Highness, Eunuch Chen is here.

644
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,940
Your Highness, His Majesty has
summoned Prince Li to the palace.

645
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,940
Alright.

646
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,700
Wu You!
Eunuch Chen is here.

647
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,180
Father must have had
something for you. Today, I...

648
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,180
Leng Yan, ask Agent Wu to investigate
on these people in secret.

649
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,860
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Let's go.

650
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,100
Wu You!

651
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,980
These are the names of
the generals in the army.

652
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,500
Looks like Wu You has found a way
to take down with Fu Chou.

653
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,180
Wei has always been
a festering wound for me.

654
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,420
All these years, we've been
in a constant war with them.

655
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,180
Many had sacrificed themselves for us.

656
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,900
A few years ago,

657
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,020
we had the chance to
defeat them once and for all.

658
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,500
But we were defeated because
of the crown prince's mistake.

659
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,300
Once this war starts,

660
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,140
it'll take a huge toll on both of
the countries' armed forces.

661
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,380
For the past years, both countries had
been making preparations for this war.

662
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,100
We trained up soldiers
and hoarded up food.

663
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,660
A few days ago,

664
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,260
our scout from the frontier pass
had reported that Wei...

665
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,860
is gathering up their troops and
is readying themselves for war.

666
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,700
So, this war between us is inevitable.

667
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,460
In order to have the upper hand,

668
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,140
I've decided to attack them first.

669
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,980
And this time,
I'll lead the troops myself.
