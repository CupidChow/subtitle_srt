00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,620
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,534
Episode 56

3
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,980
Greetings, Mother.

4
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,326
So, you do remember me as your mother.

5
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,462
Take His Majesty and the Princess
back to the palace.

6
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,244
Man Yao!

7
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,459
Man Yao!

8
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,769
Your Highness.

9
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,504
We found this villager
outside the house.

10
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,073
Who are you?

11
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,225
What happened here just now?

12
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,717
Why is there so much blood by the bed?

13
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,181
She just gave birth to a boy.

14
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,733
The boy?

15
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,711
How are they now?

16
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,817
Both the mother
and the son are fine.

17
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,703
Calm down, tell us what happened here.

18
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,916
A group of soldiers
came into our village.

19
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,395
They took the child from me.

20
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,895
They even knocked me out.

21
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,290
I think they said something about...

22
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,188
going back to the palace.

23
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,940
My son?

24
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,731
My son?

25
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,072
My son?

26
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,182
My son?

27
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,285
Do you know what you did?

28
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,128
Not at all.

29
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,796
No?

30
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:53,970
For so many years...

31
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,009
you never thought
about having revenge.

32
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:01,716
You went against me at every corner.

33
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,027
If I hadn't found you earlier,

34
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:10,051
are you really going
to leave this place for good?

35
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,709
Mother, calm down.

36
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,321
Deep down in your heart,

37
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,238
you never cared about my life.

38
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,939
You know better than anyone...

39
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,905
that my destiny...

40
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,565
was already decided by you...

41
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,150
before I was even born.

42
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,377
That is all...

43
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,534
thanks to those who hurt you!

44
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,331
Because of them,

45
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,881
you suffered years of pains
from the illness.

46
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,427
Because of them, you are unable...

47
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:47,538
to realise your vision
of unifying the land.

48
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,156
You spent the last two decades...

49
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,427
to stage a tragedy for everyone.

50
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,906
But in the end,

51
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,939
is the hatred finally relieved?

52
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,873
You have to live in
 the trauma of your past.

53
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,680
Only by reading scripture...

54
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,902
can you have a moment of
serenity for your mind.

55
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,820
What you have done...

56
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,847
and what you made me do...

57
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:18,323
are basically pointless.

58
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,380
I must have my revenge.

59
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,356
But that is not what I want!

60
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,141
I just want her to live.

61
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,334
I don't want to defy you.

62
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,021
My only wish for this life...

63
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,012
is for Rong Le to find her happiness.

64
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,737
I wish she could live on
healthy and well.

65
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,303
Please, stop getting into my way.

66
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:58,262
Stop hurting Rong Le.

67
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,703
Mother.

68
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,668
I want you to hand over Rong Le's son
as soon as possible.

69
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,586
Otherwise...

70
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,404
Even you...

71
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,767
have learned to make demands on me?

72
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,767
For years,

73
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,356
you bowed down to me
as you had no choice.

74
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,962
You never dare to defy my will...

75
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,281
simply because you want
that little girl to live.

76
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,239
What gave you the courage
to defy me now?

77
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,995
I have had enough of this!

78
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:48,579
I may be known
as the ruler of this land,

79
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,687
but you control me like a puppet.

80
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,421
I couldn't have my own life.

81
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,961
I couldn't have love.

82
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,469
You were in love with
your enemy's daughter!

83
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,638
Back then, Qin Yong...

84
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,287
loathed me with vile words!

85
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,021
If he hadn't alienated my relationship
with Zongzheng Yun He...

86
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:11,051
all for the sake of
that cursed Lady Yun,

87
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,347
I wouldn't have been
sent to the Cold Harem.

88
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,460
I wouldn't have been...

89
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,257
violated by that cursed...

90
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,503
And I wouldn't have been born.

91
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,566
I know.

92
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,628
I am the living proof
of your humiliation.

93
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,791
But that was over twenty years ago.

94
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,422
You killed Qin Yong.

95
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,246
Lady Yun is dead because of you.

96
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,662
Zongzheng Yun He lives in hell
because of you.

97
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,652
Are these not enough for your revenge?

98
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,207
If...

99
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,733
Zongzheng Wu You must pay
for the sins of his parents,

100
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,443
what about the lives that are lost
because of your plan for revenge?

101
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,965
How many times do I have to die
just to pay for your sins?

102
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,161
In your heart,

103
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,503
was I ever truly a son to you?

104
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:33,635
Do you remember...

105
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,396
how much I have...

106
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,983
went through and
how much effort I put in...

107
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,209
just to make you the emperor?

108
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,860
You seized the throne for me,

109
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:53,895
but did you do it for me...

110
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,528
or was it for your own plottings?

111
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,410
I am sure you know it
better than anyone.

112
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,266
I think...

113
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,620
after over twenty years,

114
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,532
all that I have done for you...

115
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:12,246
are already enough.

116
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,595
I brought you into this world...

117
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,751
I would rather not being
born into this world!

118
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,415
Qi!

119
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,804
I am a dead man walking.

120
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,454
My only wish for this life...

121
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,499
is to spend...

122
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,511
some quiet time with Rong Le
that is not bothered by anyone.

123
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,575
But even this little wish of mine...

124
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,890
is too much for me to ask of you.

125
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,007
In that case,

126
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,948
why would I even care now?

127
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,514
Don't be ridiculous.

128
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,685
You are not dying!

129
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,100
I will figure out a way...

130
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,084
to let you live.

131
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,828
My days are numbered long ago.

132
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,245
You should know that by now.

133
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,449
Why do you keeping lying to yourself?

134
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,306
Fine.

135
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,851
Stay here and rest well.

136
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,740
Starting tomorrow,

137
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,746
all the matters of Imperial Court...

138
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,644
will be...

139
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,231
taken care of for you.

140
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,439
Dismiss.

141
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,779
Yes.

142
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,968
You are still weak.

143
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,022
Why are you standing here
for the cold breeze?

144
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,945
I need to talk to you.
Follow me to the house.

145
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,502
It was you.

146
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:08,423
You took my son from me.

147
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,455
You locked me up in here.

148
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,970
Your son is safe.

149
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,748
Don't worry.

150
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,181
Do you...

151
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,198
have your own reason for this?

152
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,310
Don't be paranoid.

153
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,491
The most pressing matter now
is your health.

154
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,293
Why?

155
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,304
Why must you lie to me again?

156
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,969
When we were in the hut,

157
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,774
I trusted you.

158
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,634
I even defended your action.

159
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,518
Perhaps all the lies you fed me
and how you used me...

160
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,684
were because you had your own reasons.

161
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,302
That is why I believed you...

162
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:56,631
and leave my son and myself
in your care.

163
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:00,771
But you...

164
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,823
I can assure you that for now,

165
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,556
your son won't be harmed.
He is safe.

166
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,057
I won't lie to you.

167
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,178
Man Er, I will cure you
of this poison!

168
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,721
Stop calling me that!

169
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,884
Drop the acting, I won't believe
another word from you.

170
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,325
You had me locked up because
you wanted to cure me.

171
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:22,041
But when the child is born,
you took him from me right away.

172
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,143
You were clearly trying to use
the child as hostage...

173
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,278
to control me and threaten Wu You.

174
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:30,723
You said you informed him.

175
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,552
But he never came.

176
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,366
Rong Le.

177
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,487
This is my last request for you,
please believe me.

178
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,847
Return my son to me...

179
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,733
or you can stop showing up
with your false kindness.

180
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,574
Your Majesty.

181
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,034
Her Majesty asked for your return.

182
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,941
If Your Majesty refuse to go back,

183
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,679
she'll hold the Princess responsible.

184
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,932
<i>The Emperor of Northern Realm
killed your family.</i>

185
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:03,703
<i>It was me that saved you...</i>

186
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,667
<i>and brought you to Western Qi.</i>

187
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,957
<i>I trained you in this Cold Harem.</i>

188
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,861
<i>If you want to avenge your family,</i>

189
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:13,022
<i>do as I say and train harder.</i>

190
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,165
<i>Do not leave this place.</i>

191
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,636
<i>Do not expose your identity...</i>

192
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,216
<i>to anyone else.</i>

193
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,216
So that reminiscence does not linger,

194
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,127
so that sorrow never lasts

195
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,465
<i>The loneliness and memories
of past fill my heart.</i>

196
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,580
<i>The rain washes everything away
and wake me up from this dream.</i>

197
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,424
<i>The leaves are falling and I wonder
if the promise was pointless.</i>

198
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:16,240
<i>From now on,</i>

199
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,943
<i>you will be the Elder Princess
of Western Qi.</i>

200
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,908
<i>You will be married
to the Northern Realm.</i>

201
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,540
<i>I will help you get your revenge.</i>

202
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,177
<i>Was it my goal to seek revenge...</i>

203
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,272
<i>so I willingly impersonate
the Princess?</i>

204
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,519
<i>Who was it that poisoned me?</i>

205
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,327
<i>What about Rong Qi?</i>

206
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,411
<i>How is he connected to all of these?</i>

207
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,378
Who are you?

208
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,993
Who are you?

209
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,396
This is the Cold Harem,
you can't just come in here.

210
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,777
You need to leave.

211
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,204
You got the wrong note.

212
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,545
I got it wrong?

213
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:29,497
This is where you press it.

214
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,420
Then, press on this chord.

215
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,012
-Like this?
-Almost there.

216
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,591
This is a nice.

217
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:44,088
Come on, I have a gift for you.

218
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,478
What is it?
You are being so mysterious.

219
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,124
This is osmanthus jelly.

220
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,086
This is greengage cake.

221
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,900
And this is the maidenhair cake.

222
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,988
I made them for you myself.

223
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:06,468
You made these all by yourself?

224
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,577
This is delicious.

225
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:17,602
As your reward,

226
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,798
I have a gift for you as well.

227
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,317
What is it?

228
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,776
This is for you.

229
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,409
What do you think?

230
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,959
Brother Qi, aren't you a prince?

231
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,660
As a prince,

232
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,700
shouldn't you learn to
rule the nation and help the people?

233
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,619
You only spend your time
cheering me up.

234
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,626
Here is something you don't know.

235
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,659
I am not the kind of
prince you expected.

236
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,938
For me, this huge palace...

237
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,414
is just the same as what
the Cold Harem is to you.

238
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,501
It's like a giant cage.

239
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,140
Don't worry, I am here for you.

240
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,776
I will always be with you.

241
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,732
I may be a mere servant,

242
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,767
but I can also be your friend.

243
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,945
Man Er.

244
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,628
For the rest of my life,

245
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:15,993
you will be the only family I have.

246
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,420
I will be here for you
and be nice to you.

247
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,126
From now on,

248
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,939
your life is mine as well.

249
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:25,155
I will do my best to protect you.

250
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:29,708
Do you like it?

251
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,815
Have a guess.

252
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:43,892
So that reminiscence does not linger,

253
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,325
 so that sorrow never lasts.

254
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,714
Let me see if your
handwriting has improved.

255
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,184
Your handwriting is getting better.

256
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,841
This looks great.

257
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,700
So that reminiscence does not linger,

258
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,449
so that sorrow never lasts.

259
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,267
It's getting dark, I must go back now.

260
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,830
You are leaving so soon?

261
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,303
I was hoping you could
stay and listen to the song I play.

262
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,752
Next time, perhaps.

263
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:17,746
I sneaked out by
climbing over the wall.

264
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:20,495
If my master finds out,
I will get punished again.

265
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,239
Very well.

266
00:22:25,788 --> 00:22:28,104
In that case,
I hope you still remember...

267
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:30,578
we will watch the maidenhair
together at the hut...

268
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,311
three days from now.

269
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,690
I am leaving.

270
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,563
Man Er.

271
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,564
So that reminiscence does not linger,

272
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:33,921
so that sorrow never lasts.

273
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,479
Rong Le.

274
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,728
I am taking you out
of this Cold Harem.

275
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,955
Man Er?

276
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,100
Why are you here?

277
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,524
I am your sister Rong Le.

278
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,066
-Greetings, Brother.
-You...

279
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,425
What did you just called me?

280
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:38,805
Brother.

281
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,547
I apologise for keeping
this a secret from you.

282
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,088
No.

283
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:46,809
This can't be real.

284
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,504
This can't be real.

285
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,628
Why did you lie to me?

286
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,403
When we were in the hut,

287
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:55,934
we vowed to marry each other,

288
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:57,884
we made a promise of life.

289
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,855
Brother.

290
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,937
The servant Man Er never existed.

291
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:08,063
How is a promise with her
even possible?

292
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,190
The only person kept in here...

293
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,152
has always been me.

294
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,732
I am your sister, Rong Le.

295
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,032
Man Er, this can't be happening.

296
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,261
You have your reason
to do this, isn't it?

297
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,653
Tell me the truth.

298
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,165
Brother Qi.

299
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,996
I...

300
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,205
The Empress Dowager arrives!

301
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,860
Qi.

302
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,596
Take your sister out of here.

303
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,828
Greetings, Your Majesty.

304
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:57,682
I hope my brother...

305
00:25:58,242 --> 00:26:00,107
will pardon my rudeness just now.

306
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,882
Absurd.

307
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,778
This is absurd!

308
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:43,066
You are the ruler of this land,

309
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,871
how could you commit
such unspeakable sin?

310
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:49,407
How long do you plan to lie to me?

311
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,609
She is not Rong Le.

312
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:53,897
She is Qin Yong's daughter, Qin Man!

313
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,376
I heard your conversation
with Lin Shen.

314
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,289
You plotted against Qin Yong
and got his whole family executed.

315
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,971
I won't allow you to
hurt Man Er again!

316
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:07,882
I am going to marry her.

317
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,632
No one can stop me from this.

318
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:11,266
You have grown tough,

319
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,220
how dare you eavesdrop on us!

320
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:14,776
Man Er!

321
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:17,897
Man Er!

322
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,466
You ordered him to bring me here.

323
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:37,336
You trained me.

324
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,216
You want me to impersonate
Princess Rong Le...

325
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,070
and be married to the Northern Realm.

326
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,016
But you are the murderer
that killed my family!

327
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:49,998
And you,

328
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,519
you clearly knew who I was.

329
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:55,318
You knew your mother killed my family.

330
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,196
But you said nothing.

331
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,223
Since you know everything,

332
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,127
then I...

333
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:11,334
have no more reason to let you stay.

334
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:15,816
Mother.

335
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:18,231
What do you want?

336
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,816
Man Er, run!

337
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,626
Run!

338
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,979
Qin Man Er!

339
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:31,540
If you step outside this hall,

340
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,530
I will kill him right here.

341
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,674
Run!

342
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,346
Run!

343
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,206
How could you...

344
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,913
Because of you,

345
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,757
he would even betray me.

346
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,467
A treacherous son like him...

347
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,252
will serve no purpose for me.

348
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,262
This is the 'Destined Poison'.

349
00:28:57,772 --> 00:29:00,025
Either you die, or he will.

350
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,152
The choice is yours.

351
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,307
Run!

352
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,644
Leave me be!

353
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,506
Run!

354
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,198
Man Er, no!

355
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,844
<i>Sorrow and joy.</i>

356
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:24,371
<i>I'm torn between the two.</i>

357
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:32,591
<i>When affections and passion...</i>

358
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,646
<i>have burnt off with the good,</i>

359
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,660
<i>I know that we can't go back anymore.
I know that I have to leave you.</i>

360
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:51,140
<i>Ignorance is bliss.</i>

361
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,951
<i>The sound of flute from my memory
reminds me of the love we have.</i>

362
00:30:57,347 --> 00:31:03,697
<i>When have it changed until
you no longer love me anymore.</i>

363
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,582
<i>I'm the one who made you leave me.</i>

364
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,246
Man Er.

365
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,132
You need to leave.

366
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:16,266
Never come back again.

367
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:23,264
<i>When the cloud and the rain
hears about your life,</i>

368
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:29,257
<i>even they will stop and wait for you.</i>

369
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,591
<i>I can saw you turning
your back towards me.</i>

370
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,820
<i>I weep for the good times
we had that was broken.</i>

371
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,381
<i>I have so many memories of you
but it'll never be enough.</i>

372
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:55,873
<i>The pain is unbearable.</i>

373
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,012
<i>Perhaps it was not meant to happen.</i>

374
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,104
<i>Brother Qi.</i>

375
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,616
<i>Brother.</i>

376
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:18,948
<i>The murderer of my family!</i>

377
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,848
<i>Who was talking to me just now?</i>

378
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,338
<i>What is this place?</i>

379
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,368
<i>Why am I here?</i>

380
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,429
<i>Yes.</i>

381
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,907
<i>Someone just told me to leave.</i>

382
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:27,310
<i>I'm the one who made you leave me.</i>

383
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:33,810
<i>It's the ultimate goal that
I'm trying to achieve.</i>

384
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:41,219
<i>When the cloud and the rain
hears about your life,</i>

385
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,785
<i>even they will stop and wait for you.</i>

386
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:52,980
<i>I can saw you turning
your back towards me.</i>

387
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,260
<i>I weep for the good times
we had that was broken.</i>

388
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:06,775
<i>I have so many memories of you
but it'll never be enough.</i>

389
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:12,076
<i>The pain is unbearable.</i>

390
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:21,574
<i>I tried to capture you
but I've broken your wings.</i>

391
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,766
Your Majesty.

392
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:29,018
Your Majesty, slowly.

393
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,089
Your Majesty.

394
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,144
The Empress Dowager arrives!

395
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,323
All hail the Empress Dowager.

396
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:54,602
Qi.

397
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,808
It pains me to see you
suffer from this sickness.

398
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,980
As long as...

399
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,810
you would just listen to me
like you used to,

400
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:10,020
complete this last mission for me,

401
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,763
I will give you the cure.

402
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,570
From that on,

403
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,346
you won't have to suffer the pain
of relapse every month...

404
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,961
and be controlled by others.

405
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,372
Qi.

406
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,898
You have done so much for that girl.

407
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:38,226
But your affections
mean nothing to her.

408
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,784
She doesn't even remember you now.

409
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,020
She sees you as an enemy.

410
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,700
Why must you...

411
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,668
keep lying to yourself
and be humiliated?

412
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,194
Besides,

413
00:35:56,925 --> 00:36:00,101
that girl is already
doomed to die soon.

414
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:03,378
She doesn't deserve you.

415
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:14,690
Mother.

416
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,793
If you try to hurt Rong Le again,

417
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,065
I will even give up my life...

418
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,344
in order to stop you.

419
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:44,525
Your Majesty?

420
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:46,731
Your Majesty?
Open your eyes!

421
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,380
-Your Majesty?
-Qi?

422
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:49,604
Your Majesty?

423
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:53,263
Your Majesty?
Open your eyes!

424
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,871
Your Majesty?

425
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,205
Your Majesty? Help!

426
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,231
Help! Bring the doctor here!

427
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,983
Send in the doctor!

428
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,273
Your Majesty?

429
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:06,122
Your Majesty?

430
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,695
From what I know about Rong Qi,

431
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,206
he would have taken precautions.

432
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:12,929
If we invade Western Qi now,

433
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,727
he will surely have us surrounded.

434
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,645
When the battle starts and
turns into a long fight,

435
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,029
Rong Le will be in greater danger.

436
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,700
Jiangdu can withstand seige.

437
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,380
If we charge in there recklessly,

438
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,055
there will be heavy casualties
and innocents will die.

439
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,973
Man Yao is still the
Princess of Western Qi.

440
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,545
There is nothing wrong
for a brother to take her home.

441
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,620
If we openly call for a war,

442
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:35,548
the reason may be unacceptable.

443
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,190
There is only one way to save Rong Le.

444
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,007
Divide the troops.

445
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,599
A stealthy infiltration.

446
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,873
Brother, I scouted the area ahead.

447
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,075
The northern gate is
their weakest point.

448
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,465
They never had a strong army
to begin with.

449
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:51,037
With our strength,

450
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,380
a focus attack on this area...

451
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,180
will force Rong Qi to
hand over Rong Le.

452
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,076
This is the best viable option.

453
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:58,666
We will only need
a hundred elite soldiers.

454
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,318
They will disguise as
common folks and merchants,

455
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,492
entering from different gates
at different timings.

456
00:38:05,038 --> 00:38:08,496
Agent Wu and men from Hidden Ones
are there to aid us.

457
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:10,301
We will split up.

458
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,275
When the time is right,
rendezvous in the city.

459
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:13,548
Very well.

460
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,772
Eunuch Xun!

461
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,258
-Fine.
-Eunuch Xun! Help!

462
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:29,800
-Eunuch Xun!
-I must talk to the Empress Dowager.

463
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,375
We will speak once I am back.

464
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,553
Eunuch Xun!

465
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:35,525
The food are meant to be sent
to Princess Rong Le in the Cold Harem.

466
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:39,477
But I heard the place is haunted
by ghost who hung herself.

467
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,073
I am scared!
Please, Eunuch Xun!

468
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,132
Send a guard as my escort!

469
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,599
Nonsense!

470
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,941
Even someone as delicate
as the Princess...

471
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,322
can live in that place.

472
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:51,115
You are a mere servant.

473
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,582
What do you have to be afraid?

474
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,660
-Eunuch Xun!
-Send the food there now!

475
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:56,423
Eunuch Xun!

476
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,933
Eunuch Xun!

477
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,122
Come out.

478
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,863
-Why are you here?
-I will take you to her.

479
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:30,503
Sure.

480
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,142
Sister!

481
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,482
Xiang! Why are you here?

482
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,093
Sister, it's my fault
for not protecting you.

483
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,301
You hands are so cold.

484
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,350
You can't stay here.

485
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:11,449
Where is your child?

486
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,884
 Rong Qi took him.

487
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,653
I don't know where my child is...

488
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,213
or if he is starving and feeling cold.

489
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,481
Don't worry.

490
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:30,949
Rong Qi took your son...

491
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,297
because he wants it as a leverage
against Prince Li.

492
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,031
Unless his got what he wants,

493
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,072
your child will still be safe.

494
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:38,945
Your Highness.

495
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,555
I will escort you out of here.

496
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,919
We need to go now.

497
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,792
We might be compromised soon.

498
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,382
We need to leave this place.

499
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:47,796
Sister, exchange your clothes with me.

500
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:50,470
Disguise as a servant
and leave with Xiang Ying.

501
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,015
What about you?

502
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:53,830
I...

503
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,108
I can always disguise as
someone else and escape.

504
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,189
I am not the one they are after.

505
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,970
It's easier for me to get away.

506
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,341
Sister.

507
00:41:04,483 --> 00:41:06,185
I finally found you.

508
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,727
I finally reunited with you.

509
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:10,790
We lost our parents.

510
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:13,332
You are the only family I have left.

511
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:15,351
I can't lose you too.

512
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,482
Nothing else matters now.
You need to go.

513
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,701
Hen Xiang.

514
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:21,697
You must stay alive.

515
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,020
-For your daughter.
-He is right.

516
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,774
You still have a daughter.

517
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,566
-My daughter is...
-She is gone.

518
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,589
What? What did you say?

519
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,167
My daughter is gone?

520
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,417
What happened?
How did she go missing?

521
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,363
I just returned from Qingzhou.

522
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:43,256
The foster family
that took her in said...

523
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,388
your daughter is missing.

524
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,182
Xiang, leave me here.

525
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:53,736
Just as you said,
my son will be safe.

526
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,333
You and Xiang Ying should
leave and search for your child.

527
00:41:56,478 --> 00:41:57,518
No.

528
00:41:57,794 --> 00:42:00,401
I can't leave you here by yourself.

529
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,340
The three of you, come out!

530
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,740
Lin Shen?

531
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,860
Don't you think this scene...

532
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,198
seems quite familiar?
