Episode 22

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,069
Our marriage has always been a lie.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,065
You know that you'll
use me more than once.

5
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:21,123
So, why do you keep on
lying to yourself...

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,580
and why do you want to
make things difficult for me?

7
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,605
Please go out.

8
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,384
I want to be by myself for a while.

9
00:00:58,952 --> 00:00:59,992
Rong Le.

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,540
Rong Le.

11
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:04,342
Don't scare me, Rong Le!

12
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,711
Sir.

13
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:20,601
Sir.

14
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:26,087
What's wrong with my wife?
When can she wake up?

15
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,297
General Fu.

16
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,061
Your wife's illness is very rare.

17
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:32,771
Although her pulse is weak,

18
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:35,298
it's not so weak until
she'll lose consciousness.

19
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:38,608
I think the reason she fainted
is of a psychological factor.

20
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:40,504
This kind of illness...

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,700
can only be treated
on the mental plane.

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,627
I can only give her some
medicine for nourishment...

23
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,942
and help her to recuperate.

24
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:50,479
As for whether or not she can wake up,

25
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,673
it'll be up to fate to decide.

26
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,843
Thank you, Sir.

27
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:03,964
-See him out.
-Yes, General Fu.

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,140
Let me.

29
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,465
<i>I don't think that we will be
talking anymore after this.</i>

30
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,352
<i>We have been through so much.</i>

31
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:24,564
When will she wake?

32
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,347
<i>Why didn't I realise it sooner?</i>

33
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:33,910
<i>My heart is bleeding
when I saw you leaving me.</i>

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,424
<i>There was once...</i>

35
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:41,217
<i>when we were so happy together.</i>

36
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,325
<i>Although we haven't known each other
for long, I already miss you so.</i>

37
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:50,883
<i>Do you dare to...</i>

38
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,169
When Brother Wu You rushed there
to save Princess Rong Le today,

39
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,564
I've never seen him...

40
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,936
so anxious and agitated before.

41
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,339
I think Brother Wu You still
cares about Princess Rong Le.

42
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,470
Impossible that he'll fall in love
with Miss Sun in Qingzhou.

43
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,847
Brother Wu You won't
shilly-shally like that.

44
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,860
Wu You's mind...

45
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,229
is not something that
we can comprehend.

46
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:18,134
I think there must be some
misunderstanding between them.

47
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,757
When I went fishing with
Princess Rong Le today,

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,620
she was so shook
when she heard that...

49
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,460
Brother Wu You is coming back.

50
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,429
She still cares about
Brother Wu You for sure.

51
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,902
They love each other,
but they cannot be together.

52
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:33,105
It's so unfortunate.

53
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,646
It's hard to find love in that
reciprocates this world.

54
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:40,930
They love each other
but they cannot be together.

55
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:44,155
It's better off if they remain
as strangers since the beginning.

56
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:46,823
So,

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,460
we can't make the
same mistake as them.

58
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:52,000
We have to be together forever...

59
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,971
until we are old and gray.

60
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:03,529
<i>I don't think that we will be
talking anymore after this.</i>

61
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,608
<i>We have been through so much.</i>

62
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,223
<i>Why didn't I realise it sooner?</i>

63
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:17,066
<i>My heart is bleeding
when I saw you leaving me.</i>

64
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,488
<i>There was once...</i>

65
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:24,321
<i>when we were so happy together.</i>

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,277
<i>Although we haven't known each other
for long, I already miss you so.</i>

67
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,229
<i>Do you dare to...</i>

68
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,828
<i>face the possible truth?</i>

69
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:44,167
<i>I cried when you leave and I keep on
reminiscing the happy times we had.</i>

70
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,544
<i>The regrets that I have...</i>

71
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:51,458
<i>will last me a lifetime.</i>

72
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:58,108
<i>After all of those hardships,
we are no longer young.</i>

73
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,832
<i>I'm doomed to live
in loneliness forever.</i>

74
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,749
<i>It's bad but I can't help it.</i>

75
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,780
" General's Manor "

76
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:18,130
<i>After all the boom and bust,
I have lost all hope.</i>

77
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:23,081
General Fu, let me feed the princess.

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,271
You've been awake for
three days and three nights.

79
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:50,301
<i>Let's drink to forget our worries
and bottoms up for...</i>

80
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,118
<i>you who have turned gray.</i>

81
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,754
You may leave now.

82
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,187
Yes, General Fu.

83
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:06,656
Rong Le.

84
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,407
Are you punishing me...

85
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:13,203
or is the heaven punishing me?

86
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,613
I can't bear with this kind
of punishment.

87
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,692
As long as you can wake up,

88
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,648
I don't care...

89
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,494
if you don't love me,

90
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,099
I don't care if you leave me...

91
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,204
or...

92
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,197
even hate me.

93
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,122
I don't care as long as
you can wake up.

94
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:51,848
Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,

95
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,736
shining bright and bring us light.

96
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:59,414
The Zhou kingdom has its age,

97
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:03,369
but the fate of nation
is yet to be known.

98
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:09,025
The princess is awake.

99
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,749
You are awake, Rong Le.

100
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,216
Do you feel unwell anywhere?

101
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Come.

102
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:25,076
Ling Yue.

103
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:28,708
Slowly, Princess.

104
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:33,381
If you don't feel well, do you want me
to get you a physician?

105
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,797
What happened to me?

106
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,086
Princess, you've fainted.

107
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,174
And you are out like a light
for three days and three nights.

108
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:42,844
General Fu has never left your side
for these three days.

109
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,773
He had stayed with you all the while.

110
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,300
How about this?

111
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,084
Ling Yue, take a good care
of Lady Rong Le...

112
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,936
and give her some food.

113
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,923
-I'll leave now.
-Yes, General Fu.

114
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,651
-Princess, anywhere else feels off?
-General Fu.

115
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,460
General Fu, aren't you going to eat?

116
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,418
Is your headache still there?

117
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:13,186
Princess, for the three days
when you were out,

118
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,300
General Fu hasn't
eaten or drank anything.

119
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,693
" Tranquil Garden "

120
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,780
Princess Rong Le,
Miss Chen Yu is here.

121
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:29,429
Mistress. I heard that you've
lost consciousness for three days.

122
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:31,143
I'm fine.

123
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,402
Ling Yue, go and have a rest.

124
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:34,619
Yes, Princess.

125
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,832
Have a seat.

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,380
Are you alright?

127
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,462
Ling Yue told me that you
had a fight with General Fu.

128
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,260
At first, I thought that...

129
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:53,048
the General's Manor will be
my home for the rest of my life.

130
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,707
Now, it looks like I'm too naive.

131
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,228
This world is so big
and yet I belong in nowhere.

132
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,665
I don't know where my home is.

133
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,337
Don't say that, Mistress.

134
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,230
You have a home for sure.

135
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,992
But you've just forgotten
about where it is.

136
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,980
That's right.

137
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:12,900
I dreamt about Yu's Fort before this.

138
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,340
That place has become
clearer and clearer to me.

139
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:18,399
Have you ever thought of
going into that fort again?

140
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,738
Maybe you can remember more
if you go there again.

141
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:16,214
Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,

142
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,780
shining bright and bring us light.

143
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:21,358
The Zhou kingdom has its age,

144
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,365
but the fate of nation
is yet to be known.

145
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,861
<i>Shilixiang wine.</i>

146
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,658
<i>Who is she?</i>

147
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,620
Greetings, General Fu.

148
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:58,517
General, the princess...

149
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,649
What's wrong with the princess?

150
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,115
There's nothing wrong with her.
But she went to...

151
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,460
Moon Embrace Teahouse this morning
with Miss Chen Yu...

152
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,220
and she hasn't been back since.

153
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,740
General Fu, it's already so late.

154
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,260
Do you want to send someone
to bring her back?

155
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:20,919
General Fu.

156
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:29,192
How about you reheat
this medicine for her first?

157
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,601
Yes, General Fu.

158
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,557
<i>Who is she?</i>

159
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,369
I thought that you were
never coming back.

160
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,161
I thought that I'll never
see you again in this lifetime.

161
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:06,259
I won't leave this place.

162
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,426
Does that mean that...

163
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,861
you'll forgive me?

164
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:14,881
I'll keep my promise.

165
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,481
In another half a year's time,
everything will come to an end.

166
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,331
Is it going to be just...

167
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:27,975
a cold and frigid agreement
between us?

168
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:32,478
I hope that you won't forget
about the promise that you made.

169
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:36,698
I remember.

170
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:41,025
I'll respect your wish
and I won't force you.

171
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,820
If your heart is still made of stone
after half a year,

172
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,624
I'll part ways with you and
set you free. And I won't...

173
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,580
And I won't go back on my words.

174
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,508
I'm tired.

175
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,919
I want to rest.

176
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:57,359
Tomorrow, Prince Zhen Bei
has invited us...

177
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,276
to Moon Embrace Teahouse for tea.

178
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,159
Are you willing to
join me for tomorrow?

179
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,300
I'll go with you tomorrow.

180
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,916
Since I've already made
a promise with you,

181
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,395
for the next half of a year,

182
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,871
I'll abide by my duties
as the general's wife.

183
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,878
<i>Who is she?</i>

184
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,419
Greetings, Prince Zhen Bei.

185
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,820
Greetings, Prince Zhen Bei.

186
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,142
No need to be so polite.

187
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,184
The things that I dislike the most
are the highfalutin titles.

188
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,287
Those Your Highness,
Princess or Prince.

189
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,072
Not only they are meaningless,
they are so tiring.

190
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,251
They are just titles
given to me by others.

191
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,838
I chose to have a gathering at
Moon Embrace Teahouse today...

192
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,646
because this place is
refreshing and elegant.

193
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,243
If we talk about titles here,

194
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,899
it'll be such a bummer.

195
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,858
You are right.

196
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,290
The essence of drinking tea
is all about equality.

197
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:51,162
Because of a cup of tea,

198
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,741
we put those wealth, rank,
status and superiority behind us.

199
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,780
We'll discard all of that and
treat each other as equal.

200
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,614
Good. Then we'll treat each other...

201
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,527
as equal today and call each
other by names, how about that?

202
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,646
You can just address me as Qian Yi.

203
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,643
So, everything that is hard in this
world is just an easy feat for you.

204
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,020
If everything is easy for me,
then everything is happy for you.

205
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:16,232
As for Fu Chou,

206
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,381
it sounds like the word revenge.

207
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,780
That's not good.
We'll call you General Fu instead.

208
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,260
Let's not talk about
revenge all the time.

209
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,820
That's too ferocious.

210
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:27,124
Come, have a seat.

211
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,119
-After you.
-After you.

212
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:54,761
Thank you.

213
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,742
Rong Le, you don't like this tea?

214
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:06,856
This is the Phoenix Narcissus tea
that I brought from Chen.

215
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,700
And I cooked it myself.

216
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,554
Is there anything wrong with it?

217
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:13,464
Don't misunderstand, Qian Yi.

218
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:15,136
This is a high quality tea.

219
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:17,218
But tea is a type of
high quality tree.

220
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,380
It took sustenance from
the mountains and rivers.

221
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,620
So they need to be steeped
with natural mineral water.

222
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,849
But for this narcissus tea,
you need to steep it with dew water...

223
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:27,460
in order to bring out
the essence of the tea.

224
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,049
Looks like you are quite
knowledgeable in the art of tea.

225
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:35,044
Unfortunately, I didn't bring
any dew water with me today.

226
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,150
Looks like I've wasted
a good quality tea.

227
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,608
No need to be so regretful.

228
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:43,741
Since you are here in the teahouse,
you will have your dew water.

229
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,877
I'm sure that the mistress here
won't mind about it.

230
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:48,309
Mistress?

231
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,313
Are you saying that you
know the owner of this teahouse?

232
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,539
Not only I know her, even you...

233
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,249
know her too.

234
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,004
So, the guest that I've
invited is actually...

235
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
the owner of this
teahouse that we are in.

236
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,000
Rong Le, you are so full of surprise.

237
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:08,843
That day in Qingliang Lake,

238
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,220
I thought that you are just a
daughter of an official.

239
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,243
I never thought that you'll turn out
to be elder princess of Western Qi.

240
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,033
After that, when I saw that
you were saved by Prince Li,

241
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,100
I thought that you are
Prince Li's wife.

242
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:22,651
But I never thought that your husband
is actually General Fu.

243
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,750
Since you are the owner
of this teahouse,

244
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,219
I'm sure that...

245
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,912
you've spent a lot of
happy moments here.

246
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,128
I'm sure that this
teahouse contains...

247
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:35,844
your love story, right?

248
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,724
General Fu, from your expression,

249
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,565
you must be thinking about some
sweet memories from the past.

250
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,532
I never thought that
a warrior like you...

251
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,507
will feel shy when it comes to love.

252
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,128
I'll get the dew water.

253
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,420
Thank you.

254
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,028
Please excuse me for a moment.

255
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:00,511
Rong Le.

256
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:05,115
You haven't recovered fully yet.

257
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:07,930
Tell me where the dew water is.
I'll get it.

258
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,396
There's a very specific way
to cook dew water.

259
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,354
It's better if I cook it myself.
I'll bring it over when it's done.

260
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:30,847
Your Highness.
I didn't protect you well enough...

261
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:33,013
when you were in
Qingliang Lake that day.

262
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:34,749
I've failed my duty.

263
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:38,113
Not only I won't blame you for it,

264
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,222
I wish to thank you for it.

265
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:43,702
Thank me for it?

266
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:45,250
Why?

267
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,288
If it wasn't for you and
your troops that came late,

268
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,859
I wouldn't have the chance...

269
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,845
to get to know about my two saviours.

270
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,580
You mentioned about two saviours.

271
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,304
Besides Rong Le, the other one is...

272
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,860
The other one is Prince Li.

273
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,053
That day, not only had
Prince Li saved Rong Le,

274
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,267
he even sent someone to protect me
and to send me back to my inn.

275
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,580
If it wasn't for these two saviours,

276
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,376
I would have lost my life.

277
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,532
That's why I've prepared a banquet
in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

278
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,122
I want to thank my
two saviours properly.

279
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:27,067
One has to repay others' help
no matter how small it is.

280
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:30,308
Although you and your troops
were late that day,

281
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,172
you had helped me taken care of
the aftermath of the incident.

282
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,201
I should thank you as well.

283
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:38,691
So,

284
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,257
are you saying that...

285
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,627
-Prince Li will be here today as well?
-Yes.

286
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:45,420
I think he will be here soon.

287
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,471
General Fu, why did you look
so pale all of the sudden?

288
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,948
Rong Le hasn't recovered fully yet.

289
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,579
I'm worried that it'll be hard for her
to move around. Let me check on her.

290
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,508
Yes, you should keep
a close eye on her.

291
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,566
You have such an
exotic lady as your wife.

292
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,493
You should treasure her well.

293
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,260
You are very right.
Pray excuse me.

294
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

295
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:18,915
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

296
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:22,916
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

297
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:26,673
<i>to melt it.</i>

298
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:32,153
<i>We are fated to get hurt
from the moment we met each other.</i>

299
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:36,591
<i>I miss you but I can only
gaze at you in silence.</i>

300
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,039
<i>You are keeping me out with your care.</i>

301
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,934
<i>Although we are together, I feel lost.</i>

302
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:49,621
Rong Le.

303
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:55,285
Are you alright?

304
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,804
Are your hand alright?

305
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,615
Your hand is so red.

306
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,613
Don't worry, my hand is fine.

307
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,179
Prince Li. Finally, you are here.

308
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:21,263
Greetings, Prince Li.

309
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,194
Why are all of you standing here?

310
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,900
Did something happen?

311
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:28,843
Your Highness.

312
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,401
My wife's hands were scalded
by the teapot just now.

313
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:35,903
So I need to bring her back
to my manor now.

314
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,181
It's unfortunate that we won't be able
to drink tea together today.

315
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:41,885
I'll have to take a rain check.

316
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,746
I have to take an early leave
for your banquet today.

317
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,260
It's very rude of me.

318
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,763
If you don't mind,

319
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,490
please come to my manor next time.

320
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,752
I'll treat you cordially.

321
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,528
Rong Le.

322
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,472
Am I right?

323
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,544
Yes.

324
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,660
Your Highness.

325
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,963
Farewell.

326
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,334
Prince Li.

327
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,299
Farewell.

328
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:27,463
Let's go.

329
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,899
Looks like this pot of good tea...

330
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,230
is prepared specifically
for me and you.

331
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,175
Would you give me the honour
to drink some tea with you?

332
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,532
Of course I wouldn't leave
without having tea first.

333
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:51,178
-After you.
-After you.

334
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:10,365
General Fu, in order to thank
Princess Rong Le for her tea today,

335
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,097
Prince Zhen Bei has specifically
asked me to give this to you.

336
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:15,082
Prince Zhen Bei is too kind.

337
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,755
General Fu, please pardon me.

338
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,305
Prince Zhen Bei has asked me...

339
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:22,614
to hand this gift to
Princess Rong Le herself.

340
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,034
Prince Zhen Bei has picked out
this gift himself.

341
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,930
He hopes that you'll like it.

342
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:33,936
Send my thanks to Prince Zhen Bei.

343
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,099
Prince Zhen Bei might look
bold and free-spirited...

344
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,826
but he's actually a shrewd person.

345
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,471
He's not someone you can call friend
just after meeting him by chance.

346
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,810
From now on, it's better for you
to be careful when you are with him.

347
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,680
You worry too much.

348
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,790
I hope you are right.

349
00:27:57,847 --> 00:28:00,807
No matter what kind of a person
he is or what purpose he has,

350
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,495
he had said something today...

351
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,715
that had struck deep within me.

352
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,330
What is it?

353
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:11,779
He said that I've seen
so many battles and death...

354
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:15,684
and yet I am visibly moved by love.

355
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:20,653
Actually, I used to think that...

356
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,074
I can face death with equanimity.

357
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,948
But I never thought that
there will be a person...

358
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:27,535
in this world...

359
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:30,157
who can put me in
an awkward predicament...

360
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,027
and take away my composure.

361
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:42,766
The water that is used in this tea...

362
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,273
is the dew water from
Rong Le's possession.

363
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,288
She had cooked it herself.

364
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,295
It's unfortunate that I didn't get
to let her steep my tea for me.

365
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:53,834
What do you think about this tea,
Prince Li?

366
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,603
A cup of tea that is steep
in the same water...

367
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,999
and with the same tea leaves...

368
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:02,606
will taste different...

369
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,423
for different kind of people.

370
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,295
Of course.
What you taste from the tea...

371
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:11,221
will depend on what you feel
when you drink it.

372
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,349
So, what are you...

373
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,327
feeling right now?

374
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,591
My heart is indeed trapped by someone.

375
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:23,863
I think that person must be...

376
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,767
Princess Rong Le.

377
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:29,224
If it's indeed Rong Le,

378
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:33,002
why would I sit here and
drink tea with you now?

379
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:35,326
Then, are you saying that...

380
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,107
I'm that someone?

381
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,786
I've always hated those insincere...

382
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,483
guesses and probing in the court.

383
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,594
That day in Qingliang Lake,

384
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,879
you are willing to entrust
your life to Rong Le...

385
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:51,445
of who you've just met.

386
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,269
So, I'm willing to believe that...

387
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,249
you are not a pretentious
and hypocritical person.

388
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,681
Thus, I'm willing to be
straightforward with you today.

389
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:04,409
I have a question for you today.

390
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:07,778
I've heard that you are an
unruly and unbridled person.

391
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:10,972
Now that I've talked to you,
it is indeed true.

392
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,020
I am the kind of person who
can be more pretentious...

393
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:15,859
if I meet a hypocrite.

394
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,860
When I meet an honest
and frank person like you,

395
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,016
I can be very forthright too.

396
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,461
Prince Li, please don't hesitate...

397
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,069
to ask me any questions that you want.

398
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:28,969
It's just a simple question.

399
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:32,819
You've came all the way
from Chen to Zhongshan...

400
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:35,607
to form a marriage alliance
with Northern Realm.

401
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,836
What's your purpose for doing so?

402
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,808
Are you going to sit back...

403
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:45,681
and reap the benefits while
letting us do all the dirty works?

404
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:48,911
Before this, I heard that you've
put down the rebellion in...

405
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:51,177
southern fringe with just
a snap of your fingers.

406
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:53,570
So, you know better than me that...

407
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,380
all is fair in war.

408
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,940
Since you want to go into
war against Wei,

409
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,284
I'm sure that you've already...

410
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,830
thought of the strategies
to strengthen your defence.

411
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,769
Alright. That's all I have to ask.

412
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:08,803
If you have any questions for me,

413
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:10,641
you can go ahead and ask me too.

414
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:13,935
I've invited you here today because...

415
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,990
first, I want to thank you...

416
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,765
for saving my life in
Qingliang Lake that day.

417
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:20,152
And second,

418
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,849
I did have something
that I wish to ask you.

419
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,021
Please go ahead.

420
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,940
Actually, compared to the war that was
triggered by setting up new territory,

421
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:33,436
I'm more interested in the benevolence
policy used by Northern Realm.

422
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,949
I heard that before this,
Lady Yun and Sir Qin Yong...

423
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:38,989
had carried out a
People-Based Transformation.

424
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:40,800
And all the measures regarding
this transformation...

425
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,675
are recorded in a book named
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

426
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,098
Have you ever seen this book before?

427
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:54,350
This book is the fruit of my mother
and my teacher's lifelong efforts.

428
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:56,883
It is their legacy.

429
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,180
This book is meant to bring
peace to the country...

430
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,220
so that the people
can live serene life.

431
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,115
But they never thought that...

432
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,801
at that same year, that book will
cause such irreparable disaster.

433
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:11,190
And so many were dragged into it.

434
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:15,396
Even I had once paid a hefty price...

435
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:18,058
in order to get that book.

436
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,692
So, the real reason you are here...

437
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,992
is to get your hands on that book.

438
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:28,357
Then you have to forgive me for
keeping it a secret from you.

439
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,980
You've misunderstood.

440
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:34,449
It's true that I want to get
that book to help my people.

441
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,788
But I don't plan to possess it...

442
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
and I don't plan to take it by force.

443
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:40,598
Then I hope that...

444
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,164
you'll never forget about
what you've said today.

445
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:46,164
Remember your original intention
for your people.

446
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:50,659
But I still have
another question for you.

447
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,001
Are you going to ask about...

448
00:32:55,203 --> 00:32:57,340
me and Rong Le's past?

449
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,962
I can see that you love
each other very much.

450
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,867
You are such a forthright person.

451
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,299
Why do you choose to be bound
by the rules of etiquette?

452
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,792
If I get to meet my one true love,

453
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,560
I'll smash through all shackles
to give her a life of happiness.

454
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,547
Maybe it's just like you've said.

455
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,551
You want to initiate the
People-Based Transformation.

456
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,419
But you don't plan to
possess that book.

457
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:27,009
Both are the same.

458
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,354
I love her but it doesn't mean
that I have to possess her.

459
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:36,071
Alright. I hope that you won't
regret it for the rest of your life.

460
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,746
By the way,
that day in Qingliang Lake,

461
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,531
Princess Zhao Yun had
gotten hurt because of me too.

462
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,460
How is she doing?

463
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:47,017
She is fine.

464
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,757
Thank you for asking.

465
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:50,442
Great.

466
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,701
I'll make sure to
visit her next time...

467
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,180
to thank her personally.

468
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,832
Cheers.

469
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:14,012
Your Highness.
The cut on your hand is very deep.

470
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,100
Although I've already changed
your dressing twice,

471
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:18,642
make sure that it stays dry.

472
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,909
Thank you, sir.

473
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:23,124
Wu You.

474
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:25,555
You never got hurt even when
you went into war in Qingzhou.

475
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,177
But you've gotten yourself hurt
when you saw her in Zhongshan.

476
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:30,118
Why did both of you
cross path so often?

477
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,660
I heard that Prince Zhen Bei
has invited your for tea...

478
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:35,585
in Moon Embrace Teahouse
together with Fu Chou and Man...

479
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,614
Have a drink, Wu You.

480
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,420
What do you think
about Prince Zhen Bei?

481
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:49,661
I really admire him because
he is very forthcoming.

482
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,484
But he is a very enigmatic man.

483
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,190
We have to guard against him.

484
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,024
I want to get in touch
more often with him.

485
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,334
By the way, have you told father
about you and Zhao Yun's marriage?

486
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:03,571
I've been wanting to tell him
since I came back from Qingzhou.

487
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:05,552
One time, I almost told him.

488
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,340
But then, you appeared.

489
00:35:07,495 --> 00:35:10,666
As soon as he saw you,
he doesn't have time for me anymore.

490
00:35:12,189 --> 00:35:14,989
After a delay comes a let.
Don't delay it anymore.

491
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:18,845
Your Highness. Miss Sun is here.

492
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,522
Bring her in.

493
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,918
Greetings, Prince Li.
Greetings, Prince Chen.

494
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,585
Sister Ya Li, you came right on time.

495
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,779
Wu You has just talked about
playing chess and here you are.

496
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,620
Both of you have quite the same mind.

497
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:36,819
You are joking around again.

498
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:39,861
I heard that Prince Li
has hurt his hand.

499
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,962
So, I've brought him some ointment.

500
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,225
It's just a small wound.
Nothing serious.

501
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:45,929
Thank you for taking the trouble.

502
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,460
Wu You. Continue with your chat.

503
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,060
Woodenhead. Let's go.

504
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:56,716
-This is...
-Ya Li.

505
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,553
Don't bother with the formalities.

506
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,804
You've never visited me at night.

507
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,074
You must be here today because
you have something to tell me.

508
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:06,787
Please go ahead and do so.

509
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:09,825
Look like I can never
hide anything from you.

510
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:13,625
I'm here today because
I need your help.

511
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:17,349
The empress has invited
royal families and nobles...

512
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,460
for a flower-viewing in
her backyard tomorrow.

513
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:23,263
I would like to invite you along.

514
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,416
Since you like flowers,

515
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,278
let's go together then.

516
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:32,739
For tomorrow's banquet,

517
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:35,827
I'll leave you to be
in charge of everything.

518
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,364
Your Majesty, I won't let you down.

519
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,060
Although this banquet...

520
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:45,277
is just a banquet to let
Prince Zhen Bei choose his bride,

521
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,664
a lot is at stake in this banquet.

522
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:51,071
Nothing can go wrong.

523
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Do you have any ideas on...

524
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:57,148
who will be Prince Zhen Bei's choice?

525
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:58,773
I...

526
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,620
hear that the daughter of Sir Sun,

527
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:04,296
Sun Ya Li, always comes here
to visit you.

528
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,220
You drink tea together and
both of you clicked well together.

529
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:11,072
Sun Ya Li is the most
gifted lady in Zhongshan.

530
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,813
She is proficient in anything
from playing music to drawing.

531
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:17,334
What do you think about Sun Ya Li?

532
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,480
Ya Li...

533
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,226
is indeed a gentle and refined lady.

534
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,080
And she is intelligent
and well-reasoned.

535
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,922
I'll hate to part with her...

536
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:31,528
if she has to be married to Chen.

537
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:35,085
I think it'll more so for Prince Li.

538
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:37,632
I heard from Wu Yu that...

539
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,299
Wu You and Sun Ya Li have
gotten along quite well in Qingzhou.

540
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:45,308
She has exchanged gifts
as love-promise with Wu You.

541
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,914
I think both of them are
inseparable right now.

542
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,730
Wu You was already hurt once...

543
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,668
because of Princess Rong Le.

544
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,610
I couldn't bear...

545
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,800
for him to be hurt again...

546
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,039
if Ya Li has to be married to Chen.

547
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:04,704
Your Highness.
Please consider it carefully.

548
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:33,169
He gave her wine?

549
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,350
Prince Zhen Bei is too bad
in giving gift to others.

550
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,620
Doesn't he know that
princess dislike wine?

551
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:44,748
It's so fragrant.

552
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,019
Princess, this wine has
a sweet smell to it.

553
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,550
Do you want to have a taste?

554
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,404
I hope that this can
absolve your worries.

555
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:20,920
Your Highness.

556
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,320
I don't want to bring
any troubles to you.

557
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,175
How about I stay for a few days
in this General's Manor?

558
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:29,608
Xiang.

559
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,367
What if I miss you when you are here?

560
00:39:41,132 --> 00:39:42,925
Greetings, General Fu.

561
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,890
Greetings, Crown Prince.

562
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:48,345
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

563
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:52,823
I'm sorry for making you wait for me.

564
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,363
Xiang, sit down.

565
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:57,459
General Fu.

566
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,187
Your servant told me that you've
came back since just now.

567
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:02,545
What took you so long?

568
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,780
Is there anything...

569
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:06,572
more important than discussing
the government affairs with me?

570
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,889
I'm sorry for being too inconsiderate.

571
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,424
It's just that my wife
has accidentally...

572
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,695
scalded her hand when
we were at the teahouse.

573
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,520
I've brought in a physician
to treat her.

574
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:17,621
But I'm too worried about her.

575
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,697
That's why I'm late to this meeting.

576
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,470
Please forgive me.

577
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,285
Your wife was hurt.

578
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,207
-Yes.
-I can understand that.

579
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,860
I am a person who...

580
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,380
shows tender care to women as well.

581
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm very envious that...

582
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,951
you and Lady Xiang
are so loving together.

583
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:38,644
Enough, General Fu.

584
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,507
Don't stand there.
Take a seat.

585
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:43,194
I've specially brought us
some good wine today.

586
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,860
Let's drink while we talk.

587
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,289
-Have a seat.
-Thank you, Crown Prince.

588
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,261
Serve some wine for the general.

589
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:58,726
General Fu.

590
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,740
General Fu!

591
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,559
Looks like you are still worried
about your wife's wound.

592
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,473
I've embarrassed myself
in front of you.

593
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:16,735
Cheers.

594
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:27,186
What's wrong with you?

595
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,932
Looks like Lady Xiang is
really up for some wine today.
