00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,140
Episode 6

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,180
In order to save me,

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,980
you have a fallout with
the Crown Prince.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,980
People might take it wrongly
if words got out.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,180
What they think is none
of your concern.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,260
But for me, you are...

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,420
a rare well-matched partner in chess.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,260
I really enjoy playing chess with you.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,260
I don't wish to be affected
by common views.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,940
Did you really save me...

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,540
for the sake of chess only?

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,940
<i>You who came to a strange land
to build our lands together.</i>

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,420
<i>I think of you
when night has fallen...</i>

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,380
<i>and when the fog has parted.</i>

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,820
Your Highness. We have reached
the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,780
<i>My yearning for you has turned you...</i>

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,780
Thank you, Your Highness. Farewell.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,660
<i>You are my happiness,
my worries and...</i>

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,980
<i>my abyss.</i>

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,980
<i>I can't touch you for you are like...</i>

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,500
<i>the reflection in water.</i>

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,260
<i>I don't want distance...</i>

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,100
-Leng Yan.
-Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,100
-Let's go back.
-Yes, Your Highness.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,660
<i>I just want to watch you...</i>

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,900
<i>in this cold world.</i>

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,660
I didn't manage to protect you.
I have failed the emperor.

29
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,420
And I have failed you too.

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
You did well in arranging
the matters in the manor.

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,860
Ling Yue and Lian Xin
have become smarter too.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,540
I should have gone back immediately.

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,820
But Long Yue has destroyed
all the contraptions.

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,740
-And I can't just use the front door.
-Mistress.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,540
Mistress.

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,180
Thank you for sacrificing
yourself to save me.

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,060
It's my fault for not being
meticulous enough...

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,820
until I have caused you such disgrace.

39
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,060
If you need anything else from now on,

40
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,980
I'll put my life to it.

41
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,060
We are here in Northern Realm.

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,740
We should take care of each other
and complete this mission.

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,580
I won't let you sacrifice yourself.

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,580
Thank you, Mistress.

45
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,300
How's Chen Yu?

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,140
She is still unconscious
from being severely wounded.

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,420
Prince Chen has already sent
someone over to treat her.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,300
She can come when
she's feeling better.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,780
I'll leave this Moon Embrace
Teahouse to you.

50
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,380
We can no longer use this place
as our rendezvous point.

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,220
We need to find a
new place immediately.

52
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,620
Yes. Don't worry, Mistress.

53
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,060
I already made the arrangement
last night. We can get in touch...

54
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,980
with Kite and Western Qi soon.

55
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,660
But we can no longer use
the original secret path.

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,620
Meanwhile, I hope that
you can stay put...

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,620
while I look for
another route for you.

58
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,980
For now, it's better if you
go back to the manor at once...

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,820
in case something else happens.

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,140
Arrival of Her Majesty!

61
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,940
Greetings, mother.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,100
It has already been two months.

63
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,620
Why isn't there any progress at all?

64
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,620
Don't be anxious, mother.

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,580
-Recently, the Kite...
-You can't be overcautious.

66
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,900
You need to give them a kick.

67
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,900
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,140
Your Majesty. Drink the medicine.

70
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,060
You'll feel better after you take it.

71
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,220
Go out.

72
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,380
<i>I am in good health.</i>

73
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,180
<i>No need to worry about me.</i>

74
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,660
<i>As for the rare book hunt,</i>

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,660
<i>put your safety before
everything else.</i>

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,700
<i>There is no rush.</i>

77
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,260
<i>I feel relieved that
you are doing well...</i>

78
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,820
<i>in the Northern Realm.</i>

79
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,620
Xiao Sha.

80
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,700
What do you need, Princess?

81
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,820
For the Eastern Suburb Inn
and the man that saved me...

82
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,780
that I had asked you
to investigate in,

83
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,380
have you found anything about them?

84
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,300
I already checked the inn.

85
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,820
It often has a lot of customers
and it looks normal enough.

86
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,340
As for that man,

87
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,580
I had asked the innkeeper.
He did remember the man.

88
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,780
But that man left after
staying for just a day.

89
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,460
And he didn't leave behind his name.

90
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,580
It might be because
I was wounded that day.

91
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,140
That's why he has to find the
nearest inn the treat my wounds.

92
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,540
I don't think it's necessary
for you to repay his kindness.

93
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,500
In this world, this kind
of meeting is a fate.

94
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
But there is something that
I have been wanting...

95
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,780
to report to you after
some considerations.

96
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,020
I think I know what it is.

97
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,100
Answer me first.

98
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,780
Did you touch the lock on this box?

99
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
That box contains the secret letters
between you and the emperor.

100
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,500
And I have never touched it.

101
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,340
Usually, only you, me,
Ling Yue and Lian Xin...

102
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,620
can come into this room.

103
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,620
And you are the only one who
knew what's inside.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,180
But I believe you.

105
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,460
Are you going to report that
there are spies in our midst?

106
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,700
How did you know?

107
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,660
By the way, where is the assassin
that was knocked unconscious?

108
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,100
That day, after I changed
and came out from the room,

109
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,740
I saw that the hiding spot for the
assassin was not very secure.

110
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,020
I was afraid that
he'll cause troubles if he wakes.

111
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,220
That's why me and Lian Xin
tied up his hands and legs...

112
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,740
and threw him into
the firewood storeroom.

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,260
After that, we rushed to your side...

114
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,380
and we don't know what happened next.

115
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,980
That's right.

116
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,660
After Yu Wen Jie barged into my manor,

117
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,780
I started to feel that
something is not right.

118
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,900
How can two girls that
grew up in a palace...

119
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,020
know how to deal with an assassin
so cleanly and neatly?

120
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,740
And somebody has touched this lock.

121
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,180
I had laid down a trap
when I designed this box.

122
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,660
That's right. Recently, I had
found some problems as well.

123
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,260
-Princess Rong Le.
-Princess Zhao Yun!

124
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,060
Princess Rong Le.

125
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,260
I had read Princess Zhao Yun's pulse.

126
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,340
Her blood flow is blocked. I think
someone pressed on her pressure point.

127
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,380
She didn't faint because
of the drugging mist.

128
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,420
No one else can know about this.
Keep a close eye for these few days.

129
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Yes, Princess.

130
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,860
Lately, the weather is very nice.

131
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,700
Everything is coming to life.

132
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,380
I'm old already,

133
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,660
I have to come out and
take a walk more.

134
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,140
Luckily I have you to accompany me.

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,500
It's my fortune to be able
to accompany you.

136
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,020
Moreover, you are still young.

137
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,700
There are many troublesome things in
this palace. Here, we grow old fast.

138
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,300
But under the spring sunlight,

139
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,820
you look so lively.

140
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,100
It must be because
something good has happened.

141
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,460
I heard from your father that...

142
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,500
Wu You has already promised...

143
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,420
to go flower viewing with you
in the suburb in a few days' time.

144
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,780
Prince Chen is tagging along too.

145
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,900
Both of them are very busy.

146
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,940
So, we haven't set the date.

147
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,060
Actually, I'm already very happy
that I can accompany you...

148
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,060
to come out for a walk.

149
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,780
Look at you.

150
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,300
I heard that Princess Rong Le
has recovered.

151
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,100
How about you pay her
a visit in my stead...

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,980
and invite her along
for your excursion?

153
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,140
We can use this chance...

154
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,140
to matchmake her and Wu Yu.

155
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,580
Prince Chen and Prince Li
are very close.

156
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,620
If Princess Rong Le is willing
to marry Prince Chen,

157
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,060
His Majesty will be
glad to see that too.

158
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,540
Alright.

159
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,460
You have a good taste.

160
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,900
This hairpin is from western region.
It's expertly carved in copper.

161
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,900
The carved flowers
symbolises good fortune.

162
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,580
They said that Moon Embrace Teahouse
has a mysterious Rare Item Chamber.

163
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,940
And it contains treasures from all
over the world. I'll take this.

164
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,780
Welcome to the
Rare Item Chamber, Miss.

165
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,420
We have high quality
silks and satins here,

166
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,380
high quality rouge in rose colour...

167
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,820
and jade-wares that are
expertly carved.

168
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm not sure if you are willing
to sell the things that I want.

169
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,540
What do you want?

170
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,660
I want the string of
a soft-winged kite.

171
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,340
Soft wing can stand against
the wind to rise up to the sky.

172
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,100
We have this in our
collection as well.

173
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,300
Your Highness.

174
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,380
Unfortunately,

175
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,580
our mistress has gone to the
tea plantation to check on the source.

176
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,140
She will only be back
after a few days.

177
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,060
Recently, I had came here three times.

178
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,820
But every time,
I just happened to miss her.

179
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,020
Our mistress is very
devoted to this teahouse.

180
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,180
I'm truly sorry, Your Highness.

181
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,260
How about I ask Miss Chen Yu
to come and play a song for you?

182
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,780
No need.
I'll just come again next time.

183
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,220
" Rare Item Chamber "

184
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,140
Wu You.

185
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,900
Our teacher is set on marrying
her daughter, Ya Li to you.

186
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,260
Even the empress has supported that.

187
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,940
But you are still engaged to Western
Qi's princess. What should we do?

188
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,740
What they want has nothing
to do with me.

189
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,380
But Wu You,

190
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,300
you are in love with Miss Man Yao
from Moon Embrace Teahouse, right?

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Look at you.
You should just admit to it.

192
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,180
You went to the teahouse again
these few days, right?

193
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,300
But she's avoiding you.
Actually, that's weird.

194
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,540
For a money-grubber
business woman like her,

195
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,620
you are a money tree for her.

196
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,620
She's not a money-grubber.

197
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,220
Please tell me more.

198
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,500
The art of steeping is about
patience and the state of mind.

199
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,380
If you are not a resolute person...

200
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,420
who is indifferent to worldly matters,

201
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,620
you can't capture the quintessence
of the art of steeping.

202
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,540
I think the way to enjoy tea...

203
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,460
is not about the tea itself...

204
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,580
but the state of mind one has
when one drinks tea.

205
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,020
How about you relax your mind
and taste the tea in earnest?

206
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,980
A person like her cannot
be a money-grubber.

207
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,740
She is not a person like that.

208
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,220
Why did she act like that then?

209
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
She is keeping you at arm's length.

210
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,300
Could it be that she's baiting you...

211
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,980
-to attract your attention?
-How can you make a hasty conclusion?

212
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,940
Look at you. You clearly like her.

213
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,100
Arrival of His Majesty!

214
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,260
Wu Yu, recently, I didn't see you
much in the court.

215
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,620
You hang out in
Prince Li's Manor every day.

216
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,420
You learned nothing but bad habits
from your brother.

217
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,940
That's not true.

218
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,940
Enough. Leave us.

219
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,220
I have something to discuss
with your brother.

220
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,620
Yes, father.

221
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,540
Wu You.

222
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,140
I haven't seen you in a long time.

223
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,020
Ever since I last saw you
in Yun's Tomb,

224
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,300
I had been thinking a lot.

225
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,140
If you really don't want to marry
the Western Qi's princess,

226
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
I won't force you.

227
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,620
The empress told me that...

228
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,220
you had known Ya Li,
the granddaughter of the...

229
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,820
Central Secretary since young.

230
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,940
This will be a good marriage too.

231
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,860
I don't see how this is
a good marriage arrangement.

232
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,940
Do you really like the
granddaughter of Sun family...

233
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,300
or just the power of Sun family
that takes root in three states...

234
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,060
of the southern region?

235
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,700
Wu You, you should understand
the troubles I took...

236
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,100
to give you those three states
in the southern region.

237
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,660
Why do you have to fight with me
at every step of the way?

238
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,420
Somebody told me that...

239
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,060
you reject the idea
of marriage alliance...

240
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,620
because lately, you had been
spending your time...

241
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,580
with a business woman.

242
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,780
And you wrecked the prison of the
Ministry of Justice because of her.

243
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,980
My choice has nothing to do with her.

244
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,020
As for why I refuse to marry
the Western Qi's princess,

245
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,740
I think you know it
better than anyone.

246
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,820
You hung the map in your reading room.

247
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,300
I can see that you are very clear
about the situation of Northern Realm.

248
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,340
The crown prince's failure has
affected the Northern Realm.

249
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,460
We have lost hundreds and
thousands of our soldiers.

250
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,700
In order to avenge them...

251
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,700
and to get rid of
this thorn in our side,

252
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,620
I have decided to band
with Western Qi to battle Wei.

253
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,780
Do you really think that
we lost that war...

254
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
because of the crown prince's
mistake alone?

255
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,940
The people has to pay war tax
every year and they are suffering.

256
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,220
Northern Realm is not
in top condition anymore.

257
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,020
Even if I marry the
Western Qi's princess or...

258
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,620
the daughter from a noble family,

259
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,340
it would do the country no good.

260
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,700
I had never lost in a battle before.

261
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,940
If I personally lead the army
this time, we can defeat Wei for sure.

262
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,180
When the time comes,
we can conquer the world.

263
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,700
We are not racing against the time
to conquer the world.

264
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,540
If we begin another war now,
you'll ruin our country.

265
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,420
For now, it's best
to recuperate and wait...

266
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,980
-until the country is strong again.
-Shut up!

267
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,900
Until now,

268
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,900
you are still holding on to
the fallacy of that traitor, Qin Yong.

269
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,460
His People-Based Transformation
theory. What nonsense!

270
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,420
-He killed your mother!
-My teacher is not a traitor.

271
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,700
Since you don't dare to mention
his name in front of others,

272
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,100
how dare you speak of my mother?

273
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,140
I know clearly who killed my mother.

274
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,140
And don't ever forget.

275
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,220
The reason Northern Realm can become
so strong in such a short time...

276
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,060
is because of my teacher's
People-Based Transformation theory.

277
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,060
Looks like you still
haven't given up on it.

278
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,900
I don't take part in managing
the country anymore.

279
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,700
Do I have to let you dictate...

280
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,900
my thinking and my beliefs too?

281
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,900
Fine.

282
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,140
Since you are like this,

283
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,700
I'll make a half-year deal
with you too.

284
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,420
Within half a year,

285
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,260
if you can find the long lost
rare book of Qin family,

286
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,100
The Book of Mountains and Rivers,

287
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,940
I'll allow you to restart your
People-Based Transformation.

288
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,700
And I'll allow you to marry freely.

289
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,620
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?

290
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,220
Yes. You didn't forget
about that book, right?

291
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,300
If you can't find it,

292
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,860
you have to marry the
princess of Western Qi.

293
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,780
And you have to help me
take down Wei as well.

294
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,420
The book has been lost for so long.

295
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,020
It is not an easy thing to
procure in the first place.

296
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,340
Moreover,

297
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,540
even if I managed to find
The Book of Mountains and Rivers,

298
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,820
you won't give an
explanation to the world...

299
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,780
-about my mother and teacher, right?
-You!

300
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,980
Other noblemen and women
in the capital city...

301
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,780
treated me with venom.

302
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,780
Why are you willing to befriend me?

303
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,740
I feel very guilty for passing on
my illness to you the last time.

304
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,420
That was just a false alarm.

305
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,820
I'm so healthy that
I recovered after a nap.

306
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,540
I remember that when
I was bullied by others,

307
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,980
you were the only one who
stepped out to help me.

308
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,620
Look at this. Is this flower pretty?

309
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,180
-You are prettier than the flower.
-Really?

310
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,860
Looks like both of you
are having a good time.

311
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,420
Greetings, Princess Rong Le
and Princess Zhao Yun.

312
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,700
I heard that the Princess Manor
is decorated with Western Qi's design.

313
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,220
Now that I see it today,
it's really the work of craftsmanship.

314
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,860
You flattered me, Miss Sun.
Take a seat.

315
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,860
Miss Sun, have you been to Western Qi?

316
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,300
I'm a home type of girl.

317
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,500
Unlike you who travelled the world,

318
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,100
besides Zhongshan, I only ever
travelled to the southern area...

319
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,860
every year during Qingming festival.

320
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,620
Zhongshan is very beautiful.
You should go out and walk around.

321
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,180
Alright.

322
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,420
By the way, Prince Li
and Prince Chen...

323
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,060
had invited me to go on
an excursion in the suburb.

324
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Are you willing to come along as well?

325
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,580
That's great. Princess Rong Le,

326
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,700
you are already engaged
with Brother Wu You.

327
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,500
You should get to know each other more
and bond with each other.

328
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,380
Although Brother Wu You
looks fierce most of the time,

329
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
he's actually a righteous, bold,

330
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,660
talented, intelligent and
sophisticated man.

331
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,460
He's the real hero.

332
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,740
I think that Prince Chen...

333
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,180
is younger, more energetic
and interesting.

334
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,140
He is an intriguing person.

335
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,500
In comparison, Prince Li is cold
and hard to predict.

336
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,100
How did you become so close with him?

337
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,380
I stayed in the palace for
a while when I was young.

338
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,500
He wasn't like this in the past.

339
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,220
He treated others kindly.

340
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,940
He still treats me kindly now.

341
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,060
A few days ago, he had helped me
by teaching that elder son a lesson.

342
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,580
Princess Rong Le.

343
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,780
Don't be fooled by Wu Yu.

344
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,660
That man is a sweet talker
and he's insensible.

345
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,420
He has many fans
in every corner of this city.

346
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,460
Princess Rong Le.

347
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,660
Moon Embrace Teahouse has sent
this new tea for you to taste it.

348
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,420
Their shopkeeper said that...

349
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,580
today, they have an important guest.

350
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,020
They have tea tasting, chess playing,
flowers viewing and sword dance.

351
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,700
They had reserved a seat for you.

352
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,660
If you ever have the time,
the invitation will is open.

353
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,420
I just asked Xiao Sha to go
and buy me some tea leaves.

354
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,900
I never thought that their shopkeeper
will be so generous.

355
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,740
Award the person who sent the tea.

356
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,380
Express my thanks to the
shopkeeper for the invitation

357
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll go there when
I have fully recovered.

358
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,580
Yes, Princess.

359
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,620
You know the shopkeeper
of Moon Embrace Teahouse?

360
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,380
I heard that she's real good.

361
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,820
And she has collected many
treasures from all over the world.

362
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,740
For example,
she has this high quality dress...

363
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,380
and rare night-luminescent pearl...

364
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,540
from western region
in her Rare Item Chamber.

365
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,860
Princess Rong Le,
can you bring me along?

366
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,140
Princess, what is wrong?

367
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,660
You have just recovered.

368
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,500
The doctor said that
you have to rest more.

369
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,660
We have disturbed you from resting.

370
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,180
Princess Rong Le, rest well.

371
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,860
We'll invite you again to go out
with us another day.

372
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,100
I'll take my leave then.

373
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,540
Princess Rong Le. I'll visit you again
on another day as well.

374
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,780
Alright.

375
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,140
Tea tasting, chess playing,
flowers viewing and sword dance.

376
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,180
The teahouse is all about
peace and tranquility.

377
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,340
They don't allow any weapons.

378
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,460
Usually, Long Yue will
find some excuse for me.

379
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,500
Since she sent someone over today,

380
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,980
it must be because
there's no other way.

381
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,340
Ling Yue. Help me change.

382
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,620
Yes, Princess.

383
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,500
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

384
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,100
You are here, Miss Man Yao.

385
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm wondering if you could
make me some tea today.

386
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,700
I know clearly whether
you are here to drink tea...

387
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,500
or to find troubles.

388
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,900
How can you be so sure that
I'm not here to drink tea?

389
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,820
If you are here to drink tea,

390
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,220
why would you hide wine
inside the bamboo tube?

391
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,780
I purposely used this old bamboo tube
for soup to hide this wine.

392
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,900
I thought that it'll be able
to hide it's smell.

393
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,220
I never thought that
you'll find out about it.

394
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,660
You are really good.

395
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,980
Wu You can't drink wine.

396
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,700
But I can't drink tea.

397
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,900
I can don't eat for a day
but I can't live without wine.

398
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,060
You are the mistress here. How about
you drink some with me today?

399
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,260
What are you thinking about?
Wu You is not here.

400
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,900
Since you have already invited me,

401
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,980
of course I can't
reject your kindness.

402
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,620
But I'm the same is Prince Li.

403
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,380
I can't drink wine.

404
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,700
We have a full house today.

405
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,580
If I drink too much and
embarrassed myself,

406
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,740
not only I'll humiliate myself
which is nothing,

407
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,260
I'll affect your reputation which is
the real problem if someone sees me.

408
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,860
After all, everybody knows that...

409
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,860
Moon Embrace Teahouse
sells only tea and no wine.

410
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,860
I never thought that besides...

411
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,740
being meticulous,
you are good with words as well.

412
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,900
Since you already said that,
I'll feel guilty to force you.

413
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,740
Fine. I'll act nobly today...

414
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,100
and enjoy this good wine by myself.

415
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,860
Take a seat.

416
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,940
Sit down.

417
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,140
Somebody please bring me
my tools to warm up the wine.

418
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,380
-Miss Long Yue.
-Miss Chen Yu. How's the mistress?

419
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,100
She is still with Prince Chen.

420
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,260
They have been in there for so long.
I'm worried that she'll be in danger.

421
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,620
Prince Chen is very unpredictable.

422
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,700
I don't know what his plan is.

423
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
Please spare my life.

424
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,980
No matter what,
you have to make tea for me today.

425
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,700
Alright, Your Highness.

426
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,540
Go and check on them again at once.

427
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,740
Alright.

428
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,340
Miss Man Yao.

429
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,300
Before this, I heard from
Long Yue that...

430
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,260
you just came to Zhongshan
not long ago.

431
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,700
Before this, where were you?

432
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,380
Are you interrogating me?

433
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,740
No, I'm just asking for fun.

434
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,780
My father is a businessman.

435
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,100
I had followed him
everywhere since young.

436
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,940
We don't stay in one place.

437
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,660
Travelling around the world has
always been on my wish-list.

438
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,940
Where have you been travelling before?

439
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,980
I had been to many places.

440
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,340
I don't know where to start.

441
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,340
Just tell me about some
of the places you went.

442
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,540
Just think of it as
broadening my horizon.

443
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,460
Are you drunk?

444
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,620
I heard that you are an expert
in travelling and having fun.

445
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,420
How can there be places
that you don't know of?

446
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,180
Where were we just now?

447
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,740
You want to know that
which places are beautiful to me.

448
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,260
Yes. I really want to know. Tell me.

449
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,860
I already told you just now.

450
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,700
Are you drunk?

451
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,220
You didn't tell me just now.

452
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,580
I want you to tell me about some
places but you haven't said anything.

453
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,300
Let me think about it.

454
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,020
Miss Man Yao.

455
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,780
Before you come to Zhongshan,

456
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,780
where were you?

457
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,580
Before I come to Zhongshan,

458
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,260
I am...

459
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,340
Where were you?

460
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,500
What's wrong with me?

461
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,980
I am...

462
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,980
in a tearoom.

463
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,100
It sounds so nice.

464
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,060
Where is the tearoom?

465
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,580
The fire for your wine has gone out.

466
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,340
Let me light it up for you again.

467
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,020
Miss Man Yao, are you alright?

468
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,540
Wu You, you are here.

469
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,340
Wu You, this is the Shilixiang wine
that I stole from your manor.

470
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,980
I thought that it can
lower one's guard.

471
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,460
We were doing fine just now.
Wu You, I never thought that it'll...

472
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,180
That it'll...

473
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,180
It will indeed lower one's guard.

474
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,380
Are you alright, Miss Chen Yu?

475
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,660
Your Highness, I feel dizzy.

476
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,660
It'll be alright.

477
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,620
You are awake.

478
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,740
This is a specially brewed
hangover soup.

479
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,220
Do you...

480
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,740
want me to feed you personally?

481
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,020
Slowly. It's a little bit bitter.

482
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,140
Thank you for your help.

483
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,340
I won't disturb you then.

484
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,540
Look. You can't even stand straight.

485
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,220
How are you going to go back?

486
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,100
Don't worry. After you sober up,

487
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,780
I'll ask someone to send you
back to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

488
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm really grateful to you
for saving me.

489
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,100
But,

490
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,660
I can't trouble you further.

491
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,460
Why do you have to keep me here?

492
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,860
Why did I go into the prison
to save you that day?

493
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
Because you know that I'm innocent.

494
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,500
You are wise and just.

495
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,660
You can't just be impervious
to the injustice, right?

496
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,140
Do you have to lie all the time?

497
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,300
I know that you bear good will,
but I really need to go back.

498
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,540
I have to take care of the teahouse.

499
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,820
How much can your teahouse
earn in a day?

500
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,260
I'll pay you.

501
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,860
What is it?

502
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,820
Man Yao.

503
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,420
This is a good chance
for you to name a price.

504
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,620
Aren't you glad?

505
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,500
Since you have invited me
so warmly to stay here,

506
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,860
I'll accept your invitation.

507
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,380
100 tael a day.

508
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,420
I thank you first, Your Highness.

509
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,300
Alright.

510
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,100
The water is reflecting the light
and dusk is upon us.

511
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,620
This beautiful scenery is fleeting.

512
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,460
But you are not willing to enjoy
this scenery with me in peace.

513
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,740
You are just thinking
about rejecting me.

514
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,580
It's not that I'm not willing,

515
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,180
but I...

516
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,980
am different from you.

517
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,660
Unlike you...

518
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,700
who can do things as you please...

519
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,700
Again with your teahouse.

520
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,900
Man Yao, you are not like others.

521
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,100
But you keep on pretending
to be a sordid merchant.

522
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,860
Are you looking down on me?

523
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,660
Do you think that I'm not worthy
for you to treat me sincerely?

524
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,980
You have exaggerated.

525
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,460
You are a royalty, you are
charming and elegant.

526
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,340
Unlike me who is just a commoner.

527
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,740
I'm not very knowledgeable.

528
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,300
-That's why you'll think that...
-Forget it.

529
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,860
I don't like to force people.

530
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,300
If you really want to go back,

531
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,940
go ahead.

532
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,540
Helmsman, please turn back...

533
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,900
and let me off at the nearest wharf.

534
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,020
Helmsman.

535
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,460
Helmsman.

536
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,780
Helmsman.

537
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,380
He is old.
His hearing is not that well.

538
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,020
I have a way if you want to go back.

539
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,980
Calm down and enjoy
the scenery with me.

540
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,020
And I'll ask someone to send you
back to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

541
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,380
Why do you have to make things
difficult for me?

542
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,900
Prince Chen had invited me
to join him with wine.

543
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,060
What are you going to do
to keep me here?

544
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,300
Sister Ling Yue.
How about we go back?

545
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,660
Go back?

546
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,220
Lian Xin, think carefully.

547
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,300
This is a rare chance that
the princess is not in tonight.

548
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,100
Are you sure about that?

549
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,420
Fine. Let's go.

550
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,780
Here. Carry them here.

551
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,060
Yes, Sir.

552
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,460
Cover them well.

553
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,100
Line them up nicely.

554
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,700
-We still have some bodies there.
-Alright.

555
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,180
Scoop him up.

556
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,380
-Check over there.
-Yes, Sir.

557
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,060
Be careful.

558
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,940
Greetings, Your Highness.

559
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,780
What happened here?

560
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,980
Your Highness, it's a shipwreck.

561
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,740
Quick, there are bodies over there.

562
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,540
Yes, Sir.

563
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
Move it over here.

564
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,100
<i>Deputy Minister Ma from
the Ministry of Personnel.</i>

565
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,140
Give them a proper burial. Make sure
to get all of them out of the water.

566
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,980
Get me two horses as well.

567
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,180
I rushed here after
I received the report.

568
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,300
I just simply brought
that horse with me.

569
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,300
You can take that horse
if you don't mind.

570
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,380
He is just a child.

571
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,500
Is this an accident?

572
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,860
There won't be so many accidents.

573
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,820
Let's leave now.

574
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,620
We can still make it back to the city
before the gate is closed.

575
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,340
Do you know this man?

576
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,860
If this is an accident,
will someone uphold justice for them?

577
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,580
Justice?

578
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,380
There is no justice
in this chaotic world.

579
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,460
Aren't you a self-claimed merchant
that cares only about money?

580
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,940
Why are you so set on this?

581
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Everybody has compassion.

582
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,100
Even you won't feel nothing
when you see such tragedy, right?

583
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,260
Then what do you think...

584
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,940
I should do?

585
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,300
I wouldn't dare to ask you
to do anything.

586
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,940
I just feel that...

587
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,460
what have they done wrong...

588
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,660
until they have to suffer like this?

589
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,700
I'm too much of a busybody.

590
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,820
In the end,

591
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,460
I'm just another person in this world.

592
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,540
We can do nothing about it
in this chaotic world.

593
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,140
Maybe one day,

594
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,740
I'll become one of the
innocent sacrifices as well.

595
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,140
Let's go.

596
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,900
With me here,
who dares to sacrifice you?
