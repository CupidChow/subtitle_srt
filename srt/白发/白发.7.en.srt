Episode 7

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
-What is it?
-Your Highness.

4
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,480
This is the crown prince's carriage.

5
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
Please move aside.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Let go of me!

7
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Why did you stop?

8
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,160
Crown Prince, it's Prince Li.

9
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,680
Do you need me to
teach you what to do?

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,160
I got this, Your Highness.

11
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
In Northern Realm,
besides the emperor's carriage,

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,600
carriage of the Eastern Palace
should pass first.

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
This is the crown prince's carriage.

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,560
Commoners should
move aside immediately.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Who are you calling commoners?

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,320
Hold tight.

17
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
Somebody!

18
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,200
-He's a lunatic!
-Crown prince.

19
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
Let's go!

20
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,600
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

21
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,760
-Your Highness.
-Choose a good horse from your barn...

22
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,200
-and send it to the capital's Yamen.
-Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,040
It's already late and
your clothes are wet.

24
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,520
Stay in my manor to
dry your clothes first.

25
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,960
-Your Highness.
-Lead this lady inside to rest.

26
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
This way please.

28
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,400
<i>You are in my thoughts for so long
without you knowing about it.</i>

29
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
<i>Who is going to talk about
this love between us first?</i>

30
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,760
<i>Luckily, I am attentive to myself.</i>

31
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>That's why I let you
turn back the time.</i>

32
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,080
<i>The western wind is preventing you
to accept the spring here.</i>

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,520
<i>But I'm still waiting
under the rain with you.</i>

34
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,840
<i>Although the future is unpredictable,</i>

35
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,480
<i>I'll do my best to create
a story together with you.</i>

36
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,160
Your Highness, Miss Man Yao is here.

37
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
Have a seat.

38
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,280
Thank you for letting me
stay here yesterday.

39
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,600
I feel unease that I had
stayed here for a night.

40
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,480
So, I'm here to bid my farewell.

41
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
You want to leave?

42
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,640
Yesterday night, I used my horse to
ram into the crown prince's carriage.

43
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,200
And the crown prince saw that
you were riding with me.

44
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,600
Although the crown prince
can do nothing to me,

45
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
it's be easy for him to arrest you
for ramming into him...

46
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,080
and interrogate you in his manor.

47
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,040
If you don't believe me,
you can walk out from this manor.

48
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
I think the spies from
the Easter Palace...

49
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,320
will be very glad to arrest you and
bring you to him for interrogation.

50
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,840
You are the one who
rammed into him, not me.

51
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
If he's a reasonable person,

52
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,120
he won't try to take advantage of you
in the prison of Minister of Justice.

53
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
I can't stay long in your manor.

54
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,680
There are many things that await me
in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

55
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
Before you came back to Zhongshan,

56
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,960
your teahouse is
doing fine on it's own.

57
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,760
But now that you are back,

58
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,280
it seems like they can't do
without you for even a second.

59
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
Can you help me once more?

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm helping you...

61
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
by keeping you here.

62
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
But if I don't go back,

63
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm afraid that they'll make
troubles in the teahouse.

64
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,840
That's an easy solution for that.

65
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,400
Guards!

66
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

67
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,960
Bring a few people along to keep a
close eye on Moon Embrace Teahouse.

68
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
If someone dares to make troubles,

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,200
-teach them a lesson.
-Yes, your Highness.

70
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,640
I'll go together with them.

71
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,760
Thank you, Your Highness.
Farewell.

72
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,560
Don't go yet.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,040
-Your Highness.
-I sent them to protect the teahouse.

74
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,960
But I didn't say that you can leave.

75
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
But...

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,720
Wu You, actually,

77
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
there are ways for you to know
whether Man Yao likes you or not.

78
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
What are they?

79
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,720
I can use drugging mist to test her.

80
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,520
This is too unrefined.

81
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,360
For women, they say one thing
and mean another.

82
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,640
We need to use both
hard and soft tactics.

83
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,480
If she wants to leave, make her stay.

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,480
If she wants to stay, make her leave.

85
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,440
If she wants to go east,
make her go west.

86
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,680
If she wants to say something,
silence her.

87
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,800
Until the end when she listens to you,

88
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,480
it'll mean that she has given you
her heart. Understand?

89
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I thought that you are
not interested in women.

90
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
But I remember that
in the teahouse back then,

91
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,320
you were the one who...

92
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,040
That day, I didn't
mean to ram into you.

93
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,440
But I can't help it,
not with the situation back then.

94
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
I did not do it on purpose.

95
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,520
If you have any doubts about me,

96
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
you can just say it out.

97
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,160
No point to force me to stay here.

98
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,920
If a woman is too stupid,

99
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,640
she'll be detestable.

100
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,880
If she is too smart, she'll be feared.

101
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Although that's not your intention,

102
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,680
you have already captured my heart.

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,640
Your Highness,
about the Clearwater River...

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll report it later.

105
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,640
Your Highness, you have
more important things to do.

106
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll take my leave first.

107
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,680
For me, there is
nothing more important...

108
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
than you.

109
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
<i>I think of you when the moon is full,</i>

110
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,640
Follow me.
Let me bring you to a place.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,240
<i>You who came to a strange land
to build our lands together.</i>

112
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,320
<i>I think of you
when night has fallen...</i>

113
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,520
<i>and when the fog has parted.</i>

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,240
<i>My yearning for you has
turned you into my reason.</i>

115
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,560
<i>You are my happiness,
my worries and...</i>

116
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
This place looks like
it's newly built.

117
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,080
Why did you...

118
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
bring me here?

119
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,720
What do you think about
the designs here?

120
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I just know that the things
in here are very expensive.

121
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,280
I know nothing about designs.

122
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,680
They just decorated it with
rare and beautiful things.

123
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm just asking you
whether or not you like it.

124
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,120
You have good taste.

125
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,600
I think this place is very nice.

126
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,840
Since you like it,

127
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,080
from now on, this place will
be called Man Yin Chamber...

128
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,080
and will be given to you.
How about that?

129
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,360
<i>Are for us to waste it.</i>

130
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,880
<i>Rather than having no worries
and having a dull life,</i>

131
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
<i>I rather pursue you.</i>

132
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>Even though the flower
might wilt and I might fail,</i>

133
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,680
<i>at least I had tried my best.</i>

134
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,080
-Brother Wu You.
-Princess Zhao Yun,

135
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,840
His Highness is busy his duty.

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
What kind of duty is this?

137
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,800
Zhao Yun, who let you in?

138
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,120
Brother Wu You, I'm here to thank you.

139
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,640
The son of Prince Qing He has asked
my uncle for my hands.

140
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
Princess Rong Le has
humiliated him in public last time.

141
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,800
So, he wants a revenge.

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,360
My uncle almost agreed
to his proposal.

143
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,800
I heard that luckily you managed
to break off that marriage in public.

144
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,440
Or else, I would have
to marry that pervert.

145
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,240
No need to marry that kind of person.

146
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
I know. In this world,
only you treat me the best.

147
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,320
Another person is Princess Rong Le.

148
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Who is this woman? How can
you bring her to your manor?

149
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,800
You are already engaged
to Princess Rong Le.

150
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,680
No need to meddle
with my affairs. Leng Yan.

151
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,440
-Bring her back to her manor.
-Please come with me, Princess.

152
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
Brother Wu You. How can you do that?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,000
What should we do?

154
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,440
Brother Xiao, you are back!

155
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,120
Princess Rong Le didn't come back
last night and no news from her.

156
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
Has something happened to her?

157
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,920
I'll search for the princess.

158
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,760
Are you sure that the princess
didn't come back at all last night?

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,480
That's right. The princess
didn't come back at all.

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Both of us has waited
for a whole night.

161
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,400
That right. Both of us slept
in the princess's room...

162
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,080
and never left the place.

163
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
Your Highness.

164
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,280
That day, we were disturbed when
were playing chess in the teahouse.

165
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Today, how about we give our best...

166
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,240
and play a few rounds of chess again?

167
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,960
Alright.

168
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,240
It's no fun to just play chess.

169
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,640
How about we make a bet.

170
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
What bet?

171
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,280
If I lose,
I'll fulfil one request of yours.

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,640
If you lose, you have to let me go.

173
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,720
What's so bad about my manor?

174
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,320
Why do you want to leave
this place again and again?

175
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,000
This manor is fantastic.

176
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,640
But I'm just a commoner.

177
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,440
It's not convenient for me
to stay here for long.

178
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,680
You are so sure that you will win?

179
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,160
Your Highness, Prince Chen is here.

180
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
He has insisted to see you.

181
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,000
Pardon me.

182
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Wu You.

183
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Wu Yu, what are you doing?

184
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,280
I heard that you already examined
this body yesterday night.

185
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,720
You must have known that
he's Deputy Minster Ma.

186
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
And he's the right hand man
of Yu Shi Hai.

187
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,200
But why will he appear on the ship...

188
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,920
and why will there be a shipwreck?

189
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,120
Wu You, you already know about it
since the beginning, right?

190
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,800
What are you trying to say?

191
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,760
Deputy Minister Ma is the main
witness for this rank-selling case.

192
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,480
This ship is full of
other innocent people.

193
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,280
Yu Shi Hai has sacrificed so many
just to kill Deputy Minister Ma.

194
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,680
Do you have evidence?

195
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Deputy Minister Zhang
was killed in a fire in his house.

196
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,320
Deputy Minister Cui met a sudden death
with foam at the mouth.

197
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,520
And together with
this shipwreck incident.

198
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,680
Those officers who died in these
seemingly real accidents...

199
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,840
are all interconnected with
this rank-selling case.

200
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,720
Wu You, this is no accident.
This is murder.

201
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,640
Since you already know, you shouldn't
come and make a ruckus here.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,440
Wu You, you saw how Sir Zhao died
in that teahouse with your own eyes.

203
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,760
Now, you are the only one
who can solve this case.

204
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,200
But you chose to remain aloof.

205
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,000
I get you, Wu You.

206
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,800
Please uphold justice for
these innocent people.

207
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Justice?

208
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,080
Justice again.

209
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,120
Do you think that you can solve all
problems by getting rid of Yu Shi Hai?

210
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,160
This rank-selling business
has been here for so long.

211
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,200
But nobody ever brought it up.
Do you know why?

212
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,080
If we dig deep into it,
how many will turn out clean?

213
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,240
I don't care how many
will turn out clean.

214
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,440
Have you forgotten?

215
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,480
When Chief Minister Qin
was still alive, he said that...

216
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,000
if there's anybody who could continue
his aspiration, it would be you.

217
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,040
Fine. If you don't want
to take care about it,

218
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,160
then I'll take care of it myself.
After all, I have the letter.

219
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,920
I don't believe that
they can get out scot-free.

220
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,400
What is it? Even you are mad at me?

221
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,440
When Qin's family was slaughtered,

222
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,040
how many in the court...

223
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
had stood up to him?

224
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
And how many of them had
hit him while he was down?

225
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,520
My mother passed away and the
transformation was put to a stop.

226
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
So, of course the court is
doomed to be unstable...

227
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
and rotten to the core.

228
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
Even if one has great power,

229
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,040
it would be hopeless.

230
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,480
-Leng Yan.
-Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
Find somebody to keep an eye on him.

232
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,120
If something happens to him,
report to me immediately.

233
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,760
Yes, Your Highness.

234
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
Prince Chen!

235
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,440
-Get lost!
-Your Highness, you can't come in.

236
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,480
Zong Zheng Wu Yu, let go of me!

237
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,080
Don't you know that it's capital crime
to barge into the Eastern Palace?

238
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,960
Selling ranks and titles
and killing in cold blood...

239
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
are the real capital crimes here!

240
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,520
You!

241
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Every case that is recorded
in this letter...

242
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
is your doings!

243
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,200
I'll report this to our father.
Let's see how you deny it!

244
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,640
Give that to me!

245
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,320
-Guards! Are all of you useless?
-Your Highness.

246
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,000
Let go of me, you scoundrel.

247
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,560
You want to report me
with this useless paper?

248
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,520
How dare you come here
to threaten me with this?

249
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,560
How dare you destroy
the evidence in the palace?

250
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
Evidence?

251
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,880
Well then.

252
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,480
Today, I'll take this evidence...

253
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,360
and bring you along
to face our father.

254
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
Let's see what you can do to me.

255
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Listen to me carefully.

256
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,760
Prince Chen barged into
the Eastern Palace...

257
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,680
to assassinate the crown prince.

258
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,680
According to the law, I have to
send him to the Supreme Court.

259
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,920
If anything else other than
this message is spread out,

260
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,960
-kill the one who spreads it.
-Yes, Your Highness!

261
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,240
How dare you, you scoundrel!

262
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,920
How dare you, you scoundrel!

263
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,400
Evidence?

264
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,400
Your Highness.

265
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,720
This is the third round.

266
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
Looks like you are
going to lose again.

267
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,080
According to our bet,

268
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,040
you have to let me go.

269
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,440
When did I agree to your bet?

270
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,360
Your Highness,
this is already a foregone conclusion.

271
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
-You are going back on your words?
-What if I do?

272
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
In chess, you don't regret
the steps you took.

273
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,400
There will always be
a winner and a loser.

274
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,320
If you are so scared about losing,

275
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,120
from now on,

276
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,400
I wouldn't dare to play chess
with you again.

277
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
Are you threatening me?

278
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,320
I don't dare to.

279
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,240
Actually, you are not a person
who cares about winning or losing.

280
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,400
Or else, you won't take care of
Princess Zhao Yun who has family.

281
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,200
Looks like you are not thinking
about the chess or the bet.

282
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,120
What are you trying to say?

283
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
If I play chess with you
and brood after I lost,

284
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
I wouldn't have the heart
to improve my skills.

285
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
So, I'll just keep on losing
to you after that.

286
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
But if I focus on
improving my skills...

287
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,040
and trudge forward,

288
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
even if I lose to you again
in the end,

289
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,920
at least I had tried my best.

290
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,200
Try your best.

291
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,920
Trudge forward.

292
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,120
Looks like you are good
in comforting a person.

293
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,200
If I don't know how to
twist my words around,

294
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
how can I do business?

295
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,560
So, in your opinion,

296
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,640
how should I go forward?

297
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
Although the art of chess...

298
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
is focusing on that
three-steps-ahead theory,

299
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,200
the one step that you
have to take now...

300
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,760
is the most important one.

301
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,640
You want me to take on
the rank-selling case.

302
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,360
If you don't take this step,

303
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,600
more innocent people are going
to be dragged into this, right?

304
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,720
Your Highness.
Something bad had happened.

305
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,160
There are news saying that
Prince Chen tried to...

306
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,520
assassinate the crown prince.

307
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,320
And Yu Shi Hai has sued him for murder
and slandering the crown prince.

308
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,360
Now, he's already in prison
waiting for his trial.

309
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,960
The prisoner, Qin Yong is here.

310
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,520
Prisoner Qin Yong...

311
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,040
is a traitor to the country. He and
his whole family will be executed.

312
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,960
Those officers who died in these
seemingly real accidents...

313
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,440
are all interconnected with
this rank-selling case.

314
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,960
This is no accident.
This is murder.

315
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,000
My mother's dying wish
won't protect you forever.

316
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,240
This will be the last chance
I give you.

317
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960
Although the art of chess...

318
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,160
is focusing on that
three-steps-ahead theory,

319
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
the one step that you
have to take now...

320
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,160
is the most important one.

321
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,480
If you don't take this step,

322
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,440
more innocent people are going
to be dragged into this, right?

323
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,280
I have lived long enough.

324
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,080
I never thought that I'll be able
to see Prince Li in the court.

325
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Prince Li is young but capable
and he's brilliant.

326
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,840
He even secured the three states in
the south. He's at his prime.

327
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,160
The war with Wei is starting soon.
Now that Prince Li is here,

328
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,080
I think there will be
changes in the court.

329
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
That's right.

330
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,440
Arrival of His Majesty.

331
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,080
Long live the Emperor!

332
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
You may rise.

333
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

334
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,200
In today's morning court, we will
discuss about Prince Chen's case.

335
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,440
What do you have to say?

336
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
Please voice out.

337
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,040
Your Majesty.

338
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,880
About the murder of Deputy
Minister Ma, we have proof that...

339
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,440
the sunken ship is made by the
Ministry of Public Works...

340
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,640
that is under Prince Chen.

341
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,000
From the remnants of the ship
that were scooped out,

342
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,080
we found the names of the
shipbuilders and their supervisor.

343
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,920
Prince Chen thought that
the evidence was destroyed.

344
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,400
So, he took out a false letter
in palace ground...

345
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
to accuse the crown prince and me.

346
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,240
Your Majesty. Let's put the death
of Deputy Minister Ma aside first.

347
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,880
The letter is about rank-selling.
And it spoke of great implication.

348
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,760
We have to do a thorough investigation
to be sure of the culprit.

349
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,760
Before this, Sir Ma and
Prince Chen had fought over...

350
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,000
a girl from a public house.

351
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Madam Qin from House of Fragrance
has personally told us about it.

352
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,320
Now, he used a letter
to accuse me and Sir Yu...

353
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,200
that we are involved
in a rank-selling case.

354
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,880
I think he just want to offend me.

355
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,560
Wu You.

356
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,040
What do think about this?

357
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
The shipwreck case is widely
connected to many things.

358
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,360
We can't just make a hasty conclusion.

359
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,000
As for the rank-selling case, whether
or not it's a false accusation,

360
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,680
I'll personally investigate about it.

361
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,360
Please ask the Ministry of Justice
to hold on for now.

362
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,520
I'll bring the truth to light
in a week's time.

363
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,400
Your Majesty, Prince Chen and
Prince Li are very close.

364
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm afraid that others
won't be convinced...

365
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
if he's the one who
takes on this case.

366
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,360
Your Majesty,
pardon me for interrupting.

367
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,760
Since Prince Li has
promised us seven days,

368
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,520
we'll do it the military way.

369
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,280
After even days, if he can procure
the witnesses and evidence,

370
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,960
we'll put them to trial
as per usual...

371
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,040
for both the ship wreck
and rank-selling case.

372
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,920
If he has nothing,
Prince Li will have to be caned,

373
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,160
his salaries deducted and
his rank lowered. How about that?

374
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,520
Fair enough.

375
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
We'll do as General Fu has said.

376
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,760
Prince Chen.
Someone is here to see you.

377
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,280
I don't want to see anybody at all!

378
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,760
Brother Wu Yu, it's me.

379
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,200
Why did you come here?

380
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,320
How can a delicate princess like you
come down to the prison?

381
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,240
Are you alright?

382
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,320
This place is dark and damp.

383
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,080
Did you eat and sleep well?

384
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,360
Did they do anything to you?

385
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,520
It's alright.

386
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,240
After all, I'm still a prince.

387
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,360
Although I'm not
my father's favourite,

388
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,640
they can't do anything to me...

389
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,800
as long as I'm not guiltily charged.

390
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,920
-I already told you many times...
-So painful.

391
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,440
to think before you act.

392
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,800
Don't be affected by
your temper and act rashly.

393
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,800
But you never listen.

394
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,280
You know how's the
crown prince is like, right?

395
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,680
He's petty and he seeks revenge for
a small thing. Why do you provoke him?

396
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,480
Now, in order to save you,
Brother Wu You...

397
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,400
had made a deal in the Great Hall
to solve the case in seven days.

398
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,600
You are just worried about
your Brother Wu You.

399
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,640
Don't cry.

400
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
It's my fault.

401
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,760
Don't cry.

402
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,640
Stop crying, I beg you.

403
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,760
Princess Zhao Yun. It's late already.
You should leave now.

404
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,960
If crown prince and Sir Yu
find out about this,

405
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,560
I'll be dead.

406
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,040
Alright.

407
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,680
Stop crying.

408
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Don't worry. I'll go and beg
the empress now.

409
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,600
I'll beg her to talk the emperor and
crown prince into letting you out.

410
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,000
Promise me, don't cry anymore.

411
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,640
Alright.

412
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,000
You have to take care of yourself.

413
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,480
You still haven't found the person
that I had asked you too?

414
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,680
This person is very cunning.

415
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,840
At first, we already have his trace.

416
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,000
But when we reach there,

417
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
he has already left.

418
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,840
I'll send more people to look for him.

419
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,320
No need. The more people there are,

420
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,520
the easier it is for an information
to be leaked.

421
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,560
Send a message to Minister Wu.
He'll be in charge of this.

422
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
We have to find
this person's hiding spot.

423
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
-Yes, Your Highness.
-You may leave.

424
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,000
Your Highness.

425
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,200
You are still here.

426
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,640
How's Prince Chen?

427
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,800
Looks like you are
quite worried about him.

428
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,680
Prince Chen is very straightforward
and he hates evil.

429
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,520
Now, he is framed by others
and is sent into prison.

430
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,280
I feel bad for him.

431
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,840
He is too reckless and he never
thinks about the consequences.

432
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,760
It's time for him to
learn his lessons.

433
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,360
If you really think that,

434
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,400
you wouldn't have gone
to the court to accept this case.

435
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,080
Before, you never take part
in the state affairs...

436
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,000
and yet people had already
sent assassins to murder you.

437
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,920
Now, you went into the court
and accepted this case.

438
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,280
There will be more
assassinations for sure.

439
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,320
Please be careful, Your Highness.

440
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,840
Are you worried about me?

441
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,440
Before this, you always acted so cold.

442
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,520
So, I thought that you are
a heartless man.

443
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,560
But from the looks of it now,

444
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,000
by lending a helping hand
to Princess Zhao Yun...

445
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,800
and taking on a case for Prince Chen,

446
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,520
I can see that you
have a cold exterior...

447
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,480
but with a warm heart inside.

448
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,240
I respect you. That's why
I worry about your safety.

449
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,000
If you think so, why do you
always think about leaving?

450
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm different from you.

451
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,560
-I have my own mission.
-What is your mission?

452
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,160
My mission is of course about
expanding my business.

453
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,640
I want to open my teahouse
in every country.

454
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,600
You are quite ambitious.

455
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,720
This is just the ambition
of a merchant.

456
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,040
It's incomparable to you who have to
care for the people in this nation.

457
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,760
I don't have many people around me.

458
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm just doing my best
to protect them.

459
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,760
The people in this nation...

460
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,520
has nothing to do with me.

461
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
You might say that...

462
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,000
but that might not be what you think.

463
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,920
Why do you say that?

464
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,240
I know a little about Lady Yun
and Chief Minister Qin...

465
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,120
when they were still alive.
And they have my deep respect.

466
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,080
I don't need to guess...

467
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,120
whose memorial tablet this is for.

468
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,160
It has been more than 20 years.

469
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,120
But you still remember the departed.

470
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,240
I can see that you
have never forgotten...

471
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,800
about your elders' unfulfilled wishes.

472
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,160
If other people speak about this,

473
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,640
I will not give them
a chance to continue.

474
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,480
You know that I bring no ill will.

475
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,400
You have a clear view
on the shipwreck case.

476
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,600
I can see that you have always
paid attention to the public affairs.

477
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,840
That's why you let Prince Chen
make a scene in the Eastern Palace.

478
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,920
Because everything
is under your control.

479
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,800
Looks like I have
underestimated you once again.

480
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,320
I'm sure that...

481
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,840
you have already read that letter.

482
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,280
I found that in the
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

483
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,880
Of course I need to take a look
to make sure that...

484
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,200
it won't bring me any harm.

485
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,560
You have a really...

486
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,680
good pair of eyes.

487
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,000
I didn't look with my eyes.

488
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,840
I look with my heart.

489
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,840
Only by using heart,

490
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,160
can you see the intentions of others.

491
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,600
Then can you see
my intentions toward you?

492
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,680
<i>I miss you but I can only
gaze at you in silence.</i>

493
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,200
<i>You are keeping me out with your care.
Although we are together...</i>

494
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,080
You are a very closed off person.

495
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,480
I think I can only see the things...

496
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,160
that you chose to let me see.

497
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,440
Usually, you are very careful with
words and you are good in pretending.

498
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,720
But you said so much today.

499
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,360
Are you trying to tell me that...

500
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,440
it'll be dangerous for me
to be too close to you?

501
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,120
And so, I should send you
back immediately?

502
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,200
You think too much, Your Highness.

503
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,720
I just feel that...

504
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,120
if a person is too good in pretending,

505
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,960
he'll live a very exhaustive life.

506
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,040
In this life, if there's no one
who understand you,

507
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
won't you feel very lonely?

508
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,520
<i>For you, I am willing to suffer.</i>

509
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,040
<i>I want to ward off
the coldness for you.</i>

510
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,920
<i>As long as I can be with you,</i>

511
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,560
<i>I'm willing to choose the cold.</i>

512
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,800
Lian Xin. Clean it carefully.
Don't spoil it.

513
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
Lian Xin.

514
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,600
Lian Xin!

515
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Yes, Sister Ling Yue.

516
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,440
Sir, do you have news about princess?

517
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,120
I already know where she is.

518
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,160
-She will be back soon.
-That's great.

519
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,240
-I'll go and make some preparations.
-Me too.

520
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,360
Lian Xin.

521
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,800
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

522
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
Please enjoy your meal.

523
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,840
Where is His Highness?

524
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,280
He's still in discussion
with Sir Leng.

525
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,920
I don't wish to eat
these oily food today.

526
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,880
Please prepare some porridge
and some dishes for me.

527
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Alright.

528
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,480
Come out.

529
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,000
Are you alright, Princess?

530
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm fine. What about you?
How did you get in?

531
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,240
I had been waiting
for a chance to come in.

532
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,520
I saw some carriages
coming without being checked.

533
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,400
So, I followed the last carriage
to come inside.

534
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,880
Why did nobody check the carriages?

535
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
I think they carry the secret files
from the palace.

536
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,520
Only Prince Li can open it.

537
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,280
Princess, I'll find a way
to bring you out.

538
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,680
No need.

539
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,760
Since Prince Li kept me here,

540
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,120
I can use this chance to
get some information.

541
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,000
Since you are here, help me out.

542
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,600
Your Highness.

543
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,480
" Lin's Village outside of
the northern suburb. "

544
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,240
-Send someone to get him.
-Yes, Your Highness.

545
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,440
Wait.

546
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,840
Leng Yan, take a look at this.

547
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,280
Do you still remember that...

548
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,440
when Chief Minister Qin
was still here,

549
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,560
he used to bring in talented people
from all over the place...

550
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,920
-to work for our nation, right?
-Yes, I do.

551
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,440
The Chief Minister didn't care
about their family backgrounds.

552
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,560
So, many people from the poor
had become the officers in the court.

553
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
Something was mentioned here.

554
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,160
Sixteen years ago, Li Zhi Yuan was
appointed as a third-rank officer.

555
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,080
He is a high-ranking talent.

556
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,880
Based on what I know,
most of the high-ranking talents...

557
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,760
from that period were
hired as assistants...

558
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,160
to join in with the writing of
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

559
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,080
<i>The Book of Mountains and Rivers.</i>

560
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,960
So, not only Li Zhi Yuan...

561
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,120
has the evidence about
crown prince selling the ranks,

562
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
it's very possible that...

563
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,920
he has the clue about my
teacher's case sixteen years ago.

564
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,240
-Search the roof for intruder!
-Roger that!

565
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,480
Your Highness. Nobody is outside.

566
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
<i>The Book of Mountains and Rivers.</i>

567
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,960
-Who is it?
-It's me.

568
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,200
Come in.

569
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,760
It's so late. What is it?

570
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,760
I saw that you are still awake.

571
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,040
So, I brought a
calming incense for you.

572
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,480
Thank you for your care,
Your Highness.

573
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,720
Rest well.

574
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,400
Princess, we already have
a clue about the book.

575
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,240
What is out next step?

576
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,760
Princess, you can't waver.
You have to be determined.

577
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,440
Please remember that you are
Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

578
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,840
Just focus on hiding yourself well.

579
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,520
Go back the same way
when they send out the secret files.

580
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,320
Do not reveal your identity.

581
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,280
I have my own plans for
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

582
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Need not worry about it.

583
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,400
Yes, Princess.

584
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,360
Scoundrel! How can you let
Li Zhi Yuan escape?

585
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,560
He's just a helpless scholar.

586
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,200
Where can he run?

587
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,160
Li Zhi Yuan is very secretive.

588
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,760
We couldn't find him although
I had sent out many to do so.

589
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,520
If we can't find him, I'm sure that
Prince Li can't find him too.

590
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,400
As long as he stays hidden,

591
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,080
Prince Li can do nothing against us.

592
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,440
Idiot!

593
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,760
This man knows too many
of our secrets.

594
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,480
Now that Prince Li has
known that he's still alive,

595
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,920
he must be killed.

596
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,080
We can't let Prince Li
get to him first.

597
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,440
Now, the His Majesty's trust
is already wavering.

598
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
If we are exposed for selling ranks,

599
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,160
crown prince will be in deep trouble.
Understand?

600
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,880
Sir Yu.

601
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
If this man lives and the worst comes
to worst, I'll just lose some money.

602
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,800
But for Yu family,

603
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,360
you are the one who
will be in deep trouble.

604
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,520
Yes, Your Highness.

605
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,880
Sir, Li Zhi Yuan's house
is already empty.

606
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,640
These are the ones left.

607
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,440
Where is Li Zhi Yuan?
