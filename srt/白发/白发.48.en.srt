00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,040
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,480
Episode 48

3
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
Lady Rong Le, it's almost
time for the morning session.

4
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,040
Your Highness,
it's time to get changed.

5
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
Your Highness.

6
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,200
You are awake.

7
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,960
Who are you?
Why are you in my room?

8
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,040
If you are worried Prince Li
will blame you for this,

9
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,480
I will keep this secret for you.

10
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
Ever since I started to serve you,

11
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
I have been deeply in love with you.

12
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
And now I am going to die for you,

13
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,280
I shall have no regret.

14
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Don't be ridiculous.

15
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
I have no idea who you are.

16
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Your Highness!

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
Your Highness!

18
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,360
Your Highness, you can't do this.

19
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
We are in the house of Prince Li.

20
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,840
Please, don't be so reckless.

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
You must not kill him.

22
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,440
Guards, lock him up
and interrogate him.

23
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Your Highness, you can't
be so cruel to me!

24
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,960
Your Highness!

25
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,360
Your Highness!

26
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,440
And the rest of you,
get back to your work.

27
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Miss Sun.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
You betrayed Prince Li.

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,600
That man was not an assassin!

30
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,840
I was locked inside this side room.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,160
I peeped outside through
a crevice in the door.

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
Ling Yue brought this man here...

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
by sneaking him in from
the garden during the night.

34
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,000
Enough of your madness!

35
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
If you don't love Prince Li,

36
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,720
why won't you let me have him?

37
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
If you don't love him,
why are you still holding onto him?

38
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,400
-She killed someone! Look!
-Let go!

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,840
-Your beloved Consort Rong Le...
-Guards!

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,600
is going to kill someone!

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,720
Guards! Save Her Highness now!

42
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,080
Guards!
Take her down, now!

43
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,920
-Yes.
-Look at her!

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,480
Let go of me!

45
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
-She is killing someone!
-Your Highness.

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,640
-Look! She is killing someone!
-Consort Rong Le has a beau...

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
and we all know that.

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,400
What a waste of
Prince Li's love for her.

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,960
What are you looking at?
Get back to your work now!

50
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Your Highness,

51
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,800
this must be a setup.

52
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,440
Chun Ni? Where is she now?

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,320
She was keeping watch last night.
She must know something.

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,120
Prince Fan Yang urges to
get ready for the morning session.

55
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,120
Tell them I'll be there in a moment.

56
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
-I will be there.
-Yes.

57
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,520
-What do we do now?
-Ling Yue.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,000
Change my clothes for me.

59
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Your Highness.

60
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,080
What do the officers have
to discuss today?

61
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,520
I heard Your Highness...

62
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,600
was found to be in bed
with another man this morning.

63
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,080
While Prince Li is away for war,
you are committing adultery.

64
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,600
Consort Rong Le,
what do you have to explain?

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,400
The beau is just outside.

66
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,080
If we hadn't run into him just now,

67
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,040
he might have been
mistaken as an assassin...

68
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,040
and executed by Your Highness.

69
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
Insolence!

70
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,480
Do not draw your own conclusion.

71
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,840
There are many questions
to be answered.

72
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,760
We cannot draw our own conclusion
and deem the Consort guilty.

73
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,920
Prince Li trusts Her highness.

74
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,600
We still need to rely on her
for the national affairs.

75
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,720
Before we get any solid evidence,

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
the Consort is still who she is.

77
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
Please, show your respect for her.

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,680
I think we should discuss this matter
when Prince Li returns.

79
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,600
I disagree with you.

80
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,320
The Consort is the decision maker
of the Imperial Court.

81
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,160
Her Highness' decency...

82
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
is more than just a family matter.

83
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,400
If Her Highness is not loyal
to Prince Li,

84
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,400
then she might betray
this land as well.

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,480
In that case, what right
does she has...

86
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,520
to make the decision...

87
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,480
and bring order to Imperial Court?

88
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,480
All of you are in high spirit...

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,760
out of your loyalty for His Highness,

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
that is a relief.

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,880
But I know better than anyone...

92
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,440
that I didn't do anything
to betray Prince Li.

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,920
I am now being framed
by people with vile intention.

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,480
If I cannot prove my innocence,

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
I am afraid Sir Cao is right.

96
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
I cannot be the decision maker.

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
In that case,

98
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,520
you are all trustworthy
officers of His Highness,

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
I am willing to leave
the investigation to you.

100
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,400
I hope you can bring me
the justice I deserve.

101
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
I just came back from Chen
not long ago.

102
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
I have no personal
attachment for Your Highness.

103
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,200
Allow me to make the judgement
for this matter.

104
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
Is there any objection?

105
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,360
You have always been
righteous, honourable...

106
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,960
and a valued officer.

107
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
I have heard from Prince Li about
your wisdom and wise judgement.

108
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
I have no objection.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,800
I assure you, Your Highness,

110
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,480
while I am here,

111
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,320
I won't allow anyone
to frame or disrespect you.

112
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,800
Pardon my frankness.

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Bring the witness in.

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,520
Do you recognise
the person sitting there?

115
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,080
Earlier this morning,

116
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,320
someone saw you
coming out from her room.

117
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,480
It has nothing to do with her.

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,280
From the first moment I saw her,

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,000
I have been in love with her.

120
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,600
It was me that seduced her.

121
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,280
She never gave me any promises.

122
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,320
He is spitting lies!

123
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,960
I have never met him
before this morning.

124
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
I don't know him either.

125
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
But people saw him
coming out from your room.

126
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,520
The Consort's room has always
been heavily guarded.

127
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,520
How is it possible for this man
to walk around so freely?

128
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480
In that case,

129
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,920
all who passed by
Her Highness' room...

130
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,960
shall be brought
in for questioning.

131
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,400
Bring them in.

132
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
While the two of you
were in the Consort's room,

133
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,840
did you see this man?

134
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,840
We were there only to help
Her Highness get changed.

135
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,680
-We don't know anything.
-Yes.

136
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,160
Miss Ling Yue came in and
chased all of us out.

137
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
We didn't see anything back there.

138
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,560
Take them away from here.

139
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
Bring in Ling Yue.

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Officers, do not believe what
this assassin is telling you.

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
He must be trying to harm the Consort.

142
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,600
Her Highness puts Prince Li
even before her own life.

143
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,040
She would never do anything
to hurt Prince Li.

144
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Prince Fan Yang, say something.

145
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
Ling Yue.

146
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,240
Simply tell us...

147
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,200
what you saw in
the Consort's room just now.

148
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,080
I went into Her Highness' room,

149
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,440
she was pointing a sword at this man.

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,120
He must be an assassin.

151
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,520
He was trying to kill her
but he was compromised.

152
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
You said he is an assassin,

153
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,920
what evidence do you have?

154
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,040
The Consort's room is heavily guarded.

155
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,080
How exactly did this killer
sneak past the guards?

156
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,600
How did Her Highness
find out about his motive?

157
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,240
How did she retaliate?

158
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,760
Was there any witness...

159
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
 at the scene?

160
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Chun Ni the servant
can be her witness.

161
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,440
Her Highness has issues falling asleep
since she got the injury.

162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
It was Chun Ni who has been
keeping watch for Her Highness.

163
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,600
She was on duty last night.

164
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,640
Your Highness.

165
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,000
Was Chun Ni in your room last night?

166
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,600
Can you prove she was there?

167
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,640
Yes.

168
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Bring her in.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,760
Officers, someone from the house
found a corpse in the well.

170
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,400
After examination, we can
confirm she was killed...

171
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
before being disposed into the well.

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,760
The servants recognise her.

173
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,440
It was the Consort's
personal servant, Chun Ni.

174
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,200
I killed her!

175
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,920
Nonsense!

176
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
This has nothing to do
with her Highness.

177
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,680
Chun Ni was getting into my way.

178
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,840
I strangled her and
tossed her into the well.

179
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,080
Her Highness didn't know.

180
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
According to the forensics,
she wasn't strangled to death.

181
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,920
The cause of death
was impact to her skull.

182
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,560
-She died from skull fracture?
-Your Highness.

183
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,200
What do you have to explain?

184
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,080
The servant must have found out
about your affair,

185
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,440
that is why she was killed.

186
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,600
This man is even trying
to defend Her Highness.

187
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
So this is why Her Highness
looks so calm.

188
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,800
She killed the witness!

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,320
So he really is her beau.

190
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,040
She killed the witness.

191
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,400
Silence!

192
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,560
We only found the body.

193
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,200
This doesn't mean Chun Ni
was killed by Her Highness.

194
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
Allow me...

195
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,720
to conduct a search at your room...

196
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,080
-to acquire more evidence.
-Why?

197
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
The Man Yin Chamber
is Her Highness' room.

198
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,960
No one can enter the room
without order from Prince Li.

199
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,560
Besides, there is no way
she would kill Chun Ni.

200
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
Ling Yue.

201
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,920
That's enough.

202
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Sir Cao.

203
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,760
I allow you to conduct the search.

204
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
But it must be by
someone I can trust.

205
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,240
After all, we are
searching for evidence,

206
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
not a fabricated false proof.

207
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,000
Your Highness.

208
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,160
I am willing to lead the search.

209
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,760
Do I have the permission?

210
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
Thank you, Prince Fan Yang.

211
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,960
Prince Fan Yang, we didn't
find anything suspicious.

212
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,520
If there is nothing here,
then we can leave now.

213
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,640
-Yes.
-I found something!

214
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
Your Highness, look.

215
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,800
A witness wishes
to have an audience.

216
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,240
Bring her in.

217
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,920
Greetings, Consort Rong Le
and fellow officers.

218
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,680
I am Sun Ya Li, the daughter
of the fugitive Sun Ji Zhou.

219
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,840
I was a witness at
Man Yin Chamber this morning.

220
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,440
I am willing to prove
what happened just now.

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
I hope all of you...

222
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,520
-would let me explain.
-No!

223
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
She is mad, you can't take
her words as evidence!

224
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,280
Besides, she holds grudge
against the Consort.

225
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,080
Miss Sun is speaking clearly and
with manner, she is perfectly normal.

226
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
You are just a mere servant,

227
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,800
how dare you show
such insolence on the court!

228
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,840
Miss Sun,

229
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,360
if you were there,

230
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
would you mind tell us what you saw?

231
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,520
When I was at the Consort's room,

232
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,920
she was holding a sword
and trying to kill the man.

233
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,640
If you don't believe me,

234
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,280
you can check the cut
on the man's neck.

235
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,040
But people came in before
she had the time to end him.

236
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,640
A dozen of people
can prove what I said.

237
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,680
Indeed.

238
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,720
After investigating, most of the
people that were at your room...

239
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,520
saw you holding a sword against
this man and trying to kill him.

240
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,840
Someone even heard Ling Yue...

241
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,760
telling you not to kill the man.

242
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,520
No, I was just reminding...

243
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,720
Silence!

244
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Miss Sun, continue.

245
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
When I was locked up inside the manor,

246
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,120
I saw Ling Yue bring that man
inside more than once.

247
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,440
This man disguises as a
male servant to sneak in.

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,680
I didn't notice at first.

249
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
Now that I think of it,

250
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
the side room I live in...

251
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,040
is right between the path to
the back door and Man Yin Chamber.

252
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,560
Which is why when Ling Yue
brought him inside,

253
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,280
I was able to see them.

254
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,400
Miss Sun,

255
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,440
you said you are locked inside
the side room,

256
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,600
how did you notice Ling Yue
and this man?

257
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
Sir,

258
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,040
Ling Yue claimed that...

259
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
I hold a grudge against the Consort.

260
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
She was telling the truth.

261
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,840
Both Ling Yue and the Consort
were my close friends.

262
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,480
But I found out about her affair,

263
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,640
so she started to grow apart from me.

264
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
She even framed me.

265
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
In order to hide her secret,

266
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
she even locked me inside the manor.

267
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,040
I could only peep through
the cracks of door and window...

268
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,520
to see the world outside
and ease my mind.

269
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,240
But who knows?

270
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,440
All I saw was Ling Yue and that man.

271
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,520
They came in at midnight
and leave at dawn.

272
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,080
Her Highness must be using
that time to commit adultery.

273
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,480
You mad woman!
What are you talking about?

274
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,480
You heard it all, she was trying
to frame Her highness.

275
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,600
Ling Yue.

276
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,680
I won't blame you for
calling me a mad woman.

277
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,280
You are her servant,

278
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
this is your duty.

279
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,600
But listen to me,

280
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,640
she will sacrifice
anyone for her own gain.

281
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,200
You must protect yourself.

282
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,080
Let go of me!
Do not fall for her lies!

283
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,640
Ling Yue!
This is enough!

284
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,720
Miss Sun, you mentioned that...

285
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,640
the Consort locked you up
to protect her secret?

286
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,680
Yes.

287
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
Fellow officers,

288
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,920
all you know about is the woman
Prince Li married as his consort,

289
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
but you didn't know...

290
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,040
the same woman was once
wife of Fu Chou from Northern Realm!

291
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,920
While she is married to Fu Chou,
she seduced Prince Li.

292
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,360
She is also Rong Le
the Elder Princess of Western Qi.

293
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,400
The whole nation knows she was
once General Fu's wife!

294
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
Shut it!

295
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,560
Don't fall for her lies!

296
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,040
She is clearly holding a grudge
against Her Highness!

297
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,680
When we were in General Fu's manor,

298
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
Miss Sun tried to seduce the General!

299
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,360
Now that she is in Qingzhou,

300
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,280
she climbed into
Prince Li's bed instead!

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,640
-Enough!
-She is...

302
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
You mentioned the General's manor.

303
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,280
The manor of General of Defence?

304
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,160
She is Fu Chou's wife?

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
So, the rumours are true.

306
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,000
You vile woman!

307
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
You may have dark hair now,

308
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,520
and Prince Li believes
you are no demon,

309
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,960
but if you are Fu Chou's wife,

310
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,440
you might also be a spy
from Northern Realm.

311
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Your Highness!

312
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Why?

313
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Why are you the one getting their love
even when you betrayed them?

314
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,960
I was always righteous
but I lost my whole family!

315
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,400
This is all your fault!

316
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,480
Let go of her! Let go!

317
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,880
Let it go!

318
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,480
Consort Rong Le!

319
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,680
How dare you kill a person
in front of us all!

320
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
Do Prince Li and the laws...

321
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
mean nothing in your eyes?

322
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,240
-He is right!
-Sir.

323
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,720
This is not true,
Her Highness didn't do it.

324
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
It was me, I killed Miss Sun.

325
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,040
-It was me that pushed her.
-Consort Rong Le!

326
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
What else do you have to say?

327
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,440
You committed adultery and murders!

328
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,360
All of these crimes...

329
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,080
are your doings!

330
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,280
Bring it in.

331
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,200
Inside the Man Yin Chamber,

332
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,680
we found shard with
blood stain on it.

333
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,640
The servants confirmed this.

334
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,440
It was from the vase
that was used in your room.

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,520
I bet after you hit Chun Ni
with this vase,

336
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,320
you cleaned the crime scene.

337
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,320
That's why you allowed me
 to search your room.

338
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,760
But you never expect...

339
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,480
or noticed that...

340
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,760
there was a shard left by the bed.

341
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,920
There were even blood stains
under the bed.

342
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,360
You overlooked the details.

343
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,680
I have another question
for Your Highness.

344
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,280
Prince Li sent several
urgent request...

345
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,080
and urged you to send
reinforcement to the front line.

346
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,560
But you delayed the requests.

347
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,080
You secretly kept a beau and
betrayed His Highness!

348
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,240
I have no choice but to suspect...

349
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,680
you are purposely sending
Prince Li to danger.

350
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,680
You left him to die by the hands
of the Northern Realm!

351
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,760
You want to take the throne
for your own by killing your husband!

352
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
Prince Li trusted you,

353
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
but you are sending him to his death!

354
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,200
Prince Li arrives!

355
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,440
Wu You!

356
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,400
I know you will believe me.

357
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,080
They didn't know about our past,

358
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,400
but you will believe me, right?

359
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,360
About Ya Li,

360
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't know why she would
come up with so many lies.

361
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,880
I didn't kill her, it wasn't me!

362
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,920
Why?

363
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,680
Why are you doing this?

364
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,680
Do you really think I can accept this?

365
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
Wu You.

366
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,000
You don't believe me?

367
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,840
People can lose their trust in me,

368
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,400
but why won't you believe me either?

369
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,080
-Her Highness!
-The Consort is...

370
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,760
-Leng Yan!
-Yes!

371
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,400
Take this sinner...

372
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,640
into the prison!

373
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,160
Yes!

374
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
That is all for today.

375
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,920
Get some rest.

376
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes.

377
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,800
You wish to learn martial arts too?

378
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,840
I can teach you a thing or two.

379
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,400
But you must remember.

380
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,920
Sometimes, not knowing
any martial art...

381
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,520
makes it easier to cover your identity
and keep yourself hidden.

382
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,680
-Thank you, Master.
-Don't call me that.

383
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,920
Not even she is my student,

384
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,840
neither are you.

385
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,880
From now on, you will be Qing Hu.

386
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,960
Stay by her side,
keep an eye on her.

387
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,240
If there is anything unusual,

388
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,080
report back to me.

389
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,160
Yes.

390
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
Our previous plan failed.

391
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
Master is bringing
this plan forward.

392
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,960
Yes.

393
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,400
Let go of me!

394
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,320
We are born under the same roof,

395
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,400
why are you the princess...

396
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
and I am the lowly servant?

397
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,240
Xiao Sha!

398
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,400
Everything is set, bring Her Highness
and come with me.

399
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,920
Brother, you look pale.

400
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,600
You stayed up all night?

401
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,240
Shouldn't you be in the camp?
Why are you here?

402
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
I am worried for you.

403
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,560
They said she is locked up,
is that true?

404
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,400
Brother, you can't honestly
believe she is keeping a beau.

405
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
That is not who she is.

406
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
I know her better than anyone.

407
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,760
If there is nothing else,

408
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,000
get back to the camp
and prepare for the battle.

409
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,240
Your Highness.

410
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,840
Your Highness,
report from the prison guard.

411
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,560
The Consort went missing last night.

412
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,560
Xiao Sha and Ling Yue
are gone as well.

413
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,800
Alert the guards,
send out the wanted order!

414
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,520
-Yes.
-Leng Yan.

415
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,040
Lead your men on the search,

416
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,680
you must find her at all cost.

417
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,040
Yes.

418
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,680
Brother, are you really
going to kill her?

419
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,320
She is Man Yao!

420
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,000
She is the one you gave up
your life to protect!

421
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,560
What is going on now?

422
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,080
I know, because of
what happened to Lady Yun,

423
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,920
you are very upset.
But this scandal about a beau...

424
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,680
and the rumours about
Silver-Hair Demon...

425
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,880
are clearly lies to frame her.

426
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,680
Can't you see it?

427
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
Are you done?

428
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Mind your own business.

429
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,200
Leave.

430
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,840
Shouldn't you be in the camp?
Why are you here again?

431
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
Rong Le is going to get killed!

432
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,560
Why are you still messing around here?

433
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,440
What did you say?

434
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,720
Who is harming Princess Rong Le?

435
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,960
Explain everything!

436
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,320
Someone is framing Rong Le.

437
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,000
They said she is keeping a beau.

438
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,320
To make things worse,
Wu You believes the lies.

439
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,480
He sent her to the prison.

440
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,400
She is now a wanted fugitive!

441
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
I must help her!

442
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
-Where are you going?
-Let go of me!

443
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,400
-Where are you going?
-I need to find her!

444
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,960
How are you supposed to do that?

445
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,560
She is not in the manor or the prison.

446
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
The guards told me...

447
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,680
your brother was seen near the prison.

448
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,080
I bet he is the one
that rescued Rong Le.

449
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,920
-My brother?
-Yes.

450
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,280
Where could they be now?

451
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,040
They couldn't have gone far.

452
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,800
Rong Le is still wounded.

453
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,480
She is wounded?

454
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,200
All the more reason to go to her now!

455
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,880
Calm down!

456
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,280
Listen to me!

457
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,920
From what I heard,
her wound isn't so serious.

458
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,720
Your brother and Ling Yue
are there to take care of her.

459
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,200
Don't worry about it.

460
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,880
She is safe.

461
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,120
Princess Rong Le and my brother
are the only family I have.

462
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,360
If they are gone,

463
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
I have no reason to stay here.

464
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
It's all right, they will be fine.

465
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,960
Come here and have a seat.

466
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,840
Don't worry.

467
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
When my brother calms down,

468
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,280
he will bring Rong Le back
after his mind is clear.

469
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,280
Trust me.

470
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,000
They will be fine.

471
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,200
Really?

472
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,120
I am sure of it.

473
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,880
You know how much
my brother loves Rong Le.

474
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
When the rumours about
Silver-Hair Demon was spreading,

475
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,640
my brother risked his life
just to keep her safe.

476
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,200
Isn't that right?

477
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,120
It's all right.

478
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,240
I should be on my way now.

479
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,280
There much works to be done
back in the camp.

480
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,840
You need to take care of yourself.

481
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,480
When Rong Le comes back,
she needs you to tend to her.

482
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,960
Right?

483
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,760
What?

484
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,520
She was keeping a beau
and escaped from prison?

485
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,480
-This is impossible.
-According to the scout,

486
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Prince Li stabbed her in front of
everyone and sent her to prison.

487
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,400
That was indeed the truth.

488
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,880
But the Consort went
missing from the prison,

489
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
so Prince Li sent out order
to have her arrested.

490
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,400
Zongzheng Wu You must be
out of his mind!

491
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,920
With Rong Le's righteousness,

492
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,520
she would never do
something so outrageous.

493
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,400
This is clearly a set-up.

494
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,400
Zongzheng Wu You is no fool.

495
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,080
How could he fall for this trick?

496
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,560
According to my source,
there are people...

497
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,680
that saw the Consort sleeping
in a bed with another man.

498
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,960
They have both witnesses
and evidences.

499
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,200
Perhaps this is why
Prince Li lost his nerves.

500
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,520
Get to the bottom of this.

501
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,400
Find Rong Le and report back to me.

502
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,920
Yes.

503
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,400
Your Highness.

504
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,840
Quickly, have a seat.

505
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,200
Let me take this off.

506
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,880
Does it still hurt?

507
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,640
We have a search warrant!

508
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,720
Officers, how may I help you?

509
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,800
Have you seen this woman?
She is badly wounded.

510
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,000
No.

511
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,200
Your Highness, the soldiers
with search warrant are here.

512
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,080
I will distract them,
use the opening to leave.

513
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,840
We have search warrant!
Everyone, come out from your rooms!

514
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,480
There is no time.

515
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,360
What do we do now?
They are coming up here.

516
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,280
We will improvise as we move along.

517
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,920
At worst case, we will show ourselves
and fight them off.

518
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,560
Your Highness, this way.

519
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,680
Captain, are they the targets?

520
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,480
-Stop right there!
-After them!

521
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,360
Your highness, someone disguised
as us and distracted the guards.

522
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,760
They actually left.

523
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,160
Who could they be?

524
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,960
Who dressed as us
and distracted the soldiers?

525
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,080
I was at the clinic
to get some medicines,

526
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,440
a few men were asking around
for your whereabouts.

527
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,360
I think they are from
the Northern Realm.

528
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,480
Your Highness, it must be
General Fu Chou.

529
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
He knows you are in trouble
so he sent help.

530
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,600
Whoever that was,

531
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,480
they soldiers are gone now.

532
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,440
This place is safe for time being.

533
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
We will stay here for the night...

534
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
and leave at dawn tomorrow.

535
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
This is outrageous.

536
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,920
Someone framed you.

537
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,280
But Prince Li actually
believes their lies.

538
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,240
He even ordered to have you arrested.

539
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,880
That is cruel.

540
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,600
Your Highness, have some tea.

541
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,960
Her Highness is still wounded.

542
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,880
We can't keep running and hiding.

543
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,080
We need to find a place
so she can get well.

544
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,240
The land is vast,

545
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,320
Prince Li's men is everywhere.

546
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,560
There is no safe place
for me in the south.

547
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,520
As for the Northern Realm,

548
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,160
I will never step into
that land again.

549
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
I am not going back
to Western Qi either.

550
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,520
In this whole world,

551
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,240
there is no place for me
to get shelter.

552
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,880
Your Highness,

553
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,120
we can still head to Chen.

554
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,720
Prince Zhen Bei is your good friend.

555
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,360
Besides, his wife is
Princess Zhao Yun.

556
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,520
She is your close friend too.

557
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,440
If you go there, I am sure
they will get you a fine doctor.

558
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,640
Your Highness.

559
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,480
Are you afraid this might
bring them trouble?

560
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,520
But I think Prince Zhen Bei
is not one that fears troubles.

561
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,520
He is friendly and helping.

562
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,400
You even saved his life once.

563
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
He owes his life for you.

564
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,600
Furthermore,

565
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,400
you haven't seen Princess Zhao Yun
in over a year.

566
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,080
She would be really
glad to see you again.

567
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,040
Very well.

568
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,600
We will head to Chen.

569
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,120
I will ready the bed for you.

570
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,160
Your Highness,
we passed the southern border.

571
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
Chen is straight ahead.

572
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,960
Your Highness, are you all right?

573
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,600
I am fine.

574
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,520
Pick up the pace and leave this place.

575
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,320
The Seven Asuras!

576
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,800
Your Highness, Prince Li
is really trying to kill you!

577
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,880
Who are you? How dare you
pick a fight at our border!

578
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,320
Princess Rong Le?

579
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,720
Li Wu?

580
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,240
Your Majesty, I have an urgent report.

581
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,720
Come in.

582
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,080
Your Majesty,

583
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,920
Princess Rong Le was ambushed
at the border of Chen.

584
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,040
Li Wu the bodyguard of
Prince Zhen Bei rescued her.

585
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,520
She suffers no injury from the ambush.

586
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,560
But she had a fallout with Prince Li.

587
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,920
Her previous wounded got worse.

588
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,720
Everyone in the whole nation
knows about their fallout.

589
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,640
There are rumours it was
Prince Li who sent the assassins.

590
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,960
-I found out...
-Enough.

591
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,960
I know who did this.

592
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,760
For the past year,

593
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,040
Zongzheng Wu You executed
the reformation at the south.

594
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,600
He earned the people's trust.

595
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,960
Someone...

596
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,200
are afraid he might grow
more powerful by the days...

597
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,320
and becomes harder to deal with.

598
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,000
So, they used Rong Le
to create this mess.

599
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,720
The Silver-Hair Demon
was their plan,

600
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,080
so was the scandal.

601
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,560
Little Xun.

602
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,120
Yes.

603
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,920
Ready the carriage.

604
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,920
I am heading to Chen.

605
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,960
But Your Majesty, your health...

606
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,360
-I am afraid...
-Their plan failed.

607
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,520
After luring Rong Le to Chen,
they will come up with new plans.

608
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,320
The dessert I gave her could only
subdue the poison for a year.

609
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,040
The effect would have worn
out by now.

610
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,880
She may have consumed
the Blood Raven Root...

611
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,720
and suppressed the poison,

612
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,520
but she will have a relapse soon.

613
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,480
I must go to Chen.

614
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,160
Yes.

615
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,480
Any progress on the item
I ordered you to search?

616
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,480
This is why I came here.

617
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,480
This is half of the tome
that I found on Mount Lone Frost.

618
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,920
The information you want
is in this tome.
