1
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,747
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:32,758
Episode 49

3
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,956
Any progress on the item
I ordered you to search?

4
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,783
This is why I came here.

5
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,979
This is half of the tome
that I found on Mount Lone Frost.

6
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,900
The information you want
is in this tome.

7
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,435
Twenty years ago,

8
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:56,055
someone asked the Lone Frost Sage
for this tome but was turned down.

9
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:59,102
In the middle of the argument,
the tome was torn into two.

10
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,981
The first half was taken.

11
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:04,021
The other half was hidden by the Sage
inside the Cave of Zephyr.

12
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:08,753
Not even Xiao Ke, the Sage's
student has seen this tome.

13
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,165
Don't bother searching
for the other half.

14
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,672
I know where it is.

15
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:17,860
Back to your work.

16
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:19,567
Yes.

17
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:32,480
Rong Le.

18
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,162
Wait for me.

19
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,576
Because of the cursed Lady Yun,

20
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:48,450
he sent me to the Emperor of Qi
to be violated!

21
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:51,786
West?

22
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,289
Is this the word west?

23
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:11,664
Ever since you came back,

24
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,733
you hate anything
that gives reflection.

25
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,083
But why...

26
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:18,109
are you in the mood
to look into a mirror now?

27
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:21,533
We all...

28
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,372
have to face our scar eventually.

29
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,927
Keep running away from it...

30
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,217
will not solve anything at all.

31
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,735
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

32
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,969
Ever since you came
back from the south,

33
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:52,211
you barely visited me in
this palace.

34
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,703
Even when I invited you
to a dinner,

35
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:58,904
you turned it down
by saying you are busy.

36
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:00,756
That day,

37
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,259
you mentioned the
Emperor of Western Qi.

38
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,063
I bet that was Rong Qi's father,
Rong Yi.

39
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,692
Mother,

40
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,407
do you know him well?

41
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,739
Chou.

42
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,754
You look a little
under the wind today,

43
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:20,976
did our men in the south...

44
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,336
bear any news?

45
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,887
Your update on the
situation in south...

46
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,063
seems to be ahead
of everyone.

47
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,080
As for the question just now,

48
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,582
-did you and Emperor of Qi...
-I am tired.

49
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,809
You should go.

50
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,829
I remember when I was little,

51
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,074
I hated this very palace.

52
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,895
The owner of this place
never acknowledged me as his son.

53
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:57,015
In this place,

54
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,737
I never felt a moment
of warmth from anyone.

55
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,069
Not even...

56
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:03,069
the warmth of foods.

57
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,714
But after I left,

58
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,500
I wanted to come back here.

59
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,916
After all, I am the elder son
of the emperor.

60
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:13,007
All of these are rightfully mine.

61
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,447
I sacrificed a lot because of this.

62
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,765
I finally become its owner.

63
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,967
But then it crossed my mind.

64
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:23,684
Is this place...

65
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,658
rightfully mine in the end?

66
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:53,611
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

67
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:57,528
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

68
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:03,185
<i>We have thrown away
the fate that we got by chance.</i>

69
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:06,412
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

70
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,423
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

71
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,919
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

72
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:19,250
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

73
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:23,620
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

74
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:27,710
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

75
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:32,257
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

76
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,720
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

77
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:40,911
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

78
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:42,961
If you had chosen me...

79
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,947
the first time we met;

80
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,431
If I never used you for my plans;

81
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,098
If...

82
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:59,048
I never fed you that poison
 with my own hands;

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,251
If I recognized you at once,

84
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,151
perhaps...

85
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,567
we would still be together.

86
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,629
But the reality is...

87
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,151
there is no such thing as 'If'.

88
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:31,625
Your Highness.

89
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,965
-What is it?
-I received reports.

90
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,854
Consort Rong Le was ambushed by
the Seven Asuras at the border.

91
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,956
She was rescued by
Prince Zhen Bei's man.

92
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,202
What?

93
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:52,161
Because of Rong Le,

94
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,005
he once gave up on his pride
and his very life.

95
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,707
And now he sent the killers after her?
What does he want?

96
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:03,197
Maybe he loves her too much.

97
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:06,529
He can't allow any flaw
in their love.

98
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:08,393
He can't tolerate betrayal.

99
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:09,925
When the scandal took place,

100
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,510
he lost all his senses of judgement.

101
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,629
I heard...

102
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,756
it was because the ashes
of Lady Yun are lost,

103
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,731
Prince Li and Consort Rong Le
grew apart and barely met again.

104
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,528
Their love was not as
impregnable as before.

105
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,120
That is why he believed his wife
was keeping a beau.

106
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,774
He sent the Seven Asuras to
hunt her down,

107
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:34,237
it seems like he is really
trying to end her life for good.

108
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,597
Is he trying to avenge Lady Yun?

109
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,254
For the sake of the army's morale,
he gave up on Rong Le.

110
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,254
Where is Rong Le right now?

111
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,061
She is in Chen, the Emperor of Qi
is heading there as we speak.

112
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,016
Get everything ready,
 I am heading to Chen.

113
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,539
Your Highness,
if Empress Fu found out...

114
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,341
If she finds out, tell her I am going
there to purchase cavalry horses...

115
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,658
for our elite troops.
That is all you need to tell her.

116
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,208
Yes.

117
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,555
Zongzheng Wu You, if you
followed the same mistake as mine,

118
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,322
I will never let Rong Le return
to your side again.

119
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,522
You ordered me
to go into hiding for so long.

120
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,042
And now you summoned me here.

121
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,693
What if Fu Chou finds out?

122
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,913
He is now on his way to Chen.

123
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,423
He is still worried for Rong Le.

124
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,233
His worries...

125
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,236
is just what we wanted.

126
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:40,352
He completed so many missions
just for the sake of my revenge.

127
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,879
But when he realised I am alive,

128
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:49,297
his guilt for Rong Le becomes
even deeper.

129
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,407
When the Creed is destroyed,

130
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,751
I knew you would be mad at me.

131
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,501
But I had no other choice.

132
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:04,031
You helped me in
using Rong Le for my bidding,

133
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:07,352
forced Zongzheng Wu You
into surrendering,

134
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:12,299
some sacrifices are necessary
to calm Fu Chou's anger.

135
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,746
I understand.

136
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,944
I wasn't mad at you.

137
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:55,648
After all these years,
no matter what happens,

138
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:58,536
as long as you would
do something for me,

139
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:01,024
even when you allow
me to make you a cup of tea...

140
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,034
or you simply spare me a smile,

141
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:05,985
I will risk my life for you.

142
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:08,747
I would stay by your side
just to protect you...

143
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,733
and chose to became a eunuch.

144
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,693
Your kindness for me...

145
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,266
will not be forgotten.

146
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,055
I asked you here...

147
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:33,080
because I need a favour from you.

148
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:37,007
You can't live without me.

149
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:38,978
Have a seat.

150
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,697
For over a year,

151
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:52,109
I demanded Fu Chou
to invade the south,

152
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,740
but he refused.

153
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,203
He even went there alone
for his own death.

154
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,254
How disappointing.

155
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:03,908
Since he won't listen to me,

156
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,720
you shall go to Chen
in my place.

157
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,450
Find a way to help him.

158
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,078
If...

159
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,223
his stubbornness persists,

160
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,406
my vengeance...

161
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:18,664
I understand.

162
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:21,432
In order to protect Rong Le,
Zongzheng Wu You...

163
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:26,287
even turned his hair white
just like Rong Le.

164
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:28,552
I thought...

165
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,181
he would continue to defend her.

166
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,938
But his action...

167
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,902
is simply out of my expectation.

168
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:41,095
Losing her mother's ashes...

169
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,470
took a toll on his mind.

170
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,642
It doesn't matter.

171
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:58,248
We...

172
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,117
still have another plan in place.

173
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:04,246
I assure you,

174
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,868
this time...

175
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:08,689
I will make the plan
a reality for you.

176
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:33,147
Why is taking them so long?

177
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:35,974
Did they run into trouble on
their way here?

178
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,557
Li Wu just sent us a letter.

179
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,331
Rong Le is now wounded.

180
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,081
They went to a clinic
to treat the wound.

181
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,837
So, the carriage
couldn't move too fast.

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,748
Yun, don't worry too much.

183
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:50,056
Rong Le is now inside
the border of Chen.

184
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,724
They have Li Wu as their escort.

185
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,251
There is nothing to worry about.

186
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,332
Watch your steps.

187
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,561
-Zhao Yun.
-Princess Rong Le.

188
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:47,356
I am fine, don't worry about me.

189
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:55,290
Yun, Rong Le is still carrying injury.

190
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,276
They travelled a long journey.
Let's talk inside.

191
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,248
Rong Le, after parting
with you a year ago,

192
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,680
Zhao Yun and I miss you a lot.

193
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:44,483
I remember the time when we were in
the Northern Realm with Prince Li...

194
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:46,444
and having tea together.

195
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,986
Stop mentioning the things
that spoil her mood.

196
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,689
Fine, let's move on
to another topic.

197
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:59,603
Rong Le, we are worried when
we heard what happened to you.

198
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,914
I sent Li Wu to escort you.

199
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:04,537
But I never expected an
ambush from the assassins.

200
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:08,749
I heard they are the Seven Asuras
from the Hidden Ones.

201
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:10,664
Is it true?

202
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,538
The Seven Asuras?

203
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,424
Aren't those Brother Wu You's men?

204
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:16,675
-What happened?
-Princess Zhao Yun.

205
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,409
You should have seen Prince Li.

206
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:22,646
It's like he as become
an entirely different person.

207
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:24,348
Princess Rong Le is being framed,

208
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:25,721
not only did he not trust her,

209
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,966
he even sent the assassins
to hunt us down.

210
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:29,858
He is trying to kill Princess Rong Le!

211
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:34,330
No way, that is not
the Brother Wu You I know.

212
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:37,188
There must be some kind
of reasons behind this.

213
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,622
-I must write him a letter.
-Zhao Yun.

214
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,217
This is not the first
fallout I had with him.

215
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:48,963
What's done is done.

216
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:51,886
There is nothing I can say.

217
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:56,341
Please, stop mentioning his name?

218
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,495
I just want to be in peace
and get well.

219
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,132
She is right.

220
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,381
Your recovery comes first.

221
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,571
Yun, whatever happens,

222
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,443
the two of us will be on
Princess Rong Le's side.

223
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:10,895
Isn't that right?

224
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,123
Rong Le, you can stay here
without any worries.

225
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,721
Take it as you are keeping
Yun company.

226
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,165
-He is right, Princess Rong Le.
-Yun.

227
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,926
How many times have I told you?
Do not press your belly.

228
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:25,746
Yun,

229
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,360
 you are expecting a child?

230
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,851
It's only been over a month.

231
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:36,305
Congratulations.

232
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,661
I was worried for you at first.

233
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,156
But after seeing you,

234
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,120
I can tell you are
having a happy life.

235
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:46,579
Your Highness, a special guest
asked for Princess Rong Le.

236
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:23,664
Welcome, I am sorry
for the lack of proper welcome.

237
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,268
I apologise for that.

238
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,248
Not at all, Prince Zhen Bei.

239
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,824
I didn't send any letter to
inform you of my visit.

240
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,318
This may be all too sudden.
I hope you are not offended.

241
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:37,237
Not at all, I have heard about
how sharp and dashing you are.

242
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:39,914
The rumours are true after all.

243
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,699
Come on in.

244
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,534
Please.

245
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,891
Your Highness, we are here.

246
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:15,790
Please.

247
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:23,740
Your Majesty.

248
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,817
Your Highness, there is another
special guest.

249
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:42,036
Rong Qi?

250
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,040
What are you doing here?

251
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:45,642
It's been over a year
since we last met.

252
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:48,179
You became the Prince Regent
of the Northern Realm.

253
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,497
Yet, you lost your manner as well.

254
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,384
For someone like yourself,

255
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,275
I don't need any manner.

256
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,123
Today must be a special day.

257
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,831
Even General Fu is paying us a visit.

258
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,795
Wait, I should address you
as the Prince Regent.

259
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,760
Your Majesty, Prince Regent,

260
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,380
let's continue inside the house.

261
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,899
If you may.

262
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:18,734
Did you come here to
harm Rong Le again?

263
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:23,033
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

264
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,600
Rong Le is the sister I love the most.

265
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,261
I have always been kind to her,

266
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:28,658
why would I harm her?

267
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,802
As for you,

268
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:37,968
I married her to you so
you could treat her well.

269
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,539
But in the end you almost
got her killed.

270
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:48,400
I understand why
the two of you came here.

271
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:51,182
You are both here
for Princess Rong Le.

272
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:52,747
Right?

273
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:55,852
I heard she is here.

274
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:57,744
I have urgent matter to
discuss with her.

275
00:20:57,897 --> 00:20:59,731
Please, lead me to her.

276
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,654
You will try to hurt her.

277
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:04,689
Prince Zhen Bei.

278
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,215
if you wish to keep
Rong Le safe,

279
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,827
allow me to see her first.

280
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,147
Please, stop arguing.

281
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:12,622
To be honest with you,

282
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,161
Rong Le is indeed in my house.

283
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:17,465
However...

284
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:20,977
Is she wounded?

285
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,993
She is, but it was no serious injury.

286
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,132
When she came to my house
and met Zhao Yun,

287
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:29,740
they cuddled together
and started crying.

288
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:32,154
They have more tears than words
for each other.

289
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,562
Even mentioning
the name of Prince Li...

290
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,819
is too much for her to handle.

291
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:42,086
I know the two of you wanted
to see her very badly.

292
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,914
But she doesn't want
any guest for now.

293
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:46,789
If I insist on taking you to her,

294
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,043
she will definitely leave at once.

295
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,317
If something happens to her,

296
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,023
none of us could help her.

297
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:57,573
How about this?
I can send the two of you...

298
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,748
to the royal villa of our palace.

299
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:01,783
I will let Zhao Yun talk to her.

300
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,081
When she is in a better mood,

301
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:05,331
I will make the arrangement
for you to meet with her.

302
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:06,563
How does that sound?

303
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:09,788
Prince Zhen Bei, you and your wife
have my thanks.

304
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:11,896
Sure. How about...

305
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,539
I send you to the Qianlin Garden?

306
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:15,000
If you may?

307
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:30,089
I am surprised the Emperor of Qi
and General Fu are here.

308
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,165
Princess Rong Le, I assure you,

309
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,804
if you don't want to see them,

310
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,646
I won't let them bother you.

311
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:43,141
Zhao Yun, you don't need to
see me off to my room.

312
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:45,723
You are expecting a child,
you need to rest.

313
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:49,655
It's all right. I want
to keep you company.

314
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,779
For the past year,
other than Qian Yi,

315
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,426
I have no one to
talk to heart-to-heart.

316
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:00,191
I wish I could return to the
good old days.

317
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:02,490
I had you,

318
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:05,117
Brother Wu You and...

319
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,495
Princess Rong Le,

320
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:15,293
how is Wu Yu doing all this time?

321
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:19,069
He is fine, don't worry about it.

322
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:20,944
I am glad to hear that.

323
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,561
When we bid each other goodbye,

324
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,112
I thought I will never fall
in love with another man.

325
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:32,702
I was depressed when
I first came to Chen.

326
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:34,829
I felt like my life is meaningless.

327
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,107
But Qian Yi tried the best he could
to cheer me up every day.

328
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:40,624
When I fell ill,

329
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,919
he hired the best doctor
to treat me.

330
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,914
When I couldn't get used
to the food here,

331
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,067
he hired a great chef from
Northern Realm for me.

332
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,896
As long as I gave him a smile,

333
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:53,125
it would make him overjoyed for days.

334
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,259
I had never felt so much
love in my entire life.

335
00:23:57,665 --> 00:24:00,627
My feelings actually matter
so much to someone.

336
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,622
It looks like he does love you a lot.

337
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,173
He must have spent a
lot of time with you.

338
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:10,694
Before this, as soon as he got home,

339
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:12,581
he would keep me company.

340
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,403
But for some reason,

341
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:16,495
he seems to be
getting busier lately.

342
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:20,045
He rushed to his study for work
as soon as he got home.

343
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:36,707
Who is she?

344
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,217
I don't know.

345
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:42,789
Aside from me and
the female servants,

346
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:44,652
there hasn't been any
other woman in here.

347
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,366
Let's take a look.

348
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:49,331
Princess, no.

349
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,563
That is Qian Yi's study.

350
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:54,556
No one can step inside
without his permission.

351
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:56,728
Not even you?

352
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,968
That is the only place I haven't
been to in the whole manor.

353
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,149
Do you know that woman?

354
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:10,184
I feel like she looks familiar.

355
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:38,706
Prince Regent,

356
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:40,324
how may I help you?

357
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:42,850
Prince Regent.

358
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:45,498
How dare you get in my way.

359
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,821
No, I won't.

360
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,459
Little Xun.

361
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,398
Leave us be.

362
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,040
Yes.

363
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:59,287
Tell me why you really came here.

364
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:01,766
The last time we met,

365
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:03,687
your temper wasn't as bad.

366
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:13,871
This...

367
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,938
is the famous bitter tea of Chen.

368
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:22,254
Have some tea.

369
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,590
Enough about last time!

370
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:26,823
Do you take me as a fool?

371
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:30,040
It was you who sneaked
into my house...

372
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:31,937
and swapped Hen Xiang with Rong Le.

373
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:34,305
You made her suffer.

374
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,094
You are her brother,
how could you do this to her?

375
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:40,703
Rather than asking me,

376
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:43,285
you should be asking yourself.

377
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,629
You had your chances to
save her from dangers.

378
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,140
But you did nothing at all.

379
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:53,970
Yes.

380
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,910
That was my fault.

381
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,600
But you are the cause of all pain.

382
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:14,175
You made me lose Rong Le.

383
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:21,747
Do you even know what is
the true meaning of loss?

384
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:25,869
She never loved you and
she was never yours.

385
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,950
How is this your loss?

386
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:33,338
I know, you couldn't
wait to end my life.

387
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:35,753
I wish I could
do the same to you.

388
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:38,319
However,

389
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:40,615
I take pity on you.

390
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,316
Even until now,

391
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:46,366
you have no idea who
the true enemy is.

392
00:27:47,703 --> 00:27:50,015
You have my sympathy for this.

393
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,215
Do not taunt me with this.

394
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:01,939
I know.

395
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:04,442
All you wanted was to use me...

396
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,872
so I could kill
Zongzheng Wu You for you.

397
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:08,888
I have stated my stand clearly.

398
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,480
This time, I will not work with you.

399
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,149
Even if I have to kill him,

400
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:15,517
I would rather make it a duel.

401
00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:17,963
Do not think you have
seen through everything...

402
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:20,537
and understand what I have in mind.

403
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:24,885
You are the only person who is
still blinded by lies.

404
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,768
Fu Chou.

405
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,636
If I were you,

406
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,972
I would return to
Northern Realm at once...

407
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,118
and do nothing.

408
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:44,221
Otherwise...

409
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:50,570
you will realise soon enough...

410
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,874
just how foolish
your entire life has been.

411
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,233
Your Majesty.

412
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,681
Your Majesty, Prince Zhen Bei
 wishes to see you.

413
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,854
Greetings, Emperor of Western Qi...

414
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,576
and Prince Regent of Northern Realm.

415
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:13,523
Prince Zhen Bei ordered me
to send this message.

416
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,749
Five days from now, he will
hold a feast at Qingtian Chamber...

417
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,081
for Your Majesty and Prince Regent.

418
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:20,730
His Highness and Princess Rong Le
will attend that feast.

419
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,564
Understood.

420
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:24,892
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

421
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:26,927
Little Xun.

422
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,143
Yes.

423
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:30,342
See the Prince Regent off for me.

424
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:31,929
Yes.

425
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,111
Please.

426
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:50,965
This is where the Princess
grooms herself.

427
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:53,066
What are you doing in here?

428
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,664
Her Highness ran into a lot
of dangers, I am worried.

429
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,560
We are in the house
of Prince Zhen Bei,

430
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:01,838
do you really think someone
would try to hurt her?

431
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:05,081
Fine.

432
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:07,234
Both of you must be tired
from the long journey.

433
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:08,706
Get some rest.

434
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,416
You don't need to keep watch here.

435
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:13,057
But Your Highness,
you haven't taken the medicine yet.

436
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:14,899
I will prepare it for you at once.

437
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,057
You can take a nap if you are tired.

438
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,941
I will wake you up when
the medicine is ready.

439
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,538
Did anything happen
in the manor today?

440
00:31:07,686 --> 00:31:09,955
Your Highness, Miss Luo Yan is back.

441
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,275
-Very well, dismiss.
-Yes.

442
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,472
What did you promise me
back in the School of Wisdom?

443
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,720
You would never put yourself
at risk again.

444
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,596
You won't let me be worried again.

445
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:41,266
I know you are mad because
I hurt myself again.

446
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,531
I broke my promise for you.

447
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:45,676
I am sorry.

448
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:55,274
This happened all too sudden.

449
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,682
I want to resolve this properly.

450
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,581
But someone is trying to frame me.

451
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,747
This scandal is all
over the Imperial Court.

452
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:04,322
There is an outrage
from the officers.

453
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,436
Even the witnesses
are being killed off.

454
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:11,003
If you stand up for
me again this time,

455
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:13,103
people and the army will
lose their trust in you.

456
00:32:13,204 --> 00:32:16,072
So you forced me into
playing along with your plan?

457
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:17,805
You want me to watch...

458
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,847
as my blade pierced into you?

459
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:22,555
What do you think
that made me feel?

460
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,030
Wu You.

461
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:31,464
You believe in me, right?

462
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,130
" Bear with me "

463
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,062
No one will believe we had a
fallout unless I do that.

464
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:47,378
Wu You.

465
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,568
If you plan to invade the north,

466
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,991
you need to earn the trust
of the army.

467
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:54,248
Because of the lies about
the Silver-Hair Demon,

468
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,370
the soldiers are starting a mutiny.

469
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,484
This time, I cannot allow myself
to be the reason...

470
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:01,026
the soldiers are wavered.

471
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,440
You gave up on the
throne because of me.

472
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:11,561
Your mother was even...

473
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:19,592
What happened to my mother
was not your fault.

474
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,365
For the past few days,

475
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:23,066
I have been thinking.

476
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:25,122
I let my mother down.

477
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,664
But if I were given another chance,

478
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,341
my decision would still be the same.

479
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,581
I cannot abandon you for something...

480
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:37,284
that is yet to happen.

481
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,425
I was so anxious.

482
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,784
I want to launch an assault
to Zhongshan.

483
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:48,303
I want to avenge my parents by
defeating Fu Chou and Fu Yuan.

484
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:51,379
But I cannot sacrifice you...

485
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,199
and make you the expandable.

486
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,123
Man Yao.

487
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:59,922
I lost both of my parents.

488
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:04,123
I can't lose you too, understood?

489
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:13,579
You have my word.

490
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:15,444
I know my limits.

491
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:03,873
You are planning a
conspiracy in my nation.

492
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:05,853
You are even asking me
to join your cause.

493
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:09,305
What makes you think...

494
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,004
I would agree to work with you?

495
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:13,951
They are good friends of mine.

496
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,584
What you are asking of me...

497
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:18,869
is to make me...

498
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:22,611
a loathsome traitor.

499
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:28,816
Your so-called gratitude...

500
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,170
are just insignificant kindness.

501
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,419
It's nothing compared to...

502
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:39,289
your grand ambition and vision.

503
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,998
My ambition and vision?

504
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,695
My goal is not something
a nameless man like you would know.

505
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:50,618
Besides, the master you serve was
the princess of the previous lords.

506
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:54,072
Why should I have any trust in her?

507
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:02,641
Because of this.

508
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:11,173
This is the letter to offer
an alliance from my master.

509
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:14,017
With her status and power,

510
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:16,819
I am sure you are well aware of...

511
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,682
what this letter means.

512
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,455
As long as Your Highness...

513
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:35,045
is willing to help my master
achieve her goal,

514
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,571
I will aid you...

515
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,873
in getting rid of the obstruction
on your path to realise the ambition.

516
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:46,391
Half the land in south
will be yours as well.

517
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:49,096
When the time comes,

518
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,011
not only can you
expand your territory,

519
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:56,217
you can even seize the
throne for yourself.

520
00:36:56,897 --> 00:36:58,485
This is the perfect opportunity.

521
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,765
-This is an urgent matter!
-Please, Lady Zhao Yun.

522
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:18,256
I will inform His Highness right away.

523
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:20,174
Never mind,
I am going in there myself.

524
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:22,205
Your Highness,
Prince Zhen Bei is having guest.

525
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:23,713
This might not be convenient.

526
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,408
Not convenient?

527
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:29,115
Not convenient for him
or the guest he is having?

528
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:30,641
-But...
-Stand aside.

529
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:33,081
I must go in there.
I need to see...

530
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:35,831
what kind of guest he is having
in the middle of the night.

531
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:37,447
-Your Highness.
-Zhao Yun?

532
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:44,740
What happened?
What's the matter?

533
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,225
I just had a dream.

534
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:50,278
You were marrying another woman.

535
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:51,939
You don't love me any more.

536
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:53,906
It was just a dream.

537
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:56,123
I thought it was about
something serious.

538
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:57,436
It's all right now.

539
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,351
This is serious.

540
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,873
I came all the way from
Northern Realm to Chen alone.

541
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:05,825
I don't have a kin or friend.

542
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,645
You are all I have.

543
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,706
If you don't love me,

544
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:11,504
I will have nothing.

545
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:14,622
Qian Yi, be honest with me.

546
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:16,688
You never let me come into your study.

547
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:19,832
Is it because you are hiding
another woman in there?

548
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:23,662
So, you are here to see if
I am keeping a woman in here?

549
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:27,166
Since it worries you so much,

550
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:29,557
let me show you what's
actually inside.

551
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,322
Come on.

552
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:34,650
Take it slowly.

553
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,996
Greetings, Your Highness.

554
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,090
You really do have a guest.

555
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:55,552
Why? Do you really think
I would lie to you?

556
00:38:58,152 --> 00:38:59,631
Silly girl.

557
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,790
When did you learn to be jealous?

558
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:04,761
Well,

559
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:07,081
that does make me feel happy.

560
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,549
This means...

561
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,691
you care a lot more about me now.

562
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:14,893
I am going back to bed.

563
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:19,007
Keep an eye on her,
don't let her fall.

564
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:25,735
So this is why you are hesitating.

565
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:30,192
You are just the same
as Zongzheng Wu You.

566
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:32,858
Your love for a woman...

567
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,803
is holding you back.

568
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:38,530
This is the last warning.

569
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,834
Do not try to harm her.

570
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:44,450
I am not the same as
Wu You and his brother.

571
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,639
If someone hurts the woman I love,

572
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:49,798
I'll launch a full frontal assault...

573
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,936
and make him pay.

574
00:39:56,474 --> 00:39:57,808
Prince Zhen Bei,

575
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,951
you worry too much.

576
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:04,581
As for your letter,
I will be keeping it for now.

577
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:07,244
You will get my reply in three days.

578
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,215
Li Wu.

579
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,905
See our guest off.

580
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:13,609
-Please.
-I believe...

581
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,953
the decision you make...

582
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,123
will be wise and sound.

583
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:47,017
Luo Yan, you are here.

584
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:53,381
Your Highness.

585
00:40:53,723 --> 00:40:56,114
It's just the two of us here.
Formality is not needed.

586
00:40:57,337 --> 00:40:59,156
I heard about your return.

587
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:02,048
But I didn't expect you to be here.

588
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,230
Let's talk outside.

589
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,038
I am sure you overheard the
conversation I have with Lin Shen.

590
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:26,525
Yes, I heard it all.

591
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:29,579
There is a matter
that confused me.

592
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,285
You haven't made the decision,

593
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:34,270
but you accept their
letter for an alliance.

594
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:37,431
Your Highness, do you really
plan to join hands with them?

595
00:41:57,634 --> 00:41:59,520
If you haven't made up your mind,

596
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:01,640
allow me to speak my thought on this.

597
00:42:02,116 --> 00:42:03,581
Do not work with them.

598
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:05,664
They are trying to harm your friends.

599
00:42:05,883 --> 00:42:07,447
Especially Princess Rong Le,

600
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:10,172
she once saved you with her life.

601
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:12,779
Luo Yan,

602
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,544
did you spend too much
time travelling...

603
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:17,920
and forgot your goal?

604
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,627
I never forget my goal.

605
00:42:20,057 --> 00:42:23,965
When a civil war broke out in Chen,
war ravaged the land.

606
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:26,081
As a young man,
you rushed to battlefield...

607
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:27,976
and saved countless people.

608
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:32,347
Your Highness was like a saviour
to me, one with a grand ambition.

609
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,668
You once asked me...

610
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:36,996
if I have any wishes.

611
00:42:38,485 --> 00:42:40,531
I told you my parents died in war,

612
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:42,628
so I wish for war
to never happen again.

613
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:44,072
You said...

614
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:45,901
you have the same wish.
