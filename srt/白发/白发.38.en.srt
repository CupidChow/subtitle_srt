00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:32,831
Episode 38

3
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,020
A capable man never brags.

4
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,504
Agent Wu.

5
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,366
Do you think that you will be able...

6
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:45,045
to stop me just by yourself?

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,500
Do you think Zongzheng Wu You
will be able to escape...

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,021
and return to power?

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,517
We will have the try to find it out!

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,400
You scoundrel!

11
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,106
I was never a righteous man
to begin with.

12
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,126
Because of this Seal,

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,200
you placed yourself in danger.

14
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,371
What if I lost you for good back then?

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,480
All hope would be pointless to me.

16
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,480
Your father wanted me to
pass this seal to you.

17
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,510
This is a promise I made to him.

18
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,330
This is his trust and love for you
at the most crucial moment.

19
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,089
But sadly...

20
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,671
because of me,

21
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,866
you couldn't say goodbye
to Lady Yun...

22
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,311
or take her with you from
this place of sorrow.

23
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,320
As my parents watch from heaven,

24
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,833
they will not blame you.

25
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,840
They taught me this when I was little.

26
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,640
Earn the people's heart and
you will have the world.

27
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,907
A piece of jade is
not capable of such.

28
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:37,183
The people must comes first.

29
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,717
Even if I had rush
to my death with you...

30
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,299
and be loathed for generations,

31
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:43,007
I will be fine with that.

32
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,740
Because I know...

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,445
I may be dead,

34
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,319
but the nation has someone else
to protect it.

35
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,160
The nation will have
a benevolent ruler.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,600
I shall have no regret.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,204
-Are you all right?
-Miss Sun.

38
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,010
Let me take a look.

39
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:02,394
I am fine.

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,926
Who dressed this wound?

41
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,096
The wound is not even cleaned.

42
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,933
This can't be good.

43
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,305
It's okay.

44
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,747
I don't want to trouble you.

45
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,418
Miss Sun, this is Ke.

46
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,483
She is Xiao Sha's sister
and the Princess' friend.

47
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,093
We were able to escape...

48
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:27,549
all thanks to her help in
getting us out of there.

49
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,629
She is a great healer.

50
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,364
Let her tend to your wound.

51
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,494
Come on.

52
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Thank you, Miss Xiao.

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,430
Miss Sun.

54
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,113
You look tense.

55
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:44,994
My brother told me not to
trust stranger easily.

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,760
But I just couldn't remember that.

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,715
When you are truly hurt by someone,

58
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:53,836
you will remember that.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,840
I never thought the General
would be so cruel to you.

60
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,367
I always see him as a man
we can rely on.

61
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:05,868
But in the end,

62
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,961
even those around him have
to suffer his cruelty.

63
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,029
What he did to Princess Rong Le
is even more so.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,547
I am glad we escaped.

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,446
He can't hurt us anymore.

66
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,048
Miss Sun, who is going to pick on you?

67
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:28,974
Then he must be the bad guy.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,523
Don't be afraid.
I can use my poison.

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,227
I will make him laugh
and cry so hard...

70
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,423
so he can no longer hurt you.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Thank you for this.

72
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:40,839
You...

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,160
are the only person
we should never mess with.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,816
We don't want to end
up like Prince Chen.

75
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,741
Miss Sun.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,429
You haven't had any good rest
in a long time...

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,167
nor any decent meal.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,383
I am not hungry.
I am just sleepy.

79
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:00,848
There.

80
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,645
Ya Li, lie down and take a nap.

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,579
Zongzheng Wu You is
crossing the river.

82
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:26,977
Stop meddling with these men.

83
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:28,529
I will catch up to him.

84
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
Brother, are you all right?

85
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,690
Brother, we should just
take Fu Chou out...

86
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,297
and send him back to the palace
to avenge our father.

87
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Fu Chou won't be defeated so easily.

88
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,193
The reinforcement will be here soon.

89
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,480
Having a battle here will
only bring us more casualties.

90
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,202
We'll wait for another day.

91
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,216
Let's leave.

92
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,739
Does it hurt?

93
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,425
While you are with me,
I don't feel any pain.

94
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,729
Brother, if you are going
to make any intimate move,

95
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
try to keep it low.

96
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,495
You can't move around
with your injury.

97
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,361
Besides, we are on a raft.

98
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,334
You might fall into the water.

99
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:24,094
It's okay if you fall into the water.

100
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,840
It's quite scenic down there.

101
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,586
Why don't you scout ahead for us?

102
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:33,108
I would really love to learn
a thing or two from you.

103
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,720
But I can't swim.

104
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
Brother, you know me well.
I never learned to swim.

105
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,850
-Leng Yan.
-Yes.

106
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Teach Prince Chen how to swim.

107
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:44,837
Never mind, I can do it myself.

108
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Brother, this rocking raft
is making me nauseous.

109
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,067
Why don't we go to the
Princess' boat instead?

110
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:11,566
We can't bother them there.

111
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,920
You should just behave and stay here.

112
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Why?

113
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,640
There are so many people on this raft.

114
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,455
We have two rafts.

115
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,497
Why can't we share them equally?

116
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,125
Brother, maybe...

117
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,849
I can go to her raft and
switch my place with that man.

118
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,547
What do you mean 'that man'?
That is my brother.

119
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:35,085
Show some respect.

120
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,733
Ke, don't be rude to Prince Li.

121
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,560
Prince Li?

122
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
So he is Prince Li?

123
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,690
And you are Prince Chen?

124
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,399
Yes.

125
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,720
It sounds like pear and orange.

126
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,251
Did you two come from
the Fruit Kingdom?

127
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
You little...

128
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,115
Ke, look.
There is a fish.

129
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:07,200
Brother, let's go fishing.

130
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,428
<i>Zhao Yun.</i>

131
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:13,428
<i>I wonder if you are okay right now.</i>

132
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,942
What is it?

133
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,146
Is there something you miss?

134
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,200
We can no longer see the city
of Zhongshan from here.

135
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,475
The past is in the past.

136
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,562
Let us...

137
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
bid our past farewell.

138
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,463
Because of you,

139
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,317
I was brought to Zhongshan.

140
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,385
Because of you,

141
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:28,471
I fell in love with this city.

142
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,457
And because of you,

143
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,812
I am disgusted by this city.

144
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,120
I tried so many times
to escape from this place.

145
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,760
But I never got what I wanted.

146
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,037
Wu You.

147
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:48,365
Leaving this place with you...

148
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,022
is the most luxurious wish I ever had.

149
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,689
We will be happy, right?

150
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,712
We will.

151
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,233
Man Yao.

152
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,552
Let's have hope for the future.

153
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,842
Once we get back on our feet,

154
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,254
I'll earn the people's trust one day.

155
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,318
Not only will I fulfil the duty
my parents left to me,

156
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:28,148
I will realise the promise of
bringing peace to the land.

157
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,360
In the future,

158
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,240
whether we succeed or not,

159
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
I will be there with you.

160
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,280
Till death do we part.

161
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,620
In the future,

162
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:49,564
no matter how perilous it is,

163
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,000
I will be there for you.

164
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
To the very end.

165
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,400
<i>If Heaven has mercy for me,</i>

166
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,503
<i>let me live for another while.</i>

167
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,255
<i>Let me stay by his side.</i>

168
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,440
<i>I couldn't bear to leave him behind...</i>

169
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,335
<i>let him be alone.</i>

170
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,720
How is she right now?

171
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
Your Majesty.

172
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,948
Prince Li and the Princess
have escaped.

173
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,923
They have left Zhongshan safely.

174
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,320
It's been over a year.

175
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,932
Rong Le.

176
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,063
I hope Zongzheng Wu You...

177
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,891
can take you to safety.

178
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,490
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager
sent the medicine for you.

179
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,880
You let the loose end get away.

180
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,450
You let your only pawn escape.

181
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,360
We may have got our revenge,

182
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,604
but without that woman,

183
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,040
what do you have to go against
Zongzheng Wu You?

184
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,776
It's too early to tell
who the winner is.

185
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,687
Besides,

186
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,634
even if I lose,

187
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,047
you are going down with me.

188
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,960
You are right.

189
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,092
I should envy Agent Wu instead.

190
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
At least he followed the right master.

191
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,750
General Fu, news from the palace.

192
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
The Crown Prince lost his mind.

193
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,367
I think he is...

194
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,935
just pretending to be a mad man.

195
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,619
I am afraid it's for real this time.

196
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
This is interesting.

197
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,240
Father.

198
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,760
Father, the candies you
gave me are so sweet.

199
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,899
I didn't take much.

200
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:00,974
Father, look.

201
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,510
I eat one candy for every
paragraph I memorise.

202
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,145
Just one candy.

203
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,549
Can you stay here and keep me company?

204
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,962
I will to memorise all of these.

205
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:21,083
Please stay here for me.

206
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,407
Please.

207
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,937
Father, please stay here.

208
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,733
Father.

209
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:33,920
Are you mad at me?

210
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,120
Is Wu You memorising
the lines better than me?

211
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:38,957
I will keep trying.

212
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,600
I want more candies.

213
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,045
I want you to stay here.

214
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,047
First, the seasons.

215
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:55,049
Second, the land.

216
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,312
Third, the way.

217
00:21:57,861 --> 00:21:59,043
Fourth, is the...

218
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,351
It's the...

219
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
Father.

220
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,161
Father.

221
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,110
Please don't leave me.
I beg of you.

222
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,353
Father.

223
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,888
Father.

224
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,078
Don't go.

225
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,682
Father, don't leave me here.

226
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,179
Father, please stay with me.

227
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,760
Father!

228
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,338
Father!

229
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,304
Father!

230
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,963
Please, don't go!

231
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:40,897
Please, don't leave me behind!

232
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,326
Father! I can memorise all of these.

233
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,408
Father, you can't leave me here.

234
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,208
I can memorise all of it.

235
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:58,485
Father!

236
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,675
Father.

237
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,277
I remember the line.

238
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,691
I remember the line.

239
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,832
First, the way.

240
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,825
Second, the seasons.
Third, the land.

241
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,366
No.

242
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,223
You are not my father.

243
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,242
My father would never
come here to listen to me.

244
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:27,776
He lectures me for not
making friends with Wu You.

245
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,651
He said Wu You is better than me.

246
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,680
You are not my father.

247
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,411
Who are you?

248
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,167
Who are you?

249
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,010
Who am I?

250
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,781
Who am I?

251
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,354
What if I tell you...

252
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,465
I am your father's son too?

253
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,222
You are my father's son?

254
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,990
So...

255
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,170
So, do you have to memorise
all of these?

256
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,197
Can you even remember the lines?

257
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,806
I have to memorise the lines too.

258
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,675
I remember them like
the back of my hand.

259
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,641
But we are different.

260
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,755
Even if I remember the lines,

261
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,698
there won't be candies for me.

262
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,555
Why?

263
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,800
Father is not giving you candies?

264
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,326
Father never gives me candies.

265
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,038
Are your candies...

266
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,344
-delicious?
-Yes, they are!

267
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,629
Let me get some for you.

268
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,852
There, I am giving you
all of my candies.

269
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,248
But...

270
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,618
can you stay here and play with me?

271
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:11,696
They are having fun with Wu You.

272
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:14,010
No one wants to play with me.

273
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
I will give you my candies.

274
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,129
Will you play with me?

275
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
These candies are delicious.

276
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,030
Let go of me!

277
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:56,987
This is the Eastern Palace!
I am the Crown Prince's consort!

278
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,365
Where are you taking me?

279
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,921
I want to see the Crown Prince!

280
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,760
Who are you?

281
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,905
If you don't live here,

282
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,506
you can't just walk around so freely.

283
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,489
If you are one of us,

284
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,597
can you take me to the Crown Prince?

285
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,374
When I was walking around this palace,

286
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,460
perhaps you are still
in your mother's womb.

287
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,163
But your love with the Crown Prince
is indeed respectable.

288
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,823
I'll grant you the request.

289
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,389
You can see the Crown Prince
one last time.

290
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,200
You! How dare you be so insolent!

291
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,475
You should be prepared...

292
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,147
to save your own skin...

293
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,440
after the Crown Prince died.

294
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,051
He is in danger?

295
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,560
You mean he is in danger?

296
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,520
This one.

297
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,376
I lost again.

298
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,016
This is not fun.
I am done with it.

299
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,431
Your Highness!
Let go of me!

300
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:15,803
Your Highness!

301
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
-Your Highness!
-She is...

302
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,217
Your Highness, Fu Chou
is planning to harm you.

303
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,948
He was plotting to seize the throne.

304
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,520
He wants to hurt you,
the candies must have been poisoned!

305
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,360
All of these people
are trying to harm us.

306
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,917
They want to kill us!

307
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,080
-Run!
-You...

308
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
-We need to leave!
-You are the bad guy!

309
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,517
You are Lady Yun!

310
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,560
Go, I don't want to see you again!

311
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,547
-Let go of me. Father!
-Your Highness!

312
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:44,883
Father!

313
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,855
Father, she is Lady Yun!

314
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,690
Take her away, quick!

315
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:50,811
She is trying to take my candies!

316
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:52,175
Your Highness?

317
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,708
What happened to you?

318
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,431
I am your wife.

319
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:57,204
Don't you remember your wife?

320
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,209
Your Highness, we need to leave now!

321
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:02,851
Run, Your Highness!

322
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,391
Your Highness!

323
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,452
It must be you.

324
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,125
You turned His Highness into
this sorry state!

325
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,613
When you first sent Hen Xiang to us,

326
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,501
I should have known it was your plan.

327
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,946
But I never thought
you could be so vile.

328
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,696
In order to get the throne,

329
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,676
you turned the Crown Prince
into a mad man!

330
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:31,162
Guards, take her out of here.

331
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:34,929
Don't you dare touch me!

332
00:28:39,955 --> 00:28:41,165
As of now,

333
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:43,075
I have no more fear for you.

334
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,574
I must speak for His Highness.

335
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:48,523
I must bring justice to
the officers you oppress.

336
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:50,727
What if you get the throne?

337
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,381
None of the officers are loyal to you.

338
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:56,599
They only fear you.

339
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:58,815
You forced your own wife...

340
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:00,571
into a vicious being.

341
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:03,714
You poisoned the brother who is
a threat to you and turn him insane!

342
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,012
You are the one that
is truly vicious and insane!

343
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,920
Don't die on me.

344
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,442
Don't die.

345
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,560
You killed a person
without my permission!

346
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,897
Zongzheng Wu You took
the Imperial Seal from you.

347
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:39,316
Your coronation would be
as good as a sham.

348
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,384
If you let the Crown Prince live,

349
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,881
he might become a loose end
that brings trouble.

350
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,115
He has gone mad.

351
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,387
He is no longer a threat to me.

352
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:51,264
If you insist on killing him,

353
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,334
you will cause an uproar!

354
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:02,040
Turn around and look.

355
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,573
You are the only person here...

356
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:07,342
that is lost!

357
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,787
If I hadn't warned you,

358
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:47,272
this fool would have killed you.

359
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,123
Who...

360
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,570
is going avenge your mother?

361
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,574
Even if you kill Zongzheng Wu You,

362
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,368
my mother won't come back to life.

363
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:03,648
She is dead.

364
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,875
She is never coming back.

365
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,709
I wish the one burned to death...

366
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,000
was me.

367
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,723
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

368
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,711
<i>Our hearts are lifetime apart.</i>

369
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,400
<i>No one was here for us.</i>

370
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,138
I got my revenge.

371
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,065
It looks like I have everything.

372
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,882
But...

373
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,209
But this is pointless.

374
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:19,631
<i>We have thrown away the fate
that we got by chance.</i>

375
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,839
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

376
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:26,942
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

377
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,488
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

378
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:35,773
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

379
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,968
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

380
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:44,246
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

381
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,869
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

382
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,159
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

383
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,185
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

384
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,979
<i>Our fate is intertwined
and I can't let go.</i>

385
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,920
<i>I must preserve the memories
that are wonderful.</i>

386
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,063
I wonder...

387
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,520
how your life is right now.

388
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,037
<i>I made this mistake...</i>

389
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,666
<i>because I was too selfish.</i>

390
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,814
<i>I walk in a desert,
but my heart is being flooded.</i>

391
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,052
<i>My heart is beating senselessly.</i>

392
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,273
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

393
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,859
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

394
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,480
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

395
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,120
Don't take my son from me!
Let go, your mad woman!

396
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,667
-Have it over!
-Don't take Chou from me!

397
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,086
Let it go!

398
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,880
-Let it go!
-It's mine!

399
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Don't take my child from me!

400
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:03,604
Let go of it!

401
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,472
-Don't hurt him!
-You mad woman!

402
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:16,038
The rain is getting worse.
We need to go.

403
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,045
Let this woman die on her own.

404
00:34:18,205 --> 00:34:20,589
Your son is gone!
He is dead!

405
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,341
Chou!

406
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,532
Chou!

407
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,107
My son!

408
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
Chou!

409
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,335
Chou!

410
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,353
Don't hurt him!

411
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,581
Chou!

412
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,449
My son!

413
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,560
Don't take my son from me!

414
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:35,296
Don't kill him!

415
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,040
He is innocent!

416
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,090
He has nothing to do with this!

417
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Please, don't kill him!

418
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:42,944
Mother!

419
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:45,476
Mother!

420
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,202
I am Chou!

421
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,008
I am Chou!

422
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,891
Mother, I am Chou!

423
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:56,057
I am Chou!

424
00:35:56,274 --> 00:35:58,750
No! I don't know you!

425
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,883
I am Chou!

426
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,379
I am Fu Chou!

427
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
Who are you?

428
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,542
Mother!

429
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,505
Mother, you are still alive!

430
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,243
If I knew you were alive,

431
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,086
none of these would have happened!

432
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,371
None of these would have happened!

433
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,790
I wouldn't be made into the man I am!

434
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,426
No, I wouldn't.

435
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,720
It's all right.
You are back now.

436
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,720
Mother, don't worry.

437
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:40,027
I won't let anyone hurt you.

438
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,655
Don't be afraid.
Everything is all right.

439
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,323
Thanks God.

440
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,201
Thank you.

441
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,040
Mother.

442
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,095
Right now...

443
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,149
you are the only thing...

444
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,419
I have left.

445
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,809
Will you give me a hug?

446
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,160
All hail the Empress.

447
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:28,575
At ease.

448
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,627
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

449
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,880
Heed my decree, General of Defence.

450
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,692
Yes, I will.

451
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,352
As decreed by the Empress,

452
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,666
His Majesty passed away,

453
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,340
it's the loss of this nation.

454
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,277
However, the nation needs its ruler.

455
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:13,526
Fu Chou, the son of Empress Fu Yuan
is descendant of royal bloodline.

456
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:17,157
He spent years in exile
because of a vile setup.

457
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:20,428
Thanks to the Heaven's protection,
he has returned to the family...

458
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,062
and his bloodline.

459
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,746
He will regain his status
as the elder prince.

460
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:27,096
His name will now be
Zongzheng Wu Chou.

461
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:28,852
He will carry out the
duty of the Heaven...

462
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,017
-and succeed the throne...
-Hold on.

463
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,941
Your Majesty.

464
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,884
I think...

465
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,880
the return of General Fu
to the royal family...

466
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:43,029
is the matter of the royal family.

467
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:44,871
It is also the national affair.

468
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,556
Your Majesty has
the edict to appoint...

469
00:39:49,193 --> 00:39:50,800
General Fu as the Crown Prince.

470
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,825
I have no objection for that.

471
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:54,664
But succeeding the throne...

472
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,847
means he must apprise
the ancestors and the people.

473
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,738
General Fu has neither the
Imperial Seal nor the Emperor's will.

474
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,217
Naturally, this is against the rules.

475
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:06,022
The people will not be convinced.

476
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,118
Indeed.

477
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,070
Wu Chou.

478
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,588
What do you think?

479
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,725
Why do you suggest, Minister of Rites?

480
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,186
I know General Fu is a man
that sees the greater good.

481
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:34,988
You earned the respect of the people.

482
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,374
They will not bow down to
a throne taken by force.

483
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:40,568
If you are willing to be crowned
as the Prince Regent,

484
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,139
bring peace to the land
and help the people,

485
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,804
when the disorder are appeased,

486
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:48,248
the people will naturally
see you as the ruler.

487
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,417
Then, the Empress can apprise
the ancestors at the temple.

488
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,976
You will succeed the throne.

489
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:57,112
If you insist on ignoring the rites
to crown yourself...

490
00:40:57,326 --> 00:40:58,829
and do not heed our advice,

491
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:02,191
with the many other sons
His Majesty has,

492
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,070
I afraid the people might
choose to follow another ruler.

493
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,170
I appreciate your advice.

494
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,838
From now on,

495
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,297
I will not be the Crown Prince.

496
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,189
I will not take the throne.

497
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:30,368
I will rule the nation as
the Prince Regent.

498
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,061
Zongzheng Wu You has
betrayed his nation.

499
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:36,388
He retreated to the south
to muster his army.

500
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,630
I, Zongzheng Wu You,
hereby swear that...

501
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:41,817
I will eliminate the traitors.

502
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,819
When I succeed in reclaiming the land,

503
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,526
I can face my ancestors righteously...

504
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,599
and become the emperor
of Northern Realm.

505
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:53,423
A word given cannot be taken back.

506
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,223
I hope you remember
what you said just now.

507
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:58,798
Do not...

508
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,661
betray your promise.

509
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,648
If I go against my promise,

510
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,640
Heaven will take care of me.

511
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:10,887
I, Yang Wei,

512
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,435
is at your service, Prince Regent.

513
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:15,001
Long live the Prince!

514
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,263
Long live the Prince Regent!
