Episode 33

3
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,840
You are still going to
launch the mutiny?

4
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,679
What's done is done.

5
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,361
Yet, I am still asking
this foolish question.

6
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,485
How silly can I be?

7
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,151
I don't even know...

8
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,154
if your resolve is real...

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,960
or simply a lie.

10
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,845
Truth or lie,

11
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,156
you never cared.

12
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,490
All you will ever do
when you started suspect me...

13
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,531
is to tell Zongzheng Wu You
about everything.

14
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,799
Or you would risk your own life
and report to the main camp.

15
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,981
Do you really think...

16
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:53,039
everything I do is wrong?

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,194
Have you ever thought about...

18
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,972
why I made those decision?

19
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:01,526
I know it all.

20
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,015
You are the son of Empress Fu Yuan.

21
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,936
A man disguised as you and had
conversation with His majesty.

22
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:10,630
I know that too.

23
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,631
Did you hear that...

24
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,660
the so-called Emperor
that is my father...

25
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,827
never sees me as his son?

26
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,885
Whether you believe it or not,

27
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,862
his is still your father.

28
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,900
This is a fact that
can never be changed.

29
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,075
Fu Chou.

30
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:33,646
Stop your plan.

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,335
Do not let your hands be stained
with the blood of your kins.

32
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,779
Kins?

33
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,498
What about your brother Rong Qi?

34
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:46,781
Do you see him as your kin?

35
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,309
He used you...

36
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:51,632
and that brought you great pain.

37
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,137
The so-called Emperor
that is my father...

38
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,839
hunted me down
for five whole years.

39
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,408
The warmth of a family...

40
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,481
was turned into a cold blade
that slaughters.

41
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,400
You want me to stop?

42
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,317
Do you even know...

43
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,740
how desperate I was back then?

44
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,283
I simply feel like...

45
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
there is no need to
have the innocents killed.

46
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,066
You asked me if I see
my brother as a family.

47
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,715
Yes.

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,561
He used me for his bidding
and hurt the people I love.

49
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:31,344
But I cannot use others' lives
to have my revenge.

50
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:33,861
It will make me the same
villain as he is.

51
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,880
The soldiers should be the
nation's strongest defence.

52
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,084
But your revenge will
make the river flow with blood.

53
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,142
How can you be at peace with that?

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,112
And in the end,

55
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,720
you will be killing your
own father and brothers.

56
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,440
Even if you won,

57
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,263
what can you possibly get from that
empty and cold throne?

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,114
Whatever I get in the end...

59
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:58,874
is still better than having
nothing at all.

60
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,553
He is not my brother.

61
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,943
The Emperor is not my father!

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,253
I had nothing to begin with.

63
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,776
What could possibly be worse for me?

64
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,549
Your Majesty.

65
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,302
Wu You.

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,906
Wu You, come down here.
You can't be so rude.

67
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,720
-Mother.
-Wu You.

68
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,046
Come.

69
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,216
Look at yourself,
you are sweating so hard.

70
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,587
-Your Majesty.
-Father.

71
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,080
Wu You is such a nice kid.

72
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
Isn't that right?

73
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,193
Wu You, go on and
play with your mother.

74
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:49,572
Okay.

75
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,782
You should have some rest.

76
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,881
Who is it?

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,021
Xiao Sha?

78
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,640
Father!

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,200
Father!

80
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Father!

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,043
I have failed you!

82
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,066
I have failed you!
Father!

83
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,347
If I were at your side,

84
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:52,293
you wouldn't have been killed
by those scoundrels!

85
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,352
Father!

86
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,567
Crown Prince.

87
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,391
May you mourn in peace.

88
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Crown Prince, please mourn in peace.

89
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,950
Here.

90
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,920
His Majesty has passed away.

91
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,828
This is the loss of our nation.

92
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,660
But the campaign must
go on as planned.

93
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,914
Now, we must deal with traitors
and the enemies.

94
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,702
I suggest...

95
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,040
we leave the coffin at the side hall
and keep it a secret.

96
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,620
Relocate a few troops to create
a distraction at the border.

97
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,882
After the rebels are dealt with,

98
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
we will hold a state funeral
for His Majesty.

99
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,730
Sure.

100
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,268
We'll proceed with your plan.

101
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,631
Father!

102
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,024
Leng Yan, with our marching speed,

103
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,685
when will we arrive in Zhongshan?

104
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:07,168
Your Highness, there is
three days of journey ahead.

105
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,453
Take him down!

106
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,619
I was ordered by Princess Rong Le
to send this to Prince Li.

107
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,435
It seems like the whole Zhongshan
is now under Fu Chou's control.

108
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,411
Even the Royal Army
is doing his bidding.

109
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:12,808
With Fu Chou's mind,

110
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:16,185
he won't let someone else
take the command.

111
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,334
If my guess is right,

112
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,137
Fu Chou never followed
my father on the campaign.

113
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,162
He has been hiding in the capital...

114
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,073
to deploy his soldiers.

115
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:28,677
The campaign was led by His Majesty.

116
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,225
How did he pull this off?

117
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,365
When Zhao Yun was
attacked at the inn,

118
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,661
he ordered someone
to disguise as Man Yao.

119
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,344
He is using the same trick again.

120
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,688
He had an imposter
go on the march in his place.

121
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
His Majesty would never
expect Fu Chou...

122
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,832
to use such a lowly
and cunning mean.

123
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:51,542
Your Highness, if General Fu
is so treacherous,

124
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:54,007
and this man is his
personal bodyguard,

125
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,864
we cannot trust him even
with the Inked-Jade Fan.

126
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,720
-This might be his plan all along.
-You...

127
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
If you don't trust me,

128
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:05,759
give me back the tactical map.

129
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,519
Man Yao will give up her own life...

130
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,662
before this plan...

131
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,387
and the Inked-Jade Fan
are taken by someone else.

132
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,920
I believe in her.

133
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:23,681
So, I trust you.

134
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:30,732
Send out the order.

135
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,623
We will travel in day
and night to Zhongshan.

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,015
Leng Yan, you will lead
a troop of elites...

137
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,367
and go to our main force.
Make sure His Majesty is safe.

138
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,131
-Also...
-I understand.

139
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
Your Highness can count on me.

140
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,292
Can you still walk?

141
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,720
I am fine.

142
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,921
I hope all will go well
for Lady Rong Le.

143
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,040
<i>Man Yao.</i>

144
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,512
<i>Have you met with my father?</i>

145
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,564
<i>As of now,</i>

146
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,479
<i>are you safe?</i>

147
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,420
-Your Highness.
-At ease.

148
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
Thank you, Prince Li.

149
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,160
If Man Yao is willing
to give you the fan,

150
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,745
it means she places her trust in you.

151
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,275
Lady Rong Le saved my life.

152
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,865
My life...

153
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,018
is hers to command.

154
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,360
Fu Chou knows you betrayed him.

155
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,096
That's why he hunted you down.

156
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,429
He only knows I betrayed the Creed.

157
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,466
But he didn't know about
the letter I sent you.

158
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
The Creed is tracking Lady Rong Le.

159
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,953
It was an accident that they found me.

160
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
So, Fu Chou knew it all along...

161
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,189
that Man Yao found out
about his plan.

162
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,818
If Man Yao is still at the main camp,

163
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,961
and if she didn't get to
inform my father...

164
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:20,999
and was found by Fu Chou's men,

165
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,760
it will not...

166
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:27,281
Your Highness!

167
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,709
Your Highness!

168
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,788
Did something happen
at the main camp?

169
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:40,149
Your Highness.

170
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,073
I investigated and
ask around the camp.

171
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,875
His Majesty was assassinated
in the main camp.

172
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:48,970
His Majesty passed away.

173
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,513
My condolences, Your Highness.

174
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,589
Our condolences, Your Highness.

175
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,040
Who was the killer?

176
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
After Fu Chou transported the body
back to the capital,

177
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:16,029
he framed Your Highness
in front of the officers,

178
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,484
claiming that you are planning
to seize the throne,

179
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,772
which is why you went to the camp
and killed His Majesty.

180
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,156
Fu Chou.

181
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:26,840
The Imperial Court is
under his control.

182
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,294
The Crown Prince has ordered us
not to say a word about His Majesty.

183
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,427
Once you entered the city,
they have order to kill you on sight.

184
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,127
Prince Chen is under house arrest too.

185
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,809
Your Highness, you must turn
the tide at the capital.

186
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,211
Bring justice to the villains.

187
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,901
Bring justice to the villains!

188
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:53,839
Your Highness, I found this...

189
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:56,625
at the location where
the main camp was.

190
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,252
It looks like His Majesty's
handwriting.

191
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,462
<i>Yun, I am advancing with the army.</i>

192
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>I could feel the ambition
is beyond my reach.</i>

193
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:38,741
<i>I couldn't fall asleep.</i>

194
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:43,356
<i>Sometimes, I wish to
forget all of it and join you.</i>

195
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:46,814
<i>But Wu You is still young.</i>

196
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,230
<i>I wish to hold on for him
for a couple of years.</i>

197
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:51,303
<i>As you know,</i>

198
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,343
<i>once a man sits on the throne,</i>

199
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:56,674
<i>he will lose all that was
once dear to him.</i>

200
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:01,060
<i>When the time comes,
choice would be a luxury.</i>

201
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:04,835
<i>Yun.</i>

202
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,194
<i>While I was on the march
with the army,</i>

203
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,684
<i>I kept thinking about the time
when Wu You was a kid.</i>

204
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:14,066
<i>Back then, he wanted to
learn how to ride a horse.</i>

205
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,166
<i>But I was so afraid
he would fall from it.</i>

206
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:20,007
<i>So, I let him ride on my back.</i>

207
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,893
<i>Back in the days,
I let him ride on me.</i>

208
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,308
<i>But I am too old now.</i>

209
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,767
<i>I even have to pass the duty...</i>

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,356
<i>onto his shoulder.</i>

211
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,071
<i>Father.</i>

212
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:59,891
<i>You promised me you will
bring peace to the world for me.</i>

213
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,734
<i>Why are you leaving me behind?</i>

214
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:00,066
<i>Father.</i>

215
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,061
<i>Have you met my mother?</i>

216
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,167
<i>I know she never blamed you.</i>

217
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:08,383
<i>Honestly,</i>

218
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:10,795
<i>I understand how hard it was for you.</i>

219
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,493
<i>But I never get the chance
to tell you myself.</i>

220
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:23,279
Father.

221
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:28,086
I will shoulder the duty
for this nation in your place.

222
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,243
I won't let Fu Chou get away
with his treachery.

223
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,992
I will bring justice to you.

224
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,352
You shall not die in vain.

225
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:27,532
<i>Wu You.</i>

226
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:30,098
<i>Zhongshan will be in a mess soon.</i>

227
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,440
<i>In order to keep
the innocents safe,</i>

228
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,558
<i>you must return here at once.</i>

229
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,697
<i>But I fear for your return.</i>

230
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:39,490
<i>I don't want you to get hurt...</i>

231
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,569
<i>and I wish to keep you away
from the fightings.</i>

232
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,480
<i>What else can I do for you now?</i>

233
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,156
Princess Rong Le, Ke gave you
two advices before she left.

234
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:08,073
You must not catch a cold
or burden yourself with thoughts.

235
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:11,906
And now you are facing the breeze
and bothered by worries.

236
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,864
You are doing everything
that goes against her advices.

237
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,830
You just as disobedient as Ke
when she was younger.

238
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:21,954
You never talked much before.

239
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:24,373
When did you learn
to nag like Ling Yue?

240
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:29,007
Princess, the medicine is ready.
Have it while it's warm.

241
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,516
-You may go now.
-Yes.

242
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,130
I have some important tasks for you.

243
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,432
Yes, Princess.

244
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,706
After you leave to get
the medicine for me,

245
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:51,808
do not come back again.

246
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:55,561
Your Highness, I fear the General Fu
might try to harm you.

247
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:57,785
I should stay here and keep you safe.

248
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,993
The whole manor is being watched.

249
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:03,186
Even the Tranquil Garden
is being monitored.

250
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,520
Once Fu Chou makes a move,
you are no match for him.

251
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,462
You might even lose your life.

252
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,040
-But under no circumstances...
-This is important.

253
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,728
There is more pressing matter
than protecting me.

254
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,540
If Wu You received the news,

255
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,449
he would be on his way back.

256
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:20,618
As soon as he enters the city,

257
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,663
you must give him
this letter yourself.

258
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:25,875
Fear not, I will keep watch
at the city gate.

259
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,480
There is another task.

260
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,945
I want you to stay alive.

261
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:36,204
Look after Ling Yue for me.

262
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:38,427
For the rest of your life,

263
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,520
never leave her again.

264
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,670
Princess Rong Le.

265
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:46,307
Both Ling Yue and I will
follow you to our last breath.

266
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,477
While she is with me,

267
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,451
she is constantly in fear.

268
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,122
She never had any
easy time for herself.

269
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,760
She thought while she is here with me,
this would be her home.

270
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:05,708
But now,

271
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:08,255
this is nothing but a prison.

272
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:13,539
I am glad she escaped.

273
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,168
I hope she never set foot
into this house again.

274
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,702
Soon, I will die.

275
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,586
I might be dead at any moment.

276
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,752
It's my fault for not
finding His Majesty...

277
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,577
and get you the antidote.

278
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:33,100
But I believe in the
next three months,

279
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,829
Ke will find a cure for you.

280
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:39,104
I keep feeling dizzy recently.

281
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,379
I know the poison is invading my body.

282
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,587
As of now,

283
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:47,309
having three months
seems like a luxury.

284
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:52,754
Do not make it hard for Ke.

285
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:54,817
This is my destiny.

286
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,631
That was a lie.

287
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:11,581
You want to leave this place.

288
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,240
That's why you lied to me.

289
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:14,824
Isn't it?

290
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,120
-You should go.
-You can either tell me the truth...

291
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,730
or none of you will leave this house.

292
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:27,833
It's true.

293
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:30,352
I am poisoned.

294
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:32,266
I am dying.

295
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,305
You are in my house!
Who would dare to poison you?

296
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,343
If my guess is right,

297
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,758
the emperor you mentioned
was her brother.

298
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,652
Only he would dare
to hurt Rong Le.

299
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,365
You take the medicine
from him every month.

300
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,038
You must have the antidote.

301
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:56,582
Tell me, where is the antidote?

302
00:24:56,835 --> 00:24:58,155
Tell me!

303
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,165
Fu Chou, stop.

304
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,280
You can fool Rong Le, but not me.

305
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:15,659
You are the spy planted by
Emperor of Qi.

306
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,480
He won't let Rong Le die so easily.

307
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,366
He is in another land,
so you must have the antidote.

308
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:21,853
You can either hand it over...

309
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,946
or I will slice you into pieces!

310
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,880
Rong Le!

311
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:44,548
Don't kill him!

312
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,758
Princess.

313
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,491
Don't beg for him because of me.

314
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:54,759
Hand over the antidote
and I will spare your life.

315
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,862
I don't have it even if you kill me.

316
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,693
Xiao Sha was working for my brother
because he had no other choice.

317
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,040
He lost my brother's trust.
He doesn't have the antidote.

318
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,080
He wouldn't have fought back
unless you struck him first.

319
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,688
Please, let him go.

320
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:12,374
General Fu!

321
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:14,564
Seize this man!

322
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,240
Let him go.

323
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,879
Lay down the weapon.

324
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,384
Leave now.
I can take care of myself.

325
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,990
-But...
-Leave!

326
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,655
General, you are hurt.
The wound needs to be treated.

327
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:00,659
I am fine.

328
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:03,610
Dismiss.

329
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,096
General.

330
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,420
Yes.

331
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,070
Dismiss.

332
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:21,645
I assure you,

333
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,361
whatever reason your brother
has to poison you,

334
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,475
I will get to him and
get you the antidote.

335
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,336
If we had got it earlier,

336
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:32,780
there might still be hope.

337
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,133
-But it's too late now.
-I don't believe it.

338
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,061
If I can't get the cure
from the Emperor,

339
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,741
I will go to Prince Li.

340
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:46,406
I'll bring Ke back here
to brew a cure for you.

341
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,894
If that doesn't work either,

342
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:50,716
I will send out
all the soldiers I have...

343
00:27:50,908 --> 00:27:52,483
to search for a healer.

344
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:01,887
Ke only told the truth about
my condition to me alone.

345
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,579
The poison is invading my organs.

346
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,760
The best option I have...

347
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,316
is to extend my life
with other medicine.

348
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,866
Completely removing
the poison is impossible.

349
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:15,383
Finding a cure is pointless for me.

350
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,242
Which is why I didn't tell you.

351
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:21,579
I don't want you to waste time
on false hope.

352
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,063
I...

353
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:29,316
I will never let you die.

354
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,195
You told me...

355
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:35,138
you will never forgive me...

356
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,176
for using you and lying to you.

357
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,820
You hate me for
locking you up in here.

358
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,292
So live on.

359
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:44,397
Stay well and live this life.

360
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,740
You can have revenge on me.

361
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:50,511
I can spent my whole life for you.

362
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,142
The time I have left...

363
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,664
is getting shorting by the seconds.

364
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,756
I don't have time for grudge.

365
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:11,102
We became husband and wife.

366
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:13,738
Whether it was for a year
or just months,

367
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,344
our fate intertwined
in the past lifetime.

368
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:20,649
But ever since the incident
at Lake Qingliang,

369
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:23,696
all I have for you is hate.

370
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,200
But now that my life is running out,

371
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,680
I have one last advice for you.

372
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,854
-Will you...
-I will.

373
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,784
Whatever you ask of me today,

374
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,400
I will agree.

375
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:44,012
Do you mean it?

376
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:46,558
Will you give up on hate for me...

377
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
and put an end to your revenge?

378
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:50,682
Yes.

379
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,080
As long as you agree to my term,

380
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,280
I will give up all I have for you.

381
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,823
What is it?

382
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:03,532
Leave this place with me.

383
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:06,225
Let me have your love.

384
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,325
Let me take care of you
for the rest of your life.

385
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,470
I hope...

386
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:26,449
you will give me the answer
after you thought it through.

387
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,280
Days of summer,

388
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:57,657
nights of winter.

389
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,991
Years from now,
I will become a breeze...

390
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,471
and follow you to the next life.

391
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:04,212
Ash to ash.

392
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:06,278
Together,

393
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,656
we will leave this world.

394
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,087
Rong Le.

395
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:34,921
You agreed?

396
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,156
I can agree to anything.

397
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,008
I regret it.

398
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
I really do regret it.

399
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,711
If we can turn back time...

400
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:58,075
If we can turn back time,
when I first saw you,

401
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:01,798
I would have left all the grudges
behind and leave with you.

402
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,800
We can live in hiding.

403
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,959
Perhaps we can live in the woods.

404
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:10,404
We can be a normal couple.

405
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:14,296
A bridge over that little brook.

406
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,476
A land of serenity.

407
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,329
Every morning,

408
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:30,556
when I see the sunlight
shines on your face,

409
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,931
I couldn't bear to wake you up.

410
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:35,712
I would stare at you quietly.

411
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:38,808
And then, you woke up.

412
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:42,864
I don't have to do anything.

413
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,319
I will just watch you.

414
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
In a time of peace and
free from worries,

415
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,400
I am willing to spend
my life with you.

416
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,070
Perhaps...

417
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,641
we would be fighting over
trivial matters such as our meals.

418
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,130
Rong Le, will you believe me?

419
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,360
If I weren't a general,

420
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,789
I would be a great farmer.

421
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,520
If you weren't a princess,

422
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,879
aside from making dumplings,

423
00:33:19,113 --> 00:33:20,753
what other food can you make?

424
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:24,579
But speaking of which,

425
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:29,009
I love the dumplings you make.

426
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,990
At every sunset,

427
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,440
we would be holding hands.

428
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:40,127
Under the glow of starlight,
we have each other.

429
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,057
Time may pass,

430
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,497
but we never left each other.

431
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:47,312
Seasons after seasons,

432
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,677
years after years.

433
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,832
After all those years,

434
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,400
I will have a face full of wrinkles...

435
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,739
and you will have long Grey hair.

436
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,960
We will tell our tales
to the children.

437
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,336
Those little brats...

438
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,240
will think of our life as
something plain and boring.

439
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,678
But the simple life
and peace we have...

440
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,120
came with a great cost.

441
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,034
In my heart,

442
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,950
this life is more
precious than anything.

443
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,423
As my spent my youth,

444
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,059
we will grow old together.

445
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,830
When we become old,

446
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,963
I will no longer be able
to see your face...

447
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,801
and you can't listen to...

448
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,929
how I say 'I love you'.

449
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:45,470
But I think...

450
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,256
the best form of love...

451
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,789
is to be together till
the end of time.

452
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:10,975
Rong Le.

453
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:14,359
You have nothing to fear.

454
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,377
I can't be with you in this life.

455
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:21,443
But I have decided...

456
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,048
to accompany you to the afterlife.

457
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,307
Time is running out for both of us.

458
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,161
But I assure you,

459
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:31,629
in our next life,

460
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:33,925
I will find you.

461
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:39,090
By that time, you would have lost
all the memories of this lifetime.

462
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,304
The two of us...

463
00:35:41,424 --> 00:35:43,100
can start over again.

464
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,421
I will wait for you.

465
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,893
Even if you can't find me,

466
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,750
I'll be right there waiting for you.

467
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,911
<i>How to we keep living this life?</i>

468
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:02,218
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

469
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,280
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

470
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:11,870
<i>We have thrown away the fate
that we got by chance.</i>

471
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:15,045
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

472
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,448
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

473
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,856
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

474
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,104
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

475
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,383
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

476
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,446
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

477
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,935
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

478
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,484
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

479
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:50,606
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

480
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:56,072
<i>It never ends, love will fade.</i>

481
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:00,550
<i>The blossoms fall,
and I waited in silence.</i>

482
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:04,837
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

483
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,160
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

484
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,629
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

485
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,689
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

486
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:22,281
<i>We are not holding hands
but you are holding my heart.</i>

487
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:27,975
<i>Although this might not be forever,</i>

488
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,975
<i>I've locked you in my heart
and I've locked you in my dream.</i>

489
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:38,122
<i>It's my fault for falling in love...</i>

490
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:42,951
<i> with you.</i>

491
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:52,799
General Fu.

492
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:55,357
Speak.

493
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,070
-General, Lady Rong Le is...
-I know about Lady Rong Le.

494
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,330
There is no need for report.

495
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:01,655
-Very well, I shall let her...
-It's all right.

496
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,997
Dismiss.

497
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,700
Yes.

498
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:15,086
<i>Rong Le, will you really
leave with me?</i>

499
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:17,502
<i>I do hold a place...</i>

500
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,998
<i>in your heart.</i>

501
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:30,057
Chou.

502
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,440
What did you call me?

503
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:06,476
Please.

504
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,365
General.

505
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:12,743
I have made my decision.
I will...

506
00:39:31,374 --> 00:39:33,248
I am sorry for interrupting.

507
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:36,505
Rong Le!

508
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,626
Rong Le!

509
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,286
Rong Le!

510
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,857
-My answer is...
-I hope you can just hear me out.

511
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:55,660
What you saw in there
is not the truth.

512
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:58,282
I was drunk last night.
I thought she was you.

513
00:39:58,466 --> 00:39:59,755
No explanation needed.

514
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,120
You did nothing wrong.

515
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,825
It was me that failed as a wife.

516
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,346
-I really mistook her as you!
-I don't want to lie to you.

517
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:08,628
Which is why I am
telling you my decision.

518
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,049
I can surrender my life,

519
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:13,653
I can follow you to
anywhere you go.

520
00:40:14,794 --> 00:40:16,102
But my heart...

521
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:18,258
belongs to Wu You.

522
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,733
You are lying.

523
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,640
You misunderstood me because of this.

524
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,168
-That is why you turned me down.
-I didn't misunderstand you.

525
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:27,895
It was you that misunderstood.

526
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:31,101
My answer is the same all along.

527
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,421
I was such a fool.

528
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,013
I should have known.

529
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,360
You will never care about me.

530
00:40:57,147 --> 00:41:00,198
You never care about
what I do, unless...

531
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:04,552
my action will bring
Zongzheng Wu You harm.

532
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,420
You only agreed with me,

533
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,280
reconsider my offer...

534
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,536
and came to this yard...

535
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,109
all because of him!

536
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,571
I so naively thought...

537
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,525
everything you did...

538
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,019
was for me.

539
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,790
Do you even remember...

540
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:28,537
when was the only time
you addressed me...

541
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,427
as your husband?

542
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:34,296
That day, Zongzheng Wu You
took you by force.

543
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,045
To keep your illness
a secret from him,

544
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,409
you used me...

545
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,035
to turn him down.

546
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:42,763
You rushed in front of me.

547
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,220
With me as your husband,
you shielded me.

548
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:49,878
After all that you did,
I know well enough that...

549
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,639
your only motive is
to keep him from having...

550
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,920
the slightest pain in his heart.

551
00:41:57,276 --> 00:41:58,441
Tell me.

552
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,200
How could I not hate him?

553
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,999
If you must hate,

554
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,104
then hate this fate we have.

555
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,218
We can be husband and wife,

556
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:14,317
but we can never be lovers.

557
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,940
This is not about anyone.

558
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:18,770
Even without Wu You,

559
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,840
the outcome will still be the same.

560
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:23,854
Then I must fight for my fate!

561
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:27,605
The person who will be
with you to the end...

562
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:30,075
and die by your side...

563
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,200
is none other than me.

564
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,342
For this lifetime,

565
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,520
this is where my fate with you ends.
