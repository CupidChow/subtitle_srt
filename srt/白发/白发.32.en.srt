Episode 32

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,860
Who was it?

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,060
-Your Majesty?
-Summon the physician!

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,300
Yes, Prince Fan Yang.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,260
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,020
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,900
What is going on?
What happened?

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,940
Who was the assassin?

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,500
Imperial physician, please check on
His Majesty's condition.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,980
Roger that.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,620
Your Majesty.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,460
Your Majesty.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,060
Your Majesty.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,540
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,580
-What happened?
-Prince Fan Yang.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,060
His Majesty is already weak,

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,540
to begin with for he has
worked hard every year.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,740
It's not suitable for His Majesty
to go into war.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,340
We already have a harsh journey.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,660
His Majesty is plagued with
dizziness and stiffness.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,820
Moreover, His Majesty
was assassinated...

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,340
and His Majesty lost too much blood.
That's why...

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,220
You are really an useless physician.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,100
-You...
-Guards. Off with his head.

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,340
-Yes, General.
-Spare my life, General.

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,140
Spare my life, General!

28
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,100
-Spare my life, General!
-Your Majesty.

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,780
Who holds such boldness in him?

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,020
How dare he barged into the
army base to assassinate the emperor.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,060
Are all the soldiers outside useless?

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,340
Tell me, who's the perpetrator?

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,140
-His Majesty addressed him as Wu You.
-Nonsense!

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,540
Impossible that Prince Li will
come here to assassinate the emperor.

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,580
Where is the assassin?

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,980
General Fu,

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
that assassin is too strong.

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,980
I'm not his opponent at all.

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,940
But when I was fighting with him,

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,540
I accidentally took off
his black mask...

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,300
and saw his real face.

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,300
Who is the assassin?

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,860
Prince Li, Zongzheng Wu You.

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,140
-Prince Li. How is that possible?
-That's right. It's impossible.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,060
-That's right.
-Impossible.

46
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,140
I can't believe it.

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,820
I think it's because
at the court last time,

48
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,140
His Majesty had sent him
back to southern fringe.

49
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,500
He has no hope for the throne.

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,940
So, he killed His Majesty
in a fit of rage.

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,980
Maybe he's already
bringing in troops...

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,420
from southern region
to seize the throne now.

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,860
General Fu. We need to go back
to the city immediately to stop him.

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,300
Such nonsense!

55
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,300
His Majesty doted on Prince Li
and trusted him.

56
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,620
And Prince Li values
filial piety and righteousness.

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,060
He won't commit patricide
to seize the throne.

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,220
Just now, you said that you are
not the assassin's opponent...

59
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,340
and yet you are able
to take off his mask.

60
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,220
All of the soldiers you
brought along were dead.

61
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,220
But you don't even have
any major wounds.

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,500
You contradict with yourself
and it's not convincing at all.

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,340
Tell me. Who are you working for?

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,220
How dare you accuse Prince Li.

65
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,020
I know that Prince Fan Yang
thinks highly of Prince Li.

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,220
But I never thought that...

67
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,980
you will be so bold...

68
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,140
to gang up with Prince Li...

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,980
to assassinate His Majesty.

70
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,300
Stop spitting lies, General Fu.

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,020
How dare you accuse me?

72
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,940
This army base has tight security.

73
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,700
Before this, nothing
has ever gone wrong.

74
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,220
But as soon as you reach
the army base,

75
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,340
an assassin came in to
assassinate His Majesty. Why?

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,620
Is it...

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,780
a coincidence?

78
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,980
You ganged up with Western Qi
and wanted to turn against us.

79
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,180
His Majesty brings you along
to give you a chance.

80
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,020
But not only you
don't repent your sins,

81
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,140
you arranged for this assassination
and blamed it on Prince Li.

82
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,180
You've lost your mind.

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,020
Guards, arrest Fu Chou!

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Fu Chou, are you really
going to revolt?

85
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,180
I have the Tiger Emblem.
I want to see who's the one...

86
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,380
trying to revolt today.

87
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,860
This is His Majesty's Tiger Emblem.
Why do you have it?

88
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,260
That's right. General Li and I had
a meeting with His Majesty today.

89
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,660
His Majesty has purposely
sent you away.

90
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
His Majesty has lost his trust
in you completely.

91
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,380
Why would His Majesty give the
Tiger Emblem to you?

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,140
Before departing for this war,
His Majesty has felt that...

93
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,460
somebody will take
this chance to rebel.

94
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,780
So, His Majesty had entrusted me
with this Tiger Emblem.

95
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,220
I never thought that...

96
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,260
General Wei and General Li...

97
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,340
are the same as Prince Fan Yang.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,540
All of you are working
with Zongzheng Wu You.

99
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,940
His Majesty has given his order.
If there's any accident,

100
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,660
those who rebelled...

101
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,260
-will be punished to death.
-You!

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,860
This is the law of the nation.

103
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,780
A general follows his emperor.

104
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,300
The Tiger Emblem commands the army.

105
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,020
Those who disobey...

106
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,700
will be treated as traitors...

107
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,220
against the nation.

108
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,820
We will obey you, General!

109
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,260
You...

110
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,580
Everybody knows that Zongzheng Wu You
has assassinated His Majesty.

111
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,700
General Wei, General Li
and Prince Fan Yang.

112
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,060
The three of you have ganged up
with Zongzheng Wu You in secret.

113
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,300
I think I should...

114
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,420
chop off your heads
as warning for others...

115
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,580
to set the law straight.

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,340
Wait! Don't believe the nonsense
uttered by this fake gentleman.

117
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,860
He is the real traitor here.

118
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,220
Such a foul man you are.
How dare you accuse me!

119
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,740
I'll fight you to death.

120
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,940
Arrest them.

121
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,540
Kill them!

122
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,900
You are not Fu Chou.

123
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,820
Fu Chou has braved the battlefield
with his soldiers for so long.

124
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,380
Even if he's no longer loyal,

125
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,780
he won't sacrifice
his soldiers like this.

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,660
Who are you?

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,980
Look at you.

128
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,660
You still wanted to make an excuse
even though you are going die soon.

129
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,300
How about this?

130
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,940
Three of them ganged up
with a traitor...

131
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,300
to assassinate His Majesty.
That is unforgivable.

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,180
You'll be rewarded with
200 tael for one head,

133
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,340
three-rank increase for two heads...

134
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,100
and for three heads,

135
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,060
you'll have an audience
with Crown Prince...

136
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,940
to be given the title
as first-rank general.

137
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,980
-Looks like we will die here today.
-We'll fight to our last breath then.

138
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,900
Bring him back to me.

139
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,420
-Yes, General! Come with me!
-Yes, Sir!

140
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,420
Listen to my command.

141
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,940
Prepare the troops to send
His Majesty back to the capital...

142
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,220
and to stop Zongzheng Wu You...

143
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,180
from seizing the throne.

144
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,020
Roger that!

145
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
" General's Manor "

146
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,780
General, we have a letter
from the army base.

147
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,500
The mutiny is successful.

148
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,060
What about the casualties?

149
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,180
It wasn't mentioned in the letter
but the letter did say that...

150
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,820
His Majesty is gone.

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,780
What did you say?

152
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,020
-He is dead?
-Please stay calm.

153
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,180
Master said that it's
because Lady Rong Le...

154
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,860
barged into the army base suddenly...

155
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,700
and exposed the truth in public that
you are still in the General's Manor.

156
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,420
So, he has to act ahead of time.

157
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,300
That's why we are left
with this result.

158
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,340
Where is Rong Le now?

159
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,620
We can't locate her after
she left the army base.

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,620
Send someone to look for her now.

161
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,140
Search every crook and cranny
from the army base to southern fringe.

162
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,900
Find Zongzheng Wu You and Rong Le.
Don't let them meet.

163
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,140
Inform me once you have the news.

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,060
Pass on my order.
Ask them to start now.

165
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,140
-Yes, General.
-Wait.

166
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,100
Don't let Rong Le get hurt.

167
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,020
I understand. Don't worry.

168
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,620
Captain Xiang.

169
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,780
Did you realise that the Crown Prince
is acting really weird recently?

170
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,940
When father was still in the palace,

171
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,460
at least he reined himself in.

172
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,620
Now that father has gone to war,
he's acting like an unbridled horse.

173
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,500
Isn't him afraid that father will
punish him when he comes back?

174
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,780
It is indeed strange.

175
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,940
But now, Crown Prince is not the
only one who is acting strange.

176
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,220
Someone is being restless among
the royal guards as well,

177
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,940
trying to stir up troubles.

178
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,180
Who is so bold to provoke you,
Captain Xiang?

179
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,220
The vice-captain of the royal guard,

180
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,540
Zhao Yi Sheng.

181
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,180
Zhao Yi Sheng? What does he want?

182
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,620
I think he is the vice-captain
for too long.

183
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,900
He wants to exchange
his position with me.

184
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,300
To try something new.

185
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,260
Impossible. My father trusts only you.

186
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,220
As long as my father is here,
nobody can take your place....

187
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,780
as the captain.

188
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,220
Alright. I'll go back first.

189
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,220
Keep a close eye on the Crown Prince.

190
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,380
Don't worry, Prince Chen.

191
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,300
Who dares block my way?

192
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,380
Who are you?

193
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,940
Why did you tie me up?

194
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,180
Do you know who am I?

195
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
The captain of the Royal Guard,
Xiang Cheng.

196
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,620
Of course I know who you are.

197
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,100
But you might not know who I am.

198
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,740
Fu Chou?

199
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,300
When did you come back to the city?

200
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,060
Maybe you should ask me,

201
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,780
why...

202
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,100
am I still here in the city.

203
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,380
I saw with you with my own eyes.

204
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,500
Is that a fake Fu Chou?

205
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,820
-Then His Majesty...
-His Majesty is not here anymore.

206
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,980
How dare you murder the emperor!

207
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,180
Fu Chou, how daring you are.

208
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm going to kill you for His Majesty.

209
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
You've killed me once for him already.

210
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,940
What do you mean?

211
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,460
Sixteen years ago,
when I'm still a child,

212
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,060
you had chased after my life
with your men for five years.

213
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,140
From the city to the suburb...

214
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,140
and from the mountains to the rivers.

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,060
In those five years,

216
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,540
I had never once had a
full stomach or a good sleep.

217
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,100
Do you still remember...

218
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,780
about it?

219
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,380
I killed you...

220
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,540
and you fell into the river.

221
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,380
I had played hide-and-seek with you
for five years. I know you very well.

222
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,700
If you know that I'm still alive,

223
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,220
you won't stop from hunting me down.

224
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,660
I was tricked by you.

225
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,660
Xiang Cheng.

226
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,820
Don't you think you should be...

227
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,460
thankful to me?

228
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,780
Because everybody thought that
I was dead. That's why,

229
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,300
you are able to sit in this position
as captain of Royal Guards today.

230
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,420
Hunting down a kid...

231
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
is the most disgraceful thing...

232
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,460
that I had ever done in my life.

233
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,220
But His Majesty has his own reasoning.

234
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,260
As his servants, I have no rights
to question his decision.

235
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,780
I can only follow his order.

236
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,420
I can't disobey him.

237
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,660
Your loyalty...

238
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,460
is so touching.

239
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,980
It's my mistake...

240
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,580
for not completing my mission...

241
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,580
back then.

242
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,020
Now that I'm in your hands,

243
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,140
I have no one to blame but myself.

244
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,060
Just do whatever...

245
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,780
you want with me.

246
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,860
You are a real man.

247
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,020
-Guards.
-Yes, Young Master.

248
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,020
Give him...

249
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,660
-a fast ending.
-Yes, Young Master.

250
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,740
I heard that after His Majesty left,
Crown Prince...

251
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,980
is having fun every night...

252
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,060
and he treated the
national affairs casually.

253
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,660
He doesn't have the poise
of a Crown Prince.

254
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,260
As his wife, you should advise him.

255
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,060
Ask him to rein himself in.

256
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,860
Looks like...

257
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,180
you are very disappointed in me.

258
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,340
Greetings, Mother.

259
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,420
It's already bad enough that you
act so wildly in your own palace.

260
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,060
How can you be so rude to your mother?

261
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,580
Your mother is lecturing you
for your own good.

262
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,100
Shut up!

263
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,700
You slapped your consort
without any reasons.

264
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,140
Are you doing it as a show for me?

265
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,180
You are just a Crown Prince
right now...

266
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,980
and you've already treated me
with such disrespect.

267
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,620
If you become...

268
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,340
the emperor in the future,

269
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,340
are you going to kick me out
from the palace?

270
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,420
You've exaggerated.

271
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,820
I've always been filial to you.

272
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,500
I've respected you.

273
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,180
But all these years,

274
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,380
because father dotes on Wu You,

275
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,700
everything Wu You did was correct...

276
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,300
and everything I did...

277
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,340
was just nuisance to you.

278
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,140
Do you think that Wu You will
be the successor to the throne?

279
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,220
That's too unfortunate.

280
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,740
The one who's sitting on the
Crown Prince's position now...

281
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,340
is me.

282
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,460
And I'll be the successor
for the throne.

283
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Mother.

284
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,100
Looks like...

285
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,500
I'll have to disappoint you.

286
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,100
You...

287
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,260
I still have work to do.

288
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,700
Farewell.

289
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,900
The Creed of Vengeance
is very capable, right?

290
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,540
What time is it now?

291
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,660
Why do you have no news
about Fu Chou yet?

292
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,100
Do not be anxious.

293
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,980
No news means that
the time is not right yet.

294
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,540
The time is not right.

295
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,100
The time is not right.

296
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,940
When will the time be right?

297
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,820
This Fu Chou.

298
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,620
Why isn't he taking any actions?

299
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,620
What is his plan?
Why didn't he tell me anything?

300
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,460
He's the same as the rest of them.

301
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,580
They never take me seriously.

302
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,420
When I sit on the throne,

303
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,020
I'll make him...

304
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,660
Fu...

305
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,540
General Fu.

306
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,420
Why are you here?

307
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,660
I thought that you had departed
together with my father.

308
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,660
Of course I have my
own reason to be here.

309
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,780
Just now, what did you say
about making me pay...

310
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,500
after you sit on the throne?

311
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,780
I'm talking about those...

312
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,060
who had never taken me seriously.

313
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,900
Of course I'll punish
them accordingly.

314
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
General Fu.

315
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,180
You are different.

316
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,540
You are my most trusted man.

317
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,620
If you can tell me about your plan,

318
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,300
when I become the emperor,

319
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,580
I'll be thankful for your help.

320
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,860
I didn't tell you about the plan...

321
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,860
because the time is not right.

322
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,340
General Fu.

323
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,980
General Fu.

324
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,260
Is it the right time now?

325
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,180
Today,

326
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,380
I'm here to tell you something.

327
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Zongzheng Wu You...

328
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,820
bears grudge from being
banished away from the capital.

329
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,820
He infiltrated the army base
to assassinate His Majesty.

330
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,020
What?

331
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,820
His Majesty is too heavily wounded.

332
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,620
So, he's now on his way
back to the capital.

333
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,180
You said that Zongzheng Wu You
assassinated His Majesty?

334
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,780
Impossible.

335
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,540
General Fu.

336
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,340
General Fu.

337
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,580
This is your plan, right?

338
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,380
Is my father...

339
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,700
really dead?

340
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,300
You didn't tell me that
you'll kill my father.

341
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,300
I think you know better
than anyone that...

342
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,060
there can only be one leader.

343
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,540
From the day you've decided to revolt,

344
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,740
this is what you should have expected.

345
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,660
Your Highness, are you
so naive to think that...

346
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,900
you'll have a chance to take the
throne if His Majesty is still alive?

347
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,220
I think the army...

348
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,180
will send this news
to the court very soon.

349
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,660
Suppress this news.
Don't let our enemies know about it.

350
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,900
Alright.

351
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,380
As for the captain of Royal Guards,
Xiang Cheng,

352
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,380
I've already taken care
of him for you.

353
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,060
What?

354
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,180
You can appoint vice-captain,
Zhao Yi Sheng as new captain.

355
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,100
When that time comes,
the Royal Guards will be ours.

356
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,260
As for Prince Chen,
no need to worry about him.

357
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,620
The court will run itself.

358
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
No.

359
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,980
There are more suitable candidates
for this position as captain.

360
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,620
-I want Zhao Yi Sheng. Your Highness.
-You!

361
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,740
-Just do as I say.
-You!

362
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,580
Stop right there!

363
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Fu Chou.

364
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,260
Have you forgotten about
who's your master?

365
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,580
I am your master.

366
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,300
This is the Eastern Palace.

367
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,940
You come and go as you please.

368
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
You didn't tell me your plan.

369
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,380
And now, you even order me around?

370
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,540
Guards! Arrest this man!

371
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,620
Greetings, Young Master.

372
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,300
What?

373
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,780
You are the young master
of the Creed of Vengeance?

374
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,060
I see.

375
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,460
So, you've been lying
to me all along.

376
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,420
I'll kill you.

377
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,860
Fu Chou.

378
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,540
You've planned all of these
since the beginning, right?

379
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,340
You tricked me to gain my trust.

380
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,260
You asked others to instigate me
so that I'll fall into your trap...

381
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,300
so that you can use me, right?

382
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,700
If you have no intention to fight
Wu You, you won't fall into my trap.

383
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,380
If you have no intention to rebel,

384
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,180
you won't be like this today.

385
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,460
You made your own choice.

386
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,300
Nobody forces you to do it.

387
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,500
You want to kill me because
you know that His Majesty is dead.

388
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,740
Now, you can control the Royal Guards.

389
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,700
And it's perfectly justifiable
for you to take the throne.

390
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,900
You have troops that can help you
to fight off Wu You now.

391
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,420
You don't need me anymore.

392
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,140
But I want to make things
clear to you.

393
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,500
Royal Guards without Xiang Cheng...

394
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,340
is like a headless chicken.

395
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,540
They won't be able to win against
the army of southern fringe.

396
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,660
They can't even win against
The Hidden Ones.

397
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,180
So, Your Highness,

398
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,580
you are still far away from success.

399
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,140
If you want to get rid of me
as soon as I'm out of use,

400
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,340
I think it's still too early for that.

401
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,060
Without me,

402
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,060
death will be upon you.

403
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,980
Think carefully.

404
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,860
Let go of him.

405
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,380
Will he kill me?

406
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,380
Xiang, will he kill me?

407
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,540
I don't know if he'll kill you or not.

408
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,500
But I know that...

409
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,860
if you think about killing him again,

410
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,860
I'll kill you first.

411
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,020
You...

412
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,420
You are...

413
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,020
That's right.

414
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,820
I am a part of Creed of Vengeance too.

415
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,260
I came here to help you under
the young master's order.

416
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,940
As long as you are obedient,

417
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,860
that almighty title
will still be yours.

418
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,500
But if you don't,

419
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,780
I'm afraid that I'll have to think
of a way to make you listen.

420
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,180
You are a smart person.

421
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,980
You won't make things
hard for yourself, right?

422
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,860
Xiang.

423
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,780
We are husband and wife, right?
There is love between us.

424
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,900
The Creed of Vengeance
has a kind of medicine...

425
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,620
called Love Potion.

426
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,380
Those who took it will dream
about romantic scene.

427
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,220
So, the love that you mean...

428
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,980
is just your imagination.

429
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,580
Although I'm an assassin,

430
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,620
I won't give myself to others easily.

431
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,300
Do you know that...

432
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,940
every time you touch me,

433
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,020
I have the urge to chop off each
and every one of your fingers.

434
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,500
You are a perverted,
useless and immoral man.

435
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,020
If it wasn't because of our
young master, do you think...

436
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,740
you have the rights to fight
Zongzheng Wu You for the title?

437
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,660
Not only you are ungrateful,
you thought about eliminating him.

438
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,180
You have overreached yourself.

439
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,980
You should be thankful that...

440
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,500
we have the same goal now.

441
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,940
Rather than being arrested by Wu You
and punished for treason,

442
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,580
how about you cooperate
with us nicely?

443
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,820
Let's defeat
Zongzheng Wu You together.

444
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,340
That's the only way for you
to sit on the throne without worries.

445
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,780
Only then can you stand at the top
to order others around.

446
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,260
Don't think about leaving
this place to get help.

447
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,340
-No.
-This palace...

448
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,340
is occupied by many of our men
from the Creed of Vengeance.

449
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,820
Take care.

450
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,220
General!

451
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,660
We have news about Lady Rong Le.
She's at Qingtong's frontier pass.

452
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,580
-Ready my horse for me.
-Yes, General.

453
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,220
Why did you hunt me down?

454
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't come near me.

455
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,580
You are not Fu Chou.

456
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,420
Fu Chou is not as cynical as you are.

457
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,900
Who are you?

458
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,460
Why did you dress up as Fu Chou
to harm His Majesty?

459
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,340
Looks like you understand him
quite well.

460
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,820
Unfortunately,

461
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,500
he's not here.

462
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,860
He can't hear what you said.

463
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,980
Since you know that I've harmed
His Majesty, it means that...

464
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,180
you were in the tent back then.

465
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,100
If that's the case,

466
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,700
I won't let you escape.

467
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,940
I've told you many times.

468
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,860
Don't hurt her.

469
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,780
She already knows about our secret.

470
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,380
That is my business.

471
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,220
Not yours.

472
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,460
Don't forget about your promise
and your mission.

473
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,860
You are getting more
and more controlling.

474
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,220
And you are getting
more and more reckless.

475
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,820
I asked you to keep the troops
under your thumb.

476
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,580
But you've cause a massive killing.
I haven't even...

477
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,740
punished you for that.

478
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,380
So, the reason you are angry...

479
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,220
is because Zongzheng Yun He is dead.

480
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,020
Don't tell me that you still
treat him as your father.

481
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,540
But even until the moment he dies,

482
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,900
he never admits that you are his son.

483
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,420
He thinks that...

484
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,500
he has to kill you for the benefit of
the country. He doesn't regret it.

485
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,060
Let me repeat myself again.
I've already told you...

486
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,940
to spare his life.
I still have use for him.

487
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,740
But you disobeyed my orders.

488
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,780
At first, I don't plan
to kill him so early.

489
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,740
But because you didn't keep
Rong Le in line,

490
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,460
she had ruined my plan.

491
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,540
I don't have a choice.

492
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,660
But this is good too.

493
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,420
Now, he can ask for your mother's...

494
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,020
-forgiveness in the underworld.
-Don't use Rong Le as excuse.

495
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,340
Don't think that I'm blind.

496
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,900
You've always wanted to kill him.

497
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,380
That's why you've forgotten that I'm
the one to decide if he lives or die.

498
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,700
Even if I want to kill him,

499
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,420
I should have been the one to do it.

500
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,980
As for when is he going to ask
forgiveness from my mother,

501
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,140
it'll be entirely up to me.

502
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,620
Although you've established
the Creed of Vengeance,

503
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,780
all the troops in this country
are under my control.

504
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,220
Let me warn you.

505
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,300
If you go head to head
against me again,

506
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,220
I'll have to take you out.

507
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,860
Your Highness,

508
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,540
about the food issue
after they've gone into war,

509
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,980
after days of discussing between
Ministry of Revenue and Prince Chen,

510
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,660
they have attached a proposal
together with the report.

511
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,740
Have you read about it?

512
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,860
Your Highness.

513
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,460
Your Highness.

514
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,060
The Minister of Revenue is asking you
about the report on the food issue.

515
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,380
Report.

516
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,820
What report?

517
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,380
Did the Crown Prince
drink too much again?

518
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,260
You didn't even remember
the latest report from yesterday.

519
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,820
I'm very busy lately.

520
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,700
I didn't get to read it in time.

521
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,140
We'll discuss about it again
after I've read it.

522
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,940
Dismiss.

523
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,940
I don't feel well today.

524
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,020
Report to me again tomorrow
if there's anything.

525
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,300
Dismiss.

526
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,700
Emergency report!

527
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,740
Crown Prince, emergency report
from the army base.

528
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,060
Make it quick.

529
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,260
Crown Prince, what happened?

530
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,100
Prince Li ganged up with the generals
in army base to assassinate father.

531
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,700
Father is gone.

532
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,540
-What?
-What nonsense is that?

533
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,500
This...

534
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,180
Who had faked this report
from the army base?

535
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,980
-It's such a nonsense.
-Whether it's fake or not,

536
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,100
Sir Yang will be able to tell it.

537
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,340
Sir Yang, take a look.

538
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,820
Your Highness, this is the real seal.

539
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,420
But there might be a
misunderstanding about...

540
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,500
Prince Li assassinating His Majesty.

541
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,820
Prince Li has always been
a person like that.

542
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,780
All these years, he had always
set himself against father.

543
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,500
He never listened to father...

544
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,580
and he disobeyed him
every chance he had.

545
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,700
This time, he even disobeyed
his decree in the court.

546
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,460
He was banished to southern fringe.

547
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,380
He is dissatisfied with it.

548
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,940
That's why he sent someone
to assassinate father!

549
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,220
Such an abominable man!

550
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,060
Wu You is not a person like that.

551
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,620
It must be you.

552
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,060
You've ganged up with
Fu Chou in secret.

553
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,740
You take advantage when father
is not here to fake evidence...

554
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,940
in order to frame Wu You
and get rid of your competitor.

555
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,540
What are you doing?

556
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,740
There are more than one who saw
Prince Li assassinating father.

557
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,500
You want to destroy
the evidence, right?

558
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,420
Go ahead, tear it!

559
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,340
I don't believe it.

560
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,140
Father is so brilliant. How could
he fall under Fu Chou's trap?

561
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,540
Father must be well and alive still.

562
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,660
When he comes back to the capital,

563
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,580
I want to see how are you going...

564
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,260
-to keep your status as Crown Prince.
-What did you say?

565
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,780
-Say it again!
-So what if I say it again?

566
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,300
Calm down.

567
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,460
Calm down, Crown Prince.

568
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,940
This news about His Majesty's death
is too sudden for Prince Chen.

569
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,300
He is too upset.

570
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,860
That's why he has uttered those words.

571
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,980
Your Highness. We are desolate,

572
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,700
petrified and uncertain
with His Majesty's death.

573
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,700
I think the Crown Prince...

574
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,180
must have felt it more than us do.

575
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,700
If you are unsure about
Prince Li's assassination,

576
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,380
no need to fight with Crown Prince.

577
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,780
You can just send someone to the
army base to find out the truth.

578
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,260
No. We can't leave the war
against Wei unfinished.

579
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,620
We have to keep this to ourselves.

580
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,220
-Wu You!
-Your Highness, this...

581
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,660
Prince Chen.

582
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,100
-Where is Captain Xiang?
-Captain Xiang?

583
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,140
Caption Xiang didn't
come into the palace today.

584
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,140
Prince Chen!

585
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,380
Captain Xiang!

586
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,180
Captain Xiang!

587
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,500
Captain Xiang!

588
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,460
Captain Xiang!

589
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,180
-Prince Chen.
-Is Captain Xiang home?

590
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,860
Captain Xiang didn't come back
since yesterday night.

591
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,020
Our lady has sent someone to look
for him, but no sign of him yet.

592
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,020
This is real bad.

593
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,420
Guards!

594
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,220
Guards!

595
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,540
You, inform Wu You that something
real bad had happened in the capital.

596
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,900
-You, ready my horse for me.
-Yes, Prince Chen!

597
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,220
Prince Chen, what happened?

598
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,300
No time to say.
Pack your things and leave at once.

599
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,100
I'm going to leave the capital to
investigate about it in the army base.

600
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,300
I don't think
you'll be able to go out.

601
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,500
When I came back just now, I saw that
every city door is heavily guarded.

602
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,700
Now, they can only come in
but nobody can go out.

603
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,980
What?

604
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,620
-Brother, you are back.
-Xiao Ke, good girl.

605
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,220
-Did you get the princess's medicine?
-I...

606
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,740
What are you doing?

607
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,100
Crown Prince's order. Prince Li's
assassination case still in progress.

608
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,660
So, everybody in his manor
can't go out without permission.

609
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,300
Those who disobey will be
decapitated on the spot.

610
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,820
Prince Chen. I'll have to trouble you
to stay here for the moment.

611
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,140
Zhao Yi Sheng.

612
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,980
You are so bold.

613
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,540
Before he left, father has ordered me
to help out with Crown Prince.

614
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,340
And I have total command over
the Royal Guards.

615
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,180
As vice-captain of the Royal Guards,

616
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,140
not only you disobey me,
you even cage me in.

617
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,420
I won't dare do it.

618
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,100
But I can't go against
Crown Prince's order.

619
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,420
Although the Royal Guards
is under your command,

620
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,580
captain of Royal Guards, Xiang Chen...

621
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,740
was found dead outside of
the city yesterday night.

622
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,340
Somebody saw that...

623
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,540
he was last seen...

624
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,620
with you, Prince Chen.

625
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,340
Crown Prince has no choice
but to keep you here.

626
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,620
He is protecting you.

627
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,460
Such nonsense!

628
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,060
If something had really
happened to Captain Xiang,

629
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,860
you are the one behind it.

630
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,940
First, you faked a military report
to frame Wu You.

631
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,420
Now, you want to accuse me?

632
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,420
I'm going to get out from here today.

633
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,980
Those who stand in my way...

634
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,900
will be killed without mercy!

635
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,820
Your Highness, don't be reckless.

636
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,300
You can't solve anything
even if you kill them.

637
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,980
I've heard a little something
about the military report.

638
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,220
I don't believe that Prince Li will
assassinate His Majesty as well.

639
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,900
But the whole capital is under
Crown Prince's control now.

640
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,860
Even if we break free from Prince Li's
manor, we can't leave the capital.

641
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,660
What should we do then?
Are we going to resign ourselves?

642
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,220
They say that the troops
are on their way back.

643
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,220
I believe that Prince Li will hear
about it soon and come back at once.

644
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,780
Rather than going head to head
with Crown Prince,

645
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,260
how about you control yourself so
that you can be of use to Prince Li.

646
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,020
Then both of you can work together
from the inside out.

647
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,460
Listen to my brother.

648
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,460
There are so many people here.
You can't win and I can't save you.

649
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,620
I don't care if you
want to stop others.

650
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,020
But after my medicine is done,
someone has to send it to her.

651
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,460
Who do you mean?

652
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,020
Of course it's Princess Rong Le
from the General's Manor.

653
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,140
Princess Rong Le is ill.

654
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,540
Miss Xiao was hired to create new
medicine for her in a quiet place.

655
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,460
They are about done.
If we can't send it out,

656
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,700
can you bear the responsibility
for it if her treatment is affected?

657
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,540
Since it's medicine
for General Fu's wife,

658
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,020
of course I won't stop you.

659
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,100
When they are here to take
the medicine, I'll let you go.

660
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,900
No need to be so mad, Prince Chen.

661
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
I'm just doing it for show.

662
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,220
As long as you don't send
a message to Prince Li,

663
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,740
I won't disturb the people
in this manor.

664
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,980
I'm just going to post my men
on the outside.

665
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,620
You can do as you please in the manor.

666
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,260
When Prince Li is here,
we'll leave immediately.

667
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,660
Get lost!

668
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,940
Guard all the exits! Retreat!

669
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,420
He said that he's doing
Crown Prince's bidding.

670
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,180
But he's just following
Fu Chou's order.

671
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,660
I didn't get to see His Majesty
when I went back to Western Qi.

672
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,300
I didn't get the medicine too.

673
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,940
On my way back, I heard that
Princess Rong Le has gone missing.

674
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,380
So, I searched for her...

675
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,300
and I found out that someone brought
her back to the General's Manor.

676
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,740
I'm very worried about
her condition right now.

677
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
I need to go to the General's Manor.

678
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,340
What's wrong with Man Yao?

679
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,980
Long story.

680
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
Prince Chen.

681
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,460
I'll entrust my sister and
Ling Yue's safety to you.

682
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,100
Don't worry. As long as I'm here,
nobody will dare touch them.

683
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,860
But Man Yao is ill.
Don't tell her...

684
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,100
about what happened today
in case she worries about it.

685
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,900
I know, farewell.
