00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,420
" Princess Silver "

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,420
Episode 45

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,180
In your eyes,

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,900
this is who I am?

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,020
Did you say this because
you hate me too much?

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,620
Don't think too highly of yourself.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,620
I thought I would hate you
my whole life.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,860
But for the past year,

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,460
my life was happy.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,780
I realised one can
erase hate with love.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,500
My heart is filled with
my love for Wu You.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,900
There is no room for hate.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,300
I know there must be a place
for me in your heart.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,140
You won't give me
the chance to be hated?

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,940
Don't come any closer.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,500
We haven't met in a year.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,020
I came all the way here...

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,700
and risked my life...

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,900
not because I wanted to hurt you.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,060
I just want to see you,

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,540
just like I would with an old friend.

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,860
I just want to talk.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,540
In your eyes,

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,860
am I really so terrifying?

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,540
Isn't that the fact?

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,500
You are just as vile as a snake to me.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,140
Before I am certain you will die
by my own hand,

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,340
I could only run away.

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,900
Rong Le.

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,700
Rong Le.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,060
If my death...

32
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,500
can wipe away your fear for me,

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,180
then I will die by your hand.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,260
As everyone knows,

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,060
half of the Northern Realm
is now mine.

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,220
But what they never knew...

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,660
is that...

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
death is the only relief
I could ask for.

39
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,300
Run!

40
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,900
-Help!
-Save them!

41
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,820
Watch out!

42
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,060
Princess Rong Le, I am glad
your vitals weren't hit.

43
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,820
You need to rest well
for the time being.

44
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,340
Stop going out again.

45
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,540
Very well.
Ke, you have my thanks.

46
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,380
You may leave now,
I need to talk to Wu You.

47
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,060
Yes.

48
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,820
Wu You, I didn't consider
all the risks this time.

49
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,980
I didn't know it was him
until I was already there.

50
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,540
He came here...

51
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,980
because of the Blood Raven Root.

52
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,900
But I can't tell if he is lying.

53
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,460
Perhaps he has other motives.

54
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,620
But whatever he has in mind,

55
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
I will have nothing to do with him.

56
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,460
I will never forget...

57
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,820
the harm and damage he did to us.

58
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,500
As for his Blood Raven Root,

59
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,060
I won't accept it.

60
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,020
I won't accept his kindness.

61
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,180
I have work to do.

62
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,300
Rest well.

63
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,860
It was a girl that saved Fu Chou.

64
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,540
Someone else was helping her.

65
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,220
The weapons they use are
these rhombus darts.

66
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,780
They are both well trained
and coordinated.

67
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,260
Is this the weapon used by
Creed of Vengeance?

68
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,540
I checked, the Creed never
 used such weapons.

69
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,420
But the way they operated
is similar to the Creed.

70
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,300
Send in more guards.

71
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,540
Track them down secretly,
use man-hunt as a cover.

72
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,180
Clinics, inns, residential areas
and all possible hideouts.

73
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,540
Search every inch of the land.

74
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,420
Consider it done.

75
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,780
Your Majesty, Sir Chang is here.

76
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,340
At your service, Your Majesty.

77
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
Sir Chang.

78
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,580
How long have you been
serving the Prince Regent?

79
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,020
About a year.

80
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,100
Do you think His Highness would see...

81
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,940
a servant that followed him
for only a year more important...

82
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,820
than his own mother?

83
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,060
I dare not compare
myself with Your Majesty.

84
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,300
His Highness is my master.

85
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,580
Your Majesty is his mother.

86
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,780
Naturally, Your Majesty is
my master as well.

87
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,620
Tell me something.

88
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,980
Ever since his reign started,

89
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,460
did he ever go to Lady Yun's tomb?

90
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,820
Never.

91
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,380
That place would remind him
of his sad past.

92
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,860
I doubt he would want to be there.

93
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,380
But from what I heard,

94
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,060
His Highness ordered you to
keep the tomb well taken care of,

95
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,020
just as how you take care of
Tranquil Garden and Moon Embrace.

96
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,900
I was only following orders.

97
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,300
I have another question.

98
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Is the woman inside the tomb...

99
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,180
still lying in there...

100
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,060
unscathed?

101
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,340
Yes, the body was never moved.

102
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,100
Zongzheng Wu You...

103
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,940
actually left his own mother...

104
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,580
in Zhongshan all along?

105
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,860
Such a disgrace of a son.

106
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,500
Even Fu Chou is taking better care...

107
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,060
of a mere dead woman than he is.

108
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,580
Dismiss.

109
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,100
Tomorrow,

110
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,580
accompany me to the tomb.

111
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,580
But His Highness gave us order.

112
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,660
None can enter the tomb.

113
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,260
Understood.

114
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,900
I will make the arrangement.

115
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,260
I shall go now.

116
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
Yun.

117
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,140
He left me with no choice.

118
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,740
Yun.

119
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,420
Do you know?
Fu Chou went to the south.

120
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,300
Now that he is there,

121
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,700
I wonder what will happen?

122
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,140
Now,

123
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,820
the children are all grown up.

124
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,940
It will be a great show to watch.

125
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,580
However,

126
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,260
Yun,

127
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,180
you left this world too soon.

128
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,540
You won't get the chance
to witness this great event.

129
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,700
Allow me...

130
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,940
to watch it in your place.

131
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,340
After so many years,

132
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,740
you haven't changed one bit.

133
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,260
You look just the same
 as 16 years ago.

134
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,780
A living person like myself...

135
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,300
is even bested by a deceased like you.

136
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,660
You've been sleeping inside
this coffin...

137
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,140
for so many years.

138
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,420
Why don't we...

139
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,860
let you get some sunlight?

140
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,020
Have you seen this man?

141
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,940
-Have you seen this man?
-No.

142
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,620
Go.

143
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,540
Come on.

144
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,340
Stop, have you seen this man?

145
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,780
Hold on, I am dressing the wound.

146
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,060
Go.

147
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,540
-Madam.
-If you want to leave in one-piece,

148
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,860
you must tend to his wounds.

149
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,860
-Yes, madam.
-Go on.

150
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,260
We may not be born as one,

151
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,700
but,

152
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,580
I have made up my mind...

153
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,260
to die by your side.

154
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,820
You disguised as her
and ruined my plan.

155
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,500
I simply gave you some punishments.

156
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,460
-And now you put on her face again...
-Young Master!

157
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,020
just to set me up!

158
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,620
I wish I can just end your life here!

159
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,140
I almost thought...

160
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,660
I have left those memories behind.

161
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,980
For one year,

162
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,060
I never get any news about you.

163
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,860
I never mention the time
we spent together.

164
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,420
I thought I could let it go.

165
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,140
But when you showed up
right in front of me,

166
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,100
I realised all of my efforts...

167
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,140
are just a waste of time.

168
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,660
The last time you listened to
my words so peacefully...

169
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,180
was over a decade ago.

170
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,740
When we trained under the Creed,

171
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,460
you were so nice to me.

172
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,900
You kindness made me feel like...

173
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,580
we could spent the rest
of our life together.

174
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,700
I worked hard to realise that dream.

175
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,780
But you slowly became
more and more distant from me.

176
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,060
Even after we have a child together,

177
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,540
I am not even sure
if I should tell you.

178
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,540
These cuisines...

179
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,020
are your usual favourites.

180
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,820
Try them out.

181
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,780
They all have a mild flavour.

182
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,260
What happened to your hand?

183
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,980
There are some work that
I must see to.

184
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Enjoy your meal.

185
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,340
Wu You?

186
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,060
-Wu You.
-Stay right there.

187
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,300
Don't go.

188
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,580
These are the herbal soup
Princess Rong Le prepared.

189
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,140
Four of those herbs are hand-picked
by Princess Rong Le herself.

190
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,940
There are sicklepods,

191
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,420
Cynanchum, Betula and platycodon

192
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,660
Your Highness, the herbs are...

193
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,060
She wishes to apologise.

194
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,500
But what do I have to forgive?

195
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,980
Do you really have no idea
what my concerns are?

196
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,740
Do you really think
I would be jealous...

197
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
over his affection for you
and play tantrum?

198
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,900
Wu You.

199
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I will be at the School of Wisdom
tomorrow afternoon.

200
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,180
You should come too.

201
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,420
I will be waiting for you.

202
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,340
Prince Li!

203
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,620
Prince Li!

204
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,660
Prince Li!

205
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,580
Are you looking for Princess Rong Le?

206
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,700
She hid herself somewhere.

207
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,740
You must find her yourself.

208
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,100
Off we go!

209
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,700
Let's go.

210
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,140
From now on,

211
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,100
you will never have to look for me.

212
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,340
Wherever you are,
as soon as you open your eyes,

213
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,620
I will right there in front of you.

214
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,100
Fine.

215
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,540
No matter what
the future holds for us,

216
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,900
you will be the first
that comes to my mind.

217
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,460
I will make myself
even more cautious...

218
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,740
and stay away from danger.

219
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,660
Since you understand my concern,

220
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,500
it doesn't matter who you are meeting,

221
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,940
you can't take the risk alone,
understood?

222
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,900
So, will you forgive me now?

223
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,620
I was never mad at you.

224
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,340
There is nothing to forgive.

225
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,300
Man Yao.

226
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,180
I am not mad.

227
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,180
I am afraid.

228
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,340
I know.

229
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,500
I know you don't wish
to see me get hurt...

230
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,340
or be tricked by anyone.

231
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,980
You don't what the tragedy
to happen again.

232
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,700
I understand all your concerns.

233
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,020
I assure you,

234
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,180
it won't happen again.

235
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,740
I will take good care of myself
so you don't have to worry.

236
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,780
Same goes for you,
don't make me worry again.

237
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,740
I won't.

238
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,580
Does it hurt?

239
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,460
When you set the kite flying for me,

240
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,940
you said it was a custom.

241
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,820
Then, I also heard that...

242
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,340
on the wedding day,
husband and wife...

243
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,220
will each cut off a
strand of their hair...

244
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,060
and tie a knot with it.

245
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,220
It means the couple will live as one.

246
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,340
Till death do they part.

247
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,140
Married as a couple,

248
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
faithful till the end of time.

249
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,380
The whole south...

250
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,140
is full of your wanted posters
and soldiers are hunting you.

251
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
There are checkpoints
at the city gates.

252
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,740
If you plan to leave
this place on your own,

253
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,020
you are as good as dead.

254
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,980
This place is rather remote.

255
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,060
You can stay here and
recover for a few days.

256
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,700
But you can't stay for too long.

257
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,900
Now that you are the
Prince Regent of Northern Realm,

258
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,180
someone will be here
for your extraction.

259
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,780
I have to go now.

260
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,380
Madam, have mercy on me!

261
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,980
I tended to that man's wound!

262
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,780
Please, don't kill me!

263
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,500
My daughter just had
her first birthday.

264
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,380
This is the present I bought for her.

265
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,820
I promised her I will
bring this back to her.

266
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,540
She is too young,

267
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,340
she can't live without a father!

268
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,340
Madam, I swear on my life,

269
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,260
I won't tell anyone about this place.

270
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,340
Please have mercy on me!

271
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,180
Spare me my life!

272
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,460
Madam! Please, don't kill me!

273
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,620
If you tell anyone after you left...

274
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,300
No, I won't say a word.

275
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,820
Get out of my sight.

276
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,140
Thank you, madam!

277
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,100
For the first time,

278
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,860
you actually spared someone.

279
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,300
People will change.

280
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,100
No one is born cruel and heartless.

281
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,780
Are you leaving?

282
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,420
We've been searching all day.

283
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,300
This should be the last house.

284
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Come on.

285
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,020
Do not alert the enemy
unless it's the last option.

286
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,260
Is anyone home?
We have order to search the house!

287
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,100
Follow my lead.

288
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,700
I must have been blind
to marry this heartless wretch!

289
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,820
You heartless fiend!

290
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,740
I gave it my all to treat you well
for all these years,

291
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,220
but you are loving someone else!

292
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,140
I never planned to marry you.

293
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,020
You asked for this.

294
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,460
What did you say?

295
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,020
Who else can you marry?

296
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,380
Even without her,

297
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,940
I won't spend any time on you.

298
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,260
-You...
-Silence!

299
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,580
This is official business!

300
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Have you seen this man?

301
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,740
What do you want?
Can't you see we are fighting?

302
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,700
-Get out of my house!
-Insolent fool!

303
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,380
What are you trying to pull off?

304
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,860
Turn around, show yourself!

305
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,300
Report!

306
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,540
Captain, we found this dart outside.

307
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Go.

308
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,340
The dart that came in for your aid...

309
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,140
-was Xiang Ying's plan.
-Yes.

310
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,300
Since you saved me,

311
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,140
all the grudges we had
are now water under the bridge.

312
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,380
You can go now.

313
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,860
Do you think that if I stay here,

314
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,580
I won't stop bothering you?

315
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,540
I am no longer the fool that
lives just to please you.

316
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,860
As of now,

317
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,140
I have another will that drives me.

318
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,420
I didn't save you out of love.

319
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,060
It's because we once
fought along side each other.

320
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,100
Xiang Ying.

321
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,660
I distracted the guards.

322
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,980
But they might come back here again.

323
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,540
This place is not safe,
Young Master...

324
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,420
I am not longer your master.

325
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,580
The Creed is gone as well.

326
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,660
There is a saying.

327
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,500
People left and only memories remain.

328
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,020
Xiang Ying.

329
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,380
If she saved you and you pledged
your loyalty to her,

330
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,860
you shouldn't have betrayed her.

331
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,900
You knew?

332
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,740
When I punished you,

333
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,300
I never meant to kill you.

334
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,180
I punished you so severely...

335
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,460
not because of your failure.

336
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,940
It's because...

337
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,700
you did it on purpose for Hen Xiang.

338
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,020
You thought if Rong Le is killed,

339
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,060
Hen Xiang would get
what she always wanted.

340
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,220
You disobeyed my order
for your own selfishness.

341
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,380
But conscience got the better of you.

342
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,020
So you started serving Rong Le.

343
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,660
Do you honestly think...

344
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,980
I don't see what's in your mind?

345
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,820
If you know everything,

346
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,660
why did you let me go?

347
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,220
That is because...

348
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,300
we were once brothers in arms.

349
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,660
This swords saved you.

350
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,380
You told me...

351
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,300
that you pledge your loyalty to me,

352
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,740
that you will follow me
to death without regret.

353
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,460
I trusted you.

354
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,460
In the ten years you
served in the army,

355
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,500
we slew the enemies together.

356
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,140
You had my back.

357
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,100
You never disappointed me
or let me down.

358
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,420
But this time,

359
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,380
because of your love,

360
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,660
you almost got Rong Le killed.

361
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,460
Yes, I betrayed my promise.

362
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,260
Whether you believe it or not,

363
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,740
I never truly betrayed you.

364
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,060
I never told anyone a word
 about your past.

365
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,420
If you want me dead,

366
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,420
then my life...

367
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,900
is yours to take.

368
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,100
Xiang Ying!

369
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,700
Xiang Ying, you know me well.

370
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,380
When I deal with traitors,

371
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,700
I never showed any mercy.

372
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,100
You saved my life.

373
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,500
We are even now.

374
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,500
If we ever meet again,

375
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,980
the three of us...

376
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,700
are no longer master and servants.

377
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,460
We don't owe each other anything.

378
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,180
You don't need to help me.

379
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,660
I won't spare any mercy
 for any of you.

380
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,660
You should go.

381
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,460
Before we leave,

382
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,900
I have an advice for you.

383
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,500
The greatest pain in life...

384
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,580
is not getting what you want.

385
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,940
If it's beyond your reach,

386
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,380
you shouldn't be obsessed.

387
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,900
Why don't you let it all go...

388
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,260
and spare yourself the pain?

389
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,340
You made it sound so easy.

390
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,540
But only few people can make it.

391
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,700
I wish people's feelings...

392
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,580
can be just the same as the curtains.

393
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,820
A single word...

394
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,460
and a blade drawn...

395
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,540
are all it takes to severe it.

396
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,580
But in reality,

397
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,580
not having the desired...

398
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,140
is the reason we have obsessions.

399
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,700
There is something...

400
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,780
I should let you know.

401
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,460
-We actually have...
-Hen Xiang, we must talk.

402
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,980
Come with me.

403
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,540
Let go of me.

404
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,820
Have you thought this through
before telling him?

405
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,460
Why shouldn't he know?

406
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,420
The daughter is ours.

407
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,380
It's a blood tie that can
never be undone.

408
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,940
But you didn't get your daughter
in a righteous way.

409
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,700
You disguised as Rong Le
and fooled him.

410
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,700
He lost his wife because of this.

411
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,620
It's his greatest pain.

412
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,380
Do you think he would let you stay
just because of the child?

413
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,900
He won't.

414
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,340
Even if he acknowledges this child,

415
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,580
he will only take her away from you.

416
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,740
Do you want to lose your daughter?

417
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,300
Hen Xiang.

418
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,620
You lived a year of
peaceful life without him.

419
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,300
You are born a prideful person.

420
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,020
But you lost all your pride
when it comes to love.

421
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,860
Let it go.

422
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,380
I will.

423
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,740
But I must make sure
Fu Chou leaves safely.

424
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,500
When the time comes,

425
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,580
I will let everything go.

426
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,180
I will forget about him.

427
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,780
You still don't understand.

428
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,740
You are in danger.
You will be exposed sooner or later.

429
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,500
He wants you to leave...

430
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,500
so you won't be risking
your life for him.

431
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,060
He doesn't wish
to owe you anything...

432
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,620
and he wants to severe all ties.

433
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,860
The longer you cling
onto this relationship,

434
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,100
the harder it is to let go.

435
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,540
I know.

436
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,860
But I cannot leave him alone here.

437
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,820
Xiang Ying, you can't
talk me out of this.

438
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,580
This is the last time.

439
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,700
I must make sure he reaches safety.

440
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,740
It seems like we just can't
escape the inevitable.

441
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,380
Ke.

442
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,180
You have always been honest with me.
This time,

443
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,980
don't hide any details from me.

444
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,260
I keep feeling dizzy lately.

445
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,940
It's the same symptoms
I had a year ago.

446
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,700
Is it because...

447
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,220
the poison inside of me is
acting up again?

448
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,940
Princess Rong Le.

449
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,220
I thought not having
any relapse in a year...

450
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,980
means the poison is receding,
it's just not entirely cleansed.

451
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,900
But judging by your pulse,

452
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,820
there is indeed sign of poisoning.

453
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,860
The only cure I know
for this poisoning...

454
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,500
is the Blood Raven Root.

455
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,500
But someone got ahead of me
and took the herb.

456
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,380
Ke, you once told me...

457
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,700
we need the favour of fate
to find a herb.

458
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,980
Perhaps it was my fate
not to have the Blood Raven Root.

459
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,340
In the past,

460
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,700
being poisoned was actually...

461
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,540
not a bad thing.

462
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,860
I had too many obsessions in the past.

463
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,940
I was obsessed with...

464
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,020
finding out who I am...

465
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,780
and what's right when
it comes to love.

466
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,460
But I am a dying person.

467
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
None of these matters anymore.

468
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,620
I must cherish the present.

469
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,060
I must love with all I have...

470
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,180
and be with Wu You.

471
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,060
Princess,

472
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,980
I was told my life would end
in a few years.

473
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,740
But then I met you.

474
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,700
You brought me the Leave
of Seven Locutions.

475
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,700
You didn't have any relapse
for one whole year.

476
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,540
Maybe the ingredients I used
in the remedies...

477
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,780
actually helped to subdue the poison.

478
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,900
I am going to flip through
all of those prescriptions again.

479
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,340
Your Highness, why are you here?

480
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,260
Blood Raven Root.

481
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,940
Where did you find this?

482
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,540
Use this in the medicine.

483
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,580
Do not let Man Yao know.

484
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,540
But,

485
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,420
getting this is a good news.

486
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,980
-What is the secrecy for?
-Do not ask.

487
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,340
Just do as I said.

488
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,180
But...

489
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,020
She doesn't want me to be worried.

490
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,780
She never told us
about her conditions.

491
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,220
I am aware of that.

492
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,060
I am doing this for her own good.

493
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,660
Keeping this a secret is the only way
to make her take the medicine.

494
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,620
Princess, you heard it all?

495
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,340
Are you all right?

496
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,500
This herb feeds on human blood.

497
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,140
It takes a toll on the feeder
and causes great pain.

498
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,580
You cannot touch it.

499
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,700
Go.

500
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,100
Just go on.

501
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,180
Wait.

502
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,700
Go on.

503
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,580
You, hold on.

504
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Go.

505
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,100
-Hold on.
-Stop staring, keep moving.

506
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Don't cry.

507
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,060
You, stop here.

508
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,820
-Let's go.
-Hush.

509
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,100
Where did you see this man?

510
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,580
I...

511
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,340
Hen Xiang?

512
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,020
What happened?

513
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,140
The Hidden Ones
found this place. Let's go!

514
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,780
You need to leave!

515
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,460
Sir!

516
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,740
Sir, we received reports.

517
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,100
Some riders broke through
the checkpoint with a carriage.

518
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,100
-Inform Prince Li.
-Yes!

519
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,620
Your Highness.

520
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,900
Report from Agent Wu.

521
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900
We found tracks of Fu Chou
at the border.
