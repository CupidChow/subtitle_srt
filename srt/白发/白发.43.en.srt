00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:30,025
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,840
Episode 43

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,960
I have to leave
Zhongshan for some time.

4
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,010
There is something...

5
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:40,187
that I should have done
a long time ago.

6
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,873
Your Highness,
you can't take the risk.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,236
Send a double to stay in here for me.

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,076
Yes, Your Highness.

9
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,360
Kneel.

10
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,511
Sir Sun, what is the meaning of this?

11
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:18,822
Lady Rong Le,

12
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,609
Prince Li spent the night with Ya Li.

13
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,723
She couldn't inform you in time.

14
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,600
So, she is here to apologise.

15
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,517
You knew this too?

16
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,705
Princess, Ke told me about this.

17
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
This way, please.

18
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,467
I thought you never
want to see me again.

19
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,783
I thought...

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,696
even if I sent my men to get you,

21
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:07,675
you would refuse to come.

22
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:10,523
Your Highness asks for me,

23
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,258
I wouldn't dare to turn you down.

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,621
Your father was there,

25
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:17,749
you couldn't say anything.

26
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,745
Now that no one is holding you back,

27
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,710
will you tell me the truth now?

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,243
No one was holding me back.

29
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:34,428
Ya Li.

30
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,906
Even until now,

31
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:39,443
you still wouldn't tell me
what really happened?

32
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,286
That is what happened.

33
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:43,567
Prince Li and I slept together.

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,757
You can stop lying to yourself now.

35
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,114
I love Prince Li.

36
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,912
He has feelings for me too.

37
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,497
Lady Rong Le, you should
give us your blessing.

38
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:58,296
You once told me...

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,359
that you see me as your
best friend and soulmate.

40
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,364
You want me to have a happy life.

41
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,587
I found my happiness.

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,923
But you can't accept the truth.

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,640
Ya Li.

44
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,785
I remember telling you...

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,249
life may be hard,

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,600
but we can all be the masters
of our own destiny.

47
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,584
Master of my destiny?

48
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,040
Each and every step
I take right now...

49
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,332
is the choice of my own.

50
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,289
No one is coercing me.

51
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,918
But your attitude towards me...

52
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,320
is pushing me to desperation.

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
I am the daughter of Sun family.

54
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:42,578
For a noble family like mine,
name and reputation...

55
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:44,178
come before everything.

56
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,980
Since you are betting on
the name of your family,

57
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,520
I have nothing more to say to you.

58
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,160
You and your father...

59
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,124
shall wait for Wu You's decision.

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,520
If you can be part of this house,

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
I will gladly leave this place.

62
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,044
However,

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,118
you should watch yourself.

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,351
You agreed?

65
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,615
If Prince Li agrees,

66
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,083
you won't stop me from
staying with him?

67
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,367
Ling Yue.

68
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:16,085
See the guest off.

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,558
Yes.

70
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,445
Miss Sun, this way please.

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,770
Princess,

72
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,440
I think...

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,831
if we love someone,

74
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,674
as long as they are happy,

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,803
we will feel happy as well.

76
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,520
I think...

77
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,935
if Prince Li does love Miss Sun,

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,419
when he is happy,

79
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,280
you will be happy as well.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,220
Why don't you try to accept her?

81
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,964
It's up to her luck.

82
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,691
This is the allocation of fund
for victims of earthquake in Zhuo.

83
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,762
Is there any objection?

84
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,680
I heard Your Highness
spent the night...

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,244
with Miss Ya Li, the daughter of
Governor of Qingzhou.

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,212
Sir Cai.

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,234
This is His Highness' personal affair.

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,509
How could you bring it
up in the court?

89
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,670
That would stain my daughter's honour.

90
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,567
Miss Sun has exceptional
morals and benevolence.

91
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,651
She is the best lady
to be the consort.

92
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,177
Best lady we have?

93
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:41,151
There can only be one consort.

94
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,379
No other women deserves my brother!

95
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:48,182
Your Highness, a single woman
cannot have power over the harem.

96
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,452
And she hasn't bear any child
even after a year.

97
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,909
If this goes on, the people
might take this wrongly.

98
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,160
There are rumours that...

99
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,160
the woman is actually the wife of
Northern Realm's Prince Regent.

100
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,656
She doesn't come clean.

101
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:05,934
She might even be the spy
Fu Chou planted here.

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,099
And now she is interfering
with national affair...

103
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,461
and causing disorder.

104
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,280
We all know she has vile intention.

105
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,308
This is unacceptable!

106
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,175
-This is all nonsense!
-Wu Yu.

107
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,049
Sir Cai, do you mind enlighten me...

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,049
of what action I should take?

109
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,199
Your Highness.

110
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,183
My daughter showed you her love.

111
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,068
She has the duty
to bring your child...

112
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,682
and continue the bloodline.

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,211
He is right.

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,843
Sir Sun, you are using the
innocence of your daughter...

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,600
to blackmail me
in front of the officers.

116
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,547
This might not sound
humiliating to you,

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,256
but have you ever considered
how Ya Li might feel?

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,798
Leng Yan.

119
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,968
Your Highness, she is here.

120
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,117
Ya Li, what exactly
happened that night?

121
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,921
Tell us what you know.

122
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:18,808
Ya Li.

123
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,633
Fear not, I will be here
to speak for you.

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Allow me to say it for her.

125
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,720
Prince Li and Miss Sun were
never together that night, not at all.

126
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,000
How is this possible?

127
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,400
You little brat, enough
of your insolence here.

128
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:42,757
Ya Li.

129
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:46,072
Was Ke telling us the truth just now?

130
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,695
Your Highness,

131
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,804
did you ask me here
to talk about that night?

132
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,098
I have always loved you.

133
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,065
I couldn't help myself...

134
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,101
when you were holding me in your arms.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,840
I don't hope to replace Rong Le.

136
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:17,652
I just want to be with you.

137
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,120
Ya Li,

138
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,306
are you sure that night in this study,

139
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,695
we had any intimate contact?

140
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,607
If you refuse to accept me
because of Rong Le,

141
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,846
then so be it.

142
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:38,440
I won't stay here to bother you.

143
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,885
I shall end my life with
my tainted honour.

144
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,043
Seeing that we were childhood friends,

145
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:47,365
I will give you another chance.

146
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,388
If you want to keep this going,

147
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:53,034
then I shall show no mercy for you.

148
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,433
Come in!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,827
Your Highness, the men's clothes
look so awful.

150
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,068
The way of manners is complicated.

151
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,913
Miss Ya Li,

152
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,329
did you enjoy the night
you spent with me?

153
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,258
You sneaked out from the infirmary.

154
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,403
So, you were here for your 'training'?

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,605
What do you mean with that?

156
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
Your Highness, General Luo Zhi...

157
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:33,662
wishes to know if the tactical layout
you discussed last night...

158
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,108
are already done.

159
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:36,659
Last night?

160
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:40,644
I was already at General Luo's house
at the dusk.

161
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,710
We were discussing works.

162
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:45,687
I came back to the study
to get changed at half past six.

163
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,545
You were already awake.

164
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:53,170
The guards in this manor
and the soldiers of Luo Army...

165
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,954
are witnesses for my whereabouts.

166
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,030
May I know...

167
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,280
how you and I had such intimate night?

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,019
Your Highness, this can't be true.

169
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,790
I may have slept a little too soundly,

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
-but we clearly had...
-What have you done earlier...

171
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,243
to fall asleep so well?

172
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:14,654
I am sure you know it better.

173
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:17,838
What are you afraid of?

174
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,944
You lit some aphrodisiac incense,

175
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,207
I used some of it on you too.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
No!

177
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,671
It was Prince Li.

178
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,306
It couldn't be you.

179
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,932
Everyone knows I wasn't
in here that night.

180
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:36,655
If you insist you had any
intimate time with someone,

181
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:40,794
we do have many
strong men in the house.

182
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:42,947
I am afraid...

183
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,810
Your Highness!

184
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,600
I apologise! Please,
do not let me carry this shame!

185
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,092
Otherwise...

186
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,200
I will have no courage
to live in this world anymore.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,189
Miss Ya Li.

188
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,323
If you don't want the others
to know what happened,

189
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,715
you can show this to them.

190
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,200
See? The virginity fleck
 is still here.

191
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,717
Miss Ya Li is still a virgin.

192
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,960
It's true.

193
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,717
This is odd.

194
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,320
Please, judge this wisely.

195
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,654
Prince Li and I never
did anything indecent.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,394
Nothing happened between us.

197
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,779
But...

198
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,563
How could a father do that?

199
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,379
Even I know men and women
must keep their distance.

200
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,492
But you are tainting
your daughter's innocence!

201
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,544
This brat is spitting nonsense
and framing me and my daughter.

202
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,367
Is Your Highness not
going to do anything?

203
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,438
You may leave now.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,879
Sir Sun, I once thought
this is the trick...

205
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,749
the consorts use to win
the favour of the Emperor.

206
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,316
I am surprised that
an officer like yourself...

207
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,062
would stoop so low...

208
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,755
to force my brother
into marrying Ya Li.

209
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:21,110
Right, maybe during the time Miss Sun
spent in the Northern Realm...

210
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,105
she was having an affair
with the Prince Regent.

211
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:28,065
Perhaps this is why you are in
such a hurry to get her a husband...

212
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,911
and used such lowly trickery.

213
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:35,719
I don't know what Your Highness
used to coerce my daughter.

214
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,359
Your Highness won't let
my daughter be the consort,

215
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,227
but the Silver-Hair Demon
that shares the bed with you...

216
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:43,687
should pay for the death of
those fallen soldiers.

217
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,520
Sir Sun,

218
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:48,772
you are being frustrated
because your plan failed.

219
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,707
You would even blackmail His Highness.

220
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,827
Your Highness must have overlooked
the proposal I submitted.

221
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,226
We think the terror of
Silver-Hair Demon must end.

222
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:08,742
Aside from the incident at the inn,
I also heard about...

223
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,055
the murder case
in the camp of Luo Army.

224
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:16,861
The victim was Luo Qiao,
the brother of General Luo Zhi.

225
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,456
How is this possible?

226
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,118
They are based outside the city wall,
everything was fine.

227
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,144
I was informed they are setting out
for the border tomorrow.

228
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,939
If Luo Qiao is dead,

229
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,057
General Luo will be furious
and charge right in here.

230
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,358
He is right.

231
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,951
Your Highness.

232
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,286
The common folks say
the culprit of the murder...

233
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,466
is the Silver-Hair Demon
that lives inside...

234
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:42,674
Sir Cai.

235
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,311
Lady Rong Le is in the manor,

236
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,920
how does she kill those men?

237
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,259
You have no evidence
and this is your own wild guess.

238
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,048
What you are accusing now are
Prince Li and the whole south.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,659
The truth doesn't matter.

240
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,275
The people want answer.

241
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,771
Answer? This is the answer.

242
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,195
Lady Rong Le is innocent.

243
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,924
Believe whatever you want.

244
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,097
Your Highness.

245
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,327
This is the request from
the people and the officers.

246
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:13,696
Please, end the scourge of this demon.

247
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:16,020
I am curious.

248
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,428
How did the people request this?

249
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,732
How did the officers request this?

250
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,275
Your Highness, end the scourge
of this demon for the fallen souls,

251
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:28,531
bring peace to the people.
Such is their request.

252
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,040
Marry another consort
and continue the bloodline,

253
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:32,497
bring order to the Imperial Court,

254
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,788
-such is the officers' request.
-Enough.

255
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,141
Man Yao is my wife.

256
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,650
I won't let her get hurt
no matter what the cost.

257
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,844
-Your Highness!
-Sir Sun!

258
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,480
This is where your acting must end.

259
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,231
As for where the murderous
Silver-Hair Demon came from...

260
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,983
and who the murderer is,

261
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,947
I have the answer.

262
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,714
And I believe you know
the truth better than anyone.

263
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,670
Your Highness.

264
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,173
Your Highness, bad news.

265
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,132
The soldiers of northern base
sent to Zhuo...

266
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:07,084
have returned an hour ago.

267
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,417
They are having a stand-off
with the Luo Army.

268
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:10,996
What?

269
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,870
Last night, 13 soldiers
of the northern base died.

270
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,645
Someone spread the rumours about
Silver-Hair Demon to the base.

271
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:23,763
A riot broke out, they claim
Lady Rong Le is the murderer.

272
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,278
They demand Your Highness
to hand over Lady Rong Le...

273
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,215
or they will invade Qingzhou....

274
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,800
and seize the manor.

275
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,563
But...

276
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,640
Your Highness, there is an uproar
among the people and the soldiers,

277
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,345
the nation's order comes first.

278
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,400
Please, take your action
as soon as possible.

279
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,062
With the nation's fate at stake,
Lady Rong Le cannot be the priority,

280
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,184
please consider this matter wisely.

281
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,191
We hope Your Highness
will take action as soon as possible.

282
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,501
If I wanted to save someone...

283
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,797
and kill innocents
without any evidence,

284
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,840
that would truly be a shame
to my name.

285
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,244
The evidence for the murders
by Silver-Hair Demon...

286
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,092
will be presented to you.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,027
As for the justice
the soldiers demand,

288
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:17,081
I will give them an explanation.

289
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,918
Justice for our brothers,
have over the Demon!

290
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,928
Justice for our brothers,
have over the Demon!

291
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,807
Justice for our brothers,
have over the Demon!

292
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,857
Justice for our brothers,
have over the Demon!

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,200
Justice for our brothers,
have over the Demon!

294
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,162
Brothers of the northern base,

295
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,698
if the 13 fallen brothers
that died last night...

296
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,752
know that you believed
the rumours so easily...

297
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,405
and accuse the innocent...

298
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:25,656
while the real culprit
is still at large,

299
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,973
I doubt they will rest in peace...

300
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,075
and their souls would be disappointed.

301
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,721
My brother Luo Qiao was
killed by the same villain.

302
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,074
You know me well.

303
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,062
If this is truly Lady Rong Le's doing,

304
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,074
I, Luo Zhi,

305
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
will not tolerate!

306
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,483
Give our brothers
the justice they deserve!

307
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,762
Give our brothers
the justice they deserve!

308
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,080
Soldiers, calm down!

309
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,508
-We want answers!
-Within the next 24 hours,

310
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,645
Prince Li will get the evidence...

311
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,963
and arrest the true killer.

312
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,600
-This is great.
-Good.

313
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,476
You are right.

314
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,037
Fine.

315
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>I followed and carried out
Prince Regent's order.</i>

316
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>I hope Your Highness can
shield us from the harms.</i>

317
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:36,604
Letter from the south, all are
 in place just as you ordered.

318
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,427
We left no trace behind.

319
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:41,783
Prince Li lost the trust of soldiers
because of the lies about Demon.

320
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,989
We can soon invade the south.

321
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,174
Sir Sun...

322
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,653
is so capable at carrying out order.

323
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,645
But he is too greedy and selfish,

324
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,580
he will surely falter.

325
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,794
Very wise, Your Majesty.
We asked him to get rid of Luo Qiao...

326
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,000
and he is already making demands
to save his skin.

327
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,160
Fortunately, we have
other spies there...

328
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,250
and killed those 13 soldiers
of the south.

329
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,332
With each death, there is
one more trouble for Prince Li.

330
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,386
There is another matter
I wonder if I should tell you.

331
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,095
His Highness claims to be sick,

332
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:22,955
but I found out he is actually
not in his room.

333
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,352
Empress Fu.

334
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,620
Your Majesty, His Highness is ill.
He is taking his rest.

335
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:35,874
Stand down.

336
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,160
Greetings, Empress Fu.

337
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:51,526
Where is the Prince Regent?

338
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,296
Your Majesty, the Prince Regent is...

339
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,827
He is...

340
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:00,430
Speak.

341
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,865
He went to the south.

342
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:04,860
Why would he go to the south?

343
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't know, but he left without
packing too many belongings.

344
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:10,546
I wasn't allowed to follow him.

345
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,269
He wanted me to stay here...

346
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:14,816
to keep his secret...

347
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,800
as long as possible.

348
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:21,212
What else can make him
prepare so well just to leave here?

349
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,635
His feathers have grown full.

350
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,819
How dare he keep me in the dark.

351
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,819
Captain Chang, you failed your duty
and cover up his plan.

352
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,994
By the laws of Royal Palace,
you are punished with 40 beatings.

353
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,977
-But...
-Why?

354
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,886
The Prince Regent is away,

355
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,754
and you dare to disrespect me now?

356
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,782
If His Highness comes back...

357
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,120
and learns that all of you
have disrespected me,

358
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,015
I wonder what the punishment...

359
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,449
will be for all of you.

360
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,405
I apologise, Your Majesty.

361
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,962
I mean no disrespect.

362
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:01,581
I appreciate the lecture.

363
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,020
I will accept the punishment.

364
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,930
The Prince Regent may be away,

365
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:17,168
but the laws still stand.

366
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,348
From now on,

367
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:23,461
all matters of the Imperial Court...

368
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,370
must be reported to
Senyan Palace in details.

369
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:28,612
I shall make the decision.

370
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,200
If I ever find out...

371
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:35,093
that someone is keeping
secrets from me,

372
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,638
only death sentence awaits.

373
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,609
Yes, Your Majesty's
order is our command.

374
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,102
Uncle, the officers are
making requests while...

375
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,854
there is a mutiny on the other side,

376
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,217
must we to hand over Man Yao
and let her get killed?

377
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:51,242
You know how much
my brother loves Man Yao.

378
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,933
He will never sacrifice Man Yao
just to appease the uproar.

379
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,082
Since the ancient times, if a
consort affects the people's life,

380
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,369
the ruler must make the hard decision.

381
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,243
As for the murder in northern base,

382
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,950
if Wu You ignores the public outrage
for Lady Rong Le,

383
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,507
he will lose the trust of
the army and the people.

384
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,600
That will bring even
more troubles afterwards.

385
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:11,625
Look at the veteran officers that
support the reformation.

386
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:14,366
Even they requested to have
Lady Rong Le punished.

387
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,988
Under these circumstances,

388
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I am afraid not even Wu You
can turn the tide.

389
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,326
Sir Sun didn't hold any
punches for this plan.

390
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,138
It's one scheme after another.

391
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,501
He knew that even if Wu You
finds out what he did,

392
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,104
there will be no evidence.

393
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,194
After all, people are unpredictable.

394
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,720
Rumour will soon become
reality with enough believers.

395
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,519
The man that set up
this plot has stood out.

396
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,054
But I have no idea what
Wu You has in place.

397
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:44,740
The soldiers of northern base
are in high spirit.

398
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,965
Things might not bode well for him.

399
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:50,163
I don't know what
my brother's plan is either.

400
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,720
He just told me to stay
and keep things in check...

401
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,021
and keep Man Yao in the dark.

402
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:58,538
But he brought Sir Sun and Sir Cai
to the northern base.

403
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,673
Princess.

404
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
What are you doing here?

405
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,058
Ke.

406
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,920
Did you know about this?

407
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,577
What was inside this vial?
What happened here?

408
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,428
It was...

409
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,640
the Ageing Frost.

410
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,798
General Luo, you promised us
Prince Li will be here.

411
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:02,476
Where is he now?

412
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,190
You take money from the ruler...

413
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:06,175
so you won't let justice
is done to our brothers!

414
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:09,864
We are just common folks
who wish to survive!

415
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,339
If Prince Li fails to hand over
the Silver-Hair Demon,

416
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,232
we will hand in the armours and quit!

417
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,499
Yes!

418
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:19,843
Hand over the Silver-Hair Demon!

419
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,336
Justice for our brothers!

420
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,522
Hand over the Silver-Hair Demon!

421
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,076
Prince Li arrives!

422
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,673
Prince Li is here, behave yourselves!

423
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,773
Your Highness, the 13 dead soldiers
died the same way as Luo Qiao.

424
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,864
They were cut at the throat
and died from blood loss.

425
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,960
There are bite marks at their wounds,

426
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:25,667
but the marks are used
to cover the cut.

427
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,263
The rumours about blood-sucking
is absurd at best.

428
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,666
This is the dagger
Captain Leng gave me.

429
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,280
I examined it,

430
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:34,427
this is the weapon of the murderer.

431
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,384
Bring her in.

432
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,325
A woman with silver hair.

433
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,400
-Is she the demon?
-She has silver hair.

434
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,835
-Her hair is silver.
-It's her!

435
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,679
Who else can it be?

436
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,294
The dagger was found on this woman.

437
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,139
Is she really the Silver-Hair Demon?

438
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,745
-She is the demon?
-She is the murderer...

439
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,564
that killed my brother!

440
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,640
Get up!

441
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,147
-That is not her hair?
-It was a wig?

442
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,972
-How is it not her?
-This is weird.

443
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,147
-You are right.
-Indeed.

444
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:18,754
Sir Sun.

445
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,534
Yes.

446
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:23,447
Come on the stage and have a look.

447
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,379
See if you know this woman.

448
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,452
I do not know her.

449
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,600
Bring in the waiter.

450
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,153
Sir Sun, why do you want
to have me killed?

451
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,968
Who is this guy?

452
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,127
You are too busy to remember him.

453
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:02,037
Of course you will forget about
the insignificant waiter.

454
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,179
But he does remember you.

455
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,683
You almost got him killed.

456
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,921
A month ago, Sir Sun
came to me in person.

457
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,585
He gave me a lot of money...

458
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,992
to spy on a woman in our shop,
especially one with silver hair.

459
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:17,909
He wants me to fall down
in front of the woman...

460
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,513
and expose her silver hair.

461
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:22,183
But I could tell something was off.

462
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,822
Lady Rong Le has silver hair too.

463
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,739
This is absurd.

464
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,168
After some time,
I faltered from this job.

465
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,748
I asked my boss to return
the money to Sir Sun,

466
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,431
I quitted my job and went home.

467
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:35,951
Then, Sir Sun used a suicide warrior
to replace you...

468
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,676
as the waiter at the inn.

469
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,052
But the bard was caught in action.

470
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:41,746
Sir Sun doesn't want any loose end,

471
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,214
so, he killed everyone
who knows this plan.

472
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,302
He is resourceful,

473
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,040
he bribed the prison guards
to kill the imprisoned bard.

474
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,237
But you returned home
and escaped his death claw.

475
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,760
I was lucky enough to find you.

476
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:55,558
Not only did I saved your life,

477
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,497
I even caught this
silver-headed woman!

478
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,019
This is ridiculous!

479
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,926
You can go now.

480
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,014
Yes.

481
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,565
Bring the chest here.

482
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,260
I am sure you recognise
this chest, Sir Sun.

483
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,597
Your house is guarded,

484
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,684
if I hadn't invited you here,

485
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:35,462
I doubt I can even find this chest.

486
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:39,027
That bard was spreading
all kinds of lies...

487
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:41,378
and took controlled of the
renowned Serene Hill Inn.

488
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,532
That inn was in fact
the property of Sun family.

489
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,458
The seal of Sun family
is on this land deed.

490
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,640
You mean the story about
Silver-Hair Demon...

491
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:52,775
are all lies made by Sir Sun?

492
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,633
There is more.

493
00:30:56,877 --> 00:31:00,913
'I, Fu Chou, thank you for planning
the mutiny in the year of rooster.'

494
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,377
'The five thousand taels of
silver shall fund your rebellion,

495
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,534
the rest can be kept for your family.'

496
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:09,603
Mutiny in the year of rooster?

497
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,477
The mutiny six years ago...

498
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:14,186
was connected to the Sun family?

499
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:17,429
-Right! The refugees' mutiny!
-How is this possible?

500
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,599
'The Zheng family is doomed,
you need not worried, Sir Sun.'

501
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:23,066
'I have settled everything
in the Court.'

502
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,483
'I will place all the charges
on the Zheng family.'

503
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:27,768
'Sir Sun, you have nothing
to be worried about.'

504
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,394
'A hundred acres of land is
for you at the eastern outskirts.'

505
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,252
-Silence!
-Sir Sun.

506
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,331
The Zheng family conspired
with the rebels,

507
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,678
they robbed us of the land
with the war.

508
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,438
Are you connected
to the rebels as well?

509
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,046
'If the reformation at
the south is a success,

510
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,845
both the people and army
will become over-powered.'

511
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,266
'The commoners will rise up
against the weakened nobles.'

512
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,840
'I was hoping to marry my daughter
to Zongzheng Wu You...

513
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,497
to secure my status and power.'

514
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:54,831
'Sir Sun, the people's
belief is the only mean...

515
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,400
to spread rumours about
terrors of Silver-Hair Demon.'

516
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,160
It was Sir Sun's doing?

517
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,675
I am sure you can see the truth now.

518
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,250
All of these letters are marked
with seal of General Fu Chou.

519
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,523
As for where the stories of
Silver-Hair demon comes from,

520
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,328
I am sure all of you
should know by now.

521
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:32,051
The ledgers of Sun family...

522
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,240
that record years of
land-hoarding through war...

523
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,360
and the reports from people
he suppressed with his ranks...

524
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:38,837
are all here.

525
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,036
He committed so many crimes!

526
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,928
Sir Sun!

527
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,840
Sir Sun.

528
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,728
We have witnesses and the evidences.

529
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,680
What do you have to say now?

530
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,277
You made up the rumours
about a demon to frame my wife.

531
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,930
That is your first crime.

532
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,048
You hired an assassin to kill
Luo Qiao and 13 other soldiers.

533
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,000
That is your second crime.

534
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:08,090
You secretly caused
years of disorder...

535
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,440
in order to help Fu Chou
secure a place for you,

536
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,080
your doings caused countless
people to lose their homes.

537
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:16,429
And because of your own greed,

538
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,920
you tried to beguile the army
and conspire with enemy.

539
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,579
That is your third crime.

540
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,000
These charges alone are enough
to get your wealth confiscated...

541
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,600
and your rank removed.

542
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,371
You will be tried and executed.

543
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:30,798
Lock him up!

544
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,561
Your Highness.

545
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,880
Even if there is evidence
to prove me guilty,

546
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,269
your wife still cannot
run away from her crimes.

547
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:49,009
Even if she never killed anyone
for the blood,

548
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:51,001
she is married to two men.

549
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:52,949
She disrupts the order of the Court.

550
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:55,441
The people of Zhongshan
died because of her.

551
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:57,761
The army is swayed because of her.

552
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,619
Your Highness,

553
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,510
ask your own conscience.

554
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,969
Is it more loathsome
that I hired a killer...

555
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,200
or is it more terrifying that...

556
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:10,590
the Silver-Hair Demon seduces you
into abandoning your nation?

557
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,462
Take this man to the cell.

558
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,302
Walk!

559
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,899
The demon is sucking His Highness dry!

560
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,800
She kills the trust of the people!

561
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,725
The people needs answers!

562
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,606
The demon must be killed!

563
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,036
The demon must be killed!

564
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,490
The demon must be killed!

565
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:31,143
The demon must be killed!

566
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:35,554
The demon must be killed!

567
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,480
Your Highness.

568
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,204
Sir Sun might be absurd,

569
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:43,524
but Lady Rong Le has silver hair,

570
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,080
it is indeed suspicious.

571
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,272
The people has great fear for her.

572
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,570
They might start to doubt
Your Highness soon.

573
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,892
If Your Highness insists to let
Lady Rong Le go unpunished,

574
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:59,152
the reformation and campaign
against Fu Chou...

575
00:34:59,437 --> 00:35:00,885
will suffer setbacks!

576
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,600
He is right.

577
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,749
-He is right.
-The efforts will suffer setbacks.

578
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,200
Indeed.

579
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,605
If you wish to pry my resolve,

580
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,195
then I shall gladly
show you my resolve!

581
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
Silver hair!

582
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,840
-What is going on?
-How did this happen?

583
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,605
I have silver hair too.

584
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
How will you punish me now?

585
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:02,962
Whatever you wish to do to her,

586
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,512
you must first go through me.

587
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,640
What is this Ageing Frost?

588
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:22,525
It's a rare poison.

589
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,356
It's effect is violent.

590
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:25,944
It's not lethal,

591
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,029
but it brings unimaginable pain,

592
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,595
a pain worse than death itself.

593
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,080
<i>How love and hatred
fool the people.</i>

594
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,859
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

595
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,520
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

596
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,200
<i>The world is warm
but sincerity is easily gone.</i>

597
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,186
<i>Any who takes this poison...</i>

598
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,261
<i>will suffer a reversal in blood flow.</i>

599
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,763
<i>The pain is worse than being
pierced by volleys and smashed organs.</i>

600
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,377
<i>It will turn the hair silver...</i>

601
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,514
<i>in just one night.</i>

602
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,385
Ten years of life will be taken.

603
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:23,640
<i>The wind blows across my cheeks,
sending him away.</i>

604
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,113
<i>Your words of affection
had me believe you.</i>

605
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:36,368
<i>Who said that
the world is flourishing?</i>

606
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:43,080
<i>There are greed and jealousy and
people's hearts are unpredictable.</i>

607
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:48,987
<i>You'll get nothing even if you can
find out about the truth.</i>

608
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,309
<i>I just hope that at least
one of us can turn Gray.</i>

609
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:04,643
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

610
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,360
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

611
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,647
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

612
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,705
<i>The world is warm
but sincerity is easily gone.</i>

613
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,244
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

614
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,935
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is hurting.</i>

615
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,287
<i>It's inevitable that we part but
I just wish that it won't be so cruel.</i>

616
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:14,586
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>

617
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:20,003
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>

618
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:22,062
What if she is a woman?

619
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,286
What if she has silver hair?

620
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,215
The people believe in me,

621
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,207
not because of my look,

622
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,290
but for where my heart lies.

623
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,111
Lady Rong Le stood by me
all this time.

624
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:35,415
She helped planning
 the reformation effort...

625
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,282
and improved the life many.

626
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,880
But to avoid any attention,
she never asked for credits.

627
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,520
She never told you...

628
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,760
that half of the south is thriving
because of her.

629
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,080
That is the Imperial Seal!

630
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,739
The Imperial Seal left
by the late emperor!

631
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,840
-You are right!
-It's the Imperial Seal.

632
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,431
My father gave her the Imperial Seal
before passing on.

633
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,840
In order to protect the Imperial Seal,
she put her life at risk...

634
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,153
so it will not fall into the hands
of the villains...

635
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,920
but in the hands of
its rightful owner.

636
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:16,105
She understands my vision.

637
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,063
She supports my loyalty to my father.

638
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,399
She understands my ambition
to unify the land.

639
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,897
I did not crown myself the emperor...

640
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,783
and kept the Imperial Seal a secret.

641
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,857
She carries out her duty with honour.

642
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,629
Yet she never took
credits for anything.

643
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,556
From now on, we will both
carry silver hair...

644
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,280
and move forward as one.

645
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:45,275
She will be my only wife.

646
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,920
She will be my only consort...

647
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:50,145
in the whole south.

648
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,841
Long Live the Consort!

649
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,680
Long Live the Consort!

650
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,560
You may go now.

651
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,366
Ya Li.

652
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,226
Did Prince Li mention
how he will punish you?

653
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,512
He didn't say anything.

654
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,491
He did nothing either.

655
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,074
It's just as I expected.

656
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,474
Because of old times' sake,
he won't hurt you.

657
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,184
What old times' sake?

658
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,520
He and I never shared
any old times' sake.

659
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,095
All he has is the newly found hate.
