00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,140
Episode 1

3
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,342
You can never escape us.

4
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,549
Your Highness!

5
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:43,989
Your Majesty.
Princess Rong Le is awake.

6
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,417
Your Majesty.

7
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,674
Come on.

8
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:01,431
Even if you disagree with
this marriage alliance,

9
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:03,346
you shouldn't have run away
on your own.

10
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,014
You are wounded and blamed.

11
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,898
Are you happy now?

12
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,940
Who are you?

13
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,873
What is this place?

14
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,700
Rong Le.

15
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:24,327
Your Majesty,
Physician Liu's worry came true.

16
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,265
Her Highness might have
had a concussion.

17
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,855
That is why she lost her memories.

18
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,761
Her Highness?
What are you talking about?

19
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,599
I lost my memories?

20
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,340
I don't understand a thing you say.

21
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,051
You are in the royal palace
of Western Qi.

22
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,242
I am the Emperor of Western Qi.

23
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,261
You are my younger sister.

24
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,430
You are Princess Rong Le
of this nation.

25
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,552
I am ...

26
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,199
Princess Rong Le of Western Qi?

27
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes.

28
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:00,979
Your Majesty.

29
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,079
The medicine is ready.

30
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,491
Don't be worried about this.

31
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,270
According to the physician,

32
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,609
as long as you take
your medicine on time,

33
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,530
you will slowly regain your memories.

34
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,269
Take your medicine.

35
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,780
I am not drinking this.

36
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,569
It's all right.

37
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,080
You just woke up, you must be
feeling a little discomfort.

38
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,687
Stay here and rest well.

39
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,646
You may drink it when you wish to.

40
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,466
Little Xun.

41
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:26,216
Rong Le.

42
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,766
You have my word.

43
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,179
I will do whatever it takes to
help you regain your memories.

44
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:35,241
Calm down and get well.

45
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:38,702
You are dismissed.

46
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:40,600
Let the princess have some rest.

47
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,659
Yes.

48
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,514
Rong Le?

49
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,150
Princess?

50
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:09,714
Marriage arrangement?

51
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,280
Amnesia?

52
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,236
An emperor for brother?

53
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,020
Why can't I remember any of these?

54
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:24,101
Who exactly am I?

55
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,391
-Is this where I lived?
-Yes, Your Highness.

56
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,397
You are His Majesty's only sister.

57
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,329
His Majesty loves you very much.

58
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,566
No matter how busy His Majesty
is with the nation's affair,

59
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,621
whether it has been days or longer,

60
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,162
he will be here to visit you.

61
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,280
Your Highness is very clingy to
His Majesty too.

62
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,616
Your Highness.

63
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,057
Your Highness?

64
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,202
Your Highness?

65
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,968
Your Highness.

66
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,614
Your Highness.

67
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,947
Am I really a princess?

68
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,419
Your Highness.

69
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,647
Your Highness, why are you here?
Are you all right?

70
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,056
Your Highness.

71
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,761
Your Highness?

72
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,842
Your Majesty.

73
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,333
You seem to be feeling better now.

74
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,762
I promised you I will
help you find the memories.

75
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,419
I can help you regain
the lost memories if you want.

76
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:50,763
However,

77
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,220
if you act recklessly
like you were just now....

78
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:55,945
and charge right into everything,

79
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,569
not only will it not help,

80
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,609
you will even get hurt and lectured.

81
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,171
Please, refrain yourself
from doing that.

82
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,039
This was your favourite place once.

83
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,017
It feels familiar, does it?

84
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,640
Does it remind you of something?

85
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,402
Rong Le.

86
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,487
Back in the days,

87
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,054
you love to brew tea in this room.

88
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:39,616
You were great at brewing tea.

89
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,588
No one in the whole palace
can best your skills.

90
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,300
Let's give it a try.

91
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,511
You should try too.

92
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,976
How is it?

93
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:43,060
See? You may have lost your memories,

94
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,000
but I think...

95
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:48,950
the muscle memories
for your interest still remain.

96
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,678
Rong Le, don't worry about this.

97
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,746
Everything will be back to normal.

98
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,973
These are your favourite desserts.

99
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:05,255
Give it a try.

100
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,582
It's okay.

101
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,051
One step at a time.

102
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,196
Let me play you a song.

103
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,899
It was once the song
you love the most.

104
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,677
You always asked me
to play it for you.

105
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,645
I always think...

106
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,370
the time we spent playing
melodies and brewing tea...

107
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,823
were the happiest moments of our life.

108
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,527
So that reminiscence does not linger,

109
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,832
so that sorrow never lasts.

110
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,597
Why is this written
in different handwriting?

111
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,729
Your Highness.

112
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,262
Your Highness, it's time
to take your medicine.

113
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,359
Ling Yue.

114
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,456
Can you tell if I wrote this poem?

115
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,220
Yes, you wrote this.

116
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:25,347
I was there when you wrote this.

117
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,436
All right, Your Highness.

118
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,579
Come on, finish this medicine.

119
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,740
I will drink it later.

120
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:38,528
The Empress Dowager arrives!

121
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,807
Come on, Your Highness.
We should be kneeling.

122
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,968
Arrest her.

123
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:09,944
What do you want?
Let go of me!

124
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,318
Why are you arresting me?

125
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,175
The alliance of Western Qi and
the Northern Realm is a reality.

126
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,460
You are going to the Northern Realm
whether you like it or not!

127
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,001
Seize her!

128
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,660
Your Majesty.

129
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,288
Mother, please calm down.

130
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,303
Rong Le broke the rules
because she has amnesia.

131
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,736
She must fulfil this marriage
with or without her memories.

132
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,059
Mother, the Northern Realm
is far from here.

133
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,556
She might never have a chance
to return if she leaves.

134
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,780
Rong Le is hurt and
suffering from injury.

135
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:49,061
It's only reasonable
if she refuses to go.

136
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,804
As for the marriage arrangement,

137
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,668
maybe we should delay it.

138
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,729
The army of Chen is advancing
on our borders.

139
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,313
There are still skirmishes
within our land.

140
00:14:58,436 --> 00:14:59,888
We have no means
to fight the enemies.

141
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,100
The fate of this nation
is hanging by the thread.

142
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:04,104
If we ally with the Northern Realm,

143
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,224
Chen will be pincered
by both of our nations.

144
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,881
They will retreat tactically.

145
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,846
I simply don't understand.

146
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:14,161
Why are you still hesitating
on making the decision?

147
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,782
As for the war with Chen,

148
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,931
I will come up with a strategy.

149
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,781
But Rong Le is suffering
from wounds and amnesia.

150
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,279
The matter with the marriage...

151
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,353
needs more time to be considered.

152
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:28,196
In the end, it's all about her.

153
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,239
I was kind enough to spare your life
and crowned you the princess.

154
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,962
Now, I still have the power to
make you die a slow death.

155
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,134
Mother, please show mercy.

156
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,272
The date for the wedding
is a week from now.

157
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:52,183
I shall order the servant to place
that poison wine in the main hall.

158
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,046
Mother.

159
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:56,095
Why must you do this?

160
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:59,888
You can either send her on a
litter to the Northern Realm...

161
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,850
or you can prepare for
my funeral a week from now.

162
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,871
The choice is yours.

163
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,059
Your Majesty.

164
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,341
Rong Le?

165
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,042
Rong Le?

166
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,259
-What do you want?
-Don't be afraid.

167
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:39,691
I will not send you away
for a marriage alliance.

168
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,800
I will sneak you out of here now.

169
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:51,738
Fear not.

170
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,180
I am taking you to a place.

171
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,820
Once you are there,

172
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,957
everything will be clear to you.

173
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,263
You lived here for quite a while once.

174
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,212
You liked this place.

175
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,772
Do you like it?

176
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,180
So that reminiscence does not linger,

177
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:21,887
so that sorrow never lasts.

178
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,001
How do you know?

179
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,272
Are you suspecting that...

180
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,553
these words weren't
written by your hands?

181
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,179
Come with me.

182
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,440
These handwritings
seem similar to mine.

183
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,839
The writings on the wall are mine.

184
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,187
Rong Le, you were very fond
of my handwriting.

185
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,146
You always tried to copy
the way I write.

186
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,763
The words on these papers...

187
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,311
are the writings you copied...

188
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,563
while you were having free time.

189
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:42,692
This little hut does
feel familiar to me.

190
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,372
If I were a delicate princess
that grew up in the palace,

191
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,068
why does it feel so alien to me?

192
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,389
You were born and raised in
the Cold Harem.

193
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:58,414
Your mother was a peasant
with mesmerizing beauty.

194
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,614
But he offended my father
and was banished.

195
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:03,899
She was already pregnant with you.

196
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:07,533
Eight months later, she gave birth
to you in the Cold Harem.

197
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:12,844
That is why the Empress Dowager
was so mean to me.

198
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,684
She went through some accident.

199
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:17,458
Her face was scarred.

200
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,132
It changed her personality as well.

201
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:25,645
I see.

202
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,129
Rong Le, you suffered a lot
in the past.

203
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,778
But you were stubborn.

204
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,748
A royal guard once received
the kindness of your mother.

205
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:43,170
During your time in the Cold Harem,

206
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,686
you secretly learned some
martial arts from him.

207
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,768
So, I wasn't some kind of
delicate lady at all.

208
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:53,495
That is why I have so many
calluses on my hand.

209
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,128
When we first met each other,

210
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,852
we were still children.

211
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,195
I remember you said that...

212
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:07,987
if anyone ever tries to pick on me,

213
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,715
you would be the first to
stand up for me.

214
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,455
Why didn't you tell me any
of these earlier?

215
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,940
Rong Le.

216
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,201
I don't really want you to remember
these unpleasant memories.

217
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,389
But I never thought...

218
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,521
you would grew suspicious of me.

219
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,252
The genesis of thoughts
is nothing but an illusion.

220
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,684
You need to trust your heart.

221
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,083
You must believe that...

222
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,367
I am the person...

223
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,657
that wishes to see you happy the most.

224
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,425
Rong Le.

225
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,783
These were your favourite flowers.

226
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,369
What's wrong?
Are you all right?

227
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:14,637
-Are you all right?
-I am fine.

228
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,020
Your Majesty!

229
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,553
Your Majesty, I must
send you back now.

230
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,455
Take Rong Le with you.

231
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,704
You are severely wounded,
we must go now!

232
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,703
Take Rong Le with you and go!

233
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,207
Yes.

234
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:40,275
Are you all right?

235
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,288
Brother! Wake up!

236
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,143
Brother! Xiao Sha,

237
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:48,401
head back to the palace!
Hurry up!

238
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,719
Yes!

239
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,841
Your Majesty wished to cheer
Princess Rong Le up...

240
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:28,116
and even took the risk
of sneaking her out of the palace.

241
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,630
But you were ambushed by
the assassins of Chen.

242
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,805
Are you happy now?

243
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:38,586
Take Xiao Sha out of here.

244
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:40,205
Punish him with eighty beatings.

245
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:42,764
Thank you for sparing my life.

246
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,558
Stop.

247
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:51,053
Come with me.

248
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,384
As of now, the land is in turmoil.

249
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,183
War ravages the nation.

250
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,220
The land of Qi is not
rich with resources.

251
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,030
Our army is weak.

252
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,660
The national treasury is
almost empty because of the war.

253
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,145
We should be having peace
to recover from the loss.

254
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,091
But as you can see now,

255
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:42,127
all the new recruits in the army...

256
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,690
are either too old or ill for battle.

257
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:50,178
Sending them to face the force
of Wei and Chen...

258
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,234
is as good as a suicide mission.

259
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,411
It's either the marriage...

260
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,689
or the war with enemies?

261
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,716
Correct.

262
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:10,265
If you can feel no guilt while
they are sent to their deaths,

263
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:13,652
if you could bear to see
His Majesty fight for this nation...

264
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:15,880
despite all the pain he is carrying...

265
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:21,142
and in the end has his head
hanging over the city gate,

266
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,326
then I hope...

267
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,529
you could live to be
a witness of this tragedy.

268
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,215
Why did you come back?

269
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,864
It would be nearly impossible
to leave the palace again.

270
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,801
Drink the medicine.

271
00:27:46,073 --> 00:27:49,537
Your Majesty, we are short
on troops and crops.

272
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,818
The people are running
out of resources.

273
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,564
The marriage alliance with
the Northern Realm can save us.

274
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,949
Your Majesty, the marriage is
the best viable plan we have.

275
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,908
If Your Majesty is unwilling
to give up the Princess,

276
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,799
I shall gladly send
my daughter instead.

277
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:06,423
I cannot allow that!

278
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,319
Silence, all of you!

279
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,488
The peace of Qi...

280
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,740
is not to be traded with
a woman's life!

281
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:20,051
Your Majesty, for the sake of Qi,

282
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,191
I shall send my daughter
in Her Highness' place.

283
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:25,074
I am willing to do the same.

284
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:26,341
You...

285
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,620
Need I remind you...

286
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,869
that I am the Princess of Qi!

287
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,987
If anyone is going, it should be me.

288
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,580
Brother.

289
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:57,777
I heard the Northern Realm
is wealthy and powerful.

290
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,581
They have an abundance of resources.

291
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:02,651
Rather than listening to
all the officers' complaints...

292
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,321
and the Empress Dowager's
loathing, maybe I should go.

293
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:07,942
I might change my life for the better.

294
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,504
Brother, I made you some tea.

295
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,648
Try it out.

296
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,199
Come on.

297
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,956
Try it out.

298
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,020
Try it out.

299
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,900
Come on.

300
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,780
Is it good?

301
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:39,552
Indeed.

302
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,642
Rong Le.

303
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:52,967
Thank you.

304
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:00,261
Your Majesty, medicine for
Princess Rong Le.

305
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,780
Rong Le.

306
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,288
It's the advice from
the royal physician.

307
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,407
You need to take this medicine
every month regularly.

308
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:16,558
It helps to regain your memories.

309
00:30:57,811 --> 00:30:59,103
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.

310
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:02,191
Your Highness, look.

311
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,371
This bridal robe is beautiful.

312
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:06,451
Look at the fabric and its texture.

313
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,060
Your Highness, please forgive me.

314
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:16,446
I was thinking Your Highness
might miss His Majesty a lot.

315
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,218
I was trying to cheer you up...

316
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,320
so you won't be frustrated
by this arrangement.

317
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:22,238
Your Highness, please forgive me.

318
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,007
I know it's my mistake.

319
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:28,231
After we moved to the Northern Realm,

320
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,660
I wonder when will we be back again.

321
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,719
After our nation prospered,

322
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,861
you can come home eventually.

323
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,083
As for me,

324
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:39,769
I have been alone my entire life.

325
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,061
I can be a servant anywhere.

326
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:48,138
Ling Yue, while you are with me,

327
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,889
don't think of yourself as a servant.

328
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,783
Order by His Majesty.

329
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,028
As the good will of His Majesty...

330
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:19,819
for forming an alliance
with the Northern Realm,

331
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:24,352
Princess Rong Le shall be sent for
the sake of the marriage alliance.

332
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,186
In hope that Prince Li of
Northern Realm, Zong Zhen Wu You...

333
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,195
and the Elder Princess of Qi,
Princess Rong Le...

334
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,474
can live in harmony,

335
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:35,939
and lead a life happily ever after.

336
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,448
The end.

337
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,888
At ease.

338
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,312
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

339
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:19,232
I carry this jade pendant
ever since I was a child.

340
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,609
Take this with you.

341
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:25,501
It shall keep you safe for me.

342
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,648
Brother, remember not to
stress yourself too hard.

343
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,854
Take care of yourself.

344
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,478
-Xiao Sha.
-Yes!

345
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,388
From now on,

346
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,671
you shall be Princess Rong Le's
personal bodyguard.

347
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:42,899
Heed her orders.

348
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,086
Keep her safe.

349
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,216
I shall protect Her Highness
to the day I die.

350
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,792
I bid you farewell, Brother.

351
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,496
Rong Le.

352
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:33,192
I heard the man Princess Rong Le
is going to marry...

353
00:35:33,323 --> 00:35:35,031
is Prince Li of the Northern Realm.

354
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:37,456
He is the favourite
son of the Emperor.

355
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:40,852
I heard he has a dashing look
and strong figure.

356
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,377
Lian Xin, if Prince Li
is such a great person,

357
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,791
why isn't he married yet until now?

358
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,060
Well, I don't know.

359
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,468
Prince Li of Northern Realm,
Zong Zhen Wu You...

360
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,099
may be living in seclusion...

361
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,390
and rarely interferes with
matter of Imperial Court,

362
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,942
but according to our spies
in Northern Realm,

363
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,504
Prince Li is actually...

364
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:12,826
a man of great intelligence
and tactics.

365
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,248
Once, General Fu Chou
of Northern Realm...

366
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,511
pacified the skirmish at southern
outskirts with 30 thousand soldiers...

367
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,413
while the enemy was strong
with over a hundred thousand warriors.

368
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,677
He overcame the enemy
that outnumbered them.

369
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:30,950
It was all thanks to
Prince Li's strategy.

370
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,735
Maybe being married
to this man is not so bad.

371
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,442
Your Highness, that mask
cannot be removed if you wear it.

372
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:50,464
It could be a bad omen.

373
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,781
The sedan of Princess
Rong Le has arrived.

374
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:15,132
I, Yang Wei, welcome the arrival
of Princess Rong Le.

375
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:19,240
Why isn't Prince Li here
to welcome the bride himself?

376
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,087
Well...

377
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,466
A moment, please.

378
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:25,780
Princess Rong Le travelled
all the way here.

379
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,148
Yet you refuse to welcome her
into your palace.

380
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,771
You are clearly looking down on us.

381
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:33,128
We are starting to
doubt your sincerity...

382
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,579
for the marriage alliance
between our nations.

383
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,636
Please, don't take this wrongly.

384
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,020
His Highness has work to see to
at this moment.

385
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,128
He couldn't manage to come here
in time for the welcome.

386
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:48,059
Please, we apologize for this.

387
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,524
Prince Chen arrives!

388
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,749
Your Highness.

389
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,391
At ease.

390
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,823
So, Princess Rong Le from
Western Qi is in the sedan?

391
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,969
Greetings, Prince Chen.

392
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:16,127
I heard rumours about your
hideous look and odd temper.

393
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:19,500
Which is why you are yet
to be married until now.

394
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:23,825
But surprisingly, you do
have a pleasant voice.

395
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,877
Lian Xin.

396
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:36,744
I appreciate the praise, Prince Chen.

397
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:39,586
Perhaps my voice is the only
aspect of me that is decent.

398
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,262
Rumour has it you are
ruthless and stubborn.

399
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:44,855
You are a lady without manner.

400
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,573
From what I see here,
that might not be the case.

401
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,837
At least you do possess the manner
a princess should have.

402
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,210
At least you know your place here.

403
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:54,984
Your Highness.

404
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,511
I welcomed Princess Rong Le's
bridal sedan.

405
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,012
I was hoping Your Highness
would set out...

406
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,848
to welcome our honourable bride.

407
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:06,021
If my brother doesn't want her here,
nothing can be done.

408
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,570
Trust me, you might as well
just go back.

409
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,481
You know the temper
of Wu You well enough.

410
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:11,946
If you anger him,

411
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:14,496
-I doubt I can save your neck.
-But...

412
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,774
Order from the Emperor, welcome
Princess Rong Le to the palace.

413
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:58,687
I am Princess Rong Le
of Western Qi.

414
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:00,776
It's my honour to meet Your Majesty.

415
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,020
At ease, Princess.

416
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Rise.

417
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,028
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

418
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:11,073
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.

419
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:17,197
Pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.

420
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,864
I wonder why you are
wearing that mask.

421
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:22,888
This is the custom of Qi.

422
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,043
The bridegroom must take off
this mask himself on wedding day.

423
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,301
I hope Your Majesty is not offended.

424
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:33,492
In that case, it won't be an issue.

425
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:38,726
Your Majesty, Prince Li is...

426
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:40,575
What happened?

427
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,478
The servants at his manor said that...

428
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,542
Prince Li is taking a rest.

429
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,407
His Highness won't be coming here.

430
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:51,821
-Wu Yu.
-Yes.

431
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:55,627
You and Captain Xiang of Royal Guards
will go to the manor.

432
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,050
Bring him here with
any means necessary.

433
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,458
Should you fail, there will be
no place for you in Imperial Court.

434
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,408
Are you serious?
I don't need to be here again?

435
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,872
You will spend your life guarding
the royal tomb in western county.

436
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:11,913
Father.

437
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,114
You know Wu You's temper well.

438
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,002
He is just...

439
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,496
Fine, your wish is my command.

440
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,159
Father, Wu You is here.

441
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,407
Prince Li arrives!
