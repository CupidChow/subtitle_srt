Episode 13

3
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:35,905
He is the first I trust...

4
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,839
after I woke up and lost my memories.

5
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:43,178
I never thought he would abandon me,
deceive me and set me up.

6
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,976
I am still struggling.

7
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:47,777
Should I hate him...

8
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:49,614
or should I trust him?

9
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:50,831
Your Highness.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,160
Perhaps your brother
has his own reason to do so.

11
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:57,582
I dug up some information after that.

12
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:59,740
Five years ago,
when I first reach Northern Realm,

13
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,704
I once used the Kite to
send letters to General Fu.

14
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:05,632
During that time, General Fu
was just a sergeant.

15
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:09,004
At first, I was curious too.

16
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:12,038
Why did we need to use the Kite
to send a letter to a sergeant?

17
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,799
That's right. I heard it with
my own ears today about...

18
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,557
Fu Chou becoming the General
of Defence in a few years' time.

19
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,650
All of these...

20
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,392
are related to my brother
and Western Qi for sure.

21
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:28,407
Behind these complex
interests and disputes,

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,600
lies the unfathomable heart
of His Majesty.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,755
It's not something that I can guess.

24
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,354
Long Yue.

25
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,539
People like you who are in the Kite...

26
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,611
left your hometown and
buried your names.

27
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,801
And all of you sacrificed
almost everything.

28
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,595
Have you ever wonder...

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
whether or not it is worth it?

30
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:55,005
I lost my parents since young
and I was brought up by Kite.

31
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:58,864
Loyalty to His Majesty and Western Qi
has become our belief.

32
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,340
So,

33
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,583
I have never thought of this question.

34
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,414
When I was walking
on the street just now,

35
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,957
I kept on thinking that...

36
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,687
if did I do something wrong.

37
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:17,512
I'm prepared to sacrifice everything
for Western Qi by coming here.

38
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,576
I don't mind to sacrifice love.

39
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,407
But when I think about...

40
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,612
marrying a complete stranger,

41
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,393
I still can't accept it.

42
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,317
Princess Rong Le.

43
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:37,749
If you can't accept all of these,

44
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,154
then you should follow your heart.

45
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,156
If you are willing to trust Prince Li,

46
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:46,332
then you should...

47
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,680
forget about
your impeding identities...

48
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:52,186
to flee to a faraway place and
keep live together forever.

49
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,748
But I don't know...

50
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,408
what is it that he wants.

51
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:11,647
My lady.

52
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,113
Prince Li is here.

53
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,830
Alright, you may go out now.

54
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,233
Alright.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,953
" The Book of Mountains and Rivers "

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,209
I recall that...

57
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,823
we had a deal last night.

58
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,903
I said that I'll be coming to
the teahouse to meet you today.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,017
Although it's already late,

60
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,589
I will not break the promise
that I made to you.

61
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,849
" The Manor of Prince Li "

62
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,741
I'm fine now.
No need to worry about me.

63
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,909
Can you tell me...

64
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,998
what had happened?

65
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,386
If you don't wish to say it,

66
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,206
then don't.

67
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:24,335
Wu You.

68
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,402
Have you ever been
tricked and set up...

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,139
by a person that you trust?

70
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:33,235
In this world,
who else will be able to trick me...

71
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,265
and set me up besides you?

72
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:39,110
I did hide something from you.

73
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,938
But I have no choice but to do that.

74
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,714
And I didn't do it to trick you
or to cause harm.

75
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,062
That's the reason you are able
to stand here and talk to me.

76
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:51,158
Man Yao, I don't know
what had happened to you.

77
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:54,201
But I had never seen you
so crestfallen before.

78
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,506
You once told me that...

79
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:01,996
the things that are
important to me today...

80
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,940
might one day become
a thorn in my heart.

81
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,346
I lost my faith.

82
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,631
I don't know how
to continue my life...

83
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,083
form this point onwards.

84
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,801
Do you trust me?

85
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,507
When my mother passed away,

86
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,069
I once thought that...

87
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
there will be no more light
in this world.

88
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:36,351
But I met you.

89
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:40,986
Man Yao, any sufferings,
no matter how great, will pass.

90
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,104
If your faith betrayed you,

91
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:46,401
you don't have to
worry about it at all.

92
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:49,896
Because it means that
it's not worthy to be your faith.

93
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,372
If you have nothing to believe in,

94
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,211
then believe in me.

95
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:59,289
My future will be your future.

96
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,869
Our future?

97
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,952
When I first saw you in
the Moon Embrace Teahouse,

98
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,360
you were calm and collected
when you faced that assassination.

99
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,466
From then on,
you were already in my mind.

100
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,910
When I met you the second time,
you were willing to cut off...

101
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:17,508
your arm in order to save Chen Yu.

102
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
I have never seen another girl...

103
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,924
with so much passion and
courage as you do.

104
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:24,766
After that, during
my mother's death anniversary,

105
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:28,426
I went to Moon Embrace Teahouse
without any recollection of it.

106
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,602
Now that I think of it,
I think it's fate.

107
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,246
From the moment I hug you...

108
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,840
in order to move away
from the assassin,

109
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,003
in my heart, I knew that...

110
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,469
you are destined to be...

111
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:44,956
different from how I see others.

112
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,460
Wu You.

113
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:50,441
When my mother and teacher
passed away after one another,

114
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,510
I really thought that...

115
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:55,046
there is no more hope in my life.

116
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,717
But you came to me.

117
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:00,312
You are the one who had
awaken my fighting spirit.

118
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,752
You made me remember
my aspiration and my duty.

119
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:09,761
Unfortunately,

120
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:12,235
war is now a constant in this world.

121
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,016
Because of it, many people...

122
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,661
have lost their home and
the lands are barren.

123
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,485
So, I have to change
this world for a better one.

124
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,746
I really hope that one day,

125
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,323
there will be no more war.

126
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,844
And the people can live in peace.

127
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,233
It would be so nice.

128
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,071
In order to achieve that,

129
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,830
my teacher used to
work his heart out...

130
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,170
to initiate the
people-based transformation.

131
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,960
But too bad.

132
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,022
That day,
I heard you talking about it....

133
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,400
with His Majesty in the palace, right?

134
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,315
As long as you can find the book,

135
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,199
you can reinitiate the
people-based transformation.

136
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,769
Not only this transformation
can benefit the people and the nation,

137
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,058
it can change the whole world.

138
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,140
My father promised that...

139
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:07,851
as long as I can find the book,

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
he'll give me freedom
to choose who I marry.

141
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:11,902
After you marry me,

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,513
we'll carry out
the transformation together.

143
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,851
When the world is in a safer place...

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,257
and the people are living in peace,

145
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,477
I promise you that...

146
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,617
I'll travel the world with you.

147
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:25,773
And we can enjoy
all the beautiful scenery.

148
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,077
How about that?

149
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,382
Will that day really come?

150
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:31,865
Yes.

151
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:41,109
At first, I thought that my future
is shrouded in darkness.

152
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:44,256
Now that you tell me all of these,

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,400
I feel that I can see the light again.

154
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,700
Wu You, can I...

155
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,161
really trust you?

156
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:56,209
Trust me.

157
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,879
I trust you.

158
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:09,886
Marry me.

159
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,483
I'll start to prepare for
our wedding tomorrow.

160
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,830
<i>You are in my thoughts for so long
without you knowing about it.</i>

161
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:49,328
<i>Who is going to talk about
this love between us first?</i>

162
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:55,830
<i>Luckily, I am attentive to myself.</i>

163
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,473
<i>That's why I let you
turn back the time.</i>

164
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,309
<i>The western wind is preventing you
to accept the spring here.</i>

165
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,127
<i>But I'm still waiting under
the rain with you.</i>

166
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:22,772
<i>Although the future is unpredictable,</i>

167
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:29,008
<i>I'll do my best to create
a story together with you.</i>

168
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,625
<i>Half of autumn is gone.</i>

169
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,714
<i>And it's still a long way with winter.</i>

170
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,332
<i>But I'm already waiting for
spring together with you.</i>

171
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,757
<i>In order to preserve your naivety,</i>

172
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,829
<i>I'll fight for the world
to be peaceful again.</i>

173
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:59,382
<i>This chill will bridge the path
for two lovers who are apart.</i>

174
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,513
Little Xun.

175
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:10,845
What is it, Your Majesty?

176
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,731
Bring me wine.

177
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:15,543
Your Majesty, don't drink too much.

178
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:19,138
Bring me wine.

179
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

180
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:35,960
<i>Although we are both against it,</i>

181
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:42,787
<i>our love is still sprouting.</i>

182
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:49,345
<i>I might sound love-struck,
but I can't help but to say it to you.</i>

183
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:56,507
<i>Fate will tear down my mask for me.</i>

184
00:13:56,653 --> 00:14:02,809
<i>Through the mirror,
I saw that you are so quiet.</i>

185
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:09,630
<i>So, I carved your name on my heart.</i>

186
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,190
Wu You.

187
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,177
I'll leave everything to you then.

188
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,898
<i>I'll tell you that I've never left.</i>

189
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:26,561
<i>I have gone through life...</i>

190
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:29,919
<i>in one day's time.</i>

191
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:36,502
<i>And you are still
the only one I'm waiting for.</i>

192
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:42,743
<i>Although there are a lot to take in,
I don't want to live in regret.</i>

193
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:49,394
<i>Because of this love,
I have found my happiness again.</i>

194
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:03,207
<i>Although there are a lot to take in,</i>

195
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:06,121
<i>I don't want to live in regret.</i>

196
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,688
<i>Because of this love,
I have found my happiness again.</i>

197
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,451
<i>No matter what,</i>

198
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:23,516
<i>we won't be apart.</i>

199
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:30,072
" The Book of Mountains and Rivers "

200
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,844
Your Highness.
You didn't sleep for the whole night?

201
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,587
You should rest.

202
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:45,365
Leng Yan.

203
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,761
Go to the city and prepare
the best things for me.

204
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:50,682
I'm going to get married.

205
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,228
So, naturally, I'll need to
have a grand wedding.

206
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,600
-Your Highness, this...
-No, before the wedding,

207
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,440
I want you to take care of
all the other...

208
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,319
marriage customs
and protocols as well.

209
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:06,289
If this is about other things,
I'm willing to do it at any cost.

210
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:08,682
But you have never been a fan
of over-elaborated formalities.

211
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,871
I don't care. You have three days.

212
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,298
You'll be held responsible for it
if it's not done properly.

213
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:15,905
Yes, Your Highness.

214
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:58,693
Are you really going to leave
just like Ms Man Yao?

215
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:01,858
From now on,

216
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,986
take good care of this place.

217
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,720
Don't let Ms Man Yao and me down.

218
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:08,474
But...

219
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:11,086
Alright then. Don't worry.

220
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:14,256
I'll take a good care of this teahouse
and wait for your return.

221
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,791
I heard that you have been looking
for this score for quite a while.

222
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,071
Ms Man Yao has asked me to pass it
to you after her men found it for her.

223
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:31,292
Before this,
she kept on telling me that...

224
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:34,434
you are a noble and unsullied person.
You should forget about the past.

225
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,141
Don't limit yourself by staying...

226
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,034
in this teahouse to
repay her kindness.

227
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:40,612
Instrumentalists like you...

228
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,775
are meant to live freely
in this world.

229
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,107
Not only has she given me a new life,

230
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,736
she is the one
who understands me the most.

231
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,749
Just that I don't know where to go
now that she has left.

232
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,409
Everybody will find their own path.

233
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:58,268
Just look at me. I'm going to
go out for an adventure...

234
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:01,045
in case I can't do it anymore
when I'm old.

235
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,085
Let's go.

236
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,315
-We'll see you out.
-Alright.

237
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,355
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

238
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:19,406
Where is the princess?

239
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,070
Who is the princess?

240
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:25,442
The princess is already gone.
You won't be able to find her.

241
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,668
If we can't find her,
none of you can leave as well.

242
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,800
Seal off this place and search it.
Arrest the rest of the suspects.

243
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Yes.

244
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,720
Wu You.

245
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,028
Wu You.

246
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,520
When I met Leng Yan just now,
I heard that you're getting married.

247
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,509
This is the first time Leng Yan
asked for my help so humbly.

248
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,344
Did the sun just set on the east?

249
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,297
When I pressed him for answer,
he said that you're getting married.

250
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,240
Congratulations to you, Wu You.

251
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,053
Finally, the beauty is in your hand.

252
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,131
Don't worry.
I'll invite you to my wedding.

253
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,460
My method is great, right?
I told you.

254
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,280
As long as you put your heart to it,
you can have any women you want.

255
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,284
As long as you use a little trick,

256
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,880
Man Yao will follow you
around obediently.

257
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,412
I never thought that...

258
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,341
a delicate lady like her...

259
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:29,698
will be so sentimental.

260
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,000
She entrust me with
everything just like that.

261
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:36,866
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?

262
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,247
Wu You, you found the book.

263
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,902
Didn't Old Man Xin say that
he couldn't find it?

264
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,065
Don't tell me that Man Yao
has given it to you.

265
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,343
She really gave it to you?

266
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,251
How did she get her hands on it?

267
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,080
During the lantern festival,

268
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,142
I heard that someone sneaked
into Qin Yong's manor.

269
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:03,846
And that person fought with Leng Yan.

270
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,600
Is that her?

271
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:08,406
That's not right.

272
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:11,115
That day, you went to the
lantern festival together with her.

273
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:15,542
Did you already know that
the place will be empty on that day?

274
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,880
You wanted to test Man Yao to see if
she knew the hiding spot of the book.

275
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,700
You did it on purpose.

276
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,560
No wonder.

277
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:27,635
Wu You, no wonder you were
so out of yourself that day.

278
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,599
You even allowed me to go to
the House of Fragrance.

279
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,587
And even that Leng Yan went
to party with the guards.

280
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,560
You were giving her a chance
to sneak into the manor.

281
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:37,806
Wu You, you did that
on purpose too, right?

282
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:42,266
Just like I said, Wu You.

283
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,803
The path to a woman's secret
is through her heart.

284
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,880
I just never thought that
you'll be able to make her...

285
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,445
fall in love with you so fast and
willingly give the book to you.

286
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,080
But you had caused me to feel
so guilty about this for so long.

287
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,880
So, everything is under your control.

288
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,240
Wu Yu, I'm not...

289
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,347
Wu You, with this book,

290
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,400
nobody can tie you down
anymore, right? Not even father.

291
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,400
It doesn't matter if Man Yao
is a spy from Western Qi.

292
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:07,883
She has contributed to this nation.
What do you plan to do with her?

293
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,610
Don't tell me that you have
truly fallen in love with her.

294
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,479
-Of course I...
-Of course it's not true.

295
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
Nothing is true.

296
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,400
Man Yao.

297
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,416
You used the rain as reason to
hold me in the manor for a few days.

298
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,112
And you shared the information
about the book with me.

299
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:31,898
Was that part of your plan?

300
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,304
You took me to the library
in the manor to enjoy the scenery...

301
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,265
so that I can find the secret room.
Was that part of your plan too?

302
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,305
-Man Yao.
-If you deny it,

303
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:43,638
why did you admit that
it was your plan...

304
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,593
to lure me into your eagle's
surveillance area with news about...

305
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:50,513
assassinating the Emperor of Qi
when we were in the hunting ground?

306
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:51,679
Yes.

307
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:54,724
Those are all my plans.

308
00:22:57,634 --> 00:22:59,594
I have never considered...

309
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,080
The Book of Mountains and Rivers
to be more important than you.

310
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:09,544
Wu You, this book is fake.

311
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,385
Man Yao.

312
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,920
Things have reached this stage.

313
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,920
You don't have to pretend anymore.

314
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,663
All of you had used
all kinds of dirty tricks...

315
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,920
to get this book from me.

316
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:46,878
Since you have already gotten it,
why bother lying to me now?

317
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,020
I never cared about that book.

318
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,028
I care only about you.

319
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:00,449
Do you think that I'll trust you?

320
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,760
You are just like them.

321
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:05,208
On the surface,
you say that you care for me.

322
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:08,715
But you are actually setting me up
and using me to get what you want.

323
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,774
I fell into your traps
again and again.

324
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,705
Man Yao.

325
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:40,959
<i>I don't think that we will be
talking anymore after this.</i>

326
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,587
<i>We have been through so much.</i>

327
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:48,099
<i>Why didn't I realise it sooner?</i>

328
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,040
<i>My heart is bleeding
when I saw you leaving me.</i>

329
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,493
Look at this, Wu You.
Everything is jumbled up.

330
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:58,234
This is not even
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

331
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,507
<i>Although we haven't known each other
for long, I already miss you so.</i>

332
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:10,987
<i>Do you dare to...</i>

333
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:15,574
<i>face the possible truth?</i>

334
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:20,202
If you had gone
according to my plan...

335
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,690
and didn't fall into the honey trap
of Zongzheng Wu You,

336
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,957
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

337
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:27,264
As long as you give me the book,

338
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:29,256
I promise you.

339
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,143
After you marry Fu Chou for one year,

340
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,577
I'll bring you back to Western Qi.

341
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,516
Any sufferings,
no matter how great, will pass.

342
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,680
If your faith betrayed you,

343
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,380
you don't have to
worry about it at all.

344
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,433
Because it means that
it's not worthy to be your faith.

345
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,335
If you have nothing to believe in,

346
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,320
then believe in me.

347
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,379
My future...

348
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,799
will be your future.

349
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,575
Just like I said, Wu You.

350
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,036
The path to a woman's secret
is through her heart.

351
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:09,155
I just never thought that
you'll be able to make her...

352
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,560
fall in love with you so fast and
willingly give the book to you.

353
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,000
Yes.

354
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,968
Those are all my plans.

355
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:25,221
<i>After all of those hardships,
we are no longer young.</i>

356
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:28,738
<i>I'm doomed to live
in loneliness forever.</i>

357
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,986
<i>It's bad but I can't help it.</i>

358
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,520
<i>Are you suffering just like me?
Are in turmoil as well?</i>

359
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:46,382
<i>After all the boom and bust,
I have lost all hope.</i>

360
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:02,123
Where have you been for today?

361
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,925
I'm so worried about you.

362
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:16,611
<i>Let's drink to forget our worries
and bottoms up...</i>

363
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:21,312
<i>for you who have turned grey.</i>

364
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,221
Did the princess pass anything to you?

365
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,839
No.

366
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:35,021
The princess has
been gone for a full whole day.

367
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,787
When will she be back?

368
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:50,365
Sir, we received a decree...

369
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:54,226
saying that the princess
will be marrying a general.

370
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:56,126
Is that true?

371
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,385
Sir Xiao.

372
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,677
Why are you locking me up?

373
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,577
Open the door!
Why did you lock me in?

374
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,372
Sir Xiao.

375
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,871
Come...

376
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,009
Sir, we have already switched out
the guards who are...

377
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,193
in the outer perimeter of the
Princess Manor just like you asked.

378
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,831
Now, this manor is under the control
of His Majesty's guards.

379
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:44,416
Arrest everybody in this manor.

380
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,826
And you'll be fully responsible
for this manor from now on.

381
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:51,988
If anything about
the princess is leaked out,

382
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,138
you'll be held responsible for it.

383
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:56,668
Yes!

384
00:29:01,277 --> 00:29:02,357
This...

385
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,556
Wu...

386
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:20,095
Your Highness, the Moon Embrace
Teahouse is closed to all today.

387
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,333
I have already searched all possible
places that Man Yao might be in.

388
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:25,564
But I couldn't even
find a trace of her.

389
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:29,920
-What about Western Qi?
-Everything seems to be normal.

390
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,701
They are still preparing for
the princess's wedding.

391
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:36,088
I think they still don't know that
Miss Man Yao has given you the book.

392
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:39,704
If they know,
there'll be more danger for her.

393
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,392
Ask Minister Wu to help you.

394
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:43,701
We have to make sure that she is safe.

395
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:45,347
Yes.

396
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,719
Wu You.

397
00:29:58,012 --> 00:29:59,132
Wu You.

398
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,718
I didn't mean to let
the cat out of the bag.

399
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,192
But, do you really don't mind that...

400
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:07,289
she had used this
fake book to test you out?

401
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,661
" The Manor of the General "

402
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,531
Brother.

403
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:27,858
I want to go home.

404
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:31,888
I want to go home.

405
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:33,556
I...

406
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,159
You are awake.

407
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,039
Take your medicine.

408
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,587
Where is my brother?

409
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,132
He is not here.

410
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,791
Where are you going?

411
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,000
Where can you go?

412
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,656
You know very well that...

413
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:35,122
you have no room to retreat anymore.

414
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,440
You came out from Prince Li's manor
like a living dead.

415
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:42,208
He is looking all over
the place for you now.

416
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:43,827
Looks like...

417
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,728
something real bad has happened
between the both of you.

418
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:52,031
The teahouse is already sealed up and
the people inside are all arrested.

419
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,606
What did you do to
Long Yue and the others?

420
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,529
If I let you out now,

421
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,875
your brother and Prince Li
won't let go of them for sure.

422
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,193
You don't wish to cause harm to
Long Yue and the others, right?

423
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:27,483
If you dare touch my people,

424
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:31,346
I'll guarantee that
you'll get nothing.

425
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:33,471
You might have forgotten.

426
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:36,103
But there is no such thing
as 'your people'.

427
00:32:46,961 --> 00:32:48,441
Take this medicine.

428
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:03,787
Your best option...

429
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:05,953
is to stay here.

430
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:43,732
Any news?

431
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,360
General Fu is here to see you.

432
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,495
I don't want to see him.

433
00:33:48,664 --> 00:33:51,461
General Fu said that he's just
following order to go to...

434
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:53,948
each princes' manor to send out
his wedding invitation.

435
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:57,222
Let him in.

436
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,780
Greetings, Prince Li.

437
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:19,150
Prince Li, I'll be getting married
in two days' time.

438
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:22,800
I hope that you'll be able to
grace us with your presence.

439
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:25,977
Congratulations.

440
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:29,614
Recently, you have helped the court
by offering yourself for the wedding.

441
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:33,744
Now, you've became
the favourite of both emperors.

442
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,703
You are a talented man. And now,
you have the most ideal spouse.

443
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,440
You look radiant today.

444
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,647
I bet you are ecstatic that...

445
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:43,284
you've gotten everything you want.

446
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:47,157
I have to thank you for that.

447
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,107
If it wasn't for you who are so set
on rejecting that marriage,

448
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:54,706
I wouldn't have gotten
what I want so quickly.

449
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,607
Sometimes, your dream...

450
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,029
might not come true if it's too big.

451
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:10,600
Thank you for your warning,
Your Highness.

452
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,178
By the way,

453
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,848
this Man Yin Chamber is prepared
for Miss Man Yao, right?

454
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,996
I hope that I'll be able to
attend your wedding soon.

455
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,806
And I hope that
Miss Man Yao and you...

456
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,437
can get married in the near future.

457
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,275
Thank you for your blessing.

458
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:38,127
I still need to go to other manor
to send out my invitation.

459
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,860
I'll take my leave now.

460
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,336
Leng Yan. You have a lead?

461
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:59,361
There are only a few words from
the message sent by Minister Wu.

462
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:00,669
Tell me.

463
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,920
Miss Man Yao is in
the general's manor.

464
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:06,477
If that's the case,

465
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,817
why did Fu Chou come here just now?

466
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,481
Move aside.

467
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:20,062
Without the general's permission,
you can't step out from the room.

468
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:21,441
Please go back in.

469
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,886
Stop it.

470
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,536
General Fu.

471
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,338
Xiang Ying, leave us.

472
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:35,993
Alright.

473
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:40,647
You are still set on leaving?

474
00:36:40,837 --> 00:36:42,837
I won't let you control me.

475
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:44,764
I won't be your puppet.

476
00:36:48,012 --> 00:36:49,267
Go ahead then.

477
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,227
General Fu, Prince Li is here.

478
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:58,148
And he has the manor
circled with his guards.

479
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:02,199
Now, you have two choices.

480
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:03,971
First, you can go to him.

481
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:05,255
I won't stop you.

482
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:08,151
Second, do as I say...

483
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:10,476
and I'll send him away for you.

484
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,111
I don't want to see him.

485
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,613
Prepare a bath and
a change of clothes for this lady.

486
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,880
Yes.

487
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,538
I'm sorry that I didn't get
to welcome you sooner.

488
00:37:35,744 --> 00:37:37,664
Please don't blame for that.

489
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:39,204
No need to be so polite.

490
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,315
I've came uninvited
because of my wife.

491
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,491
I heard that she's here in your manor.

492
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,226
So, I've came to bring her back.

493
00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:50,384
Are you going to get married already?

494
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,591
Who is the lucky one?

495
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:56,152
But you said that your wife
is in my manor.

496
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:58,616
I'm afraid that you are
wrong about that.

497
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,913
If that's the case,
when I manage to locate her,

498
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:04,129
you'll know who she is.

499
00:38:04,504 --> 00:38:06,003
Guards, search the place.

500
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:08,065
-Search the place!
-Stop!

501
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:11,043
Insolent!

502
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:13,692
Wu You.

503
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:16,909
General Fu has invited me to
his manor to have a feast.

504
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,377
I never thought that you'll
come here to make a scene.

505
00:38:19,802 --> 00:38:21,060
According to the law,

506
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:23,814
without order from the Supreme Court,
no one can barge into...

507
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,520
the private manor of officers
with ranking six and above.

508
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:27,523
What do you think you are doing?

509
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,436
According to the law,

510
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,703
an officer cannot have an illicit
meeting with the wife of a royalty.

511
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,224
Why can't I search the place?

512
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:35,937
Wife of a royalty?

513
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:38,869
When did you have a wife?

514
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:41,593
Looks like you have no respect
for me anymore.

515
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:44,763
Even if our father is here today,

516
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,340
I won't let anyone stop me.

517
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:47,672
You...

518
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,240
As the sayings go,
meeting by chance is a rare thing.

519
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:52,005
How about this?

520
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:54,585
I've already prepared
a feast in my manor.

521
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:57,839
How about both of you
enjoy the feast first...

522
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,014
and after that, if you still want
to search my manor,

523
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,494
you can search it
after the feast is over.

524
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,109
What if I insist to search the place?

525
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:14,685
Then you'll be humiliating my country.

526
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:16,428
A bully.

527
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
First, you rejected
the marriage in the great hall.

528
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,281
You had humiliated Western Qi.

529
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,879
Now, as you wish,

530
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,235
I had chosen General Fu Chou instead.

531
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:30,194
In two days' time, I'll be marrying
into this General's Manor.

532
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,201
But you are making up excuses
to search this place.

533
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,669
You have continued to
show no respect to us.

534
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:39,347
Do you really think that...

535
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:42,464
the Western Qi is afraid of you?

536
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,860
Looks like you've gotten more
and more piercing with your words.

537
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,499
This marriage is too rushed.

538
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:51,177
I can only lightly decorate
the Tranquil Garden...

539
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,700
according to Western Qi's style
for the wedding.

540
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:57,827
I'm not sure if it's
to the princess's liking.

541
00:39:58,158 --> 00:40:00,713
So, I had invited her over
to take a look at it.

542
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:04,164
I never thought that
she'll really come.

543
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,927
You are so meticulous
and caring for me.

544
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,040
Compared to those
conventional courtesies,

545
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:11,628
I'm more touched by your actions.

546
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:15,236
In this world, there are
some who are short-sighted,

547
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:16,997
shallow and rude.

548
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:19,242
But I'm very lucky...

549
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:22,201
to be able to meet a person
who is as generous as you...

550
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,986
and one who is of the same mind.

551
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,307
You had made such a scene
at the great hall...

552
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,680
just to wait for the arrival
of the General Fu, right?

553
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,450
Thank you for your compliment.

554
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,094
How about this?

555
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:39,236
Let me show both of you
around the manor.

556
00:40:39,463 --> 00:40:42,446
You can use that chance to look
for your wife too, Prince Li.

557
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:44,930
Let's go.

558
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:48,326
After you, Princess Rong Le.

559
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,124
Miss, this is the dress
and head accessory...

560
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,973
that the general
had prepared for you.

561
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:06,709
Let us put them on for you.
