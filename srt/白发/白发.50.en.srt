00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,260
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,824
Episode 50

3
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,455
Luo Yan.

4
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,290
Have you been outside for too long...

5
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:39,354
until you've forgotten
about your aspiration?

6
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,963
I haven't forgotten about it.

7
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,102
You once asked me...

8
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,388
about my wish.

9
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,619
My parents died in war.

10
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,885
I wish that there will be
no more war in this world.

11
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:53,848
You said that you have
the same wish as I have.

12
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:58,873
" The Books of Mountains and Rivers "

13
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,356
Now,

14
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,401
I choose to accept this alliance...

15
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,703
in order to fulfil that wish.

16
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,428
But this is against the act
of kindness and right conduct.

17
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,409
Kindness and right conduct?

18
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:17,412
What is kindness and right conduct?

19
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:21,304
Back then, when I had saved you,
kept you,

20
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:24,240
let you stay in the manor and
taught you how to read and fight,

21
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,545
that was kindness.

22
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:28,025
Because of me, you had stayed
in Northern Realm for years,

23
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:31,046
you had endured humiliation
until finally, you got the book.

24
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,659
That was right conduct.

25
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:35,852
Our original intention is to get
The Book of Mountains and Rivers...

26
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:38,511
and take over the world honourably.

27
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,769
But until now,

28
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,599
we still can't unearth
the secret of the book...

29
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,951
although we already
had it for one year.

30
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,101
We can't continue with
this path anymore.

31
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,093
We can't be stubborn about it anymore.

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,139
Luo Yan.

33
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:54,907
You are different from other woman.

34
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:56,621
So, you should know better that...

35
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,243
discarding smaller righteousness
for bigger righteousness...

36
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:02,188
is the best way for a person who
is meant to do great things.

37
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,243
Now,

38
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:08,155
someone has presented
this shortcut to us.

39
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,240
We can achieve
our aspiration with it...

40
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,918
while reducing the number of soldiers
that we have to sacrifice.

41
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,141
Why not do it?

42
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,285
But if we can't be righteous
in the smaller scale,

43
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:20,221
we can forget about
bigger righteousness.

44
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:24,190
You can have no qualm about
Prince Li and Rong Le's safety...

45
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,251
but you have to think about
your consort's feelings.

46
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:28,062
As long as you don't tell her,

47
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,495
she won't know about it.

48
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,618
But if you tell her,

49
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,324
then our friendship
for so many years...

50
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,053
will have to come to an end.

51
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,327
Your Highness.

52
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:53,454
I have been hiding something from you.

53
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:55,673
Rong Le is the descendant
of Qin family.

54
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:58,243
And she is the only one who knows
about the secret of the book.

55
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,325
So, you can't kill her.

56
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,575
That day, in the inn,

57
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,451
you were the one who
arranged for someone...

58
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,419
to disguise as me to
lure away the soldiers?

59
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,633
If I can issue an arrest warrant,

60
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,564
I can make sure that you
won't be caught for sure.

61
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:26,336
I wonder who are the people that
had disguised as the Seven Asuras.

62
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,559
They look exactly
the same on the surface.

63
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:30,838
But their martial art skills
are way off.

64
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,846
I had asked The Hidden Ones
to investigate about it.

65
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,634
If I'm not wrong,

66
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,761
they are from the Creed of Vengeance.

67
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:40,493
By the way, in the letter that you
had asked Xiao Sha to give me,

68
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,871
you said that something is
not right with Ling Yue.

69
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,783
From the moment she approaches Ya Li,

70
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,137
I already feel that
something is not right.

71
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm not sure about it yet.

72
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,433
But when we were in
the great hall back then,

73
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:54,589
it looked like she was defending me.

74
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,465
But actually,
she was twisting the truth.

75
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:58,365
Her words were not persuasive at all.

76
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:00,350
And she had planned...

77
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,285
Ya Li's death as well.

78
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,637
She had made sure that it'll be
impossible for me to justify myself.

79
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,257
Now, we are here in Chen together.

80
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,076
I want to see...

81
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,274
what other evil plans
the instigator behind her...

82
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,243
has for me.

83
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:15,868
I found out that...

84
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,191
that beau was sent into
the manor by Ling Yue.

85
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,690
A day before, he had murdered Chun Ni.

86
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:24,666
And then, he disguised as
Chun Ni to go into your room.

87
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,785
I'm right after all.

88
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,476
I treated her like my sister.

89
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,031
How could she snuff out a life...

90
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,992
in order to frame me?

91
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:37,179
She was sent here as your
maidservant for the marriage alliance.

92
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,117
I'm afraid that...

93
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,715
since the very beginning, she has
stayed with you with ulterior motives.

94
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,481
You have been together for two years.

95
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:47,222
But she can still do
such a cruel thing to you.

96
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:50,335
Looks like she doesn't
treat you like a sister.

97
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:52,581
Man Yao.

98
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,883
Once you have something to hold
against her, don't be soft-hearted.

99
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,110
The medicine is done?

100
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:09,527
Yes, it is.

101
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:12,916
Look at you. You've slimmed down out
of exhaustion for the past two days.

102
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:16,696
Give this to me.
I'll send it to the Princess.

103
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:18,982
Go back and rest up earlier.

104
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,958
You too.

105
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,254
-Who is it?
-It's me, Princess.

106
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,111
Come in.

107
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,904
Your Highness.

108
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,395
Princess, your medicine is done.

109
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:22,673
Continue to keep
an eye on her tonight.

110
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:25,097
-Don't let her come near here.
-I understand.

111
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,153
Wu You.

112
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,169
Actually, besides Ling Yue,

113
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:40,991
I saw the back of a person in...

114
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,829
Prince Zhen Bei's manor that day.

115
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,427
It looks like a person
that I know in the past.

116
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:46,889
Chen Yu?

117
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,491
You knew?

118
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,391
After she took away the book,

119
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,260
I had my suspicion.

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,148
Ning Qian Yi came to Zhongshan
in the name of alliance.

121
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,850
And he had gone more than once
to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

122
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,409
Before he came,
Chen Yu was still acting normal.

123
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:03,980
As soon as he left,

124
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:07,076
Chen Yu had kidnapped you and
forced me to give her the book.

125
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,069
That was too much of a coincidence.

126
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,228
I had asked The Hidden Ones
to track her as well.

127
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,534
And we found out that
she was last seen...

128
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,687
at the border of Chen.

129
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,108
I see.

130
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,127
I came here to Chen this time...

131
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,809
for another thing actually.

132
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,431
It is about the warhorse that
I had mentioned to you in the letter.

133
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:30,883
Chen is famous with their warhorse.

134
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:33,659
When Ning Qian Yi took Zhao Yun
as his wife back then,

135
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,683
he had given a thousand
warhorses to Northern Realm.

136
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:38,289
Now, these warhorses
have fallen into Fu Chou's hands.

137
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,567
He wants to build
a team of elite Calvary.

138
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:43,395
We don't have enough warhorses.
We'll be in a disadvantage.

139
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:46,895
If we can use this chance to buy
a team of warhorses from them,

140
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:49,845
we will be able to solve
our biggest problem.

141
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:53,671
Wu You.

142
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:55,867
I'm worried about Zhao Yun.

143
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,974
She has fallen in love
with Ning Qian Yi...

144
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:00,992
and she is pregnant with his child.

145
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,462
If Ning Qian Yi...

146
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:05,433
is really the one who had instructed
Chen Yu to get the book,

147
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:08,295
tell me, what should we do then?

148
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:09,930
Let's be sure about it first.

149
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,292
Unless it's necessary,

150
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,760
I won't do something that
will upset Zhao Yun.

151
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,492
But if Ning Qian Yi is someone
with wild ambition,

152
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,576
it won't be easy for us
to get the warhorses.

153
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,118
Don't worry.

154
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,264
Although Ning Qian Yi holds
the military power of Chen,

155
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,558
he is not the emperor of this country.

156
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:32,542
I already asked Leng Yan to spy
on the emperor of Chen in the palace.

157
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,200
The emperor of Chen?

158
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:38,451
He is the emperor
who has just reached...

159
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,712
the age of 10 and who has
just ascended the throne?

160
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,399
I heard that...

161
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,872
he just knows how to have fun and
knows nothing about public affairs.

162
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,837
-I wonder if it's true.
-Whether it's true or not,

163
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,742
we'll know when we meet him.

164
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,972
It's late already.

165
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:00,609
I have to go.

166
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,511
You have to be careful
when you stay here.

167
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,669
Don't do anything risky.

168
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,594
Be extra careful when you are outside.

169
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,689
-Small pendants and toys for sale.
-Fresh vegetables for sale.

170
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:46,926
Small pendants and toys for sale.

171
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:54,478
-Small pendants and toys for sale.
-Fresh vegetables for sale.

172
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,818
I heard that he ran to West Market
Street after he left the palace.

173
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,582
He should be here soon.

174
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:05,664
Stop running!

175
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:07,113
Don't run.

176
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,611
Slow down!

177
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,650
-Don't run!
-Don't run, slow down!

178
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,697
Be careful!

179
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,304
Slow down!

180
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,002
Catch me if you can.

181
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,541
A bunch of fools.

182
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:55,612
Move aside!

183
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,854
Move aside!

184
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:03,826
Quick, move aside!

185
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,424
Quick, move aside!

186
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,054
Are you alright?

187
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,066
-Open the door!
-How dare you!

188
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,353
Follow me.

189
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:42,225
It's so painful!

190
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,724
Let go of me! I still want to
look at their silly faces!

191
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,828
Let go of me first, alright?

192
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:49,959
You saved me. I can repay you.

193
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,300
Let go of me first, alright?

194
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,831
It's very painful.

195
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,035
If you don't let go of me now,

196
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,824
I'll hit you!

197
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,276
Somebody help!

198
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:06,451
An adult is bullying a kid!

199
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:08,480
An adult is bullying a kid!

200
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,046
Somebody help!

201
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:12,144
If you have had enough, Your Majesty,

202
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,928
how about we use
this chance to talk business?

203
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:21,772
Alright, Prince Li.

204
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,105
You know me?

205
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,279
Prince Li, have a seat.

206
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:34,078
You are the one who sent someone to
spy on my actions and whereabouts?

207
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,285
Not only I know about your identity,

208
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:39,621
I know about things that happened in
Northern Realm for the past few years.

209
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,897
And I know why...

210
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,274
you and Prince Regent
of Northern Realm are here.

211
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:47,535
First, it's because of
Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

212
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:49,759
Second, it's because of warhorse.

213
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,700
Am I right?

214
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,005
Word is, emperor of Chen
is young, clueless...

215
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,672
and ignorant about public affairs.

216
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:57,201
It is indeed untrue.

217
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:58,327
If I didn't do so,

218
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:01,985
I wouldn't have the chance to
experience your graceful bearing.

219
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:17,126
How could they let a
ten-year-old take the throne?

220
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,682
What are they trying to do?

221
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,724
He is just a kid.

222
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:24,651
Besides playing,
he knows hide-and-seek only.

223
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,115
They let him handle
the public affairs.

224
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,337
Will he be able to do it well?

225
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,293
Who did His Majesty...

226
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,174
encounter today?

227
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,285
Just now, His Majesty almost
got hit by a carriage.

228
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,046
Then, that carriage stopped dead
in the middle of the road...

229
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:52,836
and blocked our sight on His Majesty.

230
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,968
We didn't get a clear look on
who was the person we encountered.

231
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,423
But we found out that...

232
00:14:57,514 --> 00:15:00,077
the carriage belongs
to the emperor of Qi.

233
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,315
Rong Qi.

234
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,332
He didn't come here...

235
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,585
just for Rong Le?

236
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,293
Does he have...

237
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,690
another reason to be here?

238
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,857
Do we need to send someone
to keep an eye on him?

239
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,153
Send someone to check on him.

240
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,589
But don't touch him.

241
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,266
I don't want any other complications.

242
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:30,174
Send someone to keep
a close eye on Fu Chou.

243
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,256
By the way,

244
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,818
Lin Shen told me that
Zongzheng Wu You...

245
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:37,140
has already left southern fringe
in secret.

246
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,095
Send more people to
keep an eye on him in secret.

247
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,413
Report to me at once
if you find anything.

248
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,211
That's it. You may leave now.

249
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,648
Yes, Your Highness.

250
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,829
" Written by Fu Yuan "

251
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,227
Zhao Yun.

252
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,360
What kind of a person...

253
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,268
do you think Qian Yi is?

254
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:50,168
Him?

255
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:53,743
He is bold and righteous,
open and aboveboard,

256
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:57,500
and is very attentive to me.
He is a very good man.

257
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,139
If...

258
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,576
If one day,

259
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:05,347
you realise that...

260
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,791
he is not what you think he is,

261
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:10,770
what will you do?

262
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:14,376
What do you mean?

263
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,784
Yun!

264
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,415
Yun!

265
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,075
Come and take a look.

266
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,069
Take a look at what
I've prepared for our child.

267
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,010
Rong Le. Come and take a look as well.

268
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:32,857
These are better than what I've sewn.

269
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,334
Of course the one you sew is better.

270
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:38,829
Yun, I just don't want it
to be too hard on you.

271
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:46,557
This shirt is for a three-year-old,
right?

272
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,719
You are even more impatient
than Zhao Yun.

273
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,123
Of course I'm impatient.

274
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,161
This is my first child with Yun.

275
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:56,422
I can't wait for him to
come into this world earlier...

276
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,480
so that I can take a look
at him earlier.

277
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,993
Yun, look at this.

278
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,491
Do you like it?

279
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:12,492
Here. Put them nicely into
Lady Zhao Yun's closet.

280
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:14,032
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,613
Let's have some tea.

282
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:35,106
Rong Le.

283
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,051
When I was in Northern Realm,

284
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,037
I once gave you a jar of wine.

285
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,959
Have you drunk it?

286
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:43,877
I've already finished it.
It tasted divine.

287
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:45,701
That's great.

288
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,014
We have many of the same wine here.

289
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,541
By the way, at noon tomorrow,

290
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,941
I'm going to have a feast...

291
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,932
in Qianlin Garden to welcome
Prince Regent and emperor of Qi.

292
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:59,243
How about you attend
the feast with me...

293
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,508
to enjoy ourselves?

294
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:04,794
I'll pass.

295
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:07,694
I haven't recovered from my wounds.
I shouldn't take any alcohol.

296
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,035
That's right.
Princess Rong Le is still unwell.

297
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:14,359
It's a feast for others,
you can just go alone.

298
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,569
Why do you want to drag her in?

299
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,709
You have no idea.

300
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,019
Both of them came to Chen
because they want to buy warhorses.

301
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:30,620
But this year, we have a
limited number of warhorses.

302
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,708
I can only sell them to one party.

303
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,659
That's why...

304
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:37,320
I don't know how to choose
between the two of them.

305
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,285
I hope that Rong Le can
advise me on that.

306
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,213
After all, you know them...

307
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:45,089
better than I do.

308
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,244
Fu Chou wants to buy horse as well?

309
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,712
Yes.

310
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,963
Before this, I had given him
one thousand horses as dowry.

311
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:55,618
I heard that he has trained up
a strong team of Calvary.

312
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:58,799
If I sell my warhorses again
to him this time,

313
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:00,826
I think his team...

314
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,418
will be able to send his enemies
fleeing helter-skelter.

315
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:10,160
You have saved me and let me
stay in your manor to recuperate.

316
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:13,924
You have asked for my help.
If I don't help you,

317
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:15,773
I won't be a very good friend.

318
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,254
I'll attend the feast with you
tomorrow then.

319
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,951
That's great. Here.

320
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,545
Let's have some tea.

321
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:26,102
Here.

322
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:08,220
-Little Xun.
-Yes, Your Majesty?

323
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,041
Princess Rong Le is still not here?

324
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,409
Your Majesty.

325
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:14,025
You still have time before your
meeting with Prince Zhen Bei.

326
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:16,837
Wait for a while more.
She is going to be here soon.

327
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:26,950
I always think that...

328
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,576
life is too short...

329
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:30,371
and time passes swiftly.

330
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,134
But today,
I feel that it's passing very slowly.

331
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,275
Little Xun.

332
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:40,037
Go and wait outside.

333
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:42,868
Inform me at once
when she reaches here.

334
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:44,345
Yes, Your Majesty.

335
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,016
Your Majesty.

336
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:26,714
Your Majesty.

337
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,319
Princess Rong Le is here.

338
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,017
She has entered Qianlin Garden and
is heading towards Qingtian Chamber.

339
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:33,390
Let's go.

340
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:40,302
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-What is it?

341
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:52,762
Little Xun.

342
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,254
Tell Prince Zhen Bei that...

343
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:57,035
I'm not feeling well today and
I can't attend the feast.

344
00:22:58,754 --> 00:22:59,944
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:04,875
Keep a close eye on Qingtian Chamber.

346
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,543
Report to me at once if you find
any traces of Lin Shen.

347
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:08,995
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,895
Rong Le.

349
00:23:31,454 --> 00:23:33,459
Although I really want to see you,

350
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,918
I'm more determined...

351
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:38,173
I can bring you back safely.

352
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,479
This way please.

353
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,495
Prince Regent really cares
about Rong Le a lot.

354
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,116
You are here so early.

355
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:23,998
Prince Regent.

356
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,308
Have a seat.

357
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,056
After you.

358
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,540
Prince Zhen Bei,

359
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,774
our Majesty won't be able
to attend the feast...

360
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,376
because he is unwell today.

361
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,176
Please forgive him.

362
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,932
Emperor of Qi is ill?

363
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:53,940
Guards,
bring the royal physician here.

364
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,701
Thank you for your hospitality.

365
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:58,125
This is just an attack
of an old illness.

366
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,227
He just need to
rest quietly to recuperate.

367
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:05,261
Princess Rong Le. Long time no see.

368
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:07,584
His Majesty misses you a lot.

369
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,237
He wishes you well.

370
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,241
Prince Zhen Bei,
I'll take my leave now.

371
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,476
He better be ill...

372
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,412
and not plotting anything
evil in the dark.

373
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,136
You think too much, Prince Regent.

374
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:25,079
This is not Western Qi.

375
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:31,243
These are the best wines in Chen.

376
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:34,681
We'll each choose a jar of wine.
We'll drink till we drop today.

377
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:36,762
Rong Le, you can choose first.

378
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,851
Alcohol will harm the body.

379
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:43,982
Since we are here to talk business,
we can skip the wine.

380
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:47,658
It's not easy for the three of us
to gather here today.

381
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:50,490
It's such a happy day today.
It's fine to drink some wine.

382
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,234
Moreover, Rong Le
is feeling down lately.

383
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:56,564
It will help her feel better
if she drinks some wine.

384
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,778
Today, Rong Le...

385
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:23,309
This wine smells exactly the same
as the wine you gave me back then.

386
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,722
You still haven't recovered.
It's better if you don't drink.

387
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,529
It's none of your business.

388
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:50,703
Prince Regent is indeed
a very good drinker.

389
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:53,239
I never thought that after so long,

390
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:55,868
the three of us will be able
to gather around again.

391
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,527
Unfortunately, Prince Li is not here.

392
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,961
Is it really over...

393
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,057
between the two of you.

394
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,035
Back in Zhongshan,

395
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:16,314
I thought that Prince Li
loved you wholeheartedly.

396
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,766
I never thought that
he will treat you like this.

397
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,091
Rong Le. Don't be too upset.

398
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,425
He doesn't trust you, but we do.

399
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:28,063
Qian Yi, let's not talk
about him anymore, alright?

400
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,161
Come, let's drink.

401
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,948
Whoever that mentions him have to
drink three cups as punishment.

402
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,837
Since you want to drink,

403
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:38,999
then let's drink together.

404
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:41,142
That's great.

405
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:53,105
Here.

406
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:54,621
Cheers.

407
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,160
Rong Le.

408
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:09,723
Before this, I thought that you and
Prince Li were each other's halves.

409
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:11,399
I never thought that...

410
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,275
Prince Li is not the one for you.

411
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,343
But this time,
Prince Regent has made me...

412
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,146
look at him with new eyes.

413
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,583
He came to Chen...

414
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,760
in the name of rebuilding
our past alliance.

415
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:25,361
But actually,
he's only here because of you.

416
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:27,229
He came here despite
the long distance.

417
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,431
Looks like he's really
infatuated with you.

418
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:32,993
How about you reconsider...

419
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:35,102
to be with Prince Regent again?

420
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,195
Prince Li.

421
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,833
After more than a year,

422
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,554
when have you became a matchmaker,
Prince Zhen Be?

423
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,483
Prince Li.

424
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:54,270
Prince Li, you came on the right time.

425
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:57,032
We were just talking about you.

426
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:04,164
I never thought that
I'll even see you in Chen.

427
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:07,701
Prince Li.

428
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,010
Prince Regent is here to buy warhorse.

429
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:12,630
He'll go back after the deal is done.

430
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:16,109
You had once sent me letters
to form an alliance with me.

431
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,712
But now, you want to sell
warhorses to my enemy.

432
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:23,070
Are you the only one
who can buy warhorses?

433
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:34,624
Calm down.

434
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:37,957
Prince Li. Since you are
genuinely here to buy warhorses,

435
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:39,733
how about we sit down...

436
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:41,895
and have a peaceful discussion
about it?

437
00:29:57,912 --> 00:30:01,079
I heard that Chen has breed
a thousand fine horses this year.

438
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:04,817
I'm willing to exchange them
for a year of my city's taxes.

439
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,611
What do you think?

440
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,815
Northern fringe is just a small area
compared to Northern Realm.

441
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:12,136
A year of taxes from a city-sized
country worth nothing.

442
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,766
Prince Zhen Bei, if you...

443
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:15,909
are willing to cooperate
with Northern Realm,

444
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,411
whether it's gold, silver, jade,
food of other goods,

445
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,300
you can just name a price.

446
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,865
For the past year, after the
transformation, the people...

447
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,293
of southern fringe lived in peace
and we have stable income.

448
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:28,828
As for you,

449
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:31,062
For the past year, you went on
punitive expedition one after another.

450
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,826
Your national treasure is depleted.
What do you have to offer?

451
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:35,490
No need to worry about it.

452
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:37,626
Northern Realm is vast country
with rich resources.

453
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:41,263
Even if we went on punitive expedition
everywhere, the court can afford it.

454
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,601
But southern fringe
is just a tiny place.

455
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,622
Besides Qingzhou,

456
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,136
do you have any other cities...

457
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:49,212
that can be up to par with Zhongshan?

458
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,657
Stop fighting with each other.

459
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:58,451
I'm very satisfied with
both of your conditions.

460
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,286
But...

461
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:03,993
Rong Le.

462
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:05,993
How about you choose it for me.

463
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,995
She is the guilty consort of
southern fringe. It's inappropriate...

464
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:13,757
to let her choose.

465
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:16,228
You are wrong, Prince Li.

466
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,701
Rong Le has already
left southern fringe.

467
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:21,293
And now, she is Prince Zhen Bei's
honoured guest.

468
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:23,434
Why can't she choose?

469
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:26,094
That's right. Rong Le.

470
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,035
I'll let you make the decision.

471
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,093
Choose for me. I trust you.

472
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:35,558
You want me to choose?

473
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,432
You'll listen to me?

474
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,109
You don't have to
choose either of them.

475
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:44,076
She is drunk already.

476
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:47,167
You let her make the decision
in such an important military matter.

477
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:49,981
-She is treating it like a plaything.
-She hasn't finished her sentence yet.

478
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:52,417
How do you know she will
treat it like a plaything?

479
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:55,663
That's right.
You may continue, Rong Le.

480
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,528
These warhorses,

481
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,496
don't sell them to either of them.

482
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,175
If you want to sell them,

483
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,016
sell them to me.

484
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:12,285
Sell them to you?

485
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,771
Why do you need warhorses?

486
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:17,406
That's right.

487
00:32:19,717 --> 00:32:22,637
Why do I need warhorses?

488
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,101
I don't know as well.

489
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:28,207
But I don't want to let them
have the horses. Can I?

490
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,587
Rong Le. You are drunk.

491
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,962
Why can't I have my own warhorses?

492
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:37,277
You too, think that...

493
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:40,605
a woman should stay quietly
and obediently in the harem,

494
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:43,633
we can have neither aspiration
nor our own troops...

495
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,408
and we can't hold a power
as great as men, right?

496
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,406
Rong Le, you think too much.

497
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,184
Have a seat first.

498
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:56,323
I was once an abandoned princess
of Western Qi.

499
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,518
Then, I was the wife abandoned by
Northern Realm's General of Defence.

500
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,390
Now, I am the guilty consort
of southern fringe.

501
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:07,933
In my life,

502
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:11,194
I am abandoned again and again
by man after man.

503
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,648
I have had enough.

504
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:16,618
I want to have power of my own.

505
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,165
From now on, I don't need to
depend on anybody anymore.

506
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:20,939
Rong Le.

507
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:25,542
This is the jade pendant...

508
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,388
you gave me when
we were in Northern Realm.

509
00:33:28,235 --> 00:33:31,142
Back then, in order to
repay me for saving you,

510
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,861
you promised that...

511
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,344
you'll agree to do me a favour.

512
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:38,702
Now, I'm going to use
this jade pendant...

513
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,103
in exchange for the warhorses deal.

514
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,674
But Prince Li has the
same jade pendant too.

515
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,784
If Prince Li uses it on me too,

516
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,618
then I'll be a person...

517
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:58,414
who breaks my promise.

518
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,681
You can sell the warhorses to her.

519
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:07,532
I want to see how will a woman
with nothing build her own army.

520
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,098
Then,

521
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,956
what about you, Prince Regent?

522
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:20,889
If that's the case,

523
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:23,145
I'll withdraw from
this fight for warhorses.

524
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,353
Besides,
I'll bear all the costs needed...

525
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,020
for Rong Le warhorses.

526
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:29,879
No need.

527
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:34,645
When I was married to
Northern Realm from Western Qi,

528
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:36,399
the dowry that I
had brought with me...

529
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,613
is more than equivalent
to the taxes of a city.

530
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,160
You just need to give me
back my dowry.

531
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:42,671
From now on,

532
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:44,382
it'll be a clean cut between us.

533
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,094
Qian Yi.

534
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,745
It's a deal then.

535
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:58,918
Don't go back on your words.

536
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,855
Princess Rong Le is drunk.
Take care of her.

537
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:03,866
She'll stay here tonight.

538
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:05,703
Rong Le.

539
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,275
Rong Le!

540
00:35:20,114 --> 00:35:23,187
Both of you. Can you
don't wage a tit-for-tat here?

541
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:25,826
Although I don't know what
grudges you have between you,

542
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,385
we are in Chen now.

543
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:31,440
See it as a form of
respect for me, alright?

544
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:34,488
If you have any grudges,
please settle this in private.

545
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:39,926
Guards, bring Prince Li
to his resting chamber.

546
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,330
Yes, Your Highness.

547
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:45,307
Farewell, Prince Regent.

548
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:03,423
What is wrong with you?
Pay attention when you walk.

549
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:05,045
Are you alright, Princess?

550
00:36:05,754 --> 00:36:07,889
Stop following me.

551
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,103
Yes, Your Highness.

552
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,484
It's me, Rong Le.

553
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,662
Rong Qi.

554
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:02,210
What are you trying to do this time?

555
00:37:03,797 --> 00:37:06,519
I already found a way to neutralise
the poison in you once and for all.

556
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,002
Come back to Western Qi with me.
Let me cure you.

557
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,542
I was hurt so badly
because of you back then.

558
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,618
Why do you still want
to lie to me now?

559
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:15,311
I'm not lying to you.

560
00:37:15,862 --> 00:37:18,354
I have completed the three things
that I had promised you.

561
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:20,768
If I knew that you were
going to do it like that,

562
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:23,102
then I rather you did nothing.

563
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:25,100
Rong Le.

564
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,014
Please trust me one more time.

565
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,704
I am tricked by you again and again.

566
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,754
I have learnt my lessons.

567
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:34,961
I won't fall for your lies again.

568
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,923
Let go of me.

569
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,335
Let go of me!

570
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
" Hanqing Pavilion "

571
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:08,152
It's dangerous here.

572
00:38:09,016 --> 00:38:10,969
Leave at once with Prince Li.

573
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,316
Chen Yu.

574
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:26,408
I never thought that after so long,

575
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,673
you are still able to
recognise me in one glance.

576
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,411
That day in Prince Zhen Bei's manor,

577
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,571
I saw your back.

578
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,254
Back in Northern Realm,

579
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,524
Ning Qian Yi was the one
who asked you to take away...

580
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,519
The Book of Mountains
and Rivers, right?

581
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,285
Why are you so impatient
for me to leave?

582
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:44,817
Is he...

583
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,740
going to do something
that will harm me?

584
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,144
Stop asking.

585
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,532
If you still trust me, leave now.

586
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,191
Do you think the problem
will be solved if I leave?

587
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:56,607
In order to get the book back then,

588
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:59,166
he had asked you to stay
in Northern Realm for years.

589
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:01,367
If he really wants to harm me,

590
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:04,084
he will find me even if I leave Chen.

591
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:09,538
Maybe he is not as bad as
you think he is.

592
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,047
You don't even dare
to look me in my eyes.

593
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,402
It means that you
know it very clearly.

594
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:17,623
If he didn't have
any evil plans for me,

595
00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:19,569
you wouldn't urge me to leave.

596
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,827
He commands the court of Chen...

597
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:26,035
and keeps watch on the
young emperor of Chen.

598
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,618
A person who craves power
can't be a kind ruler.

599
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:33,056
You asked me to leave Chen.

600
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:35,754
And I want you to leave Ning Qian Yi.

601
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:38,883
-I...
-Moreover, the book is in his hands.

602
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:42,710
We can't be sure what he'll do
in the future even if I leave.

603
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,995
Why are you here, Your Highness?

604
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,076
I heard that Qian Yi had drunk
too much last night.

605
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:18,932
And I heard that
Brother Wu You is here.

606
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,774
I want to meet them.

607
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,691
It's late already.

608
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:25,413
There are many male guests
in Qianlin Garden.

609
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,238
It's inappropriate for you
to go in now.

610
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,249
Please come again tomorrow.

611
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,753
Princess Rong Le is inside as well.
What's inappropriate about it?

612
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:37,163
His Highness put Princess Rong Le here
because he wants to find a chance...

613
00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:40,045
to restore Prince Li and
Princess Rong Le's relationship.

614
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:43,267
If you insist on going inside
to meet Prince Li now,

615
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:46,409
I'm afraid you'll ruin the plan that
His Highness has meticulously planned.

616
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:48,293
I see.

617
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,621
Send this hangover soup to Qian Yi.

618
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,407
I'll visit them again tomorrow.

619
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:58,773
Hopefully, all will be well
between Brother Wu You and...

620
00:40:58,864 --> 00:41:00,155
Princess Rong Le tomorrow.

621
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:02,303
Farewell, Your Highness.

622
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,507
Gunpowder.
