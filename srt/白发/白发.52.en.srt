1
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:06,937
" Princess Silver "

2
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,782
Episode 52

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,729
They had saved your life once.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,793
Zhao Yun.

5
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:17,826
Prince Li.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,770
Zhao Yun is your sister.

7
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,628
Don't think of using her life
to threaten me.

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:27,319
Zhao Yun, leave now.
It's dangerous here.

9
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:28,723
I'm not going to budge.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,120
Qian Yi.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,833
Don't set yourself against Brother
Wu You and Princess Rong Le anymore.

12
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:39,414
Give them back the book and
return the power to our emperor.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,553
Let's live a quiet life together,

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,583
alright?

15
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,646
Zhao Yun, stop wasting
your time on him.

16
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,291
Other than the power he seeks,

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,000
there is nothing else
that he cares about.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,695
Zhao Yun, don't be foolish.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
If I let them go today,

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,000
they won't let me get away so easily.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,542
I have come so far,

22
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:07,633
there is no turning back for me now.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,126
Otherwise...

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,760
death is my only end.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,215
Kill them, do not hurt my wife.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,493
Stop!

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,600
Let them go.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,855
Luo Yan.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,960
You are using the blade I gave you...

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,845
to kill me?

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,240
Do you really...

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,160
have the resolve?

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,160
Chen Yu!

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,280
Not a step closer!

35
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,668
Zhao Yun!

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,360
If I can't stop you,

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,424
I shall end my life here!

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,685
It's better than seeing you
become a murderer.

39
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:26,731
Zhao Yun,

40
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:29,134
do not make me do this.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,107
You know it well.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,856
You are special to me.

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,824
I truly love you.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,991
You are cruel and heartless.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,344
You never cared about how I feel.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,400
I don't want my child to be born...

47
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,181
with a cruel and...

48
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:51,024
power-hungry father like you!

49
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,844
Power-hungry?

50
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,592
Zhao Yun.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,869
This is my last warning for you.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,520
Come to my side.

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,141
Lay down the knife.

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,218
Fine, I get it now.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,453
Kill them.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,123
All of you, stop!

57
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,067
Your Majesty should be in the palace,

58
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:15,371
what brings you here?

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,383
Prince Zhen Bei, how dare you!

60
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,880
You plan to have a slaughter
inside the royal villa!

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,645
Emperor of Qi is a righteous ruler.

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,107
Prince Li and Prince Regent of
Northern Realm are lords of lands.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,040
You command the elite troops
without my permission to kill them,

64
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:31,319
don't you realise this will
make us their common enemy?

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,498
That is only because they
are having a fight in here.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
They died from the injury.

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,504
As for the Emperor of Qi,
he died trying to save his sister.

68
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,073
If the Western Qi wants vengeance,

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,315
they should go to
Northern Realm instead.

70
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,905
Such insolence!
No one would believe you!

71
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,804
It doesn't matter what
the others believe.

72
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,917
As soon as the three of
them are dead, chaos arrives.

73
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,052
Chen will have the chance
to unite and rule the world.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,992
We can conquer the whole world!

75
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,530
Is this the promise Fu Yuan gave you?

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,897
She only promised me
the land in south.

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,324
But what I want is far more than that.

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
Prince Zhen Bei, because
of the power you hold,

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
you never show any respect for me.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,237
And now you conspired with enemy
while keeping me in the dark!

81
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,236
You even tried to wage war
to the world!

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,852
Guards! Take him down!

83
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,200
Don't you dare!

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,263
Ning Qian Yi! This is treason!

85
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:31,357
How could you say that?

86
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:34,122
I allied with the Empress Dowager
of Northern Realm...

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,713
all for the sake of expanding
the territory of Chen.

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,976
Your Majesty will rule the world.

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,720
How is that a crime?

90
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,320
You conspire with enemies,
that is a crime!

91
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,882
And you even made it sound
so righteous.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
If you are really doing this
for my sake,

93
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,161
why don't you show me the letter
of alliance to me?

94
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:55,311
Who says we need a letter
to forge an alliance?

95
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,482
But Your Majesty came here
in the middle of the night,

96
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
did someone talked you into this?

97
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,785
Ever since you left the palace,

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,457
the officers all requested
for you to take the rule,

99
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,698
they never considered the fact
you are just a child.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,815
What are their intentions?

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,331
To prevent our nation
from falling into the wrong hands,

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
I am willing to be the expandable.

103
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:18,841
Before Your Majesty becomes of age,

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,364
I must settle all the
national affairs for you.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,592
What else do you think
I am doing this for?

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,520
Do you really think if no one
reads the letter from Fu Yuan,

107
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,009
that there is no need
to admit your crime?

108
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,037
Zhao Yun, hand it over to me.

109
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,717
Luo Yan!

110
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,613
'I have long heard about
your sharp insight,

111
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,010
yet you had to bow
down to a mere child.'

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,231
'It got in the way of your ambition.'

113
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:00,133
'That is truly unfortunate.'

114
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,561
'I am willing to aid Prince Zhen Bei,

115
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,443
but you must use Rong Le's death...

116
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:13,993
as a reason to provoke
Prince Li into fighting my son.'

117
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,880
'Aid my son in killing Prince Li.'

118
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,374
'When it's done, half the land
in south will be yours.'

119
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,101
'Prince Zhen Bei,

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
you shall have the throne.'

121
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
Did everyone hear that?

122
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,040
You treacherous fool
is trying to overthrow the nation.

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,800
What else do you have to say?

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,531
Luo Yan.

125
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,980
I am doing this for the sake
of unifying the land.

126
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,633
This was once our shared goal.

127
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,202
-Don't you remember?
-It's you who forgot.

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,801
If you get away with this,
people will lose their lives.

129
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,793
The united world I long for...

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,408
is a peaceful time without any war.

131
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,245
Even if I am not the one
who wages war,

132
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,468
the world will never
know everlasting peace.

133
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,954
Hate exists as long as humans live.

134
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,513
Prince Li and Prince Regent...

135
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,968
may have reconciled as brothers,

136
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,354
but they hate each other
for the death of their father,

137
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:22,873
they hate each other
because their loved one.

138
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,454
The truth may be revealed,

139
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,173
but will they really be able
to let bygone be bygone...

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,333
and see each other as brothers?

141
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,314
You are right.

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,110
We made a lot of mistakes
because of hate.

143
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,342
We paid a dear price for that.

144
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,605
But you are different.

145
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,853
You thirst for power,
you seize the Imperial Court...

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,361
and take advantage
of your young lord.

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,560
You brought this upon yourself.

148
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,256
History is written by the victor!

149
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,604
All the lords and rulers have
their hands stained with blood.

150
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,745
Even your father...

151
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,480
resorted to despicable means
to rebuild his nation...

152
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,687
and that was how the
Northern Realm could thrive.

153
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,479
This is not justice.

154
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,290
This is the revelation
of your ambition.

155
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,405
Are you certain if the world
is thrown into chaos,

156
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,259
you would be able
to conquer it?

157
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,804
Or will you seize the throne
for yourself...

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,742
because of your own greed?

159
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:25,154
All those lies of Prince Zhen Bei
started to fool even himself.

160
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,426
All the nations are living in peace.

161
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,045
People are living a good life.

162
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,789
How could you say waging war
is for the peace of the world?

163
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:36,514
Does the lives of countless people
mean nothing to you?

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,320
Rong Le is right.

165
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,162
In this world we live in,

166
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,280
living a life is probably
a luxury for many.

167
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,172
You, Prince Zhen Bei,
enjoyed the luxury of life.

168
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,800
But you would risk ruining
everything for your own gain.

169
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:52,918
You may sacrifice
your own life for your goal,

170
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:55,846
but will you give up on the life...

171
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,048
of your loved one as well?

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,291
Prince Zhen Bei
conspired with the enemy.

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,919
He tried to seize the throne.

174
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,663
As for the rest of you
who fell for his lies,

175
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,685
lay down your weapons
and you shall be spared.

176
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,155
Guards, take Prince Zhen Bei
to the prison so he will be tried!

177
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:27,533
Hold on!

178
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,778
Prince Li.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,521
Back at Lady Yun's tomb,

180
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:38,208
I invited you to have
a toast together.

181
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,634
I felt like in the whole wide world,

182
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:42,902
the only person who
deserves to be my rival...

183
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,443
is none other than you.

184
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,105
I failed today,

185
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,368
but I didn't lose to anyone.

186
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,069
I lost to myself.

187
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,576
Guards, bring forth the wine.

188
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
A request from a dying man.

189
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:12,970
Prince Li,

190
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:15,178
will you accept this toast?

191
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,453
If you were my soulmate,

192
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,594
I don't mind having a drink with you.

193
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,311
But the truth is,

194
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,155
you only ever wanted power.

195
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,509
The people's lives mean
nothing to you.

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,539
The man who is fit to be my rival...

197
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,619
will not be lowly being like you.

198
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,700
As for this toast,

199
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,075
save it for yourself.

200
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,476
Zongzheng Wu You,

201
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,095
you still don't have the courage.

202
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,589
-Your Highness!
-Qian Yi!

203
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,811
Qian Yi!

204
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
Promise me.

205
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,884
Do not let our child know...

206
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,563
he has a failure like me as father.

207
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,178
Qian Yi!

208
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,170
-Rong Le!
-Man Yao!

209
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,888
Man Yao!

210
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,146
Man Yao!

211
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,120
Man Yao!

212
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
Is Man Yao suffering from illness?

213
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,611
Why did she pass out?

214
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,158
Prince Li,

215
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,019
the Consort passed out because
of fatigue from recent events.

216
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,841
Worries are unnecessary.

217
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:45,651
I should congratulate Your highness.
Consort Rong Le...

218
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,939
is indeed expecting a child.

219
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,043
Man Yao, we are going
to have a child.

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,311
Congratulation, Prince Li
and Consort Rong Le.

221
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,800
<i>What's done is done.</i>

222
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,873
<i>Young Master,
there is no turning back.</i>

223
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,058
<i>Your only choice now...</i>

224
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,365
<i>is to keep going on this wicked path.</i>

225
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,537
Chou.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,969
Come on here.

227
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,372
Why did you get yourself
all sweaty again?

228
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,032
Our father...

229
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:51,338
is still alive.

230
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,600
Your Majesty, Her Highness
is still not awake.

231
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,274
Please come again later
for your visit.

232
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,202
Your Majesty.

233
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,611
Your Majesty.

234
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,941
Xiao Sha.

235
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,164
Do you know why I sent
Xiao Ke to you...

236
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,400
instead of keeping her in Western Qi?

237
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:16,627
You mean, it wasn't
to keep her as a hostage?

238
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,047
If it wasn't for Xiao Ke,

239
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,306
will you still betray me?

240
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,258
Both you and Xiao Ke are with Rong Le.

241
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,007
You are both loyal to her.

242
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,379
This is the outcome I was hoping for.

243
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,369
Rong Le.

244
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,445
You would even hurt yourself
for his safety.

245
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,072
But you are now a wife and a mother.

246
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,665
You need to take care of yourself...

247
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:10,738
and cherish your health.

248
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,664
Is that clear?

249
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,241
Seeing that you are well and safe,

250
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,646
I am relieved.

251
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,112
Now that you have forgotten
all the memories we shared,

252
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,670
I hope you will never
recall them ever again.

253
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
Your Highness.

254
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,944
What do you want?

255
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,308
Zongzheng Wu You,
 don't you dare get into my way.

256
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
I am taking her back to Western Qi.

257
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:54,157
-She will...
-Wu You.

258
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,097
Man Yao, you are awake.

259
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,263
I am glad you are fine.

260
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,895
I am glad you are all right.

261
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,254
Haven't you heard?
We are going to be parents.

262
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,784
You mean...

263
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,320
we have a child now?

264
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,788
You passed out just now.

265
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,628
I thought you were
having another relapse.

266
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:25,086
But it was actually because
you are expecting a child.

267
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,460
Your body has become weak.

268
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,264
You have always liked kids.

269
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,457
Now, we will finally
have one of our own.

270
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,863
I am fine.

271
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,392
Did the injury at my abdomen...

272
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,055
hurt the child?

273
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:46,308
I inquired the doctor.
The child is fine.

274
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,478
Your Majesty.

275
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,947
Your Majesty.

276
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,760
If you have any wish to complete,

277
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:26,493
I am willing to help you.

278
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,278
Never mind.

279
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,417
Xiao Sha,

280
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,003
stay with Princess Rong Le.

281
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,312
Keep her safe.

282
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,469
Your Majesty,

283
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,652
you came all the way here to Chen...

284
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,840
to bring Princess Rong Le
back to Western Qi.

285
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,716
Are you certain you will
return empty-handed?

286
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,933
If she wants to stay,
I shouldn't take her by force.

287
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,455
Let's go.

288
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,510
When I listened
to the music you played,

289
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:47,075
the melodies are crisp and clear.

290
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:50,574
I could tell you are not
one blinded by desires.

291
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,440
Maybe you had other matters
on your mind.

292
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,872
But the melodies
you played just now...

293
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,983
are tranquil and momentous.

294
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,620
Perhaps your mind is cleared
when you played the music.

295
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:06,741
It was the same song.

296
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,160
Be it the audience or the musician,

297
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,254
with different moods come
different sensations.

298
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,741
You heard the tranquility
and momentum in it,

299
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,640
that is because you have
a pure heart to begin with.

300
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,250
We are no longer master and servant.

301
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:27,645
Stop addressing me as your mistress.

302
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,932
Chen Yu.

303
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:33,531
Luo Yan.

304
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:36,620
That is my real name.

305
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,008
If you won't let me address you
as my mistress,

306
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,133
you can address me by my real name.

307
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,404
From now on, we have
no secrets for each other.

308
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,397
Very well, Luo Yan.

309
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,909
Actually, I am rather
curious about your past.

310
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:54,802
I remember what you told me
when you were playing a song.

311
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,859
There are something in this world...

312
00:24:58,052 --> 00:24:59,966
that is more important
than loving someone.

313
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,206
Those are in the past.

314
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:06,915
Back then, I thought...

315
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,589
acquiring the Book of Mountains
and Rivers is my mission.

316
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,758
But I have strayed far from
my goal to one that leads to regrets.

317
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I even betrayed our friendship.

318
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,927
In times of turmoil,
 loyalty may seem like a luxury.

319
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,412
I remember the time...

320
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,376
when we talked about
our own plans for future.

321
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:34,608
Long Yue, Wei,

322
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:36,483
Ling Yue and even you,

323
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:38,671
you all have your own goals.

324
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,713
Now,

325
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,352
it does seem like we each
have our own calling.

326
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,570
I realised the choice we made...

327
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:53,166
was a decision made
out of desperation.

328
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,231
As long as we feel no regret,

329
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,464
it doesn't matter what the people say.

330
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,080
This is rightfully yours.

331
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,733
I am returning it to its owner.

332
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,112
But...

333
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:28,147
My past was a simple tale.

334
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,029
When civil war spread
throughout the land,

335
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,012
my family died in the battles.

336
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,469
I was saved by a young hero...

337
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,455
and I survived.

338
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,979
He told me that...

339
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,734
a ruler needs a strong army
to unite the land.

340
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,004
I thought...

341
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,478
acquiring the Book of
Mountains and Rivers...

342
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:53,626
will allow Chen to unite the land...

343
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,660
and prevent war from
breaking out again.

344
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,845
I shared the same idea.

345
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,040
I went to the Northern Realm
in search of the Book...

346
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:03,325
for the sake of my nation.

347
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,560
I even went as far as
to hurt someone.

348
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,836
I blamed my brother for this.

349
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,048
I blamed Wu You and Fu Chou
for my suffering.

350
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,824
I blamed those who
lied to me and used me.

351
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,785
But now, I am freed of
those burdens.

352
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:26,230
I have no hate.

353
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,187
I am glad this realisation
didn't come any later.

354
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,327
Man Yao, you have a heart
for kindness and sympathy.

355
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,159
This is why I feel like
you should have the Book.

356
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,107
Perhaps you can understand
the true teaching within.

357
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:44,929
Only those without any greed
or vile intention...

358
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,747
will never take
the land for their own...

359
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,464
but to bring peace to the people
and save them from suffering.

360
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,019
That is when the land
will truly be united as one.

361
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,586
I hope I won't let you down.

362
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,901
Luo Yan,

363
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:18,480
what is your plan for the future?

364
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,898
I have been wanting
to travel the world.

365
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,194
Now I have the opportunity...

366
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:25,060
to search for a path of my own.

367
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,093
Prince Li, if you may.

368
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,040
Only one of the statue is a
match for the stallion of Chen.

369
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
You may have a guess.

370
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:52,565
If your choice is correct,

371
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,593
of all the stables in Chen,

372
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,397
you may pick a thousand stallions
and bring them back.

373
00:28:57,606 --> 00:28:59,166
If you make the wrong choice,

374
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,670
you shall return with nothing.

375
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,892
If my guess is correct...

376
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:17,655
and I could reveal the meanings
behind the other two statues,

377
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:20,746
will Your Majesty grant me
another request?

378
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,041
It won't be a problem.

379
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,303
I appreciate this, Your Majesty.

380
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:27,391
As for the stallions,

381
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,240
I won't disrespect
Your Majesty's offer.

382
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,291
I will be taking this.

383
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,587
How are you so certain
it's not the other statues?

384
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,920
After overthrowing the
previous dynasty,

385
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,737
Chen returned to rebuilding its army.

386
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:44,303
You see horses as precious
as human lives.

387
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,062
Which is why...

388
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:49,211
you won't mere silver and gold...

389
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,328
or woods and grass that rot easily...

390
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,008
as its symbol.

391
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:57,815
But the clay statue in my hand...

392
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,473
is fused with the high spirit
of Chen's troops.

393
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,207
It's made with the clay
of their homeland...

394
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,862
and melded with high heat.

395
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,390
This is how the statue represents
the empathy of your stallions.

396
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:10,929
I am deeply impressed
with your insight.

397
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,511
Before you leave, you may bring a
thousand of those stallions with you.

398
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:17,287
May those stallions protect
your people and your home.

399
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:20,238
You have my words.
For the next a hundred years,

400
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,444
Chen and Northern Realm
will forge an alliance.

401
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:23,809
There will be no war.

402
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,338
You have my word.

403
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,220
Prince Li, if you may.

404
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,997
As for your request from earlier,

405
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:37,043
do you wish for me to spare
Princess Zhao Yun?

406
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,101
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

407
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,912
I had everything arranged.

408
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,226
For the house of Prince Zhen Bei,
except for Ning Qian Yi's crime,

409
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,464
all the others who were
kept in the dark are spared.

410
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:51,479
Ning Qian Yi's ambition
was for his own,

411
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,816
the others are innocent to begin with.

412
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,940
Your Majesty, you have my gratitude.

413
00:30:57,723 --> 00:31:00,827
I will take Princess Zhao Yun
away from this land of sorrow.

414
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,081
I envy her a lot.

415
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,000
If I could have a brother
that truly cares for me,

416
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,657
that would be great.

417
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,982
I am going back to Zhongshan.

418
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,890
Whatever her reason is,

419
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:24,294
I must get an explanation from her.

420
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,091
Those are memories of the past.

421
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,315
Right.

422
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,016
There is something you should know.

423
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,356
What is it?

424
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,685
I heard Ning Qian Yi and Chen Yu
talk about the Book and Qin Yong.

425
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,700
Hen Xiang is actually
Qin Yong's daughter.

426
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,741
Her real name is Qin Xiang.

427
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,993
The Qin family are loyal.

428
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,520
The whole nation is aware of this.

429
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,352
But because the wine
they brewed was sent to the palace,

430
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:56,333
the whole family was executed.

431
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,276
A whole family was
slaughtered over a night.

432
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,998
All the officers mourned for the loss.

433
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,590
Do you know if Hen Xiang has a sister?

434
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,658
I am not sure about that.

435
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,903
Your Highness, it's time to leave.

436
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:50,437
Well,

437
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,236
take care of yourself.

438
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,155
Goodbye.

439
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,614
You...

440
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,694
Have a safe journey.

441
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,010
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

442
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,816
<i>Our hearts are lifetime apart.</i>

443
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,564
<i>No one was here for us.</i>

444
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,260
<i>How to we keep living this life?</i>

445
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:32,506
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

446
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,462
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

447
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,899
<i>We have thrown away
the fate that we got by chance.</i>

448
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,056
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

449
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,249
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

450
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,787
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

451
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:58,090
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

452
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,550
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

453
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,692
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

454
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,024
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

455
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,383
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

456
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,814
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

457
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,613
<i>Yun!</i>

458
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,764
<i>-Not another step closer!
-Zhao Yun!</i>

459
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,176
<i>It never ends, love will fade.</i>

460
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,568
<i>The blossoms fall,
and I waited in silence.</i>

461
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:49,886
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

462
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,320
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

463
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,695
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

464
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:02,921
<i>This is the leniency
that you've shown me.</i>

465
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,492
<i>We are not holding hands
but you are holding my heart.</i>

466
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,560
<i>Although this might not be forever,</i>

467
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,373
<i>I've locked you in my heart
 and I've locked you in my dream.</i>

468
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,068
<i>It's my fault for falling in love...</i>

469
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,281
<i> with you.</i>

470
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,771
Zhao Yun.

471
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,443
Don't be too upset.

472
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:43,950
We are here for you.

473
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,562
Let's go home.

474
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:55,216
Move out!

475
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,440
In search of the remarkable
breed of stallions,

476
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:14,542
Consort Rong Le was framed
by those with ill intentions...

477
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,784
and suffered great humiliations.

478
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,660
The stallions from Chen have arrived,
her mission is completed.

479
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:25,713
His Highness has ordered us
to tell the world of the truth.

480
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,548
We shall now welcome
the return of the Consort!

481
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,921
Welcome, Prince Li and
Consort Rong Le.

482
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:06,122
-At ease!
-Much obliged, Your Highness!

483
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,132
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

484
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:46,947
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

485
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,072
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

486
00:37:54,549 --> 00:38:00,835
<i>The world is warm
but sincerity is easily gone.</i>

487
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,778
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager
went into the mountain for recovery.

488
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:19,357
She hasn't returned in over a year.

489
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,440
While I was away for
the past two weeks,

490
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:31,874
she hasn't come back either?

491
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,467
Yes, none of us has seen her.

492
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,796
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

493
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,698
" Lone Frost Tome "

494
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,792
I was too late.

495
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,862
You had everything planned,

496
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,187
when will you finally leave me...

497
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,057
and Rong Le in peace?
