Episode 26

3
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,980
I'll hold on to your hands forever.

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,980
You can rely on me
without any worries.

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,820
Is Princess Rong Le
back at the palace?

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,580
You have nothing to worry.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,020
I sent my men to escort her back.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,980
Before she left,

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,140
she left the job of protecting you
in my hand.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,340
Thank you.

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,620
Your Highness' love for my sister
is true and sincere.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,180
I appreciate it.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,180
This is as far as I can send you.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,980
Have a safe trip.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,620
Much appreciated, Prince Li.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,260
Prince Zhen Bei.

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,180
Please.

18
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,860
Yun.

19
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,900
From now on,

20
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,180
I won't let you shed another tear.

21
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,580
Even if you do,

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,420
that would be the tear of joy.

23
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,500
<i>Love was never easy to come by.</i>

24
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,740
<i>If a couple that loves each other
must be separated,</i>

25
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,540
<i>isn't it better just to be strangers?</i>

26
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,460
<i>Which is why we need to
be together all the time,</i>

27
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,860
<i>till death do we part.</i>

28
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,340
<i>From now on, we will have no home.</i>

29
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,460
<i>The whole world can be our home.</i>

30
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,180
<i>We will wander the land
without any wealth.</i>

31
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,340
<i>We will be partners in arms
on the road to glory.</i>

32
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,380
<i>But we will live without
any shelter and money.</i>

33
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,980
<i>We will use every second to
enjoy our life to the fullest.</i>

34
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,700
Zhao Yun.

35
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,860
You must live a good life,

36
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,140
a life better than the time
we spent together.

37
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,300
Wu Yu.

38
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
Let's go.

39
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,180
Sir Xiao.

40
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,900
You can have it back.

41
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,060
You gave me this for the wound.

42
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,380
My leg is feeling much better now.

43
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,100
Thank you.
You can have it back.

44
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,660
You should keep it.

45
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,100
You...

46
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,060
You go out a lot.

47
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
I don't know why you
are going out so frequently.

48
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,980
But I hope you won't turn your back
on Her Highness again.

49
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,780
Princess Zhao Yun is gone.

50
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,180
Her Highness...

51
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,660
We are the only friends she has left.

52
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,820
I will keep you safe.

53
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,180
My lord!

54
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,020
You are finally back!

55
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,820
-Come.
-Come inside!

56
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,820
Sir, join us and have fun!

57
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,940
Please, come in.

58
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,620
Master Chang, it's been a long time.

59
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
Hong, take good care of him.

60
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,580
I will.

61
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,620
-Little girl.
-What?

62
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
Do you know what is this place?

63
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,060
Why would a little girl
like you come here?

64
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,500
Madam.

65
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,380
Madam, the man with
a sword from earlier,

66
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,820
does he come here often?

67
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,460
Why? Who is he to you?

68
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,940
You don't need to know.
He and I are...

69
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,940
Little girl.

70
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,060
You shouldn't cause any trouble here.

71
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,420
He is a man.

72
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,060
Even with a beautiful girl
like yourself in the house,

73
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,420
he can still put up an act
and have fun in here.

74
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,460
I will be honest with you.

75
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,100
Your gentleman...

76
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,700
has been coming to our
business quite frequently.

77
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,460
Right, he got into a fight
with someone over a girl.

78
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,780
Is he all right?

79
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,220
He is an amazing warrior.

80
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,860
The man he fought with...

81
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,700
is the brother of the
Crown Prince's wife.

82
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,740
There was a dozen of men
surrounding him.

83
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,860
But they failed to beat him.

84
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,780
However, he did offend
the official in the palace.

85
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,780
I am afraid your gentleman
might be in deep trouble.

86
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,580
Please, talk to him.

87
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,900
Tell him to apologise and
make up for his mistake.

88
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,180
Beat it, don't bother
my business here.

89
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,900
Are you sure Xiao Sha went into
the House of Fragrance?

90
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,180
He even got into a fight?

91
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,980
I am certain of it, Your Highness.

92
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,660
I followed him to the
House of Fragrance.

93
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,140
Madam Qin said it herself.

94
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,300
He...

95
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,180
He may seem righteous
and calm all the time,

96
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,900
but who knows he would
be charmed by the ladies there.

97
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,260
I am sure he is not.

98
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,940
There must be some kind of reason.

99
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,780
Let me go with you.

100
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,700
No, Your Highness.
You can't.

101
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,740
You are still a patient.

102
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,980
I do have someone
that can go with you.

103
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,100
Welcome, my lords!

104
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,820
Do you need anything?

105
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,380
-Are you new here?
-Yes.

106
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,300
Such a dashing gentleman!

107
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,580
I will come back for you later.

108
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,740
Miss Chen Yu.

109
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,020
Can you please keep it down?
People might suspect us.

110
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,220
I can tell who is new and
who worked here for a long time.

111
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,780
As for you,

112
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,900
stop keeping your head down.
You are drawing too much attention.

113
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,180
Follow my lead and I promise you
I will search the whole place...

114
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,900
and find your Sir Xiao.

115
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,620
Miss Chen Yu, he is not mine.

116
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,020
Fine, keep searching.

117
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,620
Remember me when you come again!

118
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,260
Ping.

119
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,180
You are...

120
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,740
Miss Chen Yu!

121
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,420
Where have you been all this time?

122
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,860
I miss you so much!

123
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,780
Why do you dress like a guy?

124
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,500
How is it? Is it convincing?

125
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,380
This gentleman here is very handsome.

126
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,060
No wonder Miss Chen Yu
never visits us again.

127
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,140
So, this handsome man won your heart?

128
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,940
Ping, enough about this.

129
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,500
I have some questions for you.

130
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,140
Did someone come here and
get into a fight?

131
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,540
I know the man you talked about.

132
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,020
This is the medicine for Her Highness.

133
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,220
Any order from His Majesty?

134
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
The Northern Realm and Chen
formed an alliance.

135
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,940
His Majesty wishes to know...

136
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,900
why you keep missing your chances
and failed to kill Ning Qian Yi.

137
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,740
The Princess was involved in it.

138
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,660
Things got complicated.

139
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,060
This is my letter for His Majesty.

140
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,380
I explained in details to His Majesty.

141
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,180
I hope you remember.

142
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,300
His Highness has
the leverage on you.

143
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,420
Captain Xiao, we serve the same lord.

144
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,660
I don't want to threaten you
for His Majesty.

145
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,900
I simply wish to remind you.

146
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,780
As long as you do your job,

147
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,340
I can ensure you
the safety of Miss Ke.

148
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,300
I appreciate that.
I know what must be done.

149
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,300
But I have to see her today.

150
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,260
Otherwise I won't have
the ease of mind.

151
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,820
If we got into a fight with
another debauched guy...

152
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,220
and put her in danger,

153
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,340
you will pay with more
than just your life.

154
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,580
No.

155
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,580
His Majesty ordered her
not to see anyone.

156
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,300
What if I insist?

157
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,340
Sir, you are forcing me
to let her go...

158
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,380
and make a fuss to draw attention?

159
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,620
Indeed.

160
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,260
-Let's go.
-Wait.

161
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,580
We are leaving him behind?

162
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,340
Didn't you hear him?
Miss Ke is still here.

163
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,820
But this place is huge,
how do we find her?

164
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,060
-Come with me.
-But...

165
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,380
-Pick up the pace.
-Okay.

166
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,220
This wine is good.

167
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,620
Not bad.

168
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,500
She must be here.

169
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,100
Those men are not the workers here.

170
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
They must be working with
that man from earlier.

171
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,820
What do we do?

172
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,180
-Come with me.
-We must keep an eye on her.

173
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,700
Don't worry about it.

174
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,900
Stop standing there, help me out.

175
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,140
This is so heavy.

176
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,300
What is this hole doing here?

177
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,060
I dug this.

178
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,500
You dug this?

179
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,260
What is it?

180
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,700
Who are you?

181
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,980
Are you Miss Ke?

182
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,300
Yes.

183
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,780
We are here to save you.

184
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,100
-Me?
-Come.

185
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,140
Come on, get out of there.

186
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,060
Watch it.

187
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,980
Who is it? Let's go!

188
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,940
We need to hide!
Come with me!

189
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,780
This way!

190
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,180
Come over here.

191
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,460
Quick!

192
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,100
Are they catching up?

193
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,660
Cover your nose and mouth.

194
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,140
What is going on here?

195
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,500
Ke, what did you use?
You knocked them out.

196
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,020
Curse you!

197
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,220
How dare you lock me up!

198
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,100
-And you too!
-Ke.

199
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,380
-Ke!
-Eat this!

200
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,660
All right, we need to go.

201
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,220
They will catch you again.

202
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,940
We need to leave.

203
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,860
From Qian Yi;
I hope you cherish it.

204
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,260
Your Highness.

205
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,100
Miss Chen Yu and I brought the lady
back from House of Fragrance.

206
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,940
Miss Chen Yu is serving the customers.
She can't come with me.

207
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,900
Who are you?

208
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,940
Fear not. I am...

209
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,140
I mean you no harm.

210
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,100
I just want to talk to you.

211
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,860
Who is Xiao Sha to you?

212
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,420
You don't need to ask,
I won't tell you anything.

213
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,340
My lips are sealed
even if you kill me.

214
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,340
What are you laughing at?

215
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,420
Nothing.

216
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,700
You don't need to see me as a hostile.

217
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,340
I am Xiao Sha's friend.

218
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,340
Look at you.
Your hair is a mess.

219
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,340
Let me groom it for you, okay?

220
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,860
Go ahead.

221
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,260
You are letting me groom your hair?

222
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,020
What if I kill you?

223
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,740
Those who groom for me are good guys.

224
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,780
You are so innocent.

225
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,020
Do you have a name?

226
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,940
I am Xiao Ke.

227
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,820
<i>From Xiao family?</i>

228
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,060
That is a nice name.

229
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,180
-Who gave it to you?
-My mother.

230
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,900
I bet your mother is a
very beautiful woman.

231
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
Yes, I know she is.

232
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,620
But I don't remember
what she looks like.

233
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,220
Maybe she is as pretty as you.

234
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,220
Where is your mother?

235
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,900
I don't remember.

236
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,420
You don't remember?

237
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,780
Did you lose your memory too?

238
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,620
No.

239
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,780
But my master took me
when I was four years old.

240
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,220
I have never seen my parents again.

241
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,900
Don't you have any family?

242
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,620
Who raised you?

243
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,140
My master, of course.

244
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,020
I was terminally ill as a kid.

245
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,580
The doctors say I won't live
past five years old.

246
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,980
I was playing on the street
with my brother.

247
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,340
My brother went to get
some candied berries.

248
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
My master passed by and saw me.

249
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,220
She said she has never
seen my illness before.

250
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,140
She got excited and took me with her.

251
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,620
What about your brother?

252
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,900
A year ago, someone found me
and brought me to him.

253
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,540
I can recognize him
with the scar on his hand.

254
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,900
I don't remember anything.

255
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,460
But I remember the scar I gave him
with the scalding soup.

256
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,540
Is it on his right wrist?

257
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,460
Your are Xiao Sha's younger sister?

258
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,580
Do you want to save your brother?

259
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,860
What happened to him?
Is he in trouble?

260
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,820
Are you all right?

261
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,260
Ke?

262
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,340
Ke is missing.

263
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,380
Sir Xiao, come home with me.

264
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,540
Let's go.

265
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,340
Ke, these are for you.

266
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,500
Eat heartily.

267
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,900
Ke.

268
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,300
-Brother!
-Ke!

269
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,660
-Brother!
-Ke!

270
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,420
-Ke!
-Brother!

271
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,100
It really is you!

272
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,460
It's me!

273
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,940
I am so sorry.

274
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,220
I didn't take good care of you.

275
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,740
I lost you.

276
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,860
It's all my fault.

277
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,500
From now on, I will never
let you leave my sight again.

278
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,900
Come, let me look at you.

279
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,260
Are you hurt? Did someone bully you?

280
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,540
Of course not!

281
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,020
I am a healer myself,
why would I get hurt?

282
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,980
Yes, you are a healer indeed.

283
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,740
But Brother,

284
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,340
you are hurt.

285
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,780
It's all right, I am fine.

286
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,500
Right, Princess Rong Le said
she will save you.

287
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,260
Come.

288
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,100
I lied to Your Highness.
I deserve to be punished.

289
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,620
From now on, I will leave Zhongshan.

290
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,260
I will hide my identity.

291
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,180
But this has nothing to do with Ke.

292
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,140
Please, Your Highness.
Spare Ke's life.

293
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,820
It's okay.

294
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,860
I know you have your reasons.

295
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,780
Your sister was imprisoned
and my brother used her as hostage.

296
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,820
He forced you to assassinate
Prince Zhen Bei at the lake.

297
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
But I was there so you
failed the mission.

298
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,060
I can tell you still have
some attachment for us.

299
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,460
You are still loyal to me.

300
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,460
From now on, I will
take good care of her.

301
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,140
I won't let them hurt you again.

302
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,060
Your Highness' kindness...

303
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,340
shall be remembered to the day I die!

304
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,300
Ke, help your brother up.

305
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,820
Brother, get up.

306
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,740
Ke, tend to his wound.

307
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,100
Xiao Sha.

308
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,060
Your life is mine as well.

309
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,900
Please take care of yourself.

310
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,700
I put you in danger for times.

311
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,060
I failed your trust.

312
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,220
This isn't your fault.

313
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,180
But I never thought that...

314
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,700
even if you grew up
together with my brother,

315
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,460
he still blackmails you.

316
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,540
For him, loyal officers
and his own sister...

317
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,660
are both expandable for his ambition.

318
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,860
When I see you,
I finally realize that...

319
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,140
this is what it meant
to be brother and sister.

320
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,340
Your Highness, the Emperor is...

321
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,740
Do not say his name.

322
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,820
After all that happened,

323
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,860
I lost my trust in him.

324
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Sir Xiao, get the wound dressed.

325
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,860
Princess Rong Le,
you can trust my brother.

326
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,060
You know, my brother talked
about you all the time.

327
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,540
He said you are beautiful and kind.

328
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,740
Your treat your servants like
they are your friends.

329
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,620
He found me a few days ago.

330
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,420
He said he wounded you by accident.

331
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,420
He wanted me to treat your injury.

332
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,060
But for some reason,
he said you don't need me anymore.

333
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,420
He is always see-sawing
with his words.

334
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,060
Ke, don't talk about nonsense
in front of Her Highness.

335
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,580
It's okay.

336
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,580
Ke is an innocent girl, I like her.

337
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,780
Right, I heard you know about healing.

338
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,500
You learned it from
the master that took you?

339
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,980
Your Highness, Ke's master
is the Lone Frost Sage.

340
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Zhao Yun's marriage is a reality.

341
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,140
This is her decision.

342
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,260
We must respect her decision.

343
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,940
You are here mourning for losing her
and forgot about the world.

344
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,140
She wouldn't want
to see you like this.

345
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,340
Brother.

346
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,820
I know you are right.

347
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,620
But I just can't forget about her.

348
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,780
I was too stubborn.

349
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,540
I only wanted to have fun.

350
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,580
I should've responded
to her love sooner.

351
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,740
I always see her as a kid.

352
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,420
I want to wait until she grows up.

353
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,740
But I never thought...

354
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,340
the one person that never grew up...

355
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,260
is me.

356
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,860
I only learned the same
lesson recently.

357
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,580
Sometimes,

358
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,900
we can't control everything.

359
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,500
Perhaps by the time
you learned to give up,

360
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,220
that is when you finally grow up.

361
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
Your Highness.

362
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,580
Your Highness.

363
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,940
It's all right, go on.

364
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,020
Your Highness.

365
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,900
Prince Zhen Bei sent this for you.

366
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,820
In order to repay your rescue
and as your friend,

367
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,820
while you have this token,
he will fulfill one request for you.

368
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,020
No matter when or where,
if Your Highness needs help,

369
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,540
this token can be used
to get the help from him.

370
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,780
The other jade pendant was
given to Princess Rong Le.

371
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,260
This is his offer.
We should accept it.

372
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,060
How is Prince Zhen Bei's journey?

373
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,220
According to the report
of Hidden Ones' agent,

374
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,740
they made it past the border.
Everything went well.

375
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,060
Fu Chou didn't make
any suspicious move.

376
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,300
Good.

377
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,260
-You may go now.
-Yes.

378
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,580
Brother, you had everything planned.

379
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,460
I was too obsessed with my own loss.

380
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,340
I never thought about how
to ensure her safety...

381
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,700
and take care of her.

382
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,900
After this experience,

383
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,380
you will surely learn about love.

384
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,500
If you are still frustrated...

385
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,860
and have some free time with you,

386
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,260
perhaps you can run
an errand for me.

387
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,100
What do you need from me?
It's time to get back on my feet.

388
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,820
I want to share your burden.

389
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,980
The agent of Hidden Ones told me...

390
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,140
that bodyguard in General's manor...

391
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,980
fought with the brother of
Crown Prince's wife...

392
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,380
over a girl in the public house
because of jealousy.

393
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,820
Even the Empress knows about this.

394
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,260
Even Xiao Sha started to spend time
at that dissolute place.

395
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,380
But Brother,

396
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,100
do they need us for
this trivial matter?

397
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,540
Zhao Yun ran into so much danger
because of the marriage.

398
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,940
Man Yao risked her life to
save Zhao Yun.

399
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,140
Don't you think you should be
in the General's manor...

400
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,580
to express your gratitude?

401
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,780
Right, you have a point.

402
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,860
I should thank Man Yao for saving her.

403
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,660
Then, I can send
your regard to Man Yao.

404
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,740
How is she?

405
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,020
Are you sure you know?

406
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
Ling Yue, be patient.

407
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Ke is the apprentice
of Lone Frost Sage.

408
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,220
Her knowledge in healing
must be top-notched.

409
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,780
I heard that Lone Frost Sage...

410
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,620
has vast knowledge about healing
and is known by many.

411
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,060
She is called the healer of miracle.

412
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,700
But she is arrogant and
has a bad temper.

413
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,220
She always comes and
goes without a trace.

414
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,580
She doesn't like helping either.

415
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,900
Your Highness is right.

416
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,340
His Majesty sent the Hidden Guards
to search for her,

417
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,860
hoping that she would help.

418
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,420
But they returned without any success.

419
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,420
But recently, they found Ke
at her hideout.

420
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,580
Yes, it was those bad guys...

421
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,820
that brought me to that strange place.

422
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,500
There are women everywhere.

423
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,380
There is that stench
of rogue powder too.

424
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,220
They also threatened
my brother that...

425
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,580
if he failed his mission,
they will kill me.

426
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,620
Ke, enough about this matter.

427
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,700
You have been reading
Her Highness' pulse.

428
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Did you find a way
to heal Her Highness?

429
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,620
Princess Rong Le is poisoned.

430
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,540
This poison is very powerful,
I haven't seen that before.

431
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,220
But the medicine she takes
prolonged her life.

432
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,220
Yet, the effects of the medicine
clashes with the poison.

433
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,980
It caused headache and memory loss.

434
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,700
Princess, the poison invaded
your body and made you weak.

435
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,620
All I can do is to make you
live as long as possible.

436
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,980
However, we might find a cure.

437
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,460
Ke, don't be ridiculous.

438
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,580
Her Highness is healed.
She is perfectly fine.

439
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,860
Ling Yue.

440
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,340
Ke, thank you.
After so long,

441
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,540
you are the first to be
so honest with me.

442
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,940
From now on,
you can stay here with me.

443
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,660
Let me protect you, okay?

444
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,700
Okay, we can be good friends.

445
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,540
<i>Princess, the poison invaded
your body and made you weak.</i>

446
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,580
<i>All I can do is to make you
live as long as possible.</i>

447
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,260
<i>However, we might find a cure.</i>

448
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,900
Time flies like an arrow.

449
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,740
But as I reach the end of my life,

450
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,540
I feel like there are much to be done.

451
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,540
Your Highness.

452
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,340
Ke was just being ridiculous.

453
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,100
It wasn't so bad.
She was exaggerating.

454
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,860
You don't have to cheer me up.

455
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,620
I don't see this as a problem.

456
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,740
After all, Ke might still
find a cure for this poison.

457
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,980
It's just that...

458
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,140
I don't want to live a life
without any purpose.

459
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,340
I want to know who I am...

460
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,820
and what I am capable of.

461
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,980
Your Highness.

462
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,180
You are still young and beautiful.

463
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,420
Why would you think about your death?

464
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,260
I just hope...

465
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,420
I can have a chance...

466
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,860
to escape from this cage
that binds me.

467
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,900
I must control my own fate,

468
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,020
live a life of my own.

469
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Your Majesty.

470
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,940
I have escorted Prince Zhen Bei and
Princess Zhao Yun to Chen.

471
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,860
-Everything went smoothly.
-At ease.

472
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,140
Much obliged.

473
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,180
Nicely done.

474
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,900
The alliance of the
two nations is now formed.

475
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,500
Prince Zhen Bei sent us
the first-rate horses.

476
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,140
It will help strengthen our cavalries.

477
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,100
The campaign against Wei
must be set in motion.

478
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,620
The Crown Prince and I have
been planning for this campaign.

479
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,060
I think His Highness is the
best man to lead our forces.

480
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,060
Never mind.
I have someone...

481
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,660
for that task.

482
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,780
Prince Fan Yang.

483
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,860
What does Your majesty need?

484
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,180
Go and find out if Wu You
is busy with any work.

485
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Bring him to the royal study
to discuss our tactical plans.

486
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,660
I am putting him in charge
of the campaign.

487
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,220
Father!

488
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,300
Wu You is always busy.

489
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,140
I am willing to take his place...

490
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,900
and give it my all for the campaign.

491
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,820
Very well.
In that case,

492
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,180
I have something of
utmost importance for you.

493
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,780
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your wish is my command.

494
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,420
The first-rate horses from Chen...

495
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,260
have arrived.

496
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,660
I assign you to supervise
the breeding process.

497
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,940
If they can't produce horses
that are capable for the battle,

498
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,700
you will be responsible for it.

499
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,620
Father.

500
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
I don't know anything...

501
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,860
about breeding horses.

502
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,140
But I have a feeling...

503
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,980
you are best suited for this job.

504
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,180
-But I am...
-Are you seriously...

505
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,060
trying to make a bargain with me?

506
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,860
I wouldn't dare.

507
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,580
I am grateful for Your Majesty trust.

508
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,260
I will carry out my duty.

509
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,340
These are the first-rate horses
from Chen.

510
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,940
Take good care of them.

511
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,820
If this gets in the
way of our campaign,

512
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,380
you will answer for it.

513
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,180
Your Highness, you are asking
for the impossible.

514
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,980
There is this saying.

515
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,260
We each have our own purposes.

516
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,140
Same goes with the horses.

517
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,580
Some are born to be
the best of its kind.

518
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,300
Some are born to be useless.

519
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,580
You...

520
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,820
What is the meaning of this?

521
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,140
You are mocking me with the horses?

522
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,220
How dare you!

523
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,660
-Your Highness!
-You said I am useless!

524
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,340
Your Highness, this was
a misunderstanding.

525
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,980
That was not what I meant.

526
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,060
I have other matters to see to.

527
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,900
I must get the best feed
for the horses.

528
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,540
If Your Highness is in a hurry,

529
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,340
you can have a look at the horses.

530
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,820
-What?
-I have to leave now.

531
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,740
Stop right there!

532
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,700
Guards!

533
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,620
Guards!

534
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,100
-Stop standing there!
-Your Highness.

535
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,100
Scram!

536
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,460
A bunch of insolent servants.

537
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,700
Get lost.
Get out of my sight.

538
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,180
Get out of here.

539
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,220
Help me get changed
before you leave!

540
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,420
You...

541
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,340
You have never ran away
so quickly before.

542
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,100
What happened, Your Highness?

543
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,540
Enough about it.

544
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,460
The job my father gave me...

545
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,580
is hard and tiring.

546
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,660
That old fool is trying
to make a slave out of me.

547
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,820
General.

548
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,820
This is all your fault.

549
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,860
If you hadn't help
Zongzheng Wu You...

550
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,060
in the matter with
marriage alliance of Chen,

551
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,780
none of these would have happened.

552
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,820
Your Highness, the two of us...

553
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,500
are in the same boat.
If I fall, so will you.

554
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,860
Blaming me won't bring you any good.

555
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I got my power and status
because of my achievements.

556
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,540
I can still stand tall in the
Imperial Court without you.

557
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,500
As for you,

558
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,140
without me on your side,

559
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,180
do you really think
the Imperial Court...

560
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,700
will have a place for you?

561
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,620
You are right.

562
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,740
I was being rude.

563
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I hope you are not offended.

564
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,020
Okay?

565
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,500
The two of us...

566
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,900
are now mutually dependant.

567
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,900
If you wish to get what
you always wanted,

568
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,260
you will need my help.

569
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,580
Yes.

570
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,740
I will listen to whatever
you have to say.

571
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,260
What you need to do now is to
change His Majesty's view on you.

572
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,580
Such as...

573
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,420
staying away from women.

574
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
Greetings, General Fu.

575
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,540
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

576
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,820
Your Highness.

577
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,900
I have to go now.

578
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,500
Sure, General Fu.

579
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,900
Xiang.

580
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,020
Xiang, from now on,

581
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,780
you need to keep
your distance from me.

582
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,420
I must focus on my work.

583
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,580
I need to earn my father's trust.

584
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,020
Yes.

585
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,700
Xiang.

586
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,180
Help me get changed before you go!

587
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
But you did tell me
to keep you at a distance.

588
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,380
I must follow your order
and leave you be.

589
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,740
You...

590
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,660
A bunch of ingrates!

591
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,940
You have no respect for me at all!

592
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,300
I must thank you for earlier.

593
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,380
I know.

594
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,820
After so many years,

595
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,140
if you made me a promise,

596
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,220
you always did your best to help me.

597
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,740
Right?

598
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,700
But you cannot let your guard down.

599
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,300
You come and go from
the palace too often.

600
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,340
It's easy to make a mistake.

601
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,140
I know.

602
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,540
But it's different today.
Today is a day for your vengeance.

603
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,500
On this day every year,

604
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,260
I must be here for you.

605
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Okay.

606
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,580
We should get going.

607
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,380
Every time you come here,

608
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,900
you set up a reminder for yourself...

609
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,460
that you cannot forget
all the vengeance you have.

610
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,500
I have never forgotten
about this day.

611
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,660
I think you got used to it.

612
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,660
A little blood and wound...

613
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,060
weren't enough to make you
hasten the progress.

614
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
You...

615
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,540
are a disappointment to your mother.

616
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,260
Let him go.

617
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,940
Don't bring up my mother on this.

618
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,660
This is my own mission.

619
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,580
It has nothing to do with the Creed.

620
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,020
Don't forget what you said.

621
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,300
You need to be decisive.

622
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,620
You need know you are
born for greatness!

623
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,940
Don't worry, Master.

624
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,460
Fu Chou has set
the plan in motion.

625
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,100
Good.

626
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,460
So this is the Princess' house?

627
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,700
It's so big!

628
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,060
It's huge, isn't it?

629
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,780
Xiao Ke, remember to
have fun here, okay?

630
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,140
Stay here.

631
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,860
Ling Yue.

632
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,220
Greetings, Prince Chen.

633
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,500
I am here for Man Yao.
Please inform her.

634
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,820
Yes.

635
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,700
Who are you?

636
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,940
Are you the new servant here?

637
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,620
You are quite the bold one.

638
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,140
How dare you stare at me.

639
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,780
Man Yao never bothered
to lecture the servants.

640
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,980
-He is so annoying.
-You are the first to be so rude.

641
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,380
He is so annoying.
Stop talking!

642
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,620
You have quite the sharp tongue.

643
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,540
But you do look like a cute girl.

644
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,260
What is this smell?

645
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,660
I feel so itchy!

646
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,860
-What did you do to me?
-Nothing.

647
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,020
I sprayed some of my newly
invented poison powder on you.

648
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,300
You shouldn't have disrespected me.
