00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:32,775
Episode 36

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,180
Where is Wu you?

4
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,222
I want to see him.

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,468
If you want him to survive,

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,869
you need to stay alive.

7
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,423
If you die...

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,840
I am not trying to threaten you.

9
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,227
He being alive...

10
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,587
could only serve one purpose.

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,817
If you take good care of yourself,

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
you will see him eventually.

13
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:09,966
Leave.

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,930
Rong Le, I know you hate me.

15
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,777
You won't believe or listen to
what I have to say.

16
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,920
The damage is done.

17
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,537
I won't deny my responsibility.

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,785
This is all my fault.

19
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,272
I failed to protect you.

20
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,731
A traitor swapped her with you
and I didn't notice.

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,072
I didn't recognise you at once.

22
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,593
I won't ask you to forgive me.

23
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,972
I just want you to know...

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,224
that I will find...

25
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:54,108
the man that hurt us.

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,406
I will make him pay dearly.

27
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,705
Rest well.

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,769
Your Highness!

29
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,401
Ling Yue.

30
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,301
Your Highness.

31
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,935
Ling Yue, you should have some rest.

32
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,037
Your Highness, Prince Li
wants you to have this.

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,834
What is the situation outside?

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,483
Prince Chen and his soldiers
retreat to the south.

35
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,025
The Crown Prince is deposed.

36
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,240
General Fu uses the Golden Scroll
and Phoenix Seal to control the Court.

37
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,640
All the officers are
under his command.

38
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,450
Any news from the Hidden Ones?

39
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,634
Prince Li is severely wounded.

40
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,177
He was captured by the General.

41
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,240
But I doubt General Fu
will do anything reckless.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,919
Besides, he came prepared.

43
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,085
All of Prince Li's troops
fell into General Fu's hand.

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,864
Fu Chou had everything planned.

45
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:24,449
It's flawless.

46
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:27,878
Xiang Ying, with your
knowledge about him,

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,565
where would he keep Wu You?

48
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,589
I have been asking around
for the past few days.

49
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,240
Everything is normal at the manor.
So, Prince Li is not there.

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,071
But the royal palace
is heavily guarded.

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,012
Guards are watching the Cold Palace.

52
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,664
No one is allowed to pass.

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,345
I think he could be there.

54
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,583
Do you know which Cold Palace
Fu Yuan was imprisoned in?

55
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,733
It was Senyan Palace.
Empress Fu burned herself to death.

56
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,274
Half of the palace
perished with her.

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,750
It's still abandoned until today.

58
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,164
Xiao Sha.

59
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,442
Your Highness.

60
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,047
Keep watch on Fu Chou's whereabouts.

61
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,409
Inform me at once
if he enters the palace.

62
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,133
You need to be cautious,
do not let him see you.

63
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,476
Yes.

64
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,208
For now,

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,395
I must recover my strength.

66
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,153
Xiang Ying, find me a good sword.

67
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,894
From now on, I must
start training my swordplay.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,051
-But your illness...
-I am fine.

69
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,690
I know my own limits.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,480
I must get stronger.

71
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,535
I can't let the others use me...

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,325
or disrespect me.

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
Yes.

74
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
Open the door.

75
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,246
You are even more
cunning than I thought.

76
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,126
I never understand why my father...

77
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:26,457
would kill the consort
he loved the most.

78
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,459
Now that I saw what
happened to Man Yao,

79
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,026
I finally know the truth.

80
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,430
Fu Yuan must have...

81
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:37,510
laced the Shilixiang wine sent by
my teacher with poison.

82
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,524
And now, you are using
the same poison.

83
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,661
You used Man Yao against me.

84
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,031
I am in your hands now.

85
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,148
Kill me if you want.

86
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,722
Why do you bother with torturing me?

87
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,283
This drug will keep the poison
at bay and keep you alive.

88
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,760
We have score to settle,
I won't let you die so easily.

89
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,051
Zongzheng Wu You.

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,346
After so many years,

91
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:41,582
I have always longed for the day...

92
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,984
I could finally lock you up in here
and step on you.

93
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,794
I will watch as you bow down to me.

94
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,033
I am going to return
the pain and suffering...

95
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:53,961
my mother and I had back to you.

96
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,129
Who are you?

97
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
You should have known who I am by now.

98
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,809
One who could hate you so much...

99
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,933
to lock you up in here...

100
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:13,011
and pierce your wound with steel,

101
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,263
who else could that be?

102
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,592
Impossible.

103
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,527
You are the son of Fu Yuan.

104
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,735
How could you still be alive?

105
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,589
I wanted to be dead.

106
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,524
Yes, I am alive.

107
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,381
Not only that,

108
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,484
I am also going to take back
what is rightfully mine!

109
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,855
Fu Chou!

110
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,387
What did you do to my father?

111
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:42,894
Did you kill him?

112
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,332
You killed your own father!

113
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:47,932
He has no right to be my father!
He has no right!

114
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,870
Well,

115
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,944
I realised the world
is never fair to me.

116
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,457
Why was I the one
who were hunted down?

117
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,014
Here is something you never know.

118
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,142
While we were...

119
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,325
still mere children,

120
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,639
my so-called father hunted me
to have me killed.

121
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,507
Back then,

122
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,796
I lost my name and my home.

123
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,400
I live in the wild
without any shelter.

124
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,323
What about you?

125
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,542
When you were a child,

126
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:32,067
in this magnificent palace,

127
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,420
you enjoyed so much love
from your father.

128
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:37,842
You lived a life without worries.

129
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,217
And there is Rong Le.

130
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,928
You used her for your bidding
and you hurt her,

131
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,850
but she is...

132
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:49,362
still madly in love with you
and misses you all the time.

133
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,011
Fu Chou.

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,680
You really are the son of Fu Yuan.

135
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,026
You are just as shameless as she is.

136
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,520
Fu Chou.

137
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,158
What did you do to Man Yao?

138
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,987
You are just a prisoner.

139
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,274
Why would you care for the others?

140
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,704
Fu Yuan is dead because
she brought it onto herself.

141
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,570
Because of her own grudge,

142
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:58,739
the Qin family was executed.

143
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:00,504
She should be punished.

144
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,557
But you,

145
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,235
you spent your life
in vengeance and hate.

146
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:06,765
You have no honour at all!

147
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,377
What if you really become the ruler?

148
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:11,278
It won't last long for you.

149
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,670
You will die a lonely old man.

150
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,692
Who says I will die a lonely old man?

151
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:24,377
The supreme and all mighty throne
will soon be mine.

152
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,118
As for Rong Le,

153
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
she will become my empress.

154
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
As for you,

155
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,695
for the rest of your life,

156
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,345
this chain will be your only friend.

157
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,372
You don't understand her at all.

158
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:47,687
Do you honestly think she will
stay by your side after this?

159
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:50,800
Empress?

160
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,558
She never cares about titles.

161
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,690
She will rather die than
be your empress.

162
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,090
You want to grow old with her?

163
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,364
That is just your wishful fantasy.

164
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,543
She loved me and yet she was
so cruel to me in the end.

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,318
To make it worse,

166
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,768
she never had any love for you.

167
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,164
You...

168
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:31,103
are right about this.

169
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:33,802
She does have love for you.

170
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,050
But for that very reason,

171
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,336
she will behave and be with me.

172
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,560
We must act with cautions.
Do not alert the enemy.

173
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,540
Fu Chou is wary of us.

174
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,776
There must be guards
hidden in this area.

175
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,590
If he finds out we know
where Wu You is,

176
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,268
he will hide Wu You to somewhere else.

177
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,219
It will be even harder
to track him down.

178
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,710
Yes.

179
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,731
I know.

180
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,249
It hurts a lot.

181
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,116
Because of the woman you love,

182
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,707
you lost everything.

183
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,447
You even handed over your life...

184
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,041
to your enemy.

185
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Don't you regret this?

186
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,877
Saving the one I love...

187
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,781
is my duty.

188
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:28,455
If I were to be like you...

189
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,240
and ignore my own feelings
to achieve my goal,

190
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,689
that would truly be a great regret.

191
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,982
Fu Chou.

192
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,772
Is it because you have no other way
to vent your anger...

193
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,577
so you came here to torture me?

194
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,878
You have a point.

195
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,898
Your Highness, a fire breaks out.

196
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,200
For your own safety,
please leave at once.

197
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,220
The Hidden Ones sure act with haste.

198
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:06,893
Who would have thought?

199
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,215
They are loyal to you till the end.

200
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,601
Wu You!

201
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
Man Yao.

202
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,906
Wu You.

203
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,224
Your hair...

204
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,402
Man Yao.

205
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,429
These are small wounds.

206
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,966
I am a warrior.
I'll be fine.

207
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,951
See?

208
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,237
Man Yao.

209
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,827
Listen to me.

210
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,040
This is not your fault.

211
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,322
This place is full of danger.
You must go, now.

212
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:17,955
Send more men to put out the fire.

213
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:20,707
Don't let the fire
spread to Senyan Palace.

214
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,381
Send more men to watch this place.

215
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,989
If you see anyone suspicious,
kill on sight.

216
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,274
Yes.

217
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,068
Leave.

218
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,857
More guards will be here.
Leave before it's too late.

219
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,195
I...

220
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:37,871
I will find the Hidden Ones.

221
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,802
I won't let you stay here
and get tortured.

222
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,471
Take care of yourself.

223
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,917
Do not be controlled because of me.

224
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,282
Wait for me.

225
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,005
Open the door.

226
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,765
Your Highness.

227
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
This is a good sword.

228
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:45,610
I am glad you like it.

229
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:47,721
It was worth it to search for it.

230
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,577
You have my thanks.

231
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,327
You can go now.

232
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,602
Yes.

233
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:57,910
Xiao Sha.

234
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,064
Have you found Ke?

235
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,342
Don't worry.

236
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,957
She has been in Prince Li's manor
to search for a cure.

237
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,436
She is safe for now.

238
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:09,117
Prince Li's manor is being
guarded by Fu Chou's men.

239
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,992
She is in danger
when she is alone there.

240
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,860
Get ready.

241
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,706
We are heading to the manor.

242
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:17,165
Yes.

243
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,680
Here comes the tea.

244
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,082
You said the mutiny was
to fight for Princes Rong Le.

245
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,553
Is it true?

246
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:40,991
Of course it's true.

247
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:42,929
With Prince Li's reputation,

248
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,556
why would he launch a mutiny?

249
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,623
The love for woman
is the cause of all fightings.

250
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:49,080
It's better if women
don't look too pretty.

251
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:51,749
Otherwise they would bring
chaos to this world.

252
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:52,992
Xiao Sha.

253
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,644
Forget it.

254
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,013
Why would the General...

255
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,157
No, I mean our future emperor...

256
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,466
actually announced to the world...

257
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,480
to make her the empress.

258
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,775
-What about the image of the land?
-You are right.

259
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,398
You are gossiping about the
royal family in broad daylight and...

260
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,760
spreading lies.

261
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,160
You should have known
to mind your words!

262
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,680
-Leave.
-Let's go.

263
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,501
Help!

264
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,962
Help my child, help him!

265
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,509
Help my child!

266
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,535
Please, help my child!

267
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,027
-Madam!
-Please help my son!

268
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
Please, save my son!

269
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:32,216
He is innocent!
Please, I beg of you!

270
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:34,888
-Madam!
-Save me!

271
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,480
Madam!

272
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,960
-Help my child! Please!
-Stop right there!

273
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
Please, save my son!

274
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:45,945
My son is innocent!

275
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,308
-Please, help my son!
-Your Highness.

276
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,930
Please, help my child.

277
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:55,747
-Don't let then kill him.
-Madam.

278
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,349
Can you please save this lady?

279
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:00,191
-He is innocent.
-We all take pity on her.

280
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:02,211
Her husband left her
when she was young.

281
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,533
She lost her child too.

282
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:04,950
Her face is scarred.

283
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,665
I beg of you.

284
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,141
Xiao Sha.

285
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,687
-Save him.
-Your Highness?

286
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,640
Save my son, please!

287
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,960
Thank you, madam.

288
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:19,344
You are welcome.

289
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,111
I am in a hurry.

290
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,861
I don't want anyone
to get into my way.

291
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,574
Help my child.

292
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:32,223
Don't let them kill him.

293
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:33,838
Don't let them kill him.

294
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:36,187
Don't let them kill him.

295
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,535
Thank you, madam.

296
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,848
Let's go.

297
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
Order from His Highness.
Prince Li is a traitor,

298
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,640
his manor is now sealed off.

299
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,480
Without His Highness' permission,

300
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,036
no one can enter.

301
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:57,540
Open your eyes.

302
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,560
This is the carriage of
the General's house.

303
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,316
How dare you block our way.

304
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,975
Stand aside or get killed.

305
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,251
You don't want to have
a bloodshed here.

306
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,834
Atractylodes is bitter and warm,
it tonifies the spleen.

307
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:15,789
Great Burnet is cold in nature.

308
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,470
It cools down the body heat.

309
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,240
Stemmacantha has great coldness,
a source of iron and cleansing.

310
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:21,965
-It helps muscle growth.
-Ke.

311
00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:23,302
Brother!

312
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,313
Princess, what happened to your hair?

313
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,732
Did the poison cause a relapse?

314
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,205
Don't worry, it's not that.

315
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,065
So why is it then?
You were fine when I left.

316
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,833
What exactly happened to you?

317
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:38,975
Ke.

318
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,040
Much have happened recently.

319
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,256
It's hard to put it in a simple way.

320
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:45,244
I will explain to you later.

321
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,256
Ke, I am here to visit you...

322
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:53,633
because I want to know
if you are well.

323
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,546
I am glad to see you are okay.

324
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
More guards have come here.

325
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,052
They all look sinister to me.

326
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:02,660
But I am too lazy to go out.
So they don't bother me at all.

327
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,511
You cannot stay here.

328
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,018
Your brother and I are here
to take you with us.

329
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:10,306
No, it's not easy to
get a place so quiet.

330
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,485
I need to research on
the remedy my master left...

331
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,085
and find a cure to cleanse
the poison in you.

332
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,000
-But...
-Princess.

333
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:18,934
This is the antidote I made.

334
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,400
It can ease your conditions.

335
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,930
Let me read your pulse.

336
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,357
Ke, I feel absent-minded lately.

337
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,841
I can't sleep well either.

338
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,800
Can you give me some medicine
to help with my sleep?

339
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,360
I understand.

340
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,117
I shall go now.

341
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,641
Miss Xiao is dear to me.

342
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,570
If any of you tries
to disrespect her...

343
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,815
to let her get hurt,

344
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,337
-Agent Wu.
-I will show no mercy.

345
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,769
Yes.

346
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,400
Is that all?

347
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:22,449
I told everything that I know.

348
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,315
With Rong Le's temper,

349
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:27,638
she won't surrender so easily.

350
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:29,617
Try to recall the details.

351
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,767
Was there any suspicious
contact between them?

352
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:36,487
I watched closely as
she made every move.

353
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,855
There was nothing suspicious.

354
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,227
Good.

355
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,999
Right,

356
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:45,043
any progress on the Imperial Seal?

357
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
I sent my men to everywhere
we could search.

358
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,699
We haven't found anything for now.

359
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,324
The capital is not a giant haystack.

360
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:54,840
It's not like the Seal would grow
a pair of wings and fly away.

361
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,034
Yes, I will keep searching.

362
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:59,914
What about Lady Rong Le's wound?

363
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,897
According to the servants
that tend to her,

364
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,614
compared to days ago,
her wound has become even worse.

365
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:08,656
What? Didn't the physician
dress the wound?

366
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:11,671
General, Lady Rong Le
trains her swordplay every night.

367
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,792
Her wound has become worse.
The physician advised her.

368
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,421
But she wouldn't listen.

369
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,446
Also, I have found the mad woman
that has been pestering her.

370
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,404
I brought her in for interrogation.

371
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:23,457
None of her words make sense.

372
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:25,373
She kept talking about her son.

373
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:28,274
-She said her son is...
-I don't want to know about mad lady.

374
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,669
If it happens again,
deal with her yourself.

375
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,691
General, there is a letter
from the south.

376
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,280
<i>If you still remember our agreement,</i>

377
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:49,543
<i>please take care of
my daughter for me.</i>

378
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,942
<i>If not, this is the end
of our alliance.</i>

379
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,330
When are you taking me to him?

380
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,143
My mind will not be at ease
unless I see him.

381
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:31,715
Your affection will
mean nothing to me.

382
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,123
Fu Chou, if you want me
to stay in this manor,

383
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,445
don't you dare try to torture him.

384
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,226
Rong Le.

385
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:44,192
Do you mean if I treat him nice,

386
00:28:44,818 --> 00:28:46,716
you will stay by my side forever?

387
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,801
As long as you are with me,

388
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,105
and Zongzheng Wu You
leaves this nation,

389
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,927
you have my word I will release him.

390
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,122
All the grudge we had...

391
00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:58,704
will be wiped clean.

392
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,402
Are you certain you can do that?

393
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:02,910
You would even have me
under house arrest.

394
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:06,395
-Why would you let him go?
-You are not under house arrest.

395
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,079
I am afraid...

396
00:29:08,252 --> 00:29:10,924
you might face more dangers
when you go out there.

397
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,303
Fine.

398
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,932
You have my word.

399
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,634
From now on,

400
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,922
you may go wherever you want.

401
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,222
I will send out the order.

402
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,618
But you must promise me one thing.

403
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:30,556
Take more guards with you
when you go out.

404
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:32,354
Safety first.

405
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:34,433
Now that you have the throne,

406
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,859
why can't you show him
some toleration?

407
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:39,101
It's not that I don't want to.

408
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,486
It's because he and I can
never see eye to eye.

409
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:46,351
Think about this.
If he is the one that won today,

410
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:48,420
do you think he would let me go?

411
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,009
With his capable mind,

412
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,021
he will rise up again sooner or later.

413
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,035
He must leave the Northern Realm.

414
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,206
When the day comes,

415
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:01,036
the nation will be threatened
and there will be pandemonium.

416
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,128
The world will never know peace again.

417
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:04,560
Forget it.

418
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,917
Just leave.

419
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,231
I don't want another word from you.

420
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,437
You will die for betraying our Master.

421
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,317
Hen Xiang, you sneaked out
while the creed is retreating.

422
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,048
Apologise to our Master now!

423
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,381
Not a chance.

424
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,240
I would rather choose
death now that I escaped.

425
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,360
I will not return to
being a pawn again!

426
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,616
You are persistent.

427
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,350
You're special since you were a child.

428
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,468
Even the Young Master
holds high remark for you.

429
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:11,009
But you have betrayed him.

430
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,807
There is no one to
save your skin this time.

431
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:15,197
You are heavily wounded.
You are no match for us.

432
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:16,540
Surrender!

433
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,628
Perhaps I can plea for you.

434
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,500
Enough of your chatter.
Bring it on!

435
00:32:58,417 --> 00:32:59,517
Your wound is bad.

436
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,171
Let me dress it for you.

437
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,129
I am taking you to a clinic,
come with me.

438
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:05,937
Don't bother.

439
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,206
I can walk on my own.

440
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,120
Do you seriously still have
hope for General Fu?

441
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,159
Because you were set up that day,

442
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,081
Lady Rong Le suffers
great humiliation.

443
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,367
Her hair has gone white.

444
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,240
With the General's love for her,
he will surely be in regret...

445
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,694
and hate you to the bone.

446
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,956
What does it matter?

447
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,040
Both you and General Fu
lost your fathers.

448
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:34,283
Both of you were raised
under harsh condition.

449
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:36,150
When you relied on one another,

450
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:38,362
it's normal if he thinks
you are better than anyone.

451
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:40,341
But once you walked out
from the hardship,

452
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,456
seeing you would remind him
of his miserable past.

453
00:33:46,112 --> 00:33:47,483
He may have trusted you,

454
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,072
but he will never love you.

455
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,751
If you still insist on going to him,

456
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:59,032
he will surely kill you.

457
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,741
Hen Xiang, don't rush
to your own death.

458
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,942
You deserve a better life.

459
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,908
The Creed is retreating.

460
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,715
They have no time to go after you.

461
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,008
Wherever you want to go,

462
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,085
whatever you plan to do,

463
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,344
I will gladly help you.

464
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:22,558
After so many years,

465
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,080
you are the only person
that truly cares for me.

466
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,880
But for that same reason,

467
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,760
I cannot let you be involved.

468
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,240
Do you still have feeling
for General Fu?

469
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,916
Feelings or not,

470
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,889
it doesn't matter.

471
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,487
I had my revenge.

472
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,128
He got what's rightfully his.

473
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,506
My goals are completed.

474
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,490
I have no other desires.

475
00:34:55,244 --> 00:34:56,923
Is this why you want to get killed?

476
00:34:57,122 --> 00:34:58,647
Only scoundrel would live
to survive, how could you...

477
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:02,137
Don't worry. It wasn't easy to
crawl out of that hellhole.

478
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,125
I won't end my life so easily.

479
00:35:05,695 --> 00:35:06,907
I am just tired.

480
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,274
I am tired of living
a life full of fightings.

481
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,145
You...

482
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,196
What will you do next?

483
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,497
When my parents were alive,

484
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,878
they wanted me and my sister
to have a normal life.

485
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,127
Now that my sister
is no longer with us,

486
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,654
I want to fulfil this wish for her.

487
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,720
My hands...

488
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,394
are stained with too much blood.

489
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,273
Even I am disgusted.

490
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,361
Don't come any closer.

491
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,600
Not even death scares you.

492
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:02,934
But you are afraid of me?

493
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:04,954
Do you really think...

494
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,109
I am more terrifying than death?

495
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:10,646
If you could be so cruel
to your own wife,

496
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,367
you will surely do the same to me.

497
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,347
Rather than being locked up in here...

498
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:19,553
or being use as a hostage
against my father,

499
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,812
I should just put an end to this.

500
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,560
You can use me as your pawn
or make me a prisoner,

501
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,840
but you cannot stop me
from seeking my death!

502
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,964
Don't you hate me,

503
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,670
want to have your
revenge and kill me?

504
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,627
Hating you and having revenge
won't make a difference.

505
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,572
Even if I kill you,

506
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:58,044
the righteous and humble
gentlemen in my heart,

507
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,895
the general that fights
despite all of his wounds,

508
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:07,413
the hero that protects
the people from our enemy...

509
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,227
will never come back to me.

510
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,561
A hero?

511
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,551
Do you know how your so-called hero...

512
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,695
is made into the man he is today?

513
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:27,503
I was abandoned by my father.

514
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,799
He even sent assassins to kill me.

515
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,857
I was raised in hell.

516
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,640
On the battlefield, I risked
my life to slay the enemy.

517
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,185
I have been through
life and death countless times.

518
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,280
I carry all sort of wounds,

519
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,313
there are scars everywhere.

520
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:45,981
Do you know any of these?

521
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,245
All you saw...

522
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,331
was the glory of a general.

523
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,322
You never saw the pain
behind those glory.

524
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,120
Sun Ya Li, don't make it
hard for yourself.

525
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,861
You were never truly in love
with me from the start.

526
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,308
What you love...

527
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,708
was your own fantasy.

528
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:08,315
No, that is not true!

529
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,213
You were a different person.

530
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,961
This is what I've always been!

531
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,377
The life I was given...

532
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:19,029
is full of plottings and scheme,

533
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:21,093
treachery and evils.

534
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,120
I was never a big hero.
That is not what I wanted.

535
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,214
No one can force me to be a hero!

536
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,311
Sun Ya Li.

537
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,320
Every time you
see me with admiration,

538
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:36,045
I give it some thoughts.

539
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,966
A delicate lady of the noble
that had a perfect life...

540
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,182
will feel like she is
above everyone...

541
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,752
but has no idea...

542
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,322
how ignorant and shallow she is.

543
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,114
I finally understand
why Princess Rong Le...

544
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,807
never loves you.

545
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:07,186
Yes, I have no idea
what you went through.

546
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:10,154
But you never told me about your past.

547
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:13,167
I love how brave and bold
you are on the battlefield.

548
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,628
I like how humble you were to people.

549
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,879
That was the side of you
that you showed me!

550
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:21,799
Was it my fault to love you...

551
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,855
for what you showed me?

552
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,705
You so heartlessly stepped
on my love for you.

553
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,860
Do you really feel joy in it?

554
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:42,799
I don't need your love.

555
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,670
My love is for Rong Le alone.

556
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,971
But that very person...

557
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,871
will never truly be in love with you.

558
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,479
You want to taunt me into killing you.

559
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,580
I will never fall for that.

560
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,561
If you had seen hell,
you would have known...

561
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,833
how fortunate you are
to be even alive.

562
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,603
Sun Ya Li.

563
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,217
You said I stepped on your love.

564
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,214
You on the other hand...

565
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:24,804
is wasting away your own life.

566
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,808
You are your father's only daughter.

567
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,426
If you die,

568
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,540
he will lost the will to live.

569
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,985
Please, don't hurt my father.

570
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,038
Maybe you are right.

571
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:46,522
I was...

572
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,049
never truly in love with you.

573
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,050
But ever since I met you,

574
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:54,488
every action that I tried
so hard to accomplish...

575
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,062
was to get one step closer to you.

576
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,267
What happened to me today...

577
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,057
was because of my own foolishness.

578
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,427
I don't wish to hate you.

579
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,567
I have but one advice for you.

580
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,010
Maybe your feelings for Rong Le...

581
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:13,644
is just the same as mine for you.

582
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,698
This is not true love.

583
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:17,846
You just wanted to best Prince Li.

584
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:19,511
Let it go.

585
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,553
Going astray on this path...

586
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,307
will make you suffer
the same consequences as mine.

587
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,644
You are not me.

588
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,615
Don't draw your own conclusion.
