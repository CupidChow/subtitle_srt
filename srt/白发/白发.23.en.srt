Episode 23

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,260
Xiang, what's wrong?

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,140
Lady Xiang seems to be
in the mood for wine.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,660
Stop drinking.

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,180
I just remembered.

7
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,100
I visited you many times,

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,100
but I never met your wife.

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,980
I shall meet her right now.
With such a good wine,

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,580
we must share it together.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,660
Xiang, you are so thoughtful.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,100
Take your time.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,300
I have something important
to discuss with General Fu.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,780
Go on.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,780
Watch out.

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,780
Much appreciated , Lady Xiang.

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,020
However, my wife doesn't drink.

18
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,540
Let me take you to her.

19
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,860
General Fu.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,580
Xiang, go to her on your own.

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,660
General Fu, you slay the enemies
without hesitation.

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,860
But you are so indecisive
when it comes to women.

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,820
You can learn more
about women from me.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,020
They just like clothings.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,540
They keep you warm in the winter,

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,460
in other occasions,
they can be shown off.

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,580
But the clothings...

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,100
must be disposed of
when time calls for it.

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,540
It's just a clothing.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,740
There is no need to hesitate.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,860
Your Highness?

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,740
Your Highness?

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,980
Your Highness, are you all right?
You are drunk.

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,260
Let me put this away for you.

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,420
If General Fu sees this,
you will have a fight again.

36
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,780
So be it then!

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,660
I am not afraid.

38
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,700
A fight is not against the rules.
I have nothing to fear.

39
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,820
Relax.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,980
I will obey the rules and
stay inside the manor.

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,500
He can lock me up,

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,900
but he can never have my heart.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,700
I don't even know
if my heart is mine!

44
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,820
You don't even own your heart?

45
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,900
How dare you still live in here.

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,780
Get out of here!

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,740
Lady Xiang!

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,780
Lady Xiang, she is drunk.
Can you come here another time?

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,980
Stand aside!

50
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Even a servant like you
is giving me order.

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,500
I am not.

52
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,900
Don't you have the
slightest respect for me?

53
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,460
No, that is not what I meant.

54
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,860
Lady Xiang?

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,540
Your Highness,
should I get General Fu?

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,820
No!

57
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,940
You are his wife.

58
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,820
His heart is all yours.

59
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,460
How could you be thinking
about another man?

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,940
He couldn't even let you get hurt.

61
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,460
He will lose his mind
if he sees this wooden doll!

62
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,940
I can't let you break his heart.

63
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,500
I can't let him see this doll!

64
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,540
-Give it to me!
-No!

65
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,780
Hand it over!

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,260
You have no right to hurt him!

67
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,460
I can't love him.

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,700
I can't marry him.

69
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,420
I can't even meet him.

70
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,500
All I can do is to keep him
inside my heart.

71
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,580
You are married to General Fu.

72
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,660
You heart should be his alone.

73
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,300
You are married to the Crown Prince.

74
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,180
But I had no choice.

75
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
The choice wasn't mine to make!

76
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,500
Same goes for me.

77
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,140
It wasn't me that chose him.

78
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,980
It was you. You disguised as me
and chose to marry him.

79
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,900
If you love him so much,

80
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,500
why don't you stay by his side?

81
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,140
Why don't you live in
this manor with him?

82
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,900
Don't you think I wanted that?

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,860
I loved him since I was a child.

84
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,420
I wanted to marry him...

85
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,940
so I could spend my life with him.

86
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,220
I gave up myself for him willingly...

87
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,140
and marry the Crown Prince.

88
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,300
What about you?

89
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,940
You took him away from me so easily.

90
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,460
You took his heart.

91
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,900
You robbed me of the dream
to live in here!

92
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,500
Do you really think
this is a cosy house?

93
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,020
It's nothing but another prison.

94
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,420
I can barely breathe in here.

95
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,180
I feel like I am being
watched all the time.

96
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,060
What have I done to deserve this?

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,140
You thought he is mine.

98
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,780
But he sees me as his pawn,

99
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,620
not his wife.

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,620
Every time I questioned him,

101
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,460
he put on that candid look for me.

102
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,660
He looked at me with pity.

103
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,620
He made me feel like it's my fault
for not forgiving him.

104
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,700
We are just the same.

105
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,460
We never get to make our own choice.

106
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,340
The Eastern Palace...

107
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,740
is also another cage.

108
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,060
I can't meet the people I miss.

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,820
But I have to be with
the man I hate every day.

110
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,380
I don't even have someone
I can talk to heart-to-heart.

111
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,220
I don't know who I am.

112
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,540
I don't know where my home is.

113
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,780
I don't know my family.

114
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,220
Right.

115
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,420
Where is my home?

116
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,300
Where is my family?

117
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,620
Your Highness.

118
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,020
This is the important matter
you spoke of?

119
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,940
How is it? General Fu,

120
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,660
I worked my fingers
to the bone for this.

121
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,940
I met with all the nobles' daughters
that are close to me.

122
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,420
I hand-picked a dozen of them.

123
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,020
I even got a painter
to draw their portrait.

124
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,660
General Fu.

125
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,580
You have a keen insight
for choosing women.

126
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,460
Lady Rong Le is indeed gorgeous.

127
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,220
So,

128
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,700
I am putting you in charge
of choosing the lady.

129
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,940
But the lady I chose might not
to Prince Zhen Bei's liking.

130
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,100
You should let him do the picking
or you can do it yourself.

131
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,580
Me? No way.

132
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,780
I know how to cherish a fair lady.

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,900
Let's say I chose this lady here.

134
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,340
I couldn't bear to let her
be married to Chen.

135
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,460
General Fu,

136
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,100
you should make the decision on this.

137
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,860
You are loyal to your lover.

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,540
Your heart won't waver
even if you chose.

139
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,740
-But...
-Enough of this chatter.

140
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,820
The risk is imminent for us.

141
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,020
Zongzheng Wu You actually
came back in one piece.

142
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,380
Not only did he
come back with victory,

143
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,540
he even saved Prince Zhen Bei
a couple of days ago.

144
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,940
If he gets ahead of us...

145
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,540
and recommends someone
on his side to the Prince,

146
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,100
the forces of Chen
will be on his side.

147
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,940
We will be sitting ducks.

148
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,060
Your concerns are true.

149
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,780
General.

150
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,260
I heard story that at Lake Qingliang,

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Prince Zhen Bei was not
the only one he saved.

152
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,420
He came to your wife's rescue
in front of everyone.

153
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,460
He is declaring an
open challenge to you.

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,060
There is a feast
in the palace tomorrow.

155
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,420
On the outside, everyone was invited
to view the flowers.

156
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,140
But it was actually meant to
pick a bride for Prince Zhen Bei.

157
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,860
Your Highness, you mean...

158
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,540
you have your lady ready there?

159
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,740
Not only did I arrange a lady
for Prince Zhen Bei,

160
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,300
I also prepared a
great show for Wu You.

161
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,220
I will make him fall hard.

162
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,100
A comeback will be impossible.

163
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,140
What is this great show you mentioned?

164
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,500
You will find out tomorrow.

165
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,940
Right, General Fu.

166
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,620
I am leaving Hen Xiang here
in your house for the night.

167
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,820
-What?
-Just one night.

168
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,700
My wife's family is here.

169
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,820
Her family may have fallen from grace,

170
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,340
but her mother is like a demon!

171
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,060
She is terrifying.

172
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,180
If she finds out about Hen Xiang,

173
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,100
she will charge straight
to His Majesty.

174
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,060
Just a few days ago,
she snitched on me to my mother.

175
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,620
We are in a tough spot.

176
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,460
Zongzheng Wu You has been trying
to get leverage on me.

177
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,580
I can't be involved in trouble.

178
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,460
This is all too sudden.
I didn't talk to my wife about this.

179
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,580
Didn't you always say your wife
has a generous heart?

180
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,340
I am sure she will agree.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,780
Besides, it's just one night.

182
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,220
General!

183
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,700
-What's wrong?
-General!

184
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,500
Bad news, Lady Xiang and
Lady Rong Le got into a fight!

185
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,140
What? Let's go!

186
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,820
They are fighting? Wait for me!

187
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Rong Le?

188
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,540
Rong Le?

189
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,900
But...

190
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,260
But they were fighting just now.

191
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,620
General.

192
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,700
What did I tell you?

193
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,620
I told you your wife
will agree with this.

194
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,420
Look at how close they are now.

195
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,780
They might even become
best friends in the future.

196
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,060
From now on, I can hide Hen Xiang
in your house at any time.

197
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,820
Let's go.

198
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,460
The Empress arrives!

199
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

200
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,820
Make yourself at home
at this gathering.

201
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,700
At ease.

202
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

203
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,660
I invited all of you here...

204
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,540
to have some joyous moments
at the Imperial Garden...

205
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
and a special arrangement.

206
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,260
I ordered my men to hide
a treasure in the garden.

207
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,100
Princess Rong Le, there is a treasure.

208
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,660
Anything that catches
Her Majesty's eyes must be precious.

209
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,220
Prince Zhen Bei brought it here
all the way from Chen.

210
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,020
It's priceless and delicate.

211
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,740
It's one of a kind.

212
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,980
As for what it is and
where it is hidden,

213
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,420
you must find it yourself.

214
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,740
Anyone who finds the treasure...

215
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,140
can own the treasure granted by
Prince Zhen Bei himself.

216
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,900
Very well. I shall wait
for your good news.

217
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,380
I took enough of your time.

218
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,580
Make yourselves at home.

219
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,180
Princess Rong Le.

220
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,060
Can you help me with
the treasure hunt?

221
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,300
I really want that treasure.

222
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,660
It depends on fate's plan for you.

223
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
You cannot force it.

224
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,180
Besides, what if you
find the treasure...

225
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,660
but you don't like it?

226
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,700
Princess, you misunderstood.

227
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,540
I am not getting
that treasure for myself.

228
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,980
I have everything I need.

229
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,660
I am giving it to someone else.

230
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,060
It this a present for Wu Yu?

231
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,300
It's not that I wanted
that treasure for him,

232
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,140
but it really does suit him well.

233
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,100
How? Do you know what the treasure is?

234
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,580
It's just my guess.

235
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,180
I am almost certain of it.

236
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,180
The most precious item in Chen
is the Ferghana horse.

237
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,940
But the horse can't be
hidden in the garden.

238
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,620
It would either be a horse bit
or a horse whip.

239
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,740
Wu Yu loves to ride on horse.

240
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,860
The very first time I met him...

241
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,820
was when he bumped
into me on a horse.

242
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,980
This means a lot for me and Wu Yu.

243
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,940
Don't you think it's
the best present for him?

244
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,220
It is indeed meant for you and Wu Yu.

245
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,980
Our little Zhao Yun has grown up.

246
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,940
You became so thoughtful and sensible.

247
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,380
You even learned to make
your loved one happy.

248
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,900
Princess Rong Le,

249
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,180
you are making fun of me
just like that brat Wu Yu.

250
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,140
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

251
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,020
Princess Zhao Yun.

252
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,220
Miss Sun, are you here
for the treasure hunt too?

253
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,100
Wu Yu told me that...

254
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,220
you were getting along very well
with Wu You in Qingzhou.

255
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,980
If you want to give
this treasure to Wu You,

256
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,060
you might as well
stop wasting your time.

257
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,700
Prince Li was treating me very well.

258
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,500
I am not one of those nobles
that was invited here.

259
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,780
It was Prince Li that brought me here.

260
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,820
Miss Sun, do you need
my help on something?

261
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,660
Yes.

262
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,460
Zhao Yun.

263
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,700
I have a little too
much wine last night.

264
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,020
I am feeling under the wind.

265
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,340
You can go on without me.
I'll be waiting.

266
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,060
Princess Rong Le,
you drank last night?

267
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,540
Do you need to go home for some rest?

268
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,820
I am fine.
I am just feeling a little dizzy.

269
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,420
A little break will do.
Go on.

270
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,140
Princess Rong Le.

271
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,860
If you see Wu Yu later on,

272
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,940
do not tell him I am hunting
this treasure for him.

273
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,620
Fine, you can go now.

274
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,100
Get it before someone else does.

275
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,620
So long.

276
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,620
I heard that because General Fu...

277
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,860
spends most of his work
on the battlefield, he never drinks...

278
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,860
as he wants to focus on work.

279
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,460
I thought he always
upholds his gravity...

280
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,180
and was a man of discipline.

281
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,780
Who would have thought he actually
drinks and writes poetry with you?

282
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,860
I envy your life.

283
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,060
Miss Ya Li, is there something
you wish to talk to me?

284
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,700
I heard from the Empress
a few days ago.

285
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,100
You have quite some
knowledge regarding teas.

286
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,500
I was hoping you can
give me some lessons.

287
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,860
I like drinking tea.

288
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,260
But I am no expert.

289
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,540
You can come to my house if you want.

290
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,980
We can have tea together.

291
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,380
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

292
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,100
My lady, the Empress asked for you.

293
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,820
Please come with me.

294
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,380
Miss Sun, you must excuse me.

295
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,180
<i>Isn't this the handmaiden
that serves Her Majesty?</i>

296
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,420
<i>What did she say to the Crown Prince?</i>

297
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,340
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

298
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,220
Her Majesty will be here soon.

299
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,860
I am terribly sorry.

300
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,140
I will bring you some
clean clothes right away.

301
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Please, head to the inner room
to get changed.

302
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,980
I must go now.

303
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,660
Brother, you are very smart.

304
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,660
What present should
I get for Zhao Yun?

305
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,020
You are marrying her, not me.

306
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,100
Besides, she doesn't care
about the present.

307
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,500
Brother, here is something
you don't understand.

308
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,740
A woman's heart is like
the needle in a haystack.

309
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,500
She will tell you
the value doesn't matter,

310
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,420
she only cares about your love.

311
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,700
But in reality, get her a
branch and see what happens.

312
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,220
She will definitely turn you down.

313
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,500
Even if she accepts it,
she will still hold a grudge.

314
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,780
You'll see.

315
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,460
Brother, what present
should I get for Zhao Yun?

316
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,220
Maybe I can carve a wooden doll
for her too.

317
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,620
Where is my doll?

318
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,460
That is mine, give it back!

319
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,700
Yours?

320
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,540
I don't see your name on it.

321
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,420
Why would that be necessary?

322
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,140
The is clearly me!

323
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,740
Open your eyes and look closely.

324
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,260
I am sorry.

325
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,460
I don't see any resemblance
of you in this doll.

326
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,500
You!

327
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,860
My brother is amazing as always.
He got the doll back for me.

328
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,580
Prince Zhen Bei, this is indeed
my brother's belonging.

329
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,500
I could tell right away
it was Prince Chen.

330
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,060
But I haven't had any fight
in a while.

331
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,340
Now that I met him,

332
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,380
I merely want to test
my skill against his.

333
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,180
Prince Li, Her Majesty asked for you.

334
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,740
You must excuse me.

335
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,740
This way, please.

336
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,100
Man Yao? What happened to you?

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,540
Man Yao?

338
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,740
Your Highness, I apologise for that.

339
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,140
Miss Sun?

340
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,340
Miss Sun, you ran into me.

341
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,420
How do you make up for that?

342
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,340
Your Highness!

343
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,660
General Fu?

344
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,780
Crown Prince.

345
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,780
You have important matter to see to.

346
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,620
Do not be distracted
by something so trivial.

347
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

348
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,540
I have an important job to do today.

349
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,220
Your Highness,
everything is in place now.

350
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,620
General Fu, my grand plan is done.

351
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,740
Come on, everyone!

352
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,540
Join me for this grand show!

353
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,340
Come on.

354
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,900
Pick up the pace.

355
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,780
<i>Not only did I arrange a lady
for Prince Zhen Bei,</i>

356
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,540
<i>I also prepared a
great show for Wu You.</i>

357
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,540
I will make him fall hard.

358
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,300
A comeback will be impossible.

359
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,140
General Fu, the servant from earlier
took Lady Rong Le with her.

360
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,700
What?

361
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,820
Hurry up!

362
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,980
What is going on?

363
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,060
Your Highness!

364
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,940
Your Highness!

365
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,740
Your Highness.

366
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,180
-Hurry up.
-Your Highness!

367
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,020
Didn't you say it will
be a great show?

368
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,780
Why didn't you bring me along?

369
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,340
You came just in time.

370
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,140
Let me show you how to catch
someone in bed red-handed.

371
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,340
Your Highness.

372
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,140
Why would it be such a show
in the Imperial Garden?

373
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,500
General Fu.

374
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,540
All you ever see is the
tactical layout on battlefield.

375
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,740
You have no idea how
debauched people can be in here.

376
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,940
Let me show you
how it is done today.

377
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,500
Let me show you the enemy...

378
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,980
and who you ally is.

379
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,300
Perhaps the only man
who can't see the enemy...

380
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,540
is you, Your Highness.

381
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,180
General.

382
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,100
You can dodge the enemy's arrow,

383
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,940
but you can't if it's from your ally.

384
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,140
Especially the one who
share the bed with you.

385
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,980
While you are basked
in her gentle embrace,

386
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,060
your end is drawing close to you.

387
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,380
Your Highness.

388
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,020
-Your Highness.
-Let's go.

389
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,940
But...

390
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,500
But...

391
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,860
Where is Zongzheng Wu You?

392
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,860
There is someone on the bed.

393
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,460
It's show time!

394
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,340
Zongzheng Wu You?

395
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,900
But...

396
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,700
Where is he?

397
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,180
Where is he?

398
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,820
Where is he?

399
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,940
Zongzheng Wu You.

400
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,180
Curse him!

401
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,380
Chun Hua, Qiu Yue!

402
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,020
How dare you lie to me!

403
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,140
Your Highness, I did see Prince Li...

404
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,020
and Lady Rong Le come
into this room.

405
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,980
I didn't know what they were doing.

406
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,780
Where is Prince Li?

407
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,300
I have heard rumours about
her affair with Prince Li.

408
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,900
I never thought they would do
something so shameless in the palace.

409
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,820
Right under General Fu's nose!

410
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,700
-Indeed.
-Where is he?

411
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,100
If I can't find him here,
I'll make you pay dearly!

412
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Your Highness, there is
a bathroom behind this.

413
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,900
Yes, they must be in the bath!

414
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
Exciting! This is exciting!

415
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,620
Stand aside! Make way!

416
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,380
Your Highness.

417
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,980
This door leads to the bathroom.

418
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,860
Charging in there
doesn't seem adequate.

419
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,660
General, you heard
what the servants said.

420
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,100
Your wife and Zongzheng Wu You
are committing adultery!

421
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,260
Are you really going to defend
a woman that cheats on you?

422
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,180
Do you think I would
believe my own wife...

423
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,820
or the handmaidens
that spread rumours?

424
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,380
We will know who to believe
once we go in there.

425
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,140
Your Highness, what if...

426
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,340
you charge into the room...

427
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,220
and my wife is the only one there?

428
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
Your Highness,

429
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,580
that would be very indecent of you.

430
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,500
His Majesty is mad at Your Highness
because of Lady Xiang.

431
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,860
Do you really want to cross the line?

432
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,980
I have always been a righteous man.

433
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,700
Even if my father misunderstands me,

434
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,900
I must catch that shameless
Zongzheng Wu You!

435
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,340
I do have a plan
that works for us both.

436
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,300
Let me go in there myself.

437
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,140
If my wife is the only
person in there,

438
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,540
Your Highness gets to
retain your honour.

439
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,940
If there is another man in there,
I'll be sure to deal with him.

440
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
Don't you have faith in me?

441
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,780
You do have a point.

442
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,940
It would also be more exhilarating
if you catch them in the bed!

443
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,660
I assure you,

444
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,460
I will explain everything
to His Majesty,

445
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,980
that includes your pain, anger...

446
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,100
and the desperation
after you see what's inside.

447
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,540
General, I shall be waiting here.

448
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,780
If you need any help,
just let me know.

449
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,420
Don't hold back.

450
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,700
Go on.

451
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,580
Yes.

452
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,540
No.

453
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,460
No.

454
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,780
General Fu.

455
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,820
Did you see any sign
of Zongzheng Wu You?

456
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,500
You...

457
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,540
How could you be so careless
and fell into the water?

458
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,260
You will catch a cold in there.

459
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,980
How about this?

460
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,180
You can put on my clothes.

461
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,020
I will be waiting out there.

462
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,860
Let's go home together.

463
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,020
<i>It never ends, love will fade.</i>

464
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,820
<i>The blossoms fall,
and I waited in silence.</i>

465
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,100
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

466
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,460
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

467
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,900
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

468
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,020
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

469
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,620
<i>We are not holding hands,
but you are holding my heart.</i>

470
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:38,620
<i>Although this might not be forever,</i>

471
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,540
<i>I've locked you in my heart
and I've locked you in my dream.</i>

472
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,860
<i>It's my fault...</i>

473
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,860
<i>for falling in love with you.</i>

474
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,700
General Fu.

475
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,380
Zongzheng Wu You is not in there?

476
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,980
You worried too much.

477
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,380
This may sound hilarious to you,

478
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,300
but my wife slipped
and fell into the water.

479
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,820
So, she took a bath here.

480
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,700
My wife is the only one in there.

481
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,780
General Fu.

482
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,260
Are you trying to defend her?

483
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,820
No, I must go in there myself.

484
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,860
You conspired for corruption
and sell the ranks for profit.

485
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,540
You killed Minister Yu's whole family.

486
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,940
You failed to kill Prince Li
in Qingzhou with assassin.

487
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,580
And now you use
incense to drug him.

488
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,180
If His Majesty knows about these,

489
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,700
who do you think will get punished?

490
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,580
His Highness has a point.

491
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,300
In that case, please go in there
and have a look.

492
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,780
Forget it!

493
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,260
It's getting warm in here.

494
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,460
I am sweating!

495
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,340
I am going back to take a bath!

496
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,900
Get back to your work!
Don't you have better things to do?

497
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,620
-Dismiss!
-Wait.

498
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,260
How do we punish the two servants
that lied to us just now?

499
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,940
Your Highness!

500
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,500
We were just following your order!

501
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,740
Spare us!

502
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,260
-Guards!
-Have mercy!

503
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Take these liars out of here!

504
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,580
-Please, spare us!
-Have mercy on us!

505
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,780
-Out!
-Have mercy on us!

506
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,940
General Fu.

507
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,740
If it's inconvenient,

508
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,660
I can help Lady Rong Le get changed.

509
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,380
This is my family matter.

510
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,420
I should handle this myself.

511
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,020
<i>Is someone really behind this screen?</i>

512
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,340
<i>He even went so far to tolerate her?</i>

513
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,300
I apologise for my manner.

514
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,380
General Fu.

515
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,780
Chang Jian.

516
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,260
From now on,

517
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,140
you will take Xiang Ying's job.

518
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,940
After my wife comes out,

519
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,820
send her back to the house.

520
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,380
Yes.

521
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,900
Are you all right?

522
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,620
I am fine.

523
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,340
Your Highness!

524
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,060
Your Highness!

525
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,420
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

526
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,780
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

527
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,380
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

528
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,860
<i>to melt it.</i>

529
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,500
<i>I am destined to fail as I met you.</i>

530
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,980
You need to go now.

531
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,300
<i>You are keeping me out with your care.</i>

532
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:10,020
<i>Although we are together, I feel lost.</i>

533
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,860
<i>I will wait even if it takes forever.</i>

534
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,460
<i>I endure all the loneliness
just for you.</i>

535
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:27,620
<i>I will be your hearth
in the coldest of places.</i>

536
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,180
Lady Rong Le, the carrier is ready.

537
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,220
This way, please.

538
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:46,020
<i>I will be with you as
I gave you all of me.</i>

539
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,300
Please,

540
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,940
stay away from my wife.

541
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,340
Please, keep her from harm.

542
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,940
Where are they hiding the treasure?

543
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,020
Did someone get it before I do?

544
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,020
Shouldn't you be at the front garden
for your archery contest?

545
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,140
I just want...

546
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,220
What exactly do you want?

547
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,820
It's nothing serious.

548
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,460
Don't bother me then.

549
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,180
I am looking for treasure.

550
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,260
I found the treasure
you were looking for.

551
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,420
You found it?

552
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,900
Do you like it?

553
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,820
The treasure you want is in my hand.

554
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,220
Give me your hand.

555
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,260
-Wu Yu!
-Do you like it?

556
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,100
I am trying to find the treasure...

557
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,700
and you are getting in my way!

558
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,020
You want the treasure from
another man and not mine?

559
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,420
Is it not pricey enough for you?

560
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,580
Does the treasure
really worth that much?

561
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,580
Do you really think I want
the treasure for myself?

562
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,220
Do you really take me
as a gold-digger?

563
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,140
-But...
-Princess Zhao Yun.

564
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,980
To express his gratitude to you
for saving his life at the lake,

565
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,260
Prince Zhen Bei invites you
to the side palace.

566
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,780
She is not going.

567
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,420
It's all thanks to
your weird treasure.

568
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,100
Why would you want to hide it?
Are you out of your mind?

569
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,620
It's just stinking trinket.
What's the big deal?

570
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,740
I bet even if you give it to someone,

571
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,100
no one would bat an eye.

572
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,820
I will.

573
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,500
I am going to get that treasure.

574
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,620
Stop following me around!

575
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,100
I am not following you!

576
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,660
You will regret this!

577
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,140
You can't find the treasure
unless you go to the side palace.

578
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,740
Stinking brat!
Stinking Wu Yu!

579
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,180
I am working so hard
to find the treasure for him!

580
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,340
And he thinks otherwise.
What a fool.

581
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,460
Where could that treasure be?

582
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,900
Why can't I find it?

583
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,260
Wu Yu, what are you up to this time?

584
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,060
A gift from the heaven!
