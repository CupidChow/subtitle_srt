00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,960
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:32,436
Episode 44

3
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:34,936
Ya Li.

4
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,000
Did Prince Li mention
how he will punish you?

5
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:41,170
He didn't say anything.

6
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:42,878
He did nothing either.

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,584
It's just as I expected.

8
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,841
Because of old times' sake,
he won't hurt you.

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,700
What old times' sake?

10
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,169
He and I never shared
any old times' sake.

11
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:58,648
All he has is the newly found hate.

12
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:01,433
I hope that he'll do something to me.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,960
It'll be better than him
ignoring me like this.

14
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:09,158
It's just like I've never
existed to him.

15
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:10,648
Ya Li.

16
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,705
Wait for me in the manor.

17
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,855
Even though I might not be able
to stage a comeback,

18
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,199
I will find another way...

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,566
to bring you away from here
and give you a better life.

20
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:22,032
What do you mean?

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,920
You are still unwilling to give up?

22
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,814
-Or are you planning to escape?
-Ya Li.

23
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,856
I've always taught you that...

24
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:32,525
if you have something that you want,

25
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,003
grasp it tightly and never let go.

26
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:37,417
Even if you might lose
your freedom for a while,

27
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,562
but as long as you live,

28
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:42,249
you'll have a chance to get it back.

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,259
Stop forcing me to accept those
false reasoning of yours.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,840
I've always listened to you.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,012
But what did I get in the end?

32
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,357
The love that I want...

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,200
is used by others...

34
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,649
and in the end, I am cast away
like a pair of worn-out shoes.

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,671
I want to have status but now,
I've fallen into a bottomless pit...

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
and I'm trampled by others.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
What more chances do I have?

38
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,867
And what more chances do you have?

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,320
Ya Li.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,916
Everything that I did,
I did it for your sake.

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,400
I don't believe it.

42
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,711
I only realise it when I heard about
the things that they blamed you for.

43
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,810
The father that I had
admired and respected...

44
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:25,796
is a traitor that brings disaster
to the country and to the people.

45
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,043
Why should I listen to you again?

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,386
Ya Li.

47
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,773
Others don't believe me.

48
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:34,998
You don't believe in me too?

49
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,973
Yes. Because of my selfishness,

50
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:41,202
I had made up lies about
the Silver-Hair Demon.

51
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,130
And I've killed those
who stood in my way.

52
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,320
But I will never admit that...

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,090
I'm a traitor to this country.

54
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,664
If I want to rebel,

55
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,797
why did I try to marry you off
to His Highness?

56
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,137
The 13 lives in the northern camp
and the mutiny riot...

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,518
have nothing to do with me.

58
00:03:58,716 --> 00:03:59,876
Father.

59
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,876
I can never tell if you are
lying or speaking of the truth.

60
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,180
And I don't want to know.

61
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:11,194
The justice, virtue, loving father
and filial daughter are just lies...

62
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,847
that you've portrayed to cover
the ugliness in your heart.

63
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,977
Ya Li.

64
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,281
Why would you
turn out to be like this?

65
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,546
Why would I turn out to be like this?

66
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:28,138
Because you've never tried
to get to know me.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Of course you don't know
what kind of a person I am.

68
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:35,254
I have always been
your filial daughter.

69
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,611
I've always been the daughter
of the illustrious Sun family.

70
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,923
The people that I like,
the life that I want to live in.

71
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:47,371
Sometimes, even I,
don't have answers for them.

72
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,544
Because I don't dare to think about it
and I don't dare to do it.

73
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,341
Finally, I've mustered the courage
to take a step forward.

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,635
But I've ended up with
such a sad ending anyway.

75
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,065
It's not just you.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,160
Even I,

77
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:08,631
don't know why would I
turn out to be like this.

78
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:13,185
Ya Li.

79
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:15,641
This is my fault.

80
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,434
I shouldn't have been
so strict to you.

81
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,110
But now,

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,960
you have to believe in me.

83
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:24,175
And you have to listen to me. Or else,

84
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,327
this will be the end of Sun family.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,800
Father.

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
Do you know?

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,571
When you show me this
kind and loving face of yours,

88
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,196
it means that you are going
to use me again.

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,567
I prefer the cold treatment
that you had shown me...

90
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,560
when we just came to Qingzhou.

91
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,495
At least I knew back then that...

92
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,965
your dislike for me was real.

93
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,632
And I didn't need to guess
about what evil plans...

94
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,950
are you plotting next
under your façade.

95
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,321
This time,

96
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,988
it'll be the end between us
as father and daughter.

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,233
I don't care if you want
to escape or what.

98
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,336
From now on,

99
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,297
your plans have nothing to do with me.

100
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,466
They have nothing to do with me.

101
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,561
Ya Li.

102
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,529
Ya Li!

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,089
Why can't you understand?

104
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:39,088
You are my daughter.

105
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,649
I will not hurt you.

106
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,895
And I won't leave you
behind unattended.

107
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,585
You can't do this!

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,000
You can't take it away!

109
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:05,249
Go away.

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,049
Finally, you are back, Miss Sun.

111
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:11,696
You went to visit your father?

112
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,781
How is he?

113
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,510
Don't mention him again!

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,162
Do you want to announce to the world
that I'm the daughter of a criminal?

115
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,277
I don't mean to do that.

116
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,279
-You say it.
-Just say it.

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,936
Miss Sun.

118
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,469
You know about the
current situation in the manor.

119
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,102
The properties in this manor,

120
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,107
including us servants
are supposed to be...

121
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,920
-confiscated as well originally.
-That's right.

122
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,760
Now, His Highness has
shown mercy and let go of us.

123
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,508
-But what about our wage this month?
-Yes, what about our wage?

124
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:50,781
How can you be like this?

125
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,362
How can you be so ungrateful?

126
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,279
Miss Sun has treated you so well.

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,840
The whole manor is empty now.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,880
-Where to find money?
-What about our wage then?

129
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,960
-That's right, what about our wage?
-Stop it.

130
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,120
Miss Sun.

131
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,961
We know that everybody has left.

132
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,725
And this manor is now an empty shell.

133
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,599
But, we are sure that there are
still some valuables left in here.

134
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,560
Rather than letting them
confiscate those valuables,

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
it's better if you can give
some of them to us.

136
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,091
-Yes, that's right.
-It'll be better to give them to us.

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,920
Get lost. All of you, get lost!

138
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,377
Let me tell you.

139
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,161
I rather smash all the things
in this manor...

140
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,784
than giving them to you!

141
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,876
-Are you mad?
-That's right. She has gone mad.

142
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,804
Go out! All of you, go out!

143
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,087
Go out now!

144
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
What is her problem?

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,390
No.

146
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,607
No!

147
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:12,769
Miss Sun.

148
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,960
Miss Sun, what's wrong with you?

149
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,558
Help!

150
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,159
Miss Sun!

151
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:20,692
Wake up, Miss Sun.

152
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:47,593
Wu You.

153
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,695
Ke told me that...

154
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,872
when one took the Ageing Frost,

155
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,424
he will suffer unimaginable pain.

156
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,420
And death will be a better choice.

157
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:04,033
Plus, his life will be
deducted by 10 years.

158
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,887
How are you able to endure that?

159
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,641
Everything is in the past now.

160
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:14,636
We are both fine now, right?

161
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,653
During the Lantern Festival back then,

162
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,999
I had vowed to hold your hands
until we are old and Gray.

163
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,523
Looks like I've fulfilled it earlier.

164
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,317
In such a short day,

165
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:30,754
you've made me go through
the most immense pain.

166
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,889
But at the same time,

167
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:37,144
you've given me the
greatest happiness.

168
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,441
Man Yao.

169
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,440
From now onwards,

170
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,030
there will be only happiness.

171
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,640
No more sufferings.

172
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,246
Marry me.

173
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:00,584
Tonight, now.

174
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,321
Let us love each other.

175
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,273
I don't want to wait anymore.

176
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,372
And you don't have to wait anymore.

177
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,016
Yes.

178
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:11,785
I accept.

179
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,750
The moon will be the witness.

180
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,796
The sky and the land will
act as our matchmaker.

181
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,791
I, Zongzheng Wu You,

182
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,887
am going to take Man Yao as wife.

183
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,617
We will be together...

184
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,008
until death drew us apart.

185
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:16,797
<i>You are in my thoughts for so long
without you knowing about it.</i>

186
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:23,424
<i>Who is going to talk about
this love between us first?</i>

187
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:30,207
<i>Luckily, I am attentive to myself.</i>

188
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:36,539
<i>That's why I let you
turn back the time.</i>

189
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:43,611
<i>The western wind is preventing you
to accept the spring here.</i>

190
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,635
<i>But I'm still waiting under
the rain with you.</i>

191
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:56,567
<i>Although the future
is unpredictable...</i>

192
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:58,759
These cups of tea...

193
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:01,127
will be our nuptial cups of wine.

194
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:11,013
<i>Half of autumn is gone.</i>

195
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:14,339
<i>And it's still a long way with winter.</i>

196
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:20,467
<i>But I'm already waiting for
spring together with you.</i>

197
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:23,814
<i>In order to preserve your naivety,</i>

198
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,219
<i>I'll fight for the world
to be peaceful again.</i>

199
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,360
<i>This chill will bridge the path
for two lovers who are apart.</i>

200
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:32,702
Man Yao.

201
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:35,844
After we wipe out our
previous humiliation...

202
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,240
and reunite Northern Realm,

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,160
I'll give you a grand wedding.

204
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,272
It's already very good like this.

205
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,752
We are married because of love...

206
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:50,081
under the sun and the moon.

207
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,436
I like it a lot.

208
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,627
And I have no regrets.

209
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,480
Although a ceremony is important,

210
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,322
it's not as long-lasting as
the sky and the land.

211
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:02,585
I just hope that as long as
the moon is still there,

212
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,930
I'll always be by your side.

213
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,444
For us to become husband and wife...

214
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:11,698
is what I've always dreamt about.

215
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,385
Now that it has become a reality,

216
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,656
it is so unbelievable to me.

217
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:18,904
It's like I'm still in a dream.

218
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:23,824
<i>But I can't help but to say it to you.</i>

219
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:30,377
<i>Fate will tear down my mask for me.</i>

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,023
<i>Through the mirror,
I saw that you are so quiet.</i>

221
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:41,266
Now,

222
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,972
do you still think that
you are dreaming?

223
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,517
<i>I wish that you can hear my call
and come back to this world.</i>

224
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,296
<i>I'll tell you that I've never left.</i>

225
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,847
<i>I have gone through life...</i>

226
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,165
<i>in one day's time.</i>

227
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:10,875
<i>And you are still the
only one I'm waiting for.</i>

228
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:17,142
<i>Although there are a lot to take in,
I don't want to live in regret.</i>

229
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:24,141
<i>Because of this love,
I have found my happiness again.</i>

230
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,344
Man Yao...

231
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
is calm and pure in nature,

232
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:42,313
virtuous and refined,

233
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,064
friendly, kind,

234
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,022
smart and courteous.

235
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:49,285
I, Prince Fan Yang, is here
to officiates the wedding.

236
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,280
Prince Chen will become the
witness for this wedding.

237
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:56,218
I hereby enthrone Man Yao as
the fair consort of Prince Li.

238
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,080
She had contributed to the policy
to help make it successful.

239
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,520
So from now on,
she will attend the court...

240
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:04,366
together with Prince Li...

241
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:06,761
and they will rule together.

242
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,937
The ceremony is now over!

243
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,400
Greetings, Prince Li.

244
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,720
Greetings, Consort Rong Le.

245
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:24,740
<i>We won't be apart.</i>

246
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,809
Father.

247
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:54,605
Mother.

248
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,205
I have an important thing to report.

249
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,628
Me and Man Yao have a mutual affinity.

250
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,277
From now on,

251
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,719
she will be my wife.

252
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,318
And we will be a family.

253
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,542
I believe that both of you will be...

254
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,291
glad about it too in the afterworld.

255
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,367
Please protect her well.

256
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,598
And please guard over us.

257
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:32,760
Let us be safe and
our lives a smooth sailing.

258
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,571
Let us hold each other
to the end of our lives.

259
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,989
For your journey back to defend the
border with General Luo Zhi this time,

260
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,497
I won't be sending you off.

261
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,957
You've been training for
quite a while in Luo Army.

262
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:12,946
I believe that you know the situation
in the border better than I am.

263
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:14,753
As soon as there's any
movement from the north,

264
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,153
report back to me immediately.

265
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:20,946
Wu You, you too, think that there will
be movement from north soon, right?

266
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,312
From Sun Ji Zhou's case, it's clear
that Fu Chou hasn't given up yet.

267
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,855
He made up this story
about Silver-Hair Demon...

268
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:29,007
because he wanted to use
Man Yao against you...

269
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:31,038
to affect the southern fringe.

270
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,427
When we first came to Qingzhou,

271
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,960
I told you that...

272
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,580
there will be a huge battle
between you and Fu Chou in the future.

273
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,880
Wu Yu.

274
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,785
Wu Yu had told you back then.

275
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:46,630
The sudden downfall of Zhongshan...

276
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,810
was possible because
Fu Chou was selfish...

277
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,819
and he did it without caring
for the people's lives.

278
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,906
Wu You won't be like Fu Chou.

279
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,559
We implemented the
transformation here...

280
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
to recuperate and rest.

281
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,531
When the people are strong
and the country is rich,

282
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,400
and when we have recuperated
enough and are ready,

283
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,322
we will take over the world
with the smallest price.

284
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,235
We can wait.

285
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,433
But Fu Chou wont'.

286
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,688
Wu You, Rong Le,
he has made a move already.

287
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:17,627
Rather than letting him
gain the upper hand,

288
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,680
how about we attack him first?

289
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,440
I already ordered Leng Yan
to let Serene Hill Inn...

290
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,831
operate as usual again
without tipping them off.

291
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,602
We already know that...

292
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,878
this is where Sun Ji Zhou colludes
with the enemies in secret.

293
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:34,482
We might be able to catch
some preys that fall into our trap.

294
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,857
As soon as Fu Chou makes a move,

295
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,056
I will fight him back.

296
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:44,697
Wu You.

297
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,905
Whenever we hold a memorial for
our parents in such a faraway land,

298
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,280
I'll blame myself.

299
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,249
I kept thinking that...

300
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,116
if I was smarter...

301
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,045
or more capable back then,

302
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,680
father wouldn't have
turned out to be like that.

303
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,216
And now,

304
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,346
we can't even set up
spirit tablets for...

305
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,901
father and Lady Yun.

306
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,951
We can only grief for them
beside the river in a faraway place.

307
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:13,675
Whenever I think about that,

308
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,400
I wish that I can go into...

309
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,019
a life or death battle with Fu Chou
who had murdered our father at once.

310
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,374
I understand.

311
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,485
I blame myself too.

312
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:28,856
And I'm in pain as well.

313
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,366
<i>Father, mother.</i>

314
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,734
<i>I'm not sure if I have
the rights to call you those.</i>

315
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,119
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

316
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:52,339
<i>If it wasn't for me back then,</i>

317
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,832
<i>Wu You won't abandon Zhongshan.</i>

318
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,769
<i>And Lady Yun wouldn't have to stay
in Yun's Tomb all by herself.</i>

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,720
<i>He has been blaming himself.</i>

320
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:03,959
<i>But in order to not
make me feel guilty,</i>

321
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,135
<i>he has never mentioned...</i>

322
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,254
<i>about this unfilial sin
that we've committed.</i>

323
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:11,377
<i>I'm willing to bear this sin alone.</i>

324
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:14,875
<i>Please don't blame Wu You for it.</i>

325
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:47,616
Here.

326
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:50,793
You just recovered
from a serious illness.

327
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:52,767
It's like you've came back
from the death door.

328
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:55,198
You've gone through
a calamity in your life.

329
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:57,572
Ya Li.

330
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,073
You have to live well from now on,
understand?

331
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Here, Chun Ni.

332
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,440
If Chun Ni didn't tell me about it...

333
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,413
and if the physician
couldn't get here in time,

334
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,490
you would have been in real danger.

335
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,972
Now, everybody...

336
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:16,253
is trying to avoid me at all cost.

337
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,477
And I don't want to trouble others.

338
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:20,406
But...

339
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,359
I never thought that you'll still
be willing to visit me here.

340
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:25,699
I'll remember this friendship...

341
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,185
that you've extended to me.

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
But now,

343
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:32,387
I have nothing to repay you with.

344
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:33,917
Ya Li.

345
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,992
No need to think about that.

346
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:39,146
I'll be satisfied if
you can live well.

347
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,840
Moreover,
if you didn't live your life well,

348
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,680
how would you have
the chance to repay me?

349
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
If there's one day...

350
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:49,074
when I need you to repay me,

351
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,779
you better be generous with me.

352
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,064
Don't worry. I'm not joking.

353
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,368
In the future,
I'll give you anything...

354
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,800
that I have.

355
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,451
You are not that good
with children, right?

356
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,604
Why did you bring me here
all of the sudden?

357
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,552
Ever since we came back from
the river, you seem depressed.

358
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,640
And you even have to massage
your head when we were in court.

359
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,882
I'm afraid that you've used
your brain too much.

360
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,389
You'll feel better to come
and meet these new children.

361
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,925
And your body will feel better too.

362
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,516
-Brother Li!
-Sister Rong Le!

363
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,481
-Brother Li!
-Sister Rong Le!

364
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,624
-Such good kids.
-All of you are new here?

365
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,579
What is your name?

366
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,870
Brother Li gave me a name.
I am Ya Ge.

367
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,722
-I am Zi Jin.
-I am Bo Yu.

368
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,864
I am his brother,
my name is Bo Rong.

369
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,040
Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,

370
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,621
shining bright and brings us light.

371
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
The Zhou kingdom has it's age,

372
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,600
but the fate of nation
is yet to be known.

373
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,920
How glorious Zhou Kingdom is.

374
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,849
It has done as the heaven says.

375
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,421
Emperor Wen walks up to the heaven.

376
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,640
And how mighty he is,
standing beside God.

377
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:27,432
Bo Rong, your turn.

378
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,808
What's next again?

379
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,292
You taught them all of these?

380
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,186
Brother Wu You has hired
a teacher for us.

381
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,555
We are going to serve
the country when we grow up.

382
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:41,552
-Good boy.
-Good boy, Zi Jin.

383
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:43,086
Go back to your studies.

384
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,825
-Such good kids.
-Let's go.

385
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,930
Wu You.

386
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,755
Why did you teach them
this poem specifically?

387
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:58,018
My late teacher used to taught me
this first when I was young.

388
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,720
It's really rare for me to hear
about your childhood.

389
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,560
When I was young,
I was a troublemaker.

390
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,280
I was not as obedient as they are.

391
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,375
I remember that when I was
playing swing one time,

392
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,530
I almost kicked the maidservant
into the water.

393
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,863
My late teacher gave me that swing.

394
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,973
He purposely hired someone
to build it for me.

395
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,311
He said that I had been
studying too hard.

396
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,341
So, he wanted me to do
some physical exercises.

397
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:31,311
After that, I made
a wind bell for him...

398
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:33,862
as a return gift for him.

399
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,735
This is for you.

400
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,491
-Thank you, brother.
-You are welcome.

401
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,046
After that, I rarely touched
that swing anymore.

402
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,163
I was immersed in learning
how to fight with weapons.

403
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,513
Brother Li, teach us how to write.

404
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:59,535
-Sir said that your writing is good.
-Sure.

405
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:00,715
Here.

406
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:07,769
I'll teach you how to
write the word...

407
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,091
-'Yao', alright?
-Yes.

408
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,040
Is she me?

409
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,040
Who is he then?

410
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,642
Wu You...

411
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,651
or...

412
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,932
-Man Yao!
-What's wrong with Sister Rong Le?

413
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,150
Man Yao.

414
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:34,169
Are you alright?

415
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:36,132
Are you having headache again?

416
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,520
Here. Let's go back and ask Ke
to take a look at you.

417
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,763
Let's go.

418
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:57,131
Man Yao.

419
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,849
Did you really have no relapse
for the past one year...

420
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,537
or have you been hiding it from me?

421
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:06,276
Your Highness, are you doubting
Princess Rong Le or me?

422
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,689
I am The Physician. I've been
treating Princess Rong Le for a year.

423
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,856
And she has been so lively
and has never fallen ill.

424
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:14,548
Maybe it's your fault.

425
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,544
Did you work
Princess Rong Le too hard?

426
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,339
Is that the reason she has headache?

427
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:20,657
You are not lying to me?

428
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:23,570
Or course not. I never lie.

429
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,428
Before this, you went out
with Wu Yu for quite a while.

430
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,097
-Where did you go?
-I...

431
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,721
didn't go anywhere in particular.

432
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:36,826
We are just walking around for fun.

433
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:41,642
Wu You.

434
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:43,986
Look at here.
Her face is all red already.

435
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:49,608
She must have had some secrets with
Wu Yu that she can't tell you about.

436
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,880
I don't have any secrets with him.

437
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,960
We just went out together to
collect some herbs.

438
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,295
Collect herbs? What herbs?

439
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,023
Show me.

440
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,451
We didn't get to find it.

441
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:03,151
You didn't get to find it?

442
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
It's true.

443
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:12,875
There. I'm looking for this.

444
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:16,415
It took me so long to
find this magical herb.

445
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:19,058
But somebody has
already taken it away.

446
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,320
Blood Raven Roots.

447
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:29,953
Ke, stop hiding the truth
from us anymore.

448
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,920
The reason for you,
Wu Yu and Agent Wu...

449
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,361
to collect herbs together...

450
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,760
must be something that is
connected to Man Yao's illness.

451
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,206
Tell me the truth.

452
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,866
How is her condition?

453
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,600
How is the treatment working on her?

454
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:48,262
Princess Rong Le's illness is...

455
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:54,889
Princess Rong Le, you didn't have
headache for quite a while already.

456
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,640
Maybe the countless weird concoctions
that I had made are truly working.

457
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:02,715
Ke.

458
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,238
Remember.

459
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,440
If someone ask about
my illness from now on,

460
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,690
tell them that it's just
a normal headache.

461
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,272
Don't let them know that
it's because of the poison.

462
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,400
Especially Prince Li.

463
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,398
If he asks you about it,

464
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:18,703
don't mention anything about poison.

465
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,362
Just tell him that you'll be able
to cure me from my illness.

466
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,525
But Princess Rong Le,
I don't know how to lie.

467
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:27,511
Ke.

468
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,347
I know I shouldn't
teach you how to lie.

469
00:29:31,507 --> 00:29:33,147
But there are a lot of things...

470
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:36,737
where ignorant is bliss.

471
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,662
Alright then, Princess Rong Le.

472
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,137
I'll keep it a secret from Prince Li.

473
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,909
I don't really know him anyway.

474
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:44,703
I'll just avoid him from now on.

475
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,774
If he knows that I'm poisoned,

476
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:55,105
he'll let go of everything
to find the cure for me.

477
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:57,995
He'll only wish to live with me
for the rest of my life.

478
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,853
But he has lofty aspirations...

479
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:03,931
and an implacable debt of blood.

480
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,487
I'll hate to let him let go
of them again because of me.

481
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,520
Princess Rong Le's headache
is not a huge issue.

482
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:18,758
I just heard that Blood Raven Roots
can cure headache.

483
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:20,163
And it can darken the hair.

484
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,819
But it grows in the most
dangerous place in Youji Mountain.

485
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,628
That's why I had asked
uncle and Wu Yu to go with me.

486
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,520
I didn't tell you because I don't want
to disappoint you if I can't find it.

487
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:32,019
See. I didn't get to find it
in the end, right?

488
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,427
Ke.

489
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,512
Why are you so nervous, Ke?

490
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,447
We know. You went to collect herbs,

491
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,891
not to have a date with Wu Yu.

492
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,575
Look at me.

493
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,074
I've already recovered.
Don't be so nervous.

494
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,087
You are scaring Ke.

495
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,560
Enough. Don't give Ke
a fright anymore.

496
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
Let's go back now.

497
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:15,618
" Serene Hill Inn "

498
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:31,772
Is he really here?

499
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,462
You are getting better and better
at hidden weapon now.

500
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,101
It's not because of my skill.

501
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,845
It's because you make
good hidden weapons.

502
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,079
We've been in hiding
for the past year.

503
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:33,748
And we didn't dare to use the
martial arts we had learnt before.

504
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,760
We are able to save ourselves many
times because of your hidden weapon.

505
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:37,963
Thank you.

506
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,963
Is she getting better now?

507
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,749
The physician came just now.
He said that her fever has gone down.

508
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,902
Her fever has indeed gone down.
She should be fine now.

509
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,380
Ever since this child is born,

510
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,628
you are the only one who can coax her.

511
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:40,206
After giving birth to my daughter,

512
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,291
I just realise that besides fighting,

513
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:46,405
I can do nothing and I know nothing.

514
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,563
If you weren't here
for the past one year,

515
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:54,183
I'm afraid that she wouldn't be able
to come into this world healthily.

516
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,706
You've done very well already.

517
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,467
Now, in this world,

518
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:01,974
there are only you, me and this child
where we can depend on each other.

519
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:04,867
Both of you are my
only family in this world.

520
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:07,907
Of course I need to do my best
to protect both of you. But...

521
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,160
What is it? Something happened?

522
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:22,950
Pack your clothes, take this money
and leave Qingzhou now.

523
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,599
Leave Qingzhou?

524
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,874
It's not easy for us to find
a place where we can live in.

525
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:29,975
-Why do we have to leave suddenly?
-Don't ask.

526
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,661
Just do it.

527
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,120
After you leave Qingzhou, go south.

528
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,961
Mark the way with our usual code.

529
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:37,710
I'll catch up to you soon.

530
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,855
If you don't tell me why,
I won't leave.

531
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,379
I heard rumours about
Silver-Hair Demon in the village.

532
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:50,088
-Is it...
-This has nothing to do with us.

533
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,360
Believe me. Leave now.

534
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:54,549
It'll be the best choice...

535
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,517
for you and your daughter.

536
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,777
We had been through so much. No matter
how dangerous the situations were,

537
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,400
you had never asked me
to leave by myself like this.

538
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,209
Even if there's any danger,

539
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,192
we can still retreat together...

540
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
just like we did in the past.

541
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:16,094
I don't want to tell you...

542
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:18,314
because I have a reason for it.

543
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,217
Some things, I think it's better
if you don't know about it.

544
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,353
In the past, no matter where
you want to go, I'll let you.

545
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,160
But this time, for your daughter,
please believe in me for once.

546
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,590
Time is pressing in.
We can't delay anymore.

547
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:30,258
Take care of yourself.

548
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:35,131
Xiang Ying.

549
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:41,323
Xiang Ying!

550
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:00,276
Look, Princess.

551
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,210
The people in southern fringe
don't dare to critique you anymore.

552
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:05,433
They only talk delightedly about...

553
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,280
the deep conjugal love
between you and Prince Li...

554
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:09,844
until both of you have turned Gray.

555
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,800
It's a story that will be
praised far and wide.

556
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:14,815
It might even be
passed down for eternity.

557
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:19,884
Instead of being known for eternity,

558
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:21,857
I rather hope that...

559
00:36:22,122 --> 00:36:24,455
I can have a simple life
with Wu You forever.

560
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:35,802
Princess.

561
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:41,137
" Invite from an old friend. Come to
Gunian Pavilion in Serene Hill Inn. "

562
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,477
Ling Yue, what is the time now?

563
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,000
Eight forty-five in the morning.

564
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:51,683
-Get me my hat.
-Yes, Princess.

565
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:00,923
Princess.

566
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,710
He said that he's an old friend.

567
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,880
I really want to see who is
this old friend of mine.

568
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:10,518
He has taken such
great pains to invite me.

569
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,491
Ling Yue. I'm going out now.

570
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:16,169
Remember. Don't alert
the people in the manor.

571
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:19,587
If I didn't come back in
four hours' time, inform Wu You then.

572
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,156
Remember, four hours.

573
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,800
Princess...

574
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:33,561
Waiter, get me some water.

575
00:37:58,093 --> 00:37:59,453
" Gunian Pavilion "

576
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,977
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

577
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:15,383
<i>Our hearts are lifetime apart.</i>

578
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:20,193
<i>No one was here for us.</i>

579
00:39:20,398 --> 00:39:23,904
<i>How to we keep living this life?</i>

580
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:28,271
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

581
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,280
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

582
00:39:33,098 --> 00:39:37,599
<i>We have thrown away
the fate that we got by chance.</i>

583
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,680
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

584
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:45,243
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

585
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,486
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

586
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:53,741
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

587
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:57,954
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

588
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,359
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

589
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,713
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

590
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,140
<i>We are not holding hands
but you are holding my heart.</i>

591
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:16,842
<i>Although this might not be forever,</i>

592
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:22,009
<i>I've locked you in my heart
and I've locked you in my dream.</i>

593
00:40:22,274 --> 00:40:26,858
<i>It's my fault...</i>

594
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:31,620
<i>for falling in love with you.</i>

595
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:45,498
You are afraid?

596
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:48,082
You are the old friend?

597
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:53,571
Sir Leng, I need to find
His Highness at once.

598
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:56,076
-His Highness has gone out just now.
-He went out?

599
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,144
Princess Rong Le has gone out as well.
What if something happened to her?

600
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:01,856
Princess Rong Le has gone out as well?

601
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:04,275
Here.

602
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,729
This is bad. His Highness
just received news that...

603
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,698
someone has seen
Fu Chou in Serene Hill Inn.

604
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,000
Fu...

605
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:15,666
Bring some guards along
to go to Serene Hill Inn with me.

606
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:17,083
-Yes, Sir!
-Yes, Sir!

607
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,060
No need to be afraid.

608
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:26,693
I'm just here to give you something.

609
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:30,127
I think this can help you with...

610
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,854
You mean this
Blood Raven Roots, right?

611
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,635
You are the one behind...

612
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,978
the Silver-Hair Demon rumour.

613
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,844
You spread the news...

614
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:42,181
so that I was castigated
by the people...

615
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,202
and Wu You was condemned and
forced into a corner by the public.

616
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:47,812
Now, you display this kind of
false affection to give me this.

617
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,011
What is you purpose for doing that?

618
00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:52,315
In your heart,

619
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:55,051
I'm just a person like that?

620
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:59,158
Or did you say it on purpose
because you hate me too much?

621
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,920
Don't think too highly of yourself.

622
00:42:02,827 --> 00:42:05,057
I thought that I will
hate you forever.

623
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,020
But for the past one year,

624
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:10,830
I have lived very happily.

625
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:14,021
I found out that love
can melt down my hate.

626
00:42:14,924 --> 00:42:16,764
Now, my heart is
full of love for Wu You.

627
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,427
I don't have enough space
in my heart to hate you.
