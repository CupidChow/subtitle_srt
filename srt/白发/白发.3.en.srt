00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,440
Episode 3

3
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,200
Have you seen this before?

4
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
Try to recall the details.

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,160
This belonged to the deceased.
It was found here.

6
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,760
But the content is missing.

7
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,680
I really have no idea.

8
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
Let's go.

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,880
Your Highness, are you all right?

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,000
Xiao Sha, this is Long Yue.

11
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Come with me.

12
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,960
There is a secret passage
to the alley.

13
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
It's safer for Your Highness to
use this exit.

14
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,520
Sir Zhao dropped this pouch just now.

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
If the authority comes
for investigation,

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,760
be cautious.

17
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,880
Yes, I will handle this matter
with cautions.

18
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,840
You should know by now
this is no simple matter.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
I understand now why Sir Zhao
insisted on meeting you.

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,360
The evidence he was holding...

21
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,920
would only be useful when
they are in your hands, Brother.

22
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,640
Only you can go up against
the force behind the case.

23
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
But sadly, Sir Zhao is killed.

24
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
We need to find more
information on that lady.

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,280
Wait, Brother.

26
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,600
I thought you are not
interested in women.

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,600
I noticed just now you had
your eyes on her.

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,160
What's wrong?
Are you having feelings for her?

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,280
This is very unusual.

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,720
Everyone is waiting
in the dining hall.

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,320
Your Highness, please
present yourself at the hall.

32
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

33
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
I apologize for making it
such a fuss for you.

34
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,240
But I don't have much
of an appetite.

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
Go without me.

36
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,240
Enjoy yourself with
the foods heartily.

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Yes, Your Highness.

38
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,040
Your Highness, I was keeping
watch outside the room.

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,240
I never saw you coming in.
How did you get in here?

40
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,880
I was so scared just now.

41
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I have Xiao Sha with me,
I have my ways.

42
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,960
My mother passed away
when I was four years old.

43
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
But Lady Yun took pity on me.

44
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,000
She brought me to the palace
and raised me there.

45
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,040
I still remember the days
I was haunted by nightmares.

46
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,760
I couldn't fall asleep.

47
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,440
It was Lady Yun that
kept me company all the time.

48
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,040
She played me the song of a
vessel flute until I fell asleep.

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
For me,

50
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,520
Lady Yun is like a mother to me.

51
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,640
Brother.

52
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
I know the very sight of me
was a nuisance for you.

53
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
You felt like I took
Lady Yun from you.

54
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,880
You kept ignoring me.

55
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,360
But when someone picked on me,

56
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
the first person that
stood up for me...

57
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
is none other but you.

58
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,960
Just because you are
bringing up the memories...

59
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,160
doesn't mean I will help
with this investigation.

60
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,760
Brother, the culprit
is no normal killer.

61
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Their identities and background,

62
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,600
the authorities have no
records on them.

63
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,480
Are we going to let
Sir Zhao die in vain?

64
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Brother, for the sake of Lady Yun,

65
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,200
we can just...

66
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
Did I say something wrong again?

67
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,560
You have been following me for years.

68
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,360
You should know well not to overstep.

69
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,320
These are not the matter
we should be discussing.

70
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,840
I...

71
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,720
I apologize, Brother.

72
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Owl.

73
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,480
You could have been soaring
in the endless sky.

74
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,760
Why did you choose to
come back to this palace?

75
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
Your Highness.

76
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
<i>This is the evidence of
rank-selling from...</i>

77
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,440
<i>the Crown Prince and
Minister of Personnel.</i>

78
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,040
Xiao Sha.

79
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
-Your Highness.
-Do you know...

80
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,880
what kind of a person
the Crown Prince is?

81
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,480
I heard he is ambitious,
cruel and petty.

82
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,960
He is not easy to befriend.

83
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
We need to be cautious with
people like him.

84
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,720
Yes.

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,840
Right.

86
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,360
I am sure you know me well
before I lost my memories.

87
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
His Majesty brought you out
to the hut sometimes.

88
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,240
I was always there.

89
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
When did you first met me?

90
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,840
I think it's after
His Majesty's coronation.

91
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,360
I picked you up from
the Cold Harem.

92
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Was that the first time
His Majesty met me?

93
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,880
I don't think so.

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
So where did he first met me?

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Well...

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,880
I am not sure either.

97
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,280
I may be His Majesty's
personal bodyguard,

98
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,760
but I can't be around him
all the time.

99
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,520
You may go now.

100
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,760
Your Highness, there is an
invitation from the palace.

101
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,600
The Empress will hold a ball
three days from now.

102
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,480
Your Highness are invited.

103
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,480
There is also a list of guests
that will be attending.

104
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,200
Please, have a look.

105
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Very well.

106
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,200
Please reply to Her Majesty for me.

107
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
I will be at the ball on time.

108
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,480
Yes, I shall go now.

109
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
Your Highness.

110
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,200
Your Highness, Prince Li's
name is on the list.

111
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,920
Her Majesty is aiming
to matchmake you and Prince Li?

112
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,920
But why are so many other
strangers invited as well?

113
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,800
Xiao Sha, do you know
the names on this list?

114
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,040
These are princes that are
yet to be married.

115
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,920
Matchmaking me with Prince Li?

116
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,560
It might as well be a blind date
for me and the princes.

117
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,160
Your Highness, maybe His Majesty
thought Prince Li refuses to marry?

118
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,400
Is that why they are holding
this blind date?

119
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
Wait, what do they take us for?

120
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
It's not like anyone
can marry a princess.

121
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,400
Your Highness, this ball
is held by the Empress.

122
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,640
I cannot enter the inner palace.

123
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,720
Please, watch your back.

124
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,080
If Prince Li is not around,

125
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
I doubt the other would
dare to disrespect me.

126
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,120
Why wouldn't Prince Li be there?

127
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,320
His name is on the list.

128
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
But he might not attend the ball.

129
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Princess!

130
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,880
-Stop following me, okay?
-Princess!

131
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,920
You wouldn't go
to the lake with me.

132
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,480
You are not interested in
flower viewing either.

133
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Princess, do you think
I don't deserve you?

134
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,360
I simple don't want to be with you.

135
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,360
Can you please stop bothering me?

136
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,400
Princess!

137
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,640
Princess! Stop!

138
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,480
Who is that?

139
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,360
Your Highness.

140
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,280
Elder son of Prince Qing He
and Princess Zhao Yun.

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,600
You should know, Princess Zhao Yun
grew up without parents.

142
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
She has no siblings either.

143
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,560
So she is living with her uncle
for the time being.

144
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,680
You have nothing
to be so arrogant about.

145
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,000
You are just an orphan that
lives under other's care.

146
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,520
You should be grateful I am
even laying my eyes on you.

147
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,160
I am warning you, let go of me!

148
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
I am letting you go.
Try me!

149
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,920
I will tell Brother Wu You
and let him finish you!

150
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,520
You are bringing up Prince Li now?

151
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
But he never attends
events like this.

152
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,400
You are not going to see him.

153
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,560
How dare you push me!

154
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Stop right there!

155
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
Sister, save me!

156
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,960
You Highness, this is
Princess Rong Le from Qi.

157
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,360
Scram!

158
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,520
I thought who is here.

159
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,920
It's the hideous Princess of Qi.

160
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
No wonder she is so nosy.

161
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,040
I heard Prince Li abandoned you.

162
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,760
So you want one of us
to marry you instead.

163
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,440
Fat chance.

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,200
Listen, even if I am not going
to marry anyone,

165
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,880
I would never marry someone
that is dumped and hideous.

166
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,560
I thought only Prince Li
behaves in this manner.

167
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,760
I never thought the elder son
of Prince Qing He is bold as well.

168
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,960
I can say whatever I want!

169
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,840
I am taking off that mask
to show your hideous look!

170
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,480
Nicely done, Princess Rong Le!
He deserved this!

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,760
Brother Wu You, you are here.

172
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,800
Prince Li?

173
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
What did you say just now?

174
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,640
Nothing, I said nothing.

175
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
I said...

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,920
if Prince Li doesn't like this woman,

177
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,000
I would never marry her.

178
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,920
If this is the woman my brother likes,

179
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
-you would marry her?
-No!

180
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,800
No, what I meant was...

181
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,560
I won't marry her whether
Prince Li likes her or not.

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,640
You might as well be an eunuch then.

183
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,280
No!

184
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
Get lost.

185
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,520
-Guards, take him away.
-Yes.

186
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,160
I am here by the order of the Empress.

187
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,400
-Get up!
-You can't take me by force!

188
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,760
-You can't do this to me!
-Prince Qing He got a son at old age.

189
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,040
He spoils his son a lot.

190
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,280
-Let go of me!
-He lets him do anything.

191
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,960
He is even bold enough
to cause trouble here.

192
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,680
He should have known his place here.

193
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
I am glad Brother Wu You is here.

194
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,680
Otherwise Princess Rong Le
would have been caught up in this.

195
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,520
Speaking of you,

196
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,200
you know he is a scoundrel,
why did you mess with him?

197
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,920
I didn't mess with him.

198
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,960
He kept bothering me.

199
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,960
If I were to have martial art skill
like Princess Rong Le,

200
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,160
I would have beaten him to a pulp.

201
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,040
Princess of Qi actually
knows martial arts.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
<i>There are two things
Prince Li never does.</i>

203
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>He never drinks.</i>

204
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,800
<i>He never touches a woman.</i>

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Who says a princess
cannot learn martial art?

206
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,880
If Your Highness wishes
to know more about me,

207
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,720
you will learn that I know more than
just martial arts.

208
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,280
Your Highness is willing
to attend the ball.

209
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,640
It means you do have
some interest in me.

210
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,360
Why don't you come
to the ball with me?

211
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,280
The Empress arrives!

212
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,840
All hail the Her Majesty.

213
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,200
At ease, all of you.

214
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,560
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Mother.

215
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,040
I have heard rumours about
how talented the princess is.

216
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,280
It seems to be true from what I saw.

217
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,880
Please, I don't deserve the praise.

218
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,640
Prince Li is here.

219
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Come to the ball before you leave.

220
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,680
Coincidently,

221
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,800
Ya Li is here in the with us today.

222
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,080
I am the daughter of
the Central Secretary, Ya Li.

223
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,800
Greetings, Princess of Qi,

224
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,080
Prince Li, Prince Chen
and Princess Zhao Yun.

225
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,480
I have matters I must see to.

226
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,080
So long.

227
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
It's almost time for the
death anniversary of Lady Yun.

228
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,160
My brother needs to retrieve
some belongings of hers.

229
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,760
He does it every year.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,720
A filial son indeed.

231
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,880
Since Prince Li is not coming with us,

232
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,280
Wu Yu, you shall go in his place.

233
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,280
Come, have a toast.

234
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,840
Princess, you came a long way.

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,920
His Majesty was concerned the welcome
was not decent enough.

236
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,720
I was ordered to hold
this feast for you.

237
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,680
All the guests are about your age.

238
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,200
I hope you won't feel awkward here.

239
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,640
Thank you for  His Majesty
and Your Majesty.

240
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,800
Your have never been
to our nation before.

241
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,400
How is your life at the manor?

242
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,840
His Majesty arranged a
modest manor for me.

243
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,960
-However...
-What is wrong?

244
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,320
Are the servants not attentive enough?

245
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,920
If so, I can arrange to get
the other servants for you.

246
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,200
I need to ensure you are having
a good time in here.

247
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
Your Majesty misunderstood.

248
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,680
The servants are
taking good care of me.

249
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,680
Perhaps they are
taking care of me all too well.

250
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,720
I wish to see the view of the capital.

251
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,440
But that seems impossible.

252
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,640
Why? Is someone stopping you
from leaving the palace?

253
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,480
That is not the case.

254
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,120
Every time I tried to leave,

255
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,400
all the guards are coming along.

256
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,520
It's too high-profile,
I feel concerned about this.

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,880
Which is why I couldn't go out.

258
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,040
They simply wish to
ensure your safety.

259
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,520
But I already have a
personal bodyguard.

260
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,280
He was sent by my brother
before I came here.

261
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,600
I see.

262
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Well, I shall send the order.

263
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,360
From now on, you may leave
the palace as you please.

264
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,440
All the guards need not follow you.

265
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,600
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

266
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,480
Princess, enjoy yourself.

267
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
Make yourself at home.

268
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
Enjoy the foods.

269
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,120
To your health.

270
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
Prince Chen, all you
care about is the food.

271
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,560
What about the Princess?

272
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
But I am not Wu You.

273
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,520
I wouldn't expect anything
from Prince Li.

274
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,240
But if Prince Chen is here,

275
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,880
I do have some expectation.

276
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,560
What do you expect from me?

277
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,560
I heard rumours about...

278
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,760
how subtle and dapper you are.

279
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,640
You know how to care for a lady.

280
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,840
If I could have your
attention and caring,

281
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,040
my life in the Northern Realm
might be more interesting.

282
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,000
Indeed!

283
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,160
Prince Chen knows
what's best for a lady.

284
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,880
Should you ever need any help
on any matter,

285
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,760
you can always ask for his help.

286
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
Your Majesty, this is just...

287
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,000
Princess Rong Le,

288
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,160
Wu Yu is simply unreliable.

289
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,480
Brother Wu You is a good man.

290
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,840
Do not fall for the rumours.

291
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,280
Princess, I wonder
what hobby do you have?

292
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,560
Your Majesty.

293
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,520
I don't really have any
interest in particular.

294
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,520
However,

295
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,760
I do love tea.

296
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,800
I wonder what Prince Chen
does in his free time?

297
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
Well,

298
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,840
I love to visit the public house.

299
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,000
What are the odds? I went
to some places in my homeland.

300
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,320
But I have never been
to a public house.

301
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,160
I wonder if Prince Chen
have the time...

302
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,040
to show me around the public house?

303
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,000
Are you even a woman?

304
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,480
You actually want to see
a public house?

305
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,040
My intention is not
about the public house.

306
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,440
I just want a chance to
know you better.

307
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,840
I wish to find out
what kind of lady do you like.

308
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,120
Mother, pardon me
but I am feeling unwell.

309
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,960
I must be on my way now.

310
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,720
Little brat.

311
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,560
Princess, make yourself at home.

312
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
Same goes for everyone.

313
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Your Highness.

314
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Perhaps...

315
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,320
His Majesty is going
to let Prince Li marry the princess.

316
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
I thought we have another six months.

317
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,080
Even if that is my father's plan,

318
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,320
there is nothing my father can
do if she refuses to get married.

319
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,800
Your Highness must know,

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,280
Her Majesty held a feast recently.

321
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,800
The Princess showed her
liking in Prince Chen.

322
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,880
Prince Chen and Li are inseparable.

323
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,560
If Prince Chen marries her,

324
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
it would be just like
Prince Li married her.

325
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Your Highness, we cannot
let our guard down.

326
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,200
She is but a mere princess.

327
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
There is no way she
is a threat to me.

328
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Besides, judging from Wu Yu's temper,

329
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,680
if he really does marry that
roguish princess,

330
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,040
that could be a great show to enjoy.

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,640
Your Highness,

332
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,960
do you know Prince Li is investigating
the case of rank-selling?

333
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,760
I thought no one knows?

334
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
How did he find out?

335
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
A snitch told Prince Li.

336
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,800
But rest assured, I came prepared.

337
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,600
The snitch is no longer with us.

338
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,400
But we can see just how
ambitious Prince Li is.

339
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,000
We can't afford to get sloppy.

340
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,680
Wu You is always care-free
and a man of seclusion.

341
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,760
He tricked me into trusting him.

342
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
But he is actually
plotting against me.

343
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Calm down, Your Highness.

344
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,720
What we must do now...

345
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,440
is to stop Prince Li from
expanding his influence.

346
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
The order for the marriage
is yet to arrive.

347
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
It's not too late for us.

348
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,160
You mean...

349
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,120
Your Highness is already married.

350
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,400
Marrying the princess is not possible.

351
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,040
Unless, we make her...

352
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
married to one of us.

353
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
My Father won't agree with this.

354
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,600
Unless...

355
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,440
Not only is Princess Rong Le hideous,

356
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,160
her behaviour is even more surprising.

357
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,440
She asked to visit the public house
with me while Her Majesty was there.

358
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,880
Wu You.

359
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,200
Why would a lady
even act like she did?

360
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
Isn't that great?

361
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,760
You don't need to visit the
public house on your own.

362
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,840
You can bring your wife along.

363
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,800
A couple sharing the same interest.

364
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,440
That could be a great tale for us.

365
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,040
Wu You, stop making fun of me.

366
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
Don't you think something is fishy?

367
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,720
She was into you just moments ago,

368
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,880
and now she got her eyes
on me instead?

369
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,880
Something is not right about this.

370
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,600
A conspiracy, something is at miss.

371
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,840
If you know she is planning something,
why bother worrying?

372
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,440
I am being cautious.

373
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,400
I may not as good-looking as you are,

374
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,640
but at least I am subtle and dapper,
chivalrous and a gentleman.

375
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,560
Did she really fall for me?

376
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,040
Brother?

377
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,880
Time flies like an arrow.

378
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Even Ya Li is of age
to get a husband now.

379
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,640
So, your father is Wu You's teacher.

380
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,800
You were a childhood friend of Wu You.

381
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,600
You are meant for each other.

382
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,120
-What a shame.
-Your Majesty.

383
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,560
I don't deserve Prince Li.

384
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,280
It's the Emperor's decision.
The Princess is in our land.

385
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,640
They may not be married yet,

386
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,560
but the marriage
agreement still stands.

387
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,920
Ya Li.

388
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,040
What is your plan now?

389
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,560
I am still too young.

390
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,640
I just want to spend more time
with my father.

391
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't wish to plan
for a marriage yet.

392
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,280
You may not be in a hurry,

393
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
but I am concerned.

394
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,720
Your mother was like a sister to me.

395
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,600
If you ever find someone you love,

396
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,520
you must let me know.

397
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,400
I will be your witness.

398
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes, thank you.
Your Majesty.

399
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,840
You have always been
an obedient child.

400
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,080
Perhaps too obedient.

401
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,240
You might run into trouble someday.

402
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,560
Your Highness.

403
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,400
I am leaving.

404
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,640
Do you need the guards with you?

405
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,840
No.

406
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,680
I am sure you all know
about Her Majesty's order.

407
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,120
From now on,

408
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,800
I don't need the guards to follow me.

409
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,560
I have Xiao Sha to protect me.

410
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,960
Yes.

411
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
Is there anything else?

412
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,480
I must come along
to ensure your safety.

413
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,400
Sending guards may be
too high-profile.

414
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,240
If it's just me, it won't draw
as much attention.

415
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
I grew up in Zhongshan.

416
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,160
If there is anything
great on the street,

417
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,640
-I know all about them.
-I am not going out now.

418
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
Back to the room.

419
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
I knew you are here.

420
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,240
Why? Are you still upset about
what happened back there?

421
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,560
You'll see, Wu You and I will teach
that son of Prince Qing He a lesson.

422
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,160
How dare he bully you.

423
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,880
No, I know.

424
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,520
As long as you and
Brother Wu You are here,

425
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,240
no one would dare to bully me.

426
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Besides, I have Princess Rong Le
to back me up now.

427
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,960
The princess?

428
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,760
Don't be so naive, okay?

429
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
Haven't you heard?

430
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Not only is she ugly,
she has a foul temper too!

431
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,880
Of course not!

432
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,160
Your heart brings
about the appearance.

433
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,000
She is so kind, she can't be ugly.

434
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
When I first met her,

435
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,600
I feel like she is so friendly.

436
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
But I don't get it.

437
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,560
Why would Wu You refuse to marry her?

438
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,560
What could you possibly understand?

439
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,600
Wu You was too protective for you.

440
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
It made you naive and simple-minded.

441
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
You should just listen to me.

442
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,480
Stay away from all the troubles. Okay?

443
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,400
What? You are no better than me!

444
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,560
All you ever know is to have fun.

445
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
How dare you lecture me!

446
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,040
Princess Rong Le humiliated you
in front of everyone,

447
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,440
I like her even more now!

448
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,960
You...

449
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,200
Madam Qiu.

450
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,200
I heard you came from Zhongshan.

451
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,440
Master Xiao, how may I help you?

452
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,840
I heard Zhongshan is a land
full of beauties.

453
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,200
Princess?

454
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,800
They say the dairy cake
of Zhongshan is delicious.

455
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,880
Let me get you some from the market.

456
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,360
Beauty...

457
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,560
I have never seen one.

458
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,320
But I did see a lot of ugly ladies.

459
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,120
But...

460
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,440
Master Xiao, why are
you leaving again?

461
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,880
I am...

462
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,200
Why is your face all red?

463
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,520
Sorry for the long wait, Master Chen.

464
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,560
-This way, please.
-Ladies, bring out the wine!

465
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,880
Master Chang, how do
you like the lady?

466
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,200
Not bad.

467
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
Look at this handsome young man.

468
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,480
You are so striking that
all our ladies are outshined!

469
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,520
Madam, I wish to see Miss Chen Yu.

470
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,160
Please, make this arrangement for me.

471
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,880
Unfortunately, Chen Yu is being
reserved by those gentlemen.

472
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,800
Come.

473
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
Let's go upstairs.

474
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
Come.

475
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,480
<i>I thought he doesn't touch
wine and women.</i>

476
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,080
Those gentlemen are here
for Miss Chen Yu too?

477
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,720
After all, Miss Chen Yu
is one of the kind here.

478
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,880
Madam.

479
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,880
I simply ask for Miss Chen Yu
to play a song for me.

480
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,480
It won't take up too much time.

481
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,480
Well...

482
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,520
Sure, not a problem at all.

483
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,760
I will send Miss Chen Yu
to your room first.

484
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,160
Then, I will send her
to the next room.

485
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
As for the other gentlemen,

486
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,680
they did paid for her.

487
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,120
I can't possibly disrespect them.

488
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,480
Right?

489
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,600
Greetings, sir.

490
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
I have heard about how gorgeous
and beautiful you are.

491
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,480
Now that I met you,

492
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,120
the words are true.

493
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,920
Much appreciated, sir.

494
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
You are quite the gentleman yourself.

495
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,720
I am not here to seek pleasure.

496
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,280
I simply wish to
strike a deal with you.

497
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
Sir, I doubt I am the right person.

498
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,600
I am but a humble courtesan.

499
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,760
Why would you need me
for a business deal?

500
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,960
Sixteen years ago,

501
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,840
there was a local officer.

502
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
He was involved in Qin Yong's mutiny.

503
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,840
His whole family was executed.

504
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,240
A total of 79 family members
were killed.

505
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,880
But when the bodies
were sent in for autopsy,

506
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,760
one body was missing.

507
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,240
I heard the missing body...

508
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,960
belonged to the youngest daughter.

509
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,080
His family name is Yu.

510
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,720
Her daughter was born in the morning.

511
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,200
As the sun rises, the child was born.

512
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,240
He have her the name Yu Cheng,
meaning morning.

513
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,280
Chen Yu...

514
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
Yu Chen.

515
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,240
I don't know what you
are talking about.

516
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,520
I am sure you understand.

517
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,760
If I can find out about this,

518
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,680
so can the others.

519
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Don't you fear for your own safety?

520
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
If I mean you harm,

521
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,040
I wouldn't bother with
the explanation.

522
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,640
What do you want from me?

523
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,760
Miss, calm down.

524
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,640
I am not telling you this
to threaten you.

525
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,560
I am seeking the truth of the past.

526
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,440
As for your compensation,

527
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,880
name any price you want.

528
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,400
What if I tell you...

529
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,240
I want to leave this place?

530
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,120
Can you make it happen?

531
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,800
If this is your wish,

532
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,520
I shall try my best.

533
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,640
Madam Qin's greed knows no bound.

534
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
She won't let me leave.

535
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,120
Unless...

536
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,600
your status is even more
prominent than her mastermind.

537
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,800
-Mastermind?
-Man above all,

538
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,600
all but one.

539
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,040
<i>It's the Crown Prince?</i>

540
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,120
Miss Chen Yu,
the guest asked for you.

541
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Fine.

542
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,600
I don't think you can help me.

543
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,320
So long.

544
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,760
Will you put your faith
in me for once?

545
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,200
I have a plan to get you
out of here today.

546
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,000
Are you serious about this?

547
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,160
Wu You, the girl I am fond of...

548
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,600
is skilled in instruments and dance,
elegant and gorgeous.

549
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,840
She may not have a noble status,

550
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,920
but she is more innocent than
most noble women.

551
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,600
I apologize for the long wait.

552
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,800
I am sorry for my tardiness.

553
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,320
As a token of apology,
I shall present you a dance.

554
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,280
Would you like that?

555
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,200
The rest of you can leave now.

556
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,000
Chen Yu, I have never
seen you dance before.

557
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,960
I get to witness it
thanks to my brother here.

558
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,560
While you are dancing,

559
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,320
approach the man with green outfit.

560
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,960
You might get hurt, but not killed.

561
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
Leave the rest to me.

562
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,520
Help!

563
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,000
Help!

564
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,680
Help! Madam, help me!

565
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,040
Leng Yan, stop!

566
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,160
Who dare hurt my precious baby?

567
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,560
Tell me who did this,
I will settle this for you.

568
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,840
How are you going to settle this?

569
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,880
Wu You, just show some mercy.

570
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,760
She might not mean it.

571
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,600
Did my girl do something
to offend you?

572
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,640
Chen Yu is the best we have here.

573
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,240
The hands she used to play
the chords with are priceless!

574
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,400
What if her priceless hands
are exactly what I want?

575
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,240
What did she do to you?

576
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,680
Why would you want
to cut her hands off?

577
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,560
I accidentally touched
Prince Li's shoulder.

578
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,040
Prince Li? Kneel!

579
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
You doomed me this time!

580
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
Please, show some mercy.

581
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,760
The House of Fragrance
is a big family,

582
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,760
we rely on her hands for livelihood.

583
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,520
Chen Yu, how did you find out
who we are?

584
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,600
I can tell you are no commoner,
you look chivalrous.

585
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,640
I know what I see.

586
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,880
Your Highness refused to let us know,

587
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,800
I wouldn't dare to speculate
your identity.

588
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,360
But His Highness called you Wu You.

589
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,680
I am certain you are Prince Li.

590
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,680
It was a careless mistake of mine.

591
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,760
I hope Prince Chen can save my life.

592
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,040
-Leng Yan.
-Yes!

593
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,840
I want her out of my sight.

594
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,240
-Brother!
-Stop!

595
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,640
I think I have met you somewhere.

596
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,280
Can we speak in private?

597
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,160
Mistress?

598
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,800
Madam Qiu.

599
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,360
The Princess is resting.
Please, do not bother her.

600
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,440
Captain Xiao.

601
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
I am here...

602
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
to send the medicine.

603
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,040
Madam Qiu, the Princess
is not feeling well.

604
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,160
If someone bothers her
and she seeks to blame me...

605
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,640
I will keep this soup warm.

606
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,360
She can have it when she is awake.

607
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,600
She wanted to go out this morning.

608
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,480
But she hasn't stepped
outside the room.

609
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,240
She is not making a sound either.

610
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,880
She is gone.
Madam Qiu is gone.

611
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,360
It's getting late.
Why isn't Her Highness back yet?

612
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,640
You are right.

613
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,320
Did something happen to her?

614
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,480
Should we send Brother Xiao
to check on her?

615
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,360
No, Master Xiao is her bodyguard,
he can't leave his post.

616
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,240
Madam Qiu is keeping
watch on us outside.

617
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,720
If he leaves now,

618
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,640
they will find out the Princess
has sneaked out.

619
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,640
The people here will take it wrongly.

620
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,000
What do we do now?

621
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,080
I just told everyone in the manor.

622
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,800
The Princess is not feeling well
and she needs to rest.

623
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Yes, fortune favours her.
I am sure she will be fine.

624
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,520
Right, Lian Xin.

625
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,920
Her Highness has headache
ever since she has the amnesia.

626
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,440
She had headache
around this time last month.

627
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,800
It's almost time.

628
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,040
Hurry up and prepare the medicine
for Her Highness.

629
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,800
Keep an eye on it.
Remember,

630
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,080
do not let anyone else
touch the medicine.

631
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,560
-Is that clear?
-Okay, I should get going.

632
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,480
I will be guarding outside.

633
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,480
Leng Yue, keep acting
like the Princess.

634
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,640
Remember not to move around
or talk to anyone.

635
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,640
You have an keen sight.

636
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,400
I am Man Yao, the young owner
of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

637
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,560
I didn't recognize you that day.

638
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,040
I didn't know you were royalties.

639
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,640
If I did anything to offend you,

640
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,680
I apologize and
hope you can look past it.

641
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,160
After you left,

642
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,960
I found something in the Teahouse.

643
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,240
Let me see it.

644
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,840
I don't know what it is.

645
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,440
May I ask,

646
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,560
is this enough to save Chen Yu's life?

647
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,760
Wu You.

648
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,120
This really is a letter from Sir Zhao.

649
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,800
But why is this in your possession?

650
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,080
When you left that day,

651
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,240
I thought the room needed
to be cleansed of bad luck,

652
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,360
so I ordered some men
to renovate the private room.

653
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,840
I found this in the wall.

654
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,640
I thought the deceased
might have left it there.

655
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,280
Besides, this might be
rather important to Your Highness.

656
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,720
Why didn't you tell us sooner
if you know this?

657
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
I was about to hand it
to the authority.

658
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,720
You want to trade this thing
for the girl's life?

659
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,600
I wish to pay for her deed.

660
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,240
I was planning on appointing her
as musician in my Teahouse.

661
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,360
I want my Teahouse
to be known by the world.

662
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,840
Miss Chen Yu is great
with music and her look.

663
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,120
There is no better option
other than her.

664
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,720
But this letter means nothing to me.

665
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,920
It's not worth a person's life.

666
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,800
Brother.

667
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,880
But for me, Miss Chen Yu is worth
more than any treasure.

668
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,160
Fine.

669
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,240
You may trade your hand...

670
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,480
for her life.
