1
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,800
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
Episode 47

3
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,600
Sir Sun.

4
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,280
Why do you think I will agree?

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,160
We have known each other
for many years.

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,120
I think that I had been
of help to you.

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,880
You became a well-known general for
your contribution in southern fringe.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,680
With Sun family's support, you'll rise
to be the master of this country.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,240
Now, I have the secret information
about southern fringe's defence.

10
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,240
It can help you take down
southern fringe.

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
Sir Sun.

12
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,160
The friendship we have before this...

13
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,440
is just for our own benefits.

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,760
But now,

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,400
you want to change
your allegiance to me.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
I have to be clear then.

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,440
What is the value of your loyalty?

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,920
Today, you betray the secret
of southern fringe to me.

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,000
Will you betray Northern Realm's
secret to Zongzheng Wu You...

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
in the future?

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
Of course not.

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,760
You can even barter away
your own daughter.

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,000
And you can even betray Wu You who
was your student for so many years.

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
How am I going to trust your loyalty?

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Besides,

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,400
you had taught Zongzheng Wu You
so many years for nothing.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,800
Even I, understand Zongzheng Wu You
better than you.

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
If he can share with you
those secret information...

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,040
that you talked of, then it means,
they are not so secret anyway.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
And your daughter will be safer off...

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
with him than with me.

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,800
Guards.

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
Your Highness, this...

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
Sir Sun, don't put up a fight.
Just go.

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,400
Forgive me for not being able
to see you off. Bring him away.

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Your Highness, have you lost your
trust in me because I've failed...

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
the Silver-Hair Demon mission?

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,840
Your Highness!

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,440
How dare you mention this to me.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
You used this lowly tactic
in my name...

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,440
to put Rong Le in dire.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,280
And you even kept
information from me...

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
until I almost died in Qingzhou.

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,480
Sir Sun.

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
You have planned it out so well.

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Take him away and chop off his head.

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Fu Chou, you promised me that...

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,720
you'll spare my family's life if I
carry out this Silver-Hair Demon plan.

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,720
How could you break
your promise, scoundrel!

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,880
You've always been my favourite.

51
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,960
I remember that when I first saw you,

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,880
I felt that...

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,960
you are quite similar to...

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,840
the younger me.

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,920
I really never thought that you,

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,920
Zongzheng Yun He,

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,200
who is my greatest enemy
and my greatest villain...

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,160
that was burnt into
my mind since young...

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
will turn out like this today.
A useless man...

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,520
weighed down with age.

61
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,800
If I were you,

62
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,800
I would have cursed myself
hundreds and thousands of time.

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Fu Chou, you...

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,200
and your ulterior motives.

65
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,600
You usurped the throne and
hurt your father and brother.

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,960
Or perhaps,
you want to curse my mother...

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,480
for being evil and sinister.

68
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,200
After all, she had murdered
your beloved one...

69
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,840
right in front of you.

70
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,200
But if others had gone through
the same as what she had,

71
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
they might become even more...

72
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,160
sinister and scarier than her.

73
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,920
After all, she did it to save me.

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,040
The sin that my mother
had committed...

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
can only be borne by...

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,640
this son of hers.

77
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,880
Now, I too have experienced...

78
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
the pain of losing someone you love.

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
But back then,

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,120
you really shouldn't have destroyed
my mother's lifetime happiness...

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
for the person you love.

82
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,280
Back then, if only...

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,680
you had some conscience
as a father and husband,

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
this tragedy might not have happened.

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
Now,

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
I feel that my mother's temperament
has changed drastically.

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
She is too resentful in some things.

88
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
I keep on feeling that...

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,720
she is doing something behind my back.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
West...

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
West...

92
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
What are you trying to say?

93
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,640
What else can you say?

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
West...

95
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,480
Yes, for the past one year and a half,

96
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
the curses that were pointed
to me and my mother...

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,440
were quite a handful.

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
West...

99
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,600
You know something?

100
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
West?

101
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,760
What you wrote is the word 'west'?

102
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,200
Chou.

103
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,520
Mother.

104
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,280
Chou, if you want to see me,

105
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,800
you can just ask Chang Jian
to inform me.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,360
No need to come to
this place by yourself.

107
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,240
This man here...

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,720
will just be an eyesore to you.

109
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,640
You have to nurse
your injuries in peace.

110
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Look at your legs.

111
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
Mother.

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
Are you in touch...

113
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,080
with Sun Ji Zhou in Qingzhou?

114
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm just a woman in a palace.

115
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
How can I be in touch with
a person who is miles away?

116
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
Chou,

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,880
don't let your imagination run wild.

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,640
Nurse your injuries in peace.

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,240
When you have recovered,

120
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,560
you can wage war
against southern fringe...

121
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,560
and cut Zongzheng Wu You into pieces.

122
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,520
But now, the snow storm has cut off
the road along with the food supplies.

123
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
I think that...

124
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,360
it's better to go back to Zhongshan
to regroup and recuperate first.

125
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
When I have fully recovered,

126
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
I'll take down southern fringe.

127
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
-Chou.
-Mother.

128
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,920
This is a national affair.

129
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
I can't discuss it with you.

130
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,720
I'll have to take my leave now.

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,840
Miss Sun.

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't come near me.

133
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,920
Ling Yue. Finally, you are here.

134
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,920
You are here to get me out, right?

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
Ya Li.

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,480
Ya Li, this must be hard on you.

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,960
Xiao Sha is just following orders.

138
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,400
Please don't blame him.

139
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm in such a dire state right now.

140
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,880
There is no use for me...

141
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,400
-to blame anybody.
-Don't say that.

142
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
You are just grounded here
for the moment.

143
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,920
You'll be fine then after they
manage to recapture Sir Sun.

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
I don't want him to.

145
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,080
I rather hope that he doesn't
come back forever.

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
He can't come back.

147
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,360
He can't come back.

148
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,080
By the way, here.
I brought you some food.

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Quick. Come here.

150
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,120
Eat it while it's hot.

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,440
Ya Li.

152
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
I've brought you some of my clothes.

153
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,880
I know that you had worn better
clothes than these in the past.

154
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
So, please don't mind
about the quality.

155
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm not in the position
to be picky now.

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm already very happy that...

157
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
you are here to visit me.

158
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,160
By the way, you've brought
so many things with you.

159
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,120
Will Rong Le scold you...

160
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,960
if she knows about it?

161
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
She won't.

162
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
You know that she treats
the servants very well.

163
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,280
Moreover, she's in a sweet cocoon
with His Highness now.

164
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
She doesn't have time for us.

165
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,840
-Is that so?
-Yes.

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
Good then.

167
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,200
Why are you here?

168
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,160
I came here to because I heard that
you've brought a huge bag with you.

169
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,480
I never thought that
you are here to visit her.

170
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,160
She plotted against His Highness...

171
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,560
and destroyed His Highness and
Princess's relationship. She is evil.

172
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,640
You should stay away
from her person like her.

173
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Xiao Sha, she is not
a person like that.

174
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,800
Besides, she is my friend.

175
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,960
When she was still a noble lady,
she had treated me very well.

176
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,080
Now, she has fallen and nobody
is here to take care of her.

177
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
I can't possibly
leave her alone, right?

178
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Besides, for the incident last time,

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,480
Ya Li must have done that by mistake
because she was forced by her father.

180
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,520
-She was not like that in the past.
-No matter how she is in the past,

181
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,320
she has changed now.

182
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,760
For some things,

183
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,160
if she had done it once,
she will do it again and again.

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
If you help her this time...

185
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,520
and if she wants to hurt
the Princess in the future,

186
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,760
-you'll become an indirect accomplice.
-She won't do it.

187
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,280
Moreover,

188
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
it's impossible that I will...

189
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,360
Enough. I know you won't.

190
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,840
But she will.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,720
She is Princess's enemy now.
You can't be kind to your enemy.

192
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,760
Or else, you'll be disloyal
to the Princess.

193
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,840
Alright, I get it.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,160
By the way,

195
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,120
don't tell Princess that
I came to visit her.

196
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,080
Or else, she will be mad for sure.

197
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,000
Make sure that there's no next time.

198
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,520
Let's go.

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,040
" Man Yin Chamber "

200
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,360
<i>He killed my father.</i>

201
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,280
<i>And he destroyed my mother.</i>

202
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,760
<i>My hatred for him is bone deep.</i>

203
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,320
<i>But compared to your life,</i>

204
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
<i>it's nothing for me...</i>

205
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,000
<i>to own him a favour.</i>

206
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
It's all because of me.

208
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,040
No need to blame yourself.

209
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,640
This is my choice.

210
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,760
It's not your fault.

211
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,760
<i>Face the possible truth?</i>

212
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,240
<i>I cried when you leave and I keep on
reminiscing the happy times we had.</i>

213
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,800
<i>The regrets that I have...</i>

214
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>will last me a lifetime.</i>

215
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,040
Princess, this Blood Raven Roots
is indeed very effective.

216
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,760
Looks at you now. You are as beautiful
as ever and you are glowing in it.

217
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
Later, when you go to the hall for
a meeting with the officials,

218
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,960
they will be in for a shock.

219
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,240
At first, I thought that...

220
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,080
it'll be a happy thing if I could...

221
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,040
restore my past look one day.

222
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
I never thought that
I'll feel like this.

223
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
Consort Rong Le.

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,760
His Highness had left Qingzhou
last night to go to the border.

225
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,600
Today's morning court
has been cancelled.

226
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,360
What?

227
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Princess, walk slowly.

228
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,280
I think hatred must be
burning in his veins now.

229
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,840
He had led his troops to the border
without waiting for the snow to melt.

230
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm afraid that he's going to fight
to death with Northern Realm.

231
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,360
I just never thought that he
will leave without telling you first.

232
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,280
I understand.

233
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,280
Actually, I don't dare
to face him too.

234
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,520
How can I force him
to face me as well?

235
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,280
How can His Highness be like that?

236
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,320
Princess's leg is still wounded.

237
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,760
How can he leave without a word?
There are so many things here...

238
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,720
I have another report.

239
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,240
We received words from
The Hidden Ones.

240
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Sun Ji Zhou has been murdered
by the people of Northern Realm.

241
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
Ya Li has been staying
in her manor recently.

242
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,920
I wonder how she is.

243
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,920
Don't tell Ya Li about this first...

244
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,880
in case she lets her
imagination runs wild.

245
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,200
Princess.

246
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
I think...

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,360
it's better if you
forget about Miss Sun.

248
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,720
What is it?

249
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,360
You are very close with her.

250
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,320
You didn't go to visit her recently?

251
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,560
No.

252
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,800
I didn't go to visit her. Xiao Sha...

253
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,440
Xiao Sha has forbid me to do so.

254
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,480
By the way, Princess,

255
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Miss Sun's maidservant, Chun Ni...

256
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
has requested to see you.

257
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,840
Chun Ni?

258
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,960
Then something might have
happened to Ya Li.

259
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,760
Xiao Sha. Bring Chun Ni here.
Let me ask her.

260
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,120
Yes, Princess.

261
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,320
-Leng Yan!
-Here!

262
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,880
Order the troops to set out now!

263
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
We have to reach the border
and set up our camp before sunset!

264
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,400
March forward!

266
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,920
Greetings, Consort Rong Le.

267
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
Chun Ni.

268
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,360
Ling Yue said that you
wanted to see me.

269
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,840
What is it?

270
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,600
Please accept me under your wings...

271
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,200
and let me serve you.

272
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Why?

273
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,000
I remember that when
Sun's Manor was confiscated,

274
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
you were the only one...

275
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,280
who were willing to stay by
Ya Li's side to serve her.

276
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
Why will you leave her now?

277
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,480
I don't want to be a person who
will leave a fallen mistress too.

278
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,200
But...

279
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,200
Miss Sun hits you?

280
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,000
Ever since Miss Sun
is grounded in her manor,

281
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
it's like she has changed into
another person.

282
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,640
Now, she always hit me
without any reasons.

283
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,560
She thinks too much.

284
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,560
She can't forget her past humiliation.

285
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
But still, she shouldn't hit you.

286
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,120
I don't blame her.

287
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,560
I think...

288
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,720
it might be because I've seen her
went through all of that.

289
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,440
As long as I'm by her side, I'll be
a thorn that reminds her of the past.

290
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,320
If I leave Miss Sun,

291
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,400
maybe she will get better.

292
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,760
Consort Rong Le, please help me out...

293
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,280
and let me serve you.

294
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
-Get up first.
-Consort Rong Le.

295
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,720
How about you get her out of the manor
so that she can choose her own life?

296
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,440
I don't wish to leave the manor.

297
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,640
I was abandoned by
my parents since young.

298
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,720
I have no one to rely on.

299
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,600
Luckily, Miss Sun is willing
to keep me.

300
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,280
Now, I don't even have
a family member that I can rely on.

301
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
I know that...

302
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,560
Miss Sun has done you wrong.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm willing to serve you
with all my heart...

304
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,440
to atone for Miss Sun's sins.

305
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,160
-Please, Princess.
-Get up first.

306
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,280
Chun Ni, get up first.

307
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,720
Her Highness has agreed.

308
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,560
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

309
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,760
Xiao Sha.

310
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,200
Bring Chun Ni to Ke so that
Ke can treat her wounds.

311
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,920
After that, ask her to go to the
side palace to take a look at Ya Li.

312
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,480
Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Princess.

314
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,480
Slowly.

315
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
You have always been close to Ya Li.

316
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
But because of me,
you didn't go to visit her recently.

317
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,240
If it wasn't for Chun Ni,

318
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,720
I'm afraid that we wouldn't
know about Ya Li's condition.

319
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,200
Please punish me, Princess.

320
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,720
Actually, after Miss Sun
is grounded in this manor,

321
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,320
I had gone to visit her
a couple of times in secret.

322
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,440
And I too found out that
something is wrong with her.

323
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,600
But after that, Xiao Sha...

324
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,320
told me not to visit her anymore.

325
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,080
After I thought about it,
I'm afraid that she'll harm you.

326
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,400
So, I didn't tell you about it.

327
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,440
Slowly, Princess.

328
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Now, Sun Ji Zhou is dead...

329
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,440
and Chun Ni has left her.

330
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
Ya Li is all alone now.

331
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,080
From what Chun Ni had described,
something is wrong with Ya Li.

332
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,920
How about you come
with me while I visit her?

333
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,160
Alright.

334
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,040
Princess, walk slowly.

335
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
You've scared me.

336
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,920
Don't come near me.

337
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,560
You are indeed sick.

338
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,280
You are pale.

339
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,280
Your breathing laboured,
low vital energy and are delirious.

340
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,080
Have you been having delusions lately?

341
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,320
Did you feel that somebody wants to
hit you, scold you or even kill you?

342
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,040
No.

343
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,160
Nobody is here to kill me.

344
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
Nobody is here to kill me.

345
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,360
Princess Rong Le.

346
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,840
What is wrong with her?

347
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
This is a mental disease.

348
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,360
But luckily, her symptoms show that
she's in the first stage.

349
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
She'll be fine after some medication.

350
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,520
I don't want to take any medication.
I'm not sick.

351
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,960
You are sick.

352
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,800
Who knows that you won't
poison my medicine.

353
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,680
Don't come here.
Don't come near me.

354
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,280
Demon. You are a demon!

355
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,040
You can just go and seduce
all those men. Don't come here.

356
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,160
Don't come over here.

357
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,800
She has silver hair.

358
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,120
This black hair is just a delusion.

359
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,400
That's right.

360
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,320
It's just a delusion.
All of them are just delusions.

361
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,560
All of them are just delusions.

362
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,560
Princess, I think...

363
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Miss Sun has really gone crazy.

364
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,800
Ling Yue.

365
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,480
You are here, Ling Yue.

366
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,480
Finally you are here, Ling Yue.
That's great.

367
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
That's not right.

368
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,120
You can't be with her.
She's a demon.

369
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,960
If you are with her, you'll get hurt.
Do you know that?

370
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,080
You can't be with her.

371
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,440
Ya Li.

372
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,000
Ya Li.

373
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,640
Princess. Miss Sun has really
gone crazy. Let's leave at once.

374
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,320
Ling Yue. Are you going
to leave me too?

375
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
My father has escaped alone.

376
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,800
And I don't know where Chun Ni went.

377
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,120
Now,

378
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
are you going to abandon me as well?

379
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
Or is it that...

380
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,160
since the very beginning,

381
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,680
you are sent here to spy on me?

382
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,120
Ya Li!

383
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,760
Don't come near me, all of you!

384
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,720
Princess Rong Le.

385
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,800
You'll only upset her further
if you are here.

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,280
How about we go back first?

387
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,640
I'll give her some medication.
She'll be better after she takes it.

388
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,120
Let me out!

389
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Let me out!

390
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,680
Let me out.

391
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,760
Greetings, Consort Rong Le.

392
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,520
Uncle, please have a seat.

393
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,760
Recently, His Highness has sent us
some emergency letters...

394
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,880
to ask for backup troops.

395
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,280
But you've been absent
from the morning court...

396
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,560
with the reason being sick.

397
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,360
You wouldn't send forward
any backup troops.

398
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,760
May I know the reason?

399
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,520
Do you think...

400
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,440
this is the best time to go
into war with Northern Realm?

401
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,800
I had been pondering about it
for the past few days.

402
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,960
But I didn't manage
to get an answer for it.

403
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,200
Based on reason,

404
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
we have rested
for more than one year...

405
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
because we want to wait
for the best chance...

406
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,720
to achieve the greatest victory
with the lowest cost.

407
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,920
But it is really risky to march...

408
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,280
our troops to them so recklessly now.

409
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,680
But based on emotion...

410
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,720
Based on emotion,

411
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,480
all of us can understand
Wu You's action.

412
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,920
Fu Chou had killed his father
and stolen the country.

413
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,800
Now, even Wu You's mother is...

414
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,800
Such bone deep hatred.

415
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,080
Even I, want to kill
Fu Chou for revenge.

416
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
Let alone Wu You who is their son.

417
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
When the late emperor was in dire,

418
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,440
I had to leave the camp to find help.

419
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
That had resulted in the death
of the late emperor.

420
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,760
Until now,

421
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,440
I still have a nightmare
about him every night...

422
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,520
where he is covered in blood.

423
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,400
Such keenly felt pain...

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,320
is what I share with Wu You.

425
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
If it wasn't because
I'm too old and weak,

426
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,720
I'll definitely join the battle.

427
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
I want to kill Fu Chou
with my own hands.

428
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,040
But I don't dare to
let him take that risk.

429
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,840
You just know that...

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,760
it'll be a slim victory
if we wage war in haste...

431
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,320
while the snow has cut off the
road along with the food supplies.

432
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,440
But you don't know that...

433
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,520
we have a bigger issue here.

434
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,080
Only me and Wu You know about it.

435
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,040
If I tell you about it,

436
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,080
I beg you not to disclose
this secret to others.

437
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,600
What issue is it? Tell me now.

438
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,760
You may leave first.

439
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,120
Yes, Your Highness.

440
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,360
After the earthquake in Zhuo...

441
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,240
together with the spreading
of the plague,

442
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,480
a lot of the army's
fine horses are dead.

443
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,280
We are left with less than a third
compared to the original numbers.

444
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,880
General Luo Zhi had won
those battles in the border...

445
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,840
by bluff and bluster only.
They don't dare to attack.

446
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,840
And that's because they lack horses.

447
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
So,

448
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,320
with the numbers we have now,

449
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,400
even if we can win by chance,

450
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,720
we can't drive straight in to the core
of Zhongshan to defeat them.

451
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,080
We can only fight with them
at the border of Northern Realm and...

452
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,640
wasting the strength of the country
and the army that didn't come by easy.

453
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,360
These are what you worried about?

454
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
That's right.

455
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,640
I had tossed and turned,
pondering about this issue.

456
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Because I can't discuss this secret
with our fellow officials...

457
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,440
and at the same time, I'm in
bitter regret that because of me,

458
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,120
Wu You has lost his parents
and has abandoned the country.

459
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,360
You don't have an answer whether
or not we should go into battle.

460
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,280
And I am tortured by it as well.

461
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,120
But I'm clear about one thing.

462
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,760
I can't let Wu You get hurt...

463
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,960
and I can't let the people of
southern fringe get hurt.

464
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,680
I understand what is
in your thoughts now.

465
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,120
To make a decision that
can affect the country,

466
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,400
it's indeed too much of a burden
for you to carry by yourself.

467
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
Don't worry, I'll help you
reassure and deal with...

468
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
the officials in the court.

469
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,840
Thank you, uncle.

470
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,360
But you need to be clear.

471
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,560
The officials obey you...

472
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,400
because of Wu You's determination
to turn Gray for you.

473
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
If you keep on delaying
the decision to send backup...

474
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,240
and leave Wu You
alone in the front line,

475
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,760
I think there will be
uproar in the court.

476
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,040
I already wrote a letter for Wu You.

477
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,560
I believe that he will
make the best decision.

478
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,280
Since you already have a plan,

479
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
I don't have to worry for now.

480
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,720
If you face any difficulties
in the court,

481
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
you can come to me.

482
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,800
Thank you, uncle.

483
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,080
Farewell.

484
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,600
Xiao Sha.

485
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,320
Consort Rong Le.

486
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Go to the border and
give this letter to Wu You.

487
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,720
This is a very important letter.
Keep it by your side always.

488
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,800
You have to personally give it
to Wu You himself.

489
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
Tell him that I'll
wait for his decision.

490
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,400
Don't worry, Consort Rong Le.
I'll depart at once.

491
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,680
Xiao Sha!

492
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Why are you here?

493
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,960
You are going to the border
just like this?

494
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,440
Don't you know
that it's cold up north?

495
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,240
Can't you wear more clothes?

496
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,440
Take it.

497
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
You always forget to take care
of yourself when you are busy.

498
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Are you a little bit angry at me?

499
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,480
Actually, I'm going there
on Princess's order.

500
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,760
It's not dangerous.
Wait for my return.

501
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,280
-I'll spend my time with you then.
-Look at you. All words no action.

502
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,360
You said that you'll accompany me
but how many times had you done that?

503
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,600
At any rate, for you,

504
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,280
Princess has always been
more important than me.

505
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
Are you jealous?

506
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,360
Princess and us depend on each other.
We are one.

507
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,320
For me, you are as important as her.

508
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
When I come back this time,

509
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,280
I'll ask Princess to let me marry you.

510
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,400
When the time comes, if you
don't want to stay in the manor,

511
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,120
I'll beg Princess to free us.

512
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,840
She won't stop us for sure.

513
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,120
From now on,
no matter where you want to go,

514
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,600
I'll go with you.

515
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,400
Enough.

516
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,680
It's late already.

517
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
Go now. Be careful on the road.

518
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,600
-Come back earlier.
-Alright. I'll leave now.

519
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Wu You!

520
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,160
Don't go.

521
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,600
Princess!

522
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,400
Princess.

523
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,600
What is it, Princess?

524
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,400
Are you having nightmare again?

525
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,640
I'm fine now.

526
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,320
Ever since His Highness left,

527
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,400
you haven't been sleeping well.

528
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,520
Maybe you've gotten used to
His Highness sleeping by your side.

529
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,760
How about I keep watch tonight...

530
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,120
and sit by your bed to serve you?

531
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,360
It's fine.

532
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,280
You have been taking care of
my leg wound for the past few days.

533
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,080
You must be exhausted.

534
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,600
Your Highness, you have taken me in.

535
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,440
It's like you have saved my life.

536
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,960
I'm grateful for you but
I don't have a way to repay you.

537
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,560
Please agree to let me
keep watch for you at night.

538
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,760
Let me repay you.

539
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,080
I'll have to trouble you then.

540
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,640
I'll go and get ready then.

541
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,720
Tomorrow night,
I'll come here to keep watch for you.

542
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
Princess, I don't have to worry then.

543
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,760
I'll take my leave now.

544
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Wu You.

545
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,120
Will you agree with my decision...

546
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,480
after you get my letter?

547
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,600
" Linan Door "

548
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,600
Your Highness, we received 20
emergency letters from the front line.

549
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,040
Please lead a troop forward
to back them up.

550
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,600
Prince Li's troops are already
stationed at Tong Pass.

551
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,440
He might attack anytime now.

552
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,800
Chang Jian, pass down my order.

553
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,400
No matter how Zongzheng Wu You
provoke us with his troops,

554
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,480
we will stay inside this stronghold
and put up our defence.

555
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,240
We have enough arrows, sand and
boulders to defend the city.

556
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,200
If Zongzheng Wu You attack us,

557
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,320
our soldiers in the front line...

558
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,160
will fight to their last breath...

559
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,920
to protect the city.

560
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,440
Five days.

561
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,200
We just need to hold it for five days.

562
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,040
I believe that he will retreat.

563
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,120
Arrival of Her Majesty.

564
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,240
Chou! You have already recovered.

565
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,800
Why are you still delaying your time
for the past few days?

566
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,640
Now, Zongzheng Wu You
is wobbly on his feet.

567
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,480
And his backup is not here yet.

568
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,840
As long as our troops
reach him first...

569
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
and attack him,
we can kill him easily.

570
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,960
I already told you.

571
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,640
I have my own plans...

572
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,880
regarding the military
and political affairs.

573
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,960
Moreover,

574
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,800
I didn't say that I won't attack them.

575
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm just waiting for the
best time to do so.

576
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,120
As for when is the best time to do it,

577
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,040
there's no need for you to know.

578
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
You just need to know one thing.

579
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,120
As long as Zongzheng Wu You
makes the first move,

580
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
he will lose for sure.

581
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Are you going to...

582
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,200
keep your plan a secret from me too?

583
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm not trying to keep it a secret.

584
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,760
I just don't want to lose again.

585
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,440
Zongzheng Wu You has
marched here out of rage.

586
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
It's rare that he'll be so rash.

587
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,800
When he has exhausted himself
and his soldiers are weak,

588
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
we can return fire...

589
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,280
and destroy them once and for all.

590
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,720
This is the best strategy
to defeat his.

591
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,840
Please don't meddle with my plan.

592
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,560
I feel that Zongzheng Wu You's
rashness out of rage...

593
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,440
is better than you being indecisive.

594
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,920
If you are still so indecisive,

595
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,560
I think I can only wait
in Senyan Palace...

596
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,760
until Zongzheng Wu You
comes and kills me face to face!

597
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,320
Your Highness,
now, what should we do?

598
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,200
I'll decide again after five days.

599
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,840
Yes, Your Highness.

600
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Tong Pass is a strategic location
with difficult access.

601
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,960
It's easy to defend and
hard to be attacked.

602
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,960
If we attack them first,
our chance in victory is slim.

603
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,280
And as soon as the battle starts,

604
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,480
we need at least half a month
to take it down.

605
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,120
The snow has cut off the road.

606
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,960
And it's difficult for Qingzhou
to supply food to us.

607
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,240
With the food supplies
that we have now,

608
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,800
it's enough for
five days only at most.

609
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,600
We have conserved our strength
for more than one year...

610
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,160
just to prepare for this battle
with Northern Realm.

611
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,240
Although it's risky to attack,

612
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,360
I'm not doing it all because
I'm swayed by my feelings.

613
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,440
Fu Chou has gone back to
Zhongshan because he is hurt.

614
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,280
It looks like their numbers are
increasing day by day in Tong Pass,

615
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,640
but actually,
it's just bluff and bluster.

616
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,520
From the news we gathered,

617
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
our enemy is in the
same situation as us.

618
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,560
Their supplies are cut off too.

619
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,960
If that's the case,
speed is paramount in war.

620
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,880
We attack them while
Fu Chou is not here...

621
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,040
and while they are still unprepared.

622
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,040
We might be able to take down
Tong Pass in five days' time.

623
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,400
We have conserved our strength
for quite a while.

624
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,120
If we press on without letup,
we might not lose.

625
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,520
Wu You, an army with grievance
is bound to prevail.

626
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,720
No matter it's public or personal,
as officials or as sons,

627
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
we have to battle them.

628
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,720
But this battle is too risky.

629
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,360
If we want to go into battle,
it's better for us to wait for backup.

630
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,400
Your Highness.
Secret letter from Her Highness.

631
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Wu You.

632
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,640
What did Man Yao say?

633
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,880
Please leave us first.

634
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,520
I need to discuss something
with Agent Wu.

635
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
Yes, Wu You.

636
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,800
Is Consort Rong Le against
this battle as well?

637
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,840
Just now, you had opposed to us
drawing the swords first.

638
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,560
Although I don't think that
we will lose for sure.

639
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,040
But you still oppose
to the idea, right?

640
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,520
Because I know that
although we might not lose,

641
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,440
our chance in victory is slim.

642
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Wu You.

643
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,960
You and Consort Rong Le
don't wish to drag...

644
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,680
the people of Qingzhou
into a long lasting war too.

645
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,200
But my heart is in constant turmoil,
tortured by regret and hatred.

646
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,280
For the past year, Wu Yu had
advised me again and again...

647
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,720
to wage war against Northern Realm
to take revenge on Fu Chou.

648
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,600
But I had stopped him every time.

649
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,000
But in my heart, I know that...

650
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
from the moment my mother's remain...

651
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,280
is destroyed, I can no longer
convince myself with those words...

652
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
that I used to convince him back then.

653
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,960
For your teacher's case back then,

654
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,160
when I luckily escaped...

655
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,600
while my whole family
was exterminated,

656
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,880
I too, wanted to kill off all of them
regardless of the cost.

657
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,080
But in the end,
I forced myself to stop.

658
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,120
If I had acted recklessly
and given away my life back then,

659
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,920
I wouldn't be standing here now.

660
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,600
And there will be no
The Hidden Ones today.

661
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,080
But brother,

662
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,120
-my father and mother...
-Wu You,

663
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,720
if they are looking down
from up there,

664
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,600
they'll hope that you can
put the people first.

665
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,160
You are a leader.

666
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,960
There are hundreds and
thousands of people behind you.

667
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,400
Consort Rong Le understand
the pain you feel as well.

668
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,120
But she still wrote a letter to
stop you from beginning this war.

669
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,280
That's because she
doesn't hope that...

670
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,240
you'll become the sinner that
put our people into dire suffering.

671
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,800
But, she is not trying to stop me
from going into war...

672
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,680
or endure sufferings
that others can't.

673
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,800
Instead, she wants me
to choose another path.

674
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,080
She wants me to do something
that others can't.

675
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,240
Here, Princess.

676
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,880
After Chun Ni watches
the night for you,

677
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I think you look so much better now.

678
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,560
Thanks to Chun Ni for
watching the night for me.

679
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,080
And thanks to you for taking care
of my leg wound every day.

680
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,840
-I'm much better now.
-These are just our duties.

681
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,520
Princess, it's late already.

682
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,040
You should rest now.
