00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:10,032
Episode 34

3
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:12,777
This is not about anyone.

4
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,505
Even without Wu You,

5
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:16,563
the outcome will still be the same.

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,735
Then I must fight for my fate!

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,300
The person who will be
with you to the end...

8
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,962
and die by your side...

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,100
is none other than me.

10
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,116
For this lifetime,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,140
this is where my fate with you ends.

12
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,296
Young Master, I am...

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,983
First, you disguised as her
and ruined my plan.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,740
I simply gave you some punishment.

15
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,333
And now you disguised as her
and seduced me.

16
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:31,384
I can't wait to kill you myself!

17
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,288
That is because I love you too much!

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,980
If I could make you
happy for a moment,

19
00:01:36,157 --> 00:01:38,167
I am willing to put on her face.

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,250
As long as you want it,
I can put on a mask for you...

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,968
and take on her look.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,833
Are you pitying me?

23
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,757
You pity me for not winning
her heart and make her mine?

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,237
So you put on her face and
show me your sympathy.

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,660
No, I just don't know any
other way I can love you!

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,340
If killing me can make you happy,
then so be it!

27
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,606
I would rather die by your blade...

28
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,469
than in the hands of the Creed.

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,296
If you like her look so much,

30
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,973
I will make your wish come true.

31
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,092
All of you want me
to complete that plan.

32
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:36,266
You will make it happen for me.

33
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:38,563
Young Master!

34
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:41,729
Not even I can see
through your disguise.

35
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,519
If we make some improvement,

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,866
I believe Zongzheng Wu You
will be fooled too.

37
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:50,051
Tell him the truth after it's done,

38
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,453
trust me,

39
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:54,438
he will feel so much guilt in him.

40
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,900
No!

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,460
Chang Jian.

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,161
Yes, General Fu.

43
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,955
Lock her inside the chamber.

44
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,487
Keep an eye on her.

45
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,867
-Yes.
-If anything goes wrong,

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,842
don't bother coming back to me.

47
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:20,018
-Yes.
-One more thing,

48
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,151
summon the commanders of
Royal Army and Armour Troops for me.

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,157
Yes.

50
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,797
I knew it.

51
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,253
As long as you wear
the face of that woman,

52
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,093
he couldn't bear to kill you.

53
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,816
Your mission is a great success.

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,419
After our grand plan succeeded,

55
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,682
I will let you leave this place.

56
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,990
The Crown Prince has been searching
for the Imperial Seal in worry.

57
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,696
He searched His Late Majesty's
Royal Study.

58
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,923
Then, he searched the Empress' room.

59
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,789
Today, he searched the
whole Royal Garden for it.

60
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,347
He even ordered his men
to look for it in the dried well.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,632
Xiang!

62
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,471
-Your Highness, you are drunk.
-Hen Xiang!

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,580
-Hen Xiang!
-Your Highness.

64
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,295
-You are drunk.
-I was so nice to you.

65
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,100
You ingrate!
You pointed a knife at me?

66
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,915
-Your Highness.
-Once I become the Emperor,

67
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,148
my first order is to have
you killed by Fu Chou!

68
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,767
He will sacrifice you
without any hesitation.

69
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,390
Because you are just the same as me.

70
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,505
We are all his pawns.

71
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,482
I am just a pawn!

72
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,939
Your Highness, General Fu is here.

73
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:20,851
I want him out of here!

74
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,115
It seems like His Highness is drunk.

75
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,793
Your Highness, you should
return to your room and rest.

76
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,207
Fu Chou!

77
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,456
Do you think threatening me...

78
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:34,611
will allow you to control me?

79
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,239
Think about it.

80
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,427
Without me,

81
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:43,749
you are just a traitor
with command over the army.

82
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,595
When Zongzheng Wu You is back,

83
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,206
no one will bow down to you.

84
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:51,989
Bring it here!

85
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,274
Do you even know...

86
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,238
what this is?

87
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,022
This is the supreme Imperial Seal.

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,794
Now that I have it, I can have
my coronation tomorrow.

89
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,158
What is the meaning of this?
This is treason!

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,540
Guards.

91
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,574
-Arrest this man.
-Yes.

92
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,582
What is the meaning of this?
This is treason!

93
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,011
Your father just passed away days ago.

94
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,420
Zongzheng Wu You has
the troops in the south.

95
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:47,279
You must be patient
for your coronation.

96
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,678
As for the Imperial Seal,

97
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,809
I will keep it for you.

98
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,029
Bring His Highness back.

99
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:01,516
Your treacherous scoundrel!

100
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,034
Let go of me!

101
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,657
This is treason!

102
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,022
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

103
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,724
You can all leave now.

104
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,812
I appreciate the help just now.

105
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Why are you talking to me
like I am stranger?

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,923
General Fu, did you ask me here
to the Royal Garden...

107
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,838
to talk about what happened
at your house?

108
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,940
You won't even keep this
fragrance pouch with you?

109
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,254
I know it was all too sudden.

110
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:42,916
But you must understand,

111
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:45,481
that was the only time
I could be so brave...

112
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,234
and pursue my own love.

113
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,589
You may have turned me down,

114
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,594
but I have no regret.

115
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
You need not be bothered
by this matter...

116
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,929
or be so cruel to me.

117
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,498
General Fu.

118
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,343
But...

119
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,030
This fragrance pouch...

120
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,570
has been with me all this time.

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,932
Actually,

122
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,504
I am not trying to give it back.

123
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,660
Do I really hold a place...

124
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,307
in your heart?

125
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,820
I will give it my all to fight
for what's rightfully mine.

126
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,271
Soon,

127
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,820
you will have an answer.

128
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,143
I shall always be there for you,
whether in life or in death.

129
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:41,286
Do I have the honour to
have a dinner with you tonight?

130
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,287
Everything is ready.

131
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:02,005
Fu Chou is waiting in the manor.

132
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,819
Our men had Chang Jian distracted.

133
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:06,304
No other people
can come near this house.

134
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,352
Very well.

135
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,340
Your Majesty, is the Princess
not in this room?

136
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,629
But the guards said she hasn't
stepped outside the whole day.

137
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,428
Leave the stuffs here.

138
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,026
You can go now.

139
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:52,248
If Rong Le refuses to see me,

140
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:55,130
then I shall be here
waiting for her...

141
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,527
until she is willing to come out.

142
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,080
Yes.

143
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,180
Your Majesty!

144
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:13,942
Your Majesty.

145
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,380
You haven't taken the medicine
in two months.

146
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,163
And you journeyed a long way
to come here.

147
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,149
-I am worried that...
-Silence.

148
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,545
I am all right.

149
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,839
You can leave now.

150
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,478
Yes.

151
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,580
So, this is the room you live in
after you got married.

152
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,363
For countless nights,

153
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,115
I would stand inside
your room back in Qi.

154
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,771
I would picture the place
you live in right now.

155
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,373
Whatever place it is,

156
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,566
while you are there,

157
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,300
it will be filled with
serenity and warmth.

158
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,500
Is this the table where you
do the writing and reading?

159
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,348
So that reminiscence does not linger,

160
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,186
so that sorrow never lasts.

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,211
Do you remember this poem?

162
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,427
I write it several times a day.

163
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,178
Is this where you have your meals?

164
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,006
I have Little Xun prepare an extra
pair of chopsticks every day.

165
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,972
All the cuisines are your favourite.

166
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,140
But I was always alone.

167
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,916
It feel so awful I can barely
swallow the food.

168
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,886
Do you watch the moon
from here every night?

169
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:28,291
I feel glad every time I see the moon.

170
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,087
Because even if we are miles apart,

171
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,940
we can still see the same moon.

172
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,540
I thought you refuse to see me.

173
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,970
Why do you come here
for this sudden visit?

174
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:52,173
What is your plan this time?
What do you want from me?

175
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,395
You finally agree to see me.

176
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,093
Rong Le.

177
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,241
How are you?

178
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:10,746
Don't come any closer.

179
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,820
I miss you a lot.

180
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,713
Get your hand away from me!

181
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,027
Get your hand away from me!

182
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:21,638
I miss you so much.

183
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,957
This time, I would rather die...

184
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,940
than being used by you.

185
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,440
Fear not.

186
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,940
I came to you today...

187
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,100
because I want to
make up for lost time...

188
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,576
and talk to you.

189
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,273
I miss the tea you brew.

190
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,140
Will you...

191
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,925
make some tea for me?

192
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,100
Did you really come all the way
to Northern Realm...

193
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,671
just to have some tea with me?

194
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,137
You didn't come here for the tea.

195
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,206
Why do you bother pretending?

196
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:10,564
It's a waste of time.

197
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,060
So, asking for the tea you make...

198
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,180
has become a luxurious thought.

199
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,484
I have had enough of your
evil plottings and plans.

200
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,140
I have no means to stop you.

201
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,267
I am sure you know.

202
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,730
Thanks to your medicine,

203
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,588
I have only months to live.

204
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,028
I don't want to be caught up
in your wicked conspiracy.

205
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:40,839
I want to live my life in peace.

206
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,700
I remember...

207
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,300
the desserts that you loved the most.

208
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,340
I made some desserts
specially for you.

209
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,980
Do you honestly think
I would eat the food you sent?

210
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,165
You don't need to.

211
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,790
But underneath these desserts...

212
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,486
are notes.

213
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:13,156
Each of the notes...

214
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,987
is written with a promise
I can give you.

215
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,449
If you really think these promises...

216
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:21,825
are not enough to let you
have these desserts,

217
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,291
then I shall leave you in peace.

218
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,844
Don't bother.

219
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,660
I don't need you to
make me any promises.

220
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,100
I just want you out of my sight.

221
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,004
You are unwell.

222
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,980
You should return to
Western Qi at once.

223
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,132
Won't you look at me just for once?

224
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,510
The first is the osmanthus jelly.

225
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,747
I remember...

226
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:08,294
you loved the scent
of osmanthus flowers.

227
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,260
I ground the osmanthus powder myself.

228
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,502
You shall meet
Zongzheng Wu You tomorrow.

229
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,740
Wu You will arrive here tomorrow?

230
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,885
But...

231
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:32,209
I am trapped inside this house.

232
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,960
How do I meet him?

233
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,470
The second dessert is
the greengage cake.

234
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,557
I made this with the greengage wine
I brewed myself.

235
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:48,204
You will leave the
General's manor safely.

236
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,633
But even if I meet Wu You,

237
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,900
I have only months to live.

238
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,419
He will be upset
if he knows about this.

239
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,660
I would rather hide myself from him.

240
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,660
The third dessert is
the maidenhair cake.

241
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,900
I plucked the leaves...

242
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,180
one by one with my own hands.

243
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,140
You can live without
sickness for one year.

244
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,734
Is this your promise for me...

245
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,960
or is this another one of your tricks?

246
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,540
If you are willing to have
the dessert with me...

247
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,562
and talk to me,

248
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,319
I can swear in the name of my throne
and my people...

249
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:03,383
that all three promises
will become a reality.

250
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,860
I am poisoned thanks to you.

251
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:14,457
How do I know there is
no poison in those desserts?

252
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,300
We'll each take half.

253
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,304
Will you trust me now?

254
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,203
Rong Le,

255
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,216
you must remember...

256
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,722
what I am about to tell you.

257
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,350
Other than life and death,

258
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,799
nothing else matters.

259
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:22,441
I just want you to live.

260
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,623
Nothing else matters to me.

261
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,853
As for the pain your could overcome,

262
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
when you look back at them
years from now,

263
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,053
you will find them insignificant.

264
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,194
Besides,

265
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:39,278
nothing is absolute in this world,
be it right or wrong,

266
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:40,767
good or evil.

267
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,132
It's just like the desserts here.

268
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:46,949
They each have a different taste.

269
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:50,019
Same goes for all that
happen in this world.

270
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,573
I remember you once blamed me...

271
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,790
for marrying you to
the Northern Realm.

272
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,314
But from what I see,

273
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:04,090
you may have gone through
all kinds of sufferings,

274
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,135
but you met Zongzheng Wu You.

275
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:09,351
Perhaps for you,

276
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,311
this is the greatest joy.

277
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:31,638
Rong Le.

278
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,489
Remember,

279
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,935
in order to acquire
the greatest happiness,

280
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,740
you must endure
the most dire hardship.

281
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:43,126
No matter what happens,

282
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,253
do not give up on living.

283
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,105
You must live on.

284
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,946
Do you understand?

285
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,238
Rong Le?

286
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
These desserts are poisoned.

287
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,517
Didn't you take it too?

288
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,530
Why?

289
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,566
Why?

290
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,259
They are not poisoned.

291
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:21,397
Sleep soundly for a while.

292
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,217
Rong Le.

293
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,086
I feel so happy tonight.

294
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,212
We had dessert together,

295
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,400
and we talked.

296
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,123
Please.

297
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,220
These are the cuisines from Qingzhou.

298
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,738
Yes.

299
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,237
I heard these are your favourite,
so I have the cook make these.

300
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,135
I wonder if you will like them.

301
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,450
I heard Prince Li will arrive
in Zhongshan soon.

302
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,536
I saw the quarrel you had with
the Crown Prince.

303
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:36,827
Your relationship with
Prince Li was even...

304
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:41,822
The Imperial Court is in a mess.

305
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,714
I am worried for you.

306
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:46,662
You need not be worried.
I am the General of Defence.

307
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,620
It doesn't matter
who sits on the throne.

308
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:52,616
My sole duty...

309
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,976
is to do what I can to protect
the people of Northern Realm.

310
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:58,860
Whatever you have in mind,

311
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:01,256
you will always have my support.

312
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,700
Right.

313
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,780
There will be great show
tomorrow at the Court.

314
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,984
Will you join me for the show?

315
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,584
Sure.

316
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:12,402
To your health, General.

317
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,797
Rong Le.

318
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,233
Please don't blame me for this.

319
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,460
I just want you to live on.

320
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,487
I am...

321
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,415
General, everything is set.

322
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,420
Zongzheng Wu You led the army
to the city gate.

323
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,780
Zongzheng Wu You is finally here.

324
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,539
No!

325
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:09,572
No!

326
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,858
Bring her there.

327
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,980
You treacherous prince!
You killed His Majesty!

328
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,820
You will pay for it!

329
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,866
Enough of your nonsense!
Silence!

330
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,928
-Take him out of here.
-Yes.

331
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,391
Fu Chou must have come prepared.

332
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,772
He is planning to
strike from the dark.

333
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,199
According to the tactical map
Man Yao gave us,

334
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:40,398
he has troops around the city gate
and the surrounding areas.

335
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,514
If the Royal Army is
under his command,

336
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,800
they won't let their guard down
and be defeated so easily.

337
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:48,900
Brother!

338
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:51,825
Brother!

339
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,526
Brother!

340
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,104
You are finally back!

341
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,780
Our father is...

342
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,792
Fu Chou framed you
for killing our father.

343
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,380
I have failed you.

344
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:16,537
Brother,

345
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:19,823
I want revenge.

346
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:23,281
Wu Yu, this is not your fault.

347
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:26,120
I know it's hard for you
to fight alone in the capital.

348
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,717
But this is not the time for grieving.

349
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,195
Fu Chou has control
over the royal palace.

350
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:32,857
We need to be cautious.

351
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,531
He must not get away with this.

352
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,550
This is the only way
we can avenge our father.

353
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,864
You must promise me,

354
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,180
if anything goes wrong for me today,

355
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,268
you must keep the soldiers
and the people safe.

356
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,020
Keep our main force safe.

357
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,524
Brother, I will follow your orders.

358
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:55,186
Wu Yu.

359
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,548
I thought Fu Chou had you
under house arrest.

360
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,840
Why would he let you
walk around freely?

361
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,739
Brother, I was being locked up.

362
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,666
But all the guards that watch me
was redeployed this morning.

363
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:11,463
He timed this so precisely
and know about my return.

364
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,711
It looks like he come prepared.

365
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,790
Your Highness, Princess Rong Le
is not inside the manor.

366
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:23,587
Xiao Sha.

367
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,366
Do you know where she is?

368
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,631
She was in the manor before I left.

369
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:31,835
Brother, could it be that she is
hidden inside a secret chamber?

370
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:36,181
Xiang Ying, you know
the manor very well.

371
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:38,976
Go to the manor and find
Man Yao at all cost.

372
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:40,670
Yes!

373
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,064
Your Highness, the Princess
wants me to give you this letter.

374
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,637
<i>Wu You,</i>

375
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:58,325
<i>if you have to choose between
me and the greater good,</i>

376
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,574
<i>do not hesitate because of me.</i>

377
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,662
<i>After the parting with each
other in this lifetime,</i>

378
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,291
<i>we will meet again in our next life.</i>

379
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,236
<i>After all of this is over,</i>

380
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:12,387
<i>and if I have the chance
to meet you again,</i>

381
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,881
<i>I will explain why I turned you down.</i>

382
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,540
<i>If we never meet again,</i>

383
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,580
<i>maybe we will in our next lives.</i>

384
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,805
Your Highness, we have
enemies from all corners.

385
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,340
Wei is waiting for strike us down,

386
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,130
there are traitors waiting
to launch a mutiny.

387
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,001
The nation needs its leader.

388
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,110
Please hold the coronation
as soon as possible.

389
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:01,946
Lead the officers and bring peace
to the Imperial Court.

390
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,963
My father was killed
by my treacherous brother.

391
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:09,677
I am in great pain for my loss.

392
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:13,714
You are right,
the nation needs its leader.

393
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,780
I think the matter
with my coronation...

394
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,205
needs to be done with
haste and without grandeur.

395
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,378
But...

396
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,460
But...

397
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,420
-Prince Li.
-Prince Li?

398
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,460
Our father just passed away.

399
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:50,012
Yet you couldn't wait
to get on the throne.

400
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,666
Guards!

401
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,700
Get this traitor arrested!

402
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:56,235
Have him executed!

403
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,815
Where is Captain Zhao
and his 3,000 men?

404
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,930
Where is General Fu's Armour Troops?

405
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,460
The Royal Army is under my command.

406
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,700
As for Fu Chou's whereabouts,

407
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,783
I was hoping you can tell me.

408
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,608
You traitor!

409
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,207
You killed our father
and obstructed the campaign,

410
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,192
and now you are leading
the troops to charge in here!

411
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:25,787
How dare you make demands while
standing there bold like a brass!

412
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,388
Prince Li.

413
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:31,109
Do you think forcing my hand
will cover your crime...

414
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,518
and get you the throne?

415
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,414
Do you think of me and
the other officers as fools?

416
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,660
Do you really think I would
stay in silence...

417
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:42,501
and be shunned while you accuse me
for what I never did?

418
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,800
I am a traitor?

419
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:46,865
Other than what Fu Chou told you,

420
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:48,981
what witness and
evidence do you have...

421
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:51,275
to prove that I killed our father?

422
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,817
But I have all the soldiers
of the south...

423
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:56,892
to be witness...

424
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,428
that I never left the camp
of the southern border.

425
00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:01,524
But you,

426
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,294
as the Crown Prince,

427
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,860
you didn't investigate
to catch the real killer...

428
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,708
and avenge our father,

429
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,883
you are worried about your coronation.

430
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:12,859
You are just an ingrate.

431
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,138
You...

432
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,580
You said I am an ingrate?

433
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:20,378
While our father was still alive,

434
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,340
I never disrespected him
even when he lectured me.

435
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:26,551
What about you?
You are Prince Li.

436
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,026
In the whole Northern Realm,

437
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,017
you are the only man who can
make him mad and fall ill.

438
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,316
It was you that had a fallout
with him before the campaign.

439
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,010
And now you are leading
your troops to force my hand.

440
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,986
You would have brought them
to the camp the other day!

441
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,405
Even if you failed to assassinate him,

442
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:47,875
you would have driven him to death!

443
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,369
Everything points towards you.

444
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,240
Why would I need any evidence?

445
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,772
If you accuse me of killing him,

446
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,703
I bet no one would believe you.

447
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:01,454
I may have argued with
our father on some matters.

448
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:04,110
But it was all for the sake
of the people.

449
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:05,840
I didn't do so for personal gain.

450
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,156
Crisis rises from all corners.

451
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:13,128
Wei and Western Qi...

452
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,581
are waiting for a chance
to invade our land.

453
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:17,789
Just outside Zhongshan,

454
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,945
hundreds of fugitive have
lost their home and are starving.

455
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,193
If anyone tries to sway their minds,

456
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,093
it will cause an uprising.

457
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:28,078
Tell me, Crown Prince,

458
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:31,248
did you send an ambassador
to persuade the Emperor of Qi?

459
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,889
Did you think about deploying
troops to the guard the border?

460
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:40,058
Did you think about
how to help those fugitives?

461
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,026
If you do nothing,

462
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,090
you have no right to rule.

463
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:50,345
You are incapable of
bring peace to the people.

464
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,919
Because I am the Crown Prince
His Majesty chose!

465
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,710
You are just a prince.

466
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:58,508
Whether you can keep
the title or not...

467
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,390
depends on how I feel about you
after the coronation.

468
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:08,532
Your Highness, the coronation
is a pressing matter.

469
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:10,309
No matter how simple it can be,

470
00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:12,627
two items are necessary.

471
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,912
First of all, the will
of the late Emperor.

472
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,928
The second item is the Imperial Seal.

473
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:20,814
Does Your Highness possess...

474
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,100
The Imperial Seal?

475
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,413
Read my father's will aloud.

476
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:46,717
I have reigned for 26 years.

477
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:49,436
The nation is at peace and
the people live in harmony.

478
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:53,239
The Crown Prince is
an honourable man like myself.

479
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:57,393
-Keep it going.
-I will pass the throne to him.

480
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,490
I hope the other princes
will assist him...

481
00:35:59,663 --> 00:36:01,191
in leading this nation.

482
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,740
-It's an fake!
-How is that a fake?

483
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,054
What is going on?

484
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,048
But...

485
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:22,896
This is...

486
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:24,860
This can't be a fake.

487
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,192
Before our father set out,

488
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,245
he passed this to me personally.

489
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:33,966
It's you!

490
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:36,111
You swapped the Imperial Seal!

491
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,828
Give me back the seal!
Give it to me!

492
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:42,011
-Give me the Imperial Sea!
-Stop pretending!

493
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,386
Gentlemen,

494
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,362
you are all the pillars
of the Northern Realm.

495
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,592
You gave it your all
to serve this nation.

496
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,139
My father placed his trust in you.

497
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:55,547
I am standing right here...

498
00:36:55,744 --> 00:36:57,430
not because I want the throne.

499
00:36:57,846 --> 00:37:01,229
If my father passed on the duty
of a ruler to the Crown Prince...

500
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:03,733
and he is capable and benevolent,

501
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,770
I will do my best to assist him.

502
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,483
But the crisis and the
Crown Prince's actions...

503
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,675
are something we witness together.

504
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,035
What do you think must be done?

505
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,052
Your Highness, I think we must
reconsider everything carefully.

506
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,533
I hope Prince Li will lead us
to resolve the situation.

507
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,913
Please lead us to
resolve the situation.

508
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,046
Please lead us to resolve the crisis.

509
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,340
Your Highness!

510
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,376
Your Highness, General Fu
is waiting for you outside.

511
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:52,283
General Fu, what took you so long?

512
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:53,817
Crown Prince!

513
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,358
To prevent the mutiny
from General Fu and casualty,

514
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:01,348
I want everyone to stay in here.

515
00:38:01,622 --> 00:38:03,161
Prince Chen and I have a plan.

516
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,443
We will deal with him and
his scheme will never succeed!

517
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,065
Prince Li, you sure took your time.

518
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:59,275
I have been waiting here
for quite a while.

519
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,853
You are always a righteous person.

520
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,317
Where are all your manners today?

521
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,271
I lost my manner?

522
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:13,983
Why are you allowed to be
carried in here on your bed...

523
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,504
and I can't even have some booze
outside the hall?

524
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,501
I wonder if you recognize...

525
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,740
the soldiers of southern
border behind me.

526
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,320
They all lost their
homes and families...

527
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:37,063
thanks to your doing.

528
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,876
You alienated the nobles in
the south and caused uprisings...

529
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,090
just so you can claim
the glory from the skirmishes...

530
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:46,444
and help you secure a place
in the Imperial Court.

531
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,093
The skirmishes were
clearly your doing.

532
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,618
Prince Li, you are planning
to commit treason.

533
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,371
Why are you accusing me...

534
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,311
of the crime you've done?

535
00:40:58,785 --> 00:40:59,942
Prince Li.

536
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,151
I came all the way...

537
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:05,076
from an insignificant sergeant...

538
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,523
to become the General of Defence
I am today.

539
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:11,213
I spent years slaying the enemies...

540
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,111
and fought countless uphill battles.

541
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,566
You cannot deny my achievements
by mere accusations.

542
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:19,300
You expand your troops
without permission.

543
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,864
With your troops here,

544
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,964
your ambition of seizing the throne
is clear to all of us.

545
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:27,456
How are you going to face
the loyal soldiers that follow you...

546
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,820
and the people that
trust and respect you?

547
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:31,876
General Fu,

548
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,144
don't you have a conscience?
