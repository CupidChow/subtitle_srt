Episode 25

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,580
I'll confer you the title as
Princess Zhao Yun immediately.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,580
And you'll be married off
to Chen in two days' time.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,660
Please forgive Prince Chen.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,260
Me and Prince Chen are young,
foolish and reckless.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,140
We almost cause a disaster.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,220
I'll take on all the blame.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,580
I hope that you'll allow me...

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,900
to marry to a faraway country
without any worries.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,940
This time, Prince Chen...

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,740
has defied the law...

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,460
of the worst offence.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,540
He should be punished as a warning.

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,740
But since he's already hurt,

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,180
I'll punish him as I see fit.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,340
He will be caned 50 times and
will be jailed in the Supreme Court.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,860
After you left the border of
Northern Realm safely,

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,980
I'll release him and I won't
pursue this matter anymore.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,700
I still have a presumptuous request.

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,500
If you need anything,
please call for me.

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,540
Zhao Yun, you are here.

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm fine.

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,740
My legs are just very stiff
because I sat too long.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,980
No need to care about me.
Go and find Wu You.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,060
Ask him to bring you out from here
and wait for me outside.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,460
Come. Let's take a seat first.

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,740
Be careful.

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,700
I'm fine, Zhao Yun.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,940
Wu Yu.

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
This time, I won't
wait for you anymore.

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,380
And no need to come
and find me anymore.

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,420
Because from now on, the husband
that I'll give myself to...

35
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,300
is Prince Zhen Bei from Chen.

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
I'll grow old and Gray with him.

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,980
I know.

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,700
Father and the others must have
forced you to do it, right?

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,020
One day soon,
I'll kill that Prince Zhen Bei.

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,820
Nobody forces me to do it.

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,500
I did it willingly.

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,780
Impossible.

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,860
I don't believe you. We were doing
so well together before this.

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,140
Zhao Yun.

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,340
We promised each other that
we'll travel the world together.

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,740
Why?

47
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,060
Why did it turn out like this?

48
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,140
Because I can rely on
Prince Zhen Bei.

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,540
Since young, I've lost my parents.

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,860
I have only you and Brother Wu You.

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,700
But both of you can do nothing
when I'm chosen as the alliance bride.

52
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,500
You said you want to
travel the world with me.

53
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,700
But the reality is, you were hurt
and you collapsed in front of me.

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,140
You can't protect me.

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,580
If I'm with you,

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,780
I'll always be in a state of anxiety.

57
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,740
Zhao Yun.

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,420
So all along, in your heart,

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,140
I'm...

60
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,660
such a weak and useless person.

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,980
It's up to you to believe it or not.

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,220
But these are my real thoughts.

63
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,140
Rather than giving myself to you
who have no achievement,

64
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,260
it's better if I give myself
to the future emperor of Chen.

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,060
When that day comes,

66
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,780
I'll be the empress of Chen.

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,980
I'll have ultimate power...

68
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,340
and I won't be bullied
or looked down by others again.

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,180
He is the future emperor.

70
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,020
But can he sacrifice
everything for you?

71
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,580
Prince Chen.

72
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,540
Take care.

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,580
Zhao Yun.

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,780
<i>Wu Yu.</i>

75
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,660
<i>As long as you live,</i>

76
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,340
<i>you'll be able to find
a lady in the future...</i>

77
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,820
<i>that can sooth the hurt that
I've brought upon you.</i>

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,420
<i>Both of you will
hold your child's hand...</i>

79
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,380
<i>and live together until
you are old and Gray.</i>

80
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,900
<i>You can see the world without...</i>

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,180
<i>-needing to lead a vagabond life.</i>
-Zhao Yun!

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,820
Zhao Yun!

83
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,220
<i>Wu Yu.</i>

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,540
<i>Leaving you...</i>

85
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,180
<i>is the bravest thing that
I've done in my entire life.</i>

86
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,740
<i>From now on, we will be world apart.</i>

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,260
<i>I hope that you won't miss me...</i>

88
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,100
<i>or yearn for me in the future.</i>

89
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,580
Lady Rong Le has been staying put
in the Tranquil Garden.

90
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,820
Just like you've asked,
we've rejected all requests...

91
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,260
from those who want to meet her.

92
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,540
You may leave now.

93
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,860
Yes, General.

94
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,900
General Fu.

95
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,380
Crown prince has sent words that
he wants to meet you immediately.

96
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
Prepare my horse.
I'll go to Eastern Palace now.

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,260
General Fu, crown prince has
asked you to go to House of Fragrance.

98
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
Master.

99
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,340
Come.

100
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,380
Let me kiss you.

101
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,340
-Here.
-Come over here.

102
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,300
Come over here.

103
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,180
-Come. We are here.
-Where are you?

104
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,060
I can't catch anyone.

105
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,300
I'm here. Come here now, quickly.

106
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,380
I'm going to catch you now.

107
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,460
Who is it?

108
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
How dare you make me fall down!

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,460
You want to be kicked out from here?

110
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,460
I didn't get to announce
my presence in time.

111
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,220
Please pardon me for
my lack of manners.

112
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,260
It's you, General Fu.

113
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,140
You lack manners in too many things.

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,260
Let me tell you.

115
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,900
He might look sanctimonious
all of the time,

116
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,740
but he's just a hypocrite!

117
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,460
A wolf in sheep's skin!

118
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,460
Fu Chou.

119
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
How dare you played me.

120
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,060
Who am I?

121
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,860
I'm the crown prince.

122
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,860
The son of the emperor.

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,660
What about you?

124
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,460
You are nothing!

125
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,900
I still have work to do. Farewell.

126
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,660
You! Stop right there!

127
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,060
What are you laughing at?

128
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,820
Do you want to die?

129
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,580
Let me ask someone to send you
back to the Eastern Palace.

130
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,140
Enough.

131
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,580
No need to pretend anymore.

132
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,900
After what you did to me that day,

133
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,140
we are no longer in good terms.

134
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,740
I admit that...

135
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,900
I was too rude to you on that day.

136
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,420
But I have no other choice.

137
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,580
Crown Prince.

138
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,700
That day, you had backed me
into a corner.

139
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,020
That's why I had
lost control of myself.

140
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,140
I hope that you can
forgive me for rudeness.

141
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,420
Please forgive me for the words
that I had uttered in a fit of rage.

142
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,580
You have to see the
bigger picture here.

143
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,740
I had indeed...

144
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,260
things too difficult for you that day,
General Fu.

145
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,460
But I had done it for your own good.

146
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,940
I want you to see clearly how
fickle and lascivious your wife is.

147
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,380
I've took great pains
to do that for you.

148
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,900
Thank you, Crown Prince.

149
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,020
Enough.

150
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,140
Of course you need to thank me.

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,340
But I need something practical.

152
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,660
I heard that Zhao Yun
has been conferred...

153
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
the title as princess
for the alliance.

154
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,740
She's going to be married
to a faraway place soon.

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,180
She's under Zongzheng Wu You.

156
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,900
I've already devised a plan that
can kill two birds with one stone.

157
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,860
The marriage alliance
of Princess Zhao Yun...

158
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,940
is under Zongzheng Wu You's
responsibility.

159
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,860
And His Majesty
has already decreed that...

160
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,260
tonight, he will be responsible for...

161
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,100
Princess Zhao Yun's safety at the inn.

162
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,500
General Fu.

163
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,540
Lady Rong Le has ordered us
to prepare a carriage for her.

164
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,860
She wants to go to the inn
with Miss Sun...

165
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,460
to pay Princess Zhao Yun a visit.

166
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,860
I'm worried that if she goes there,

167
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,780
she might affect our plan for tonight.

168
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,820
Make sure that everything
goes according to plan.

169
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,860
Nothing can go wrong.

170
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,540
Yes, General Fu.

171
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
General Fu.

172
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,620
Sorry for disturbing you
at your manor.

173
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,580
It's rare for you to come here.

174
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,060
No need to be so polite.
Come, have a seat.

175
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
General Fu.

176
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,620
Zhao Yun will be married off
the Chen tomorrow.

177
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,380
Me and Miss Sun wish to
pay her a visit at the inn.

178
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,100
After she left,

179
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,620
I'm not sure if I'll
ever see her again.

180
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,180
I hope that you can understand.

181
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,340
You treat Zhao Yun like a sister.

182
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,540
It's only right for you to give
your sister who is...

183
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,420
going to be married
to Chen a farewell.

184
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,020
Why would I stop you?

185
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,700
I won't let you interfere with
this before because I know that...

186
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
you won't be able to turn the table.

187
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,180
It'll be pointless even if
you try to stop it.

188
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,900
Now, everything is already
on their due courses.

189
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,580
You should go and
give her some advice.

190
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,660
After all, both of you are
princess for alliance.

191
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,380
I think both of you can
understand each other well.

192
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,660
I'll go and get ready then.

193
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,460
Please excuse me.

194
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,380
Miss Sun, I've lost my composure...

195
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,300
in Linglong Palace that day.
I've embarrassed myself.

196
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
You think too much.

197
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,140
I understand the difficult position
you were in at that time.

198
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,980
I still have some work to do.

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,500
Please feel free at home. Goodbye.

200
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,540
Tonight, no matter what, we have
to guard Princess Zhao Yun's safety.

201
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,380
Make sure that nobody comes in.

202
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,620
Yes, Your Highness.

203
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,180
Do you like me?

204
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,300
I like you too.

205
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,900
After my father is done with
the marriage alliance affair,

206
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm going to tell him
about our marriage.

207
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,780
Who says I'm marrying you?

208
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,020
You haven't even proposed to me.

209
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm already hooked on you.
You can't get rid of me.

210
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,180
From now on, there will be...

211
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,020
no prince and princess,

212
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,620
no wealth and status...

213
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,420
and no duties for the country.

214
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,740
In our world,
there will be only me and you.

215
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,180
Zhao Yun.

216
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,220
Brother Wu You.

217
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,140
From tomorrow onwards,

218
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,340
I won't be by your side.

219
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,740
You have to take
good care of yourself.

220
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,660
Brother Wu You.

221
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,060
Don't worry. I'm all grown up now.

222
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,940
I'm no longer that little girl...

223
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,300
who always trod behind you.

224
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,580
From tomorrow onwards,

225
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,140
I'll try my best to be a
qualified alliance princess.

226
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,460
How I hope that...

227
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,500
you can be my sister forever.

228
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,140
I hope that you can always be...

229
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,620
a wilful, cute and
cheerful little girl.

230
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,500
I hope that whenever I turn my back,

231
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,900
I can see you running towards me...

232
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,100
while calling me Brother Wu You.

233
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,900
Brother Wu You.

234
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,220
Don't worry.

235
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,020
Zhao Yun.

236
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,660
You and Wu Yu...

237
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,460
are my family who
I care about most in this world.

238
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,860
I couldn't get both of you to be
together although I've tried my best.

239
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,180
Do you blame me?

240
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,380
Not only I don't blame you,

241
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,380
I feel very touched
whenever I saw you...

242
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,180
doing your best to help me.

243
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,060
To be able to have a great brother
like you in this lifetime,

244
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,460
I can live without any regrets.

245
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,860
How nice would it be
if you can never grow up.

246
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,940
Brother Wu You.

247
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,740
I need you to help me with something.

248
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,740
You want me to advice Wu Yu, right?

249
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,460
But you have to wait...

250
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,220
until he has found his beloved one...

251
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,620
to tell him this.

252
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,660
In my heart,

253
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,220
he has always been
the bravest man that I know.

254
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,300
When I was with him,

255
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,380
I had never once felt lonely.

256
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,180
Alright. I promise you.

257
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,780
I'll tell him that.

258
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,340
Wu Yu has asked me
to give this to you.

259
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,100
When he gave you this ring before,

260
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
he hoped that it can
bring you peace...

261
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,300
and luck for your whole life.

262
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,500
Now, he gives it to you again...

263
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,020
to wish you a life of happiness.

264
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,420
This way please.

265
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,500
Zhao Yun. I'm sorry that...

266
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,220
I've only come to see you now.

267
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,660
Princess Rong Le, I'm very happy...

268
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,340
you are here to see me today.

269
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,060
Miss Sun, are you alright?

270
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm fine.

271
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,660
It's better if you go inside
the room to rest.

272
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Come.

273
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,500
Guards.

274
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,820
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Get me a physician.

275
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,220
Yes, Your Highness.

276
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,500
Thank you, Prince Li.

277
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,940
You are welcome.

278
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,300
I still need to take care of
Princess Zhao Yun's safety.

279
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,780
I'll have to take my leave now.

280
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,260
<i>When can...</i>

281
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,940
<i>General Fu care for me like this?</i>

282
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,140
<i>I would be satisfied even if...</i>

283
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,020
<i>it's just a care from
a stranger to another.</i>

284
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,260
Zhao Yun.

285
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,660
I can't help you this time.

287
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,260
Princess Rong Le, no need to
blame yourself or feel sorry for me.

288
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,820
This time, I'm doing it willingly.

289
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,380
-You and Wu Yu...
-Before this,

290
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,420
I don't understand
you and Brother Wu You.

291
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Why can't you be together
even though you love each other?

292
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,460
Until now only did I understand.

293
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,140
Brother Wu You loves you deeply.

294
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,900
But he can only guard and
protect you from afar.

295
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,860
This kind of love...

296
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,820
is even more precious than him
forcing you to be with him.

297
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,180
Zhao Yun.

298
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,380
I'm having a peaceful life right now.

299
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,980
But are you happy?

300
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,660
Princess Rong Le.

301
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,900
Although General Fu
is very kind to you,

302
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,140
you don't like him.

303
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,780
So, how can you be happy?

304
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,420
It's already impossible
between me and Wu Yu.

305
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,980
I once loved him.

306
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,980
But now...

307
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,580
Princess Rong Le.

308
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,700
Although I hope that you can be
together with Brother Wu You,

309
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,140
now I know that...

310
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,060
the fate of marriage cannot be forced.

311
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,100
I don't hope that there is
any misunderstanding...

312
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,980
between you and Brother Wu You.

313
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,900
Although you can't be lovers
or husband and wife,

314
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,860
you can still be friends.

315
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,060
Zhao Yun.

316
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,620
What happened between me and Wu You...

317
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,580
is not as simple as
just a misunderstanding.

318
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,140
Princess Rong Le.

319
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,340
Although I don't know what
happened between both of you,

320
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,940
I'm sure that...

321
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,380
Brother Wu You loves you truly.

322
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,380
Princess Rong Le.

323
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,860
You only see the Brother Wu You now.

324
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,380
But you've never seen the past him.

325
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,620
The past him?

326
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
When he was young,

327
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,020
he was a very forthright
and hearty person.

328
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,140
He was even more playful
and cheerful than Wu Yu.

329
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,060
When he was seven,

330
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
after Lady Yun's sudden death,

331
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,820
he locked himself in Yun's Tomb
and refused to eat or drink.

332
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,020
He almost lost his life.

333
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,460
From then on, he changed drastically.

334
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,740
He was so cold towards everything.

335
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>So, Wu You was once
a young and carefree boy.</i>

336
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,500
<i>I never thought that
his mother's passing...</i>

337
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,180
<i>is something so traumatic to him.</i>

338
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,340
Who is it?

339
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,940
Miss, I'm the physician they called.

340
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
Come in.

341
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,180
This way please.

342
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,460
Miss, have a seat.

343
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,780
Princess Rong Le.

344
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,300
For you, Brother Wu You had caused
such a ruckus in your wedding.

345
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,340
And he said something
so hurtful to you.

346
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,380
And for you,

347
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,140
he had left Zhongshan and stayed in
Qingzhou for more than half a year.

348
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,660
He had never stayed away
from his mother for so long.

349
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,380
All of these are proofs
that he loves you truly.

350
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,020
But his heart is encased
in ice for too long.

351
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,580
He doesn't know how to
show his love anymore.

352
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,700
Thank you, Zhao Yun.

353
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,300
No matter how will me
and Wu You end up like,

354
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,140
I'm very thankful for...

355
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,020
what you told me today.

356
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,580
You've grown up.

357
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,100
You know more about love than me.

358
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,300
There's no chance for me and
Wu Yu anymore in this life.

359
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,420
But there might still be a chance...

360
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,460
for you and Brother Wu You.

361
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,260
Promise me that...

362
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,820
if there's a chance,
no matter how slim,

363
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,900
you'll hold it tightly
with your two hands.

364
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,180
Because in this world,

365
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,860
you are the only one who can
bring happiness...

366
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,700
to Brother Wu You.

367
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,620
Princess Rong Le.
I think you are exhausted.

368
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,900
How about you go back
to your room and rest first?

369
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
I'll check on Ya Li then.

370
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,060
Princess Rong Le, didn't you...

371
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,740
Is your leg feeling better?

372
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,780
I'm fine now.

373
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,700
Zhao Yun!

374
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,300
Wu You, save me.

375
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,300
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

376
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,420
Princess Rong Le.

377
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,340
Leng Yan! She is not Man Yao.
Chase after her!

378
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,220
-Yes, Your Highness!
-Guards!

379
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,820
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Tonight, keep your eyes wide open.

380
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,060
We can't let Princess Zhao Yun
face any danger again.

381
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,340
-Yes, Your Highness!
-Go there! The rest, follow me!

382
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,740
Roger that!

383
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,220
Zhao Yun.

384
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,980
Zhao Yun, wake up.

385
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,660
Zhao Yun.

386
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,140
Who are you?

387
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Princess Rong Le won't hurt me.
Who are you?

388
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
You can't even recognise me?

389
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,460
Lady Rong Le saved you just now.

390
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,940
Princess Rong Le.

391
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,420
You saved me just now.

392
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,980
Just now, that person...

393
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,460
looks exactly like you.

394
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,180
Don't worry.

395
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,220
She ran away.

396
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,620
Prince Li has sent someone
to chase after her.

397
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,500
I'll stay by your side.

398
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,140
Princess Zhao Yun, don't be afraid.

399
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,660
We are here.

400
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,940
Zhao Yun.

401
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,100
Are you alright, Zhao Yun?

402
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,860
Brother Wu You.

403
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm fine.

404
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,820
Just now, Princess Rong Le
has fought with that assassin.

405
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,060
I wonder if she's hurt.

406
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,060
Alright, I get it. Don't worry.

407
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,900
Have a good rest.
I'll stand guard outside.

408
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,820
Princess Rong Le
has seen the assassin.

409
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,380
She has something to tell you.

410
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,820
Lady Rong Le has fought
with the assassin.

411
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,860
She can indeed help you to find out
about the assassin's identity.

412
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,180
Don't worry, Lady Rong Le.
I'll take care of Princess Zhao Yun.

413
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,460
If that's the case,
please follow me outside...

414
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,860
and tell me everything in details.

415
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,660
-You...
-You...

416
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,460
You first.

417
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,860
That person is a master of disguise.

418
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,860
She had disguised herself as me...

419
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,260
and tricked Zhao Yun.

420
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,620
I think she is from the
Creed of Vengeance.

421
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,580
Zhao Yun is going to get married soon.

422
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,580
I hate to part with her.

423
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,500
She's growing up.

424
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,900
And she's more mature now.

425
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,700
Sometimes, I think that
she has a clearer picture on things...

426
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,500
more than me.

427
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,980
What about you?

428
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,700
How are you?

429
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,980
I never thought that...

430
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,340
someone will disguise as you
to frame you up.

431
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,660
I can't help but to feel that...

432
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,020
ever since I came back to the city,

433
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,100
danger lurks on your every side and
there are so many hidden dangers.

434
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,620
It's almost like one mistake and
you'll fall into a bottomless abyss.

435
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,060
Perhaps...

436
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,220
I shouldn't have left you alone
in the city back then.

437
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,100
I didn't protect you well enough.

438
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,900
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

439
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,660
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

440
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,740
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

441
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,220
<i>to melt it.</i>

442
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Actually, when I was in Qingzhou
for a year and a half,

443
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,420
I've faced a lot of things.

444
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,900
I went to Qingzhou to forget about...

445
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,420
the past grievance in the capital.

446
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,500
But I also went there because
of my father's secret decree.

447
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,700
He purposely sent me to Qingzhou...

448
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,500
because he wants me
to investigate the cause...

449
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,420
of the frequent revolts that happened
in the southern fringe recently.

450
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,220
When putting down the rebellion,
not only I have to face death...

451
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,940
in the blood-washed battlefield,

452
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,060
I have to defend myself against
both open and covert attacks.

453
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,220
I already found out that...

454
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,260
the scholars in southern fringe
has colluded with the rebel forces.

455
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,380
They robbed the people of
their lands and exploited them.

456
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,300
You might be suspicious that...

457
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,860
why did I share with you
this kind of secrets.

458
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,220
I just hope that...

459
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,740
I'll keep no secret from you.

460
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,820
From now on,

461
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,980
I'll not keep anything
about me from you.

462
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,740
I won't force you.

463
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,780
As long as you are living well,

464
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,820
I'll accept the fact that you've
became General Fu's wife.

465
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,460
I just hope that
I can protect you well.

466
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,060
Prince Li.

467
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,820
I heard that Zhao Yun is hurt
by an assassin. How is she?

468
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,100
Don't worry.

469
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,300
Zhao Yun is fine.

470
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,220
That's good then.

471
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,940
I want to check on her.

472
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,540
Even if it's just a glance.

473
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,420
That day in Yun's Tomb,
you told me that...

474
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,260
you are sincere towards Zhao Yun.

475
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,180
I believe that you are a gentleman.

476
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,820
Please abide by the customs...

477
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,820
and check on her from outside
the door for just a glance.

478
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,820
Alright.

479
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,900
Over there!

480
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,820
Who asked you to disguise as her?

481
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,540
This is not the first time I did it.

482
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,380
What is it? You can't even
face her right now?

483
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,100
Do you know that...

484
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,740
your action...

485
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,380
will ruin our whole plan?

486
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,060
It's not the first time she sees you.

487
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,700
-She'll know that it's you.
-So what if she does?

488
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,980
She just knows that I'm a stand-in
hired by the emperor of Qi.

489
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,980
Even if she suspects you,
she has no proof about it.

490
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,660
But you are so nervous about it.

491
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,340
Are you afraid that she'll
find out about the real you?

492
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,060
Hen Xiang, let me warn you.

493
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,420
Don't drag her into this.

494
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,220
And don't challenge my limit.

495
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,180
Moreover, don't ruin the whole plan...

496
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,060
because of your selfishness.

497
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,780
Remember that.

498
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,900
You can't fall in love with her.

499
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,460
It's none of your business!

500
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,340
Now that you've made
an unnecessary move,

501
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,260
they'll be more alert now.

502
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,620
It'll be hard for us to find
a chance to attack again.

503
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,260
You should just stick
to your own task.

504
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,340
Go back to the crown prince
and keep a close eye on him.

505
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,820
Make sure that he doesn't
bring me trouble again.

506
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,300
I can't take it anymore.

507
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,060
I don't want to stay at his side.

508
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,340
You've given me to him
because of your plan.

509
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,100
But have you ever thought
about my feelings...

510
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,340
and about my situation?

511
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,140
I know.

512
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,860
Although...

513
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,380
I know that it must
be difficult for you,

514
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,380
everything that we do now...

515
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,300
must be for the benefit of the whole.

516
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,140
My entire plan is already
fanned out in my brain.

517
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,820
Don't worry.

518
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,820
After everything is done,

519
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,740
I'll get you out from there.
Trust me.

520
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,980
Although you are my best
right-hand man,

521
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,020
you've failed your mission today
because of you selfishness.

522
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,940
You have to be punished.

523
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,140
Take her away.

524
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,900
It's not up to you to
question my thinking.

525
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,140
Hen Xiang, let me warn you.

526
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,740
Don't drag her into this.

527
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,860
And don't challenge my limit.

528
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,180
Rong Le.

529
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,980
I won't let you off
the hook so easily.

530
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,380
General Fu.

531
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
-What is it?
-His Majesty has ordered you to be...

532
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,380
in charge of the transport to send
Princess Zhao Yun to Chen tomorrow.

533
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,940
I told Eunuch Chen that you've
gone to the inn with your wife...

534
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,380
and managed to deceive him.

535
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,260
But you have no chance
but to accept the decree.

536
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,340
Looks like Zongzheng Wu You
has known that...

537
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,420
tonight's assassination in the inn
is connected to me.

538
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,700
That's why he hands over the task
of protecting the princess to me.

539
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,420
He puts me in a difficult situation...

540
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,660
so that I don't dare to
attack Princess Zhao Yun.

541
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,660
If something happens
to Princess Zhao Yun,

542
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,060
I'll be the first one...

543
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,780
to be blamed.

544
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,740
So, what's your plan?

545
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,660
I have to take on this task for sure.

546
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,140
But Zongzheng Wu You
better keeps his guard up.

547
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,300
We'll do it like this.

548
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,220
Bring back Lady Rong Le first.

549
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,420
Tell them that we've heard
about the incident in the inn.

550
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,140
And the safety of
Lady Rong Le comes first.

551
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,900
After that, make sure that...

552
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,900
they don't see each other
anymore from now on.

553
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,580
Yes. I understand.

554
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,900
Go.

555
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,100
" Southern City Inn "

556
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,180
Greetings, Prince Li.

557
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,140
I have some questions for you,
General Fu.

558
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,300
I still have important works to do.

559
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,260
Please ask your question.

560
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,020
Not long ago, I've met a group
of assassins in Qingliang Lake...

561
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,780
trying to assassinate Prince Zhen Bei.

562
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,100
Yesterday night, someone went into the
inn to assassinate Princess Zhao Yun.

563
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,460
Looks like their aim...

564
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,020
is to stop Prince Zhen Bei from
marrying Zhao Yun by hook or by crook.

565
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,500
Do you think that...

566
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,580
those assassins might be
one and the same?

567
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,420
I'm not sure.

568
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,860
Prince Li.

569
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,980
You've fought against them
for quite a few times.

570
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,780
You should have known more than me.

571
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,100
The ones I faced are of the bad sort.

572
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,980
Just like the Creed of Vengeance...

573
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,420
that dips their hands into
those criminal activities.

574
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,180
Greetings, Prince Zhen Bei.

575
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,100
Prince Zhen Bei.

576
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,100
His Majesty has ordered me...

577
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,100
to be your escort
and to protect you...

578
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,900
and Princess Zhao Yun until you
reach the border of our nation.

579
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,860
Thank you for taking
the trouble to do that.

580
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,140
Before we leave the border,

581
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,660
I'll have to trust you
with the safety of me...

582
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,340
and my future wife.

583
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,580
But, if something happens
during the journey,

584
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,940
you'll greatly disappoint the emperor
of Northern Realm...

585
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,140
and it'll bring troubles to you too,
General Fu.

586
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,980
Thank you for your reminder.

587
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,220
I'll hold on to your hands forever.

588
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,260
You can rely on me
without any worries.
