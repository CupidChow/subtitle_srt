Episode 21

3
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:36,372
You've not done well with
the southern fringe rebellion.

4
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,834
Prince Li has already
taken care of it for you.

5
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:41,581
I'll overlook that matter.

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,674
For this alliance between us and Chen,

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,892
if you do any mistakes again...

8
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:49,609
This time,

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,528
I will not let Your Majesty down.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,229
Your Majesty, Prince Chen returned
from the southern border.

11
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,851
-He is waiting outside.
-Wu Yu is back?

12
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,834
Father!

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,642
I am home!
I miss you so much!

14
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,260
When Brother said he is coming home,

15
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,873
I rushed back here as soon
as I could without any halt!

16
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,696
I just hoped to see you sooner.

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,116
You are an adult.
Stop acting like a child.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,943
Don't be so whiny.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,589
This is not how a prince behaves.

20
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,252
You spent so much time with Wu You,

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,474
didn't you learn the slightest
subtlety from him?

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
Father.

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
You only ever care about Wu You.

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,147
I know Wu You is firm and subtle.

25
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:32,759
He is also very sensible.

26
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:36,386
Father, compared to those
who boot-lick...

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,432
and the pretentious hypocrite,

28
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:42,130
Wu You is so much better than them.

29
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,919
How is your brother?

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,376
He started acting all mysterious
after he came to Zhongshan.

31
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,297
He seems to have some important work.

32
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,498
<i>He is back?</i>

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,817
Your Majesty, Prince Chen
hasn't seen you in a long time.

34
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,772
I should not bother your reunion.
I shall take my leave.

35
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:02,397
General Fu.

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,680
We haven't met in six months.

37
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,290
General Fu, I did think about you
from time to time.

38
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,044
During the rebellion in the south,

39
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,975
I had so many questions about
military affairs for you.

40
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,076
Do you mind sharing your
knowledge with me?

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,501
I am flattered, Prince Chen.

42
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,661
To be able to learn some
experience from you...

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,334
is my honour.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,603
If you have the time,
I will be available at all time.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
Mere discussion means nothing.

46
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:28,495
I have an idea.
After my brother is back,

47
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:31,154
we can test our skills against yours
and exchange views.

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,049
My father is here,
he can be our judge.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,784
General Fu has other
matters to see to.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
He doesn't have the time for you.

51
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:46,921
I will have our discussion
another day, Prince Chen.

52
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:50,002
General Fu, you may go now.

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,607
I'll be on my way.

54
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,721
Princess Rong Le, we can't lose.

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,295
Zhao Yun, I never
know you like to fish.

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
What made you want to
go fishing this time?

57
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,443
Wu You and Wu Yu are
coming back from the south.

58
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:49,250
Wu Yu said I can't cook
a fish properly.

59
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,297
He made fun of me and
said I can't even catch a fish.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,135
The fish! It got away.

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,200
Princess Rong Le.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,791
You didn't know Wu You is
returning from the south?

63
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,914
General Fu didn't tell you?

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,093
I heard after Wu You
reached the southern border,

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,720
an uprising took place.

66
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,324
Brother Wu You took the lead
and ended the rebellion.

67
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:19,012
I am sure there is reward
waiting for him.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,093
Besides, he regained his title
as Prince Li.

69
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:26,204
Princess Rong Le.

70
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:29,505
I know he still holds place
in your heart, right?

71
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:33,327
Brother Wu You still loves you
deep down in his heart.

72
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:36,321
Otherwise he wouldn't
go through so much...

73
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,160
to send you the candied dates...

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,310
and still keeps it a secret from you.

75
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,831
Your Highness, Princess Zhao Yun,

76
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,460
you must be tired from
fishing all day.

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
Come on, have some tea.

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,604
Watch out!
Ambush from the water!

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,366
-Run!
-Go!

80
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,079
Catch!

81
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,629
Master, run!

82
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,532
Fall back!

83
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,033
Ling Yue!

84
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,320
How is it?

85
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:24,866
Are you all right?

86
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,778
No, Your Highness.
You must go on without me.

87
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,163
No, I can't leave you behind.

88
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,440
We can find a place to hide first.

89
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,165
Go.

90
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,111
Why would so many men
kill a fishmonger like you?

91
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,200
Miss, don't worry about it.
They are after me.

92
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:53,102
I am sure they won't try to hurt you.

93
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:56,237
My lord, since we get
to meet each other,

94
00:07:56,587 --> 00:08:00,347
we have no other choice
but to make it through together.

95
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,415
Ling Yue, don't be afraid.
I can protect you.

96
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
Zhao Yun, you don't know
any martial art.

97
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,063
Princess Rong Le,
don't worry about me.

98
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,777
I watched Wu You and Wu Yu
training with their swords.

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,425
I know a thing or two myself.

100
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:15,085
It's all right.

101
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
We met here by chance.

102
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,880
I never imagined we would
be fighting side by side.

103
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,501
I shall die without any regret.

104
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,101
Stop talking about dying.

105
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,181
I am not married yet.
I don't plan to die here.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,760
If we can make it out
of here safely, I will...

107
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,731
Miss, we should split up
and move forward.

108
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,960
They won't hurt you.

109
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,447
We are in the same boat,
I can't leave you behind.

110
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,520
-No!
-Your Highness!

111
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,880
Volley!

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,357
Xiang Ying?

113
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,549
General Fu sent his men to save us!

114
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,720
I am glad General Fu sent help.

115
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:46,181
Otherwise we would
have all died in here.

116
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:58,891
Your Highness,
I had a dream last night.

117
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,400
You were fishing
peacefully by the lake.

118
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
You looked firmed and calm.

119
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,424
Your pose was striking.

120
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,406
A true ruler that befits the throne!

121
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,448
So right after I woke up,

122
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,639
I couldn't wait to take
Your Highness on a fishing trip.

123
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,921
We should get a painter.

124
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,671
Let him draw a painting
of me fishing by the lake.

125
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:22,458
All the lady in this land
can see how dashing I am.

126
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
That can't be done.

127
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,360
Your Highness is mine alone.

128
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,607
I won't allow the others
to have any wild desire for you.

129
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,565
Of course.

130
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,334
Who is it? How dare you ride
pass His Highness' carrier!

131
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,080
What is going on?

132
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,077
Your Highness, it was General Fu.

133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,192
General Fu?

134
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,449
It's General Fu.

135
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,722
General Fu.

136
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
What are the odds?

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,556
Watch your steps.

138
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,255
Greetings, Crown Prince.

139
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,769
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

140
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,480
This path leads to Lake Qingliang.

141
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:30,006
-Are you heading there too?
-General Fu.

142
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:34,084
Lady Xiang told me the lake
is a good fishing spot.

143
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,580
Yes, I can almost imagine...

144
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,311
the brave warrior you are that
kills the enemies on battlefield.

145
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,335
But I could never imagine...

146
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,280
what General Fu would do
when he is fishing.

147
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,835
General Fu, you rarely get
a chance to relax.

148
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,868
Why don't you join me for the fishing?

149
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,421
Just now,

150
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,680
His Majesty mentioned you
when I met him.

151
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,471
I think you should be back
at the Eastern Palace.

152
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,381
My father never cares to
talk about me.

153
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,166
This is such a bad timing.

154
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,844
Your Highness,
we can go fishing first.

155
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,645
Then, we present the fish
to His Majesty.

156
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,400
Two birds with one stone.

157
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,774
Xiang, that is a great idea.

158
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,305
Your Highness, Lady Xiang.

159
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,130
General Fu, there was a burglary
at the eastern outskirts.

160
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,387
We caught the thief.

161
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
We have no information
about his identity.

162
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,323
Your Highness, Lady Xiang.
I must leave now.

163
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,010
General.

164
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,525
It's just a mere burglary
and some thieves.

165
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,892
Do they really need you
to see to this case?

166
00:13:57,096 --> 00:13:58,696
Come fishing with me.

167
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,275
After I returned to the palace,

168
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:04,304
I can tell my father I was
with you all the time,

169
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,045
discussing about work
while we were fishing.

170
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,237
Xiang, what's wrong?

171
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,756
Your Highness, I am not feeling well.

172
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,909
Could it be that you are pregnant?

173
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,571
Head back to the palace!

174
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:26,074
We are going back to the palace!

175
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,360
-Get moving!
-Goodbye, Your Highness.

176
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:31,682
Go on.

177
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,464
-What is it?
-Lady Rong Le was hurt at the lake.

178
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,640
Prince Li saved her
and she is still there.

179
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,062
There are only the two of us here.

180
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:31,317
Take it as...

181
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,597
we have never met before.

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
No identities, no names,

183
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,657
no memories.

184
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,893
We are here by chance...

185
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,243
and meeting each other as strangers.

186
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,360
Miss.

187
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,511
My hand is hurt.

188
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:52,617
Will you help me out?

189
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,996
We have different background...

190
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:57,996
and different stands.

191
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,094
We may have been in love,

192
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,799
but we never cherished
our time together.

193
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,760
I, Zongzheng Wu You,

194
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,046
will give you all of me.

195
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:23,064
I will never give up.

196
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,762
I won't let the world down,

197
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:27,851
or you.

198
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,071
Who was the assassination target?

199
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,094
Prince Zhen Bei of Chen.

200
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,242
He came here for the alliance.

201
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,754
If you are upset about
what happened today,

202
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,333
perhaps...

203
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,689
you can go to the lake tomorrow.

204
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,228
Spring is almost upon us.

205
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,060
The view there is nice.

206
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,927
How is your injury, my lady?

207
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,578
Where are Zhao Yun and Ling Yue?

208
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,501
Lady Rong Le, I sent my men
to escort them home.

209
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,455
They suffer no serious injury.

210
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
General, a moment please.

211
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,243
I think you owe me an explanation
for what happened just now.

212
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,335
Prince Li.

213
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,920
Prince Zhen Bei was
terrified from the attack.

214
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,332
That was my fault.

215
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,993
After I returned to the capital,
I will apologise to His Majesty.

216
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
I came back from the south.

217
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:40,116
My father put me in charge of
overseeing this alliance.

218
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,139
From now on, you can report to me
if there is any inquiry.

219
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,060
Don't bother His Majesty with this.

220
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,260
Prince Zhen Bei was ambushed.

221
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,827
I saw the whole thing.

222
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,810
During the attack,

223
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,354
your wife was there too.

224
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:58,243
As for your men,

225
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:00,966
they were standing by in the area
but didn't make a move.

226
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,335
General, may I know...

227
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,527
what the reason is?

228
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,212
I failed my duty as I failed
to ensure Prince Zhen Bei's safety.

229
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,800
I am willing to accept punishment.

230
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,179
Prince Li, you may
punish me as you see fit.

231
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:16,666
As for my wife,

232
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,020
I must thank you for her
as you saved her in time.

233
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:22,413
General Fu.

234
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,400
Don't you realise that
if I had been a moment too late,

235
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,996
your wife would have
been dead by now.

236
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,411
Rong Le would have perished.

237
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,735
Which is why...

238
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,600
I must thank you for saving her life.

239
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
After her injury is healed,

240
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,985
she and I will both
express our gratitude to you.

241
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,236
Fu Chou.

242
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,171
Do you think everyone would
fall for your mask of lies?

243
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,168
Only Rong Le could be fooled
by your false gentle.

244
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,481
And you used her with no remorse.

245
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,692
She almost died because of you.

246
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,686
How dare you standing right here...

247
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,840
and claim that she is your wife.

248
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:12,045
That is not true, Prince Li.

249
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,985
I am sure you are well aware that...

250
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,206
Rong Le and I have been living
in harmony for the past six months.

251
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,288
Our life is happy and quiet.

252
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,560
I believe you wouldn't...

253
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,837
ruin the peaceful life
she worked so hard on to get.

254
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,876
How do you explain
what happened earlier?

255
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,766
It was simply an accident.

256
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,907
I never intended for
Rong Le to get hurt.

257
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:38,362
Not then, not now,

258
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:40,428
not in the future.

259
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,047
If you insist that I am using her
as my pawn,

260
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,030
I do have some questions for you.

261
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,395
Did you not hurt
and lied to her yourself?

262
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,501
If you hadn't,

263
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,065
she wouldn't have chose to marry me.

264
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,330
Also, on our wedding six months ago,

265
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:03,027
you tainted her honour and name.

266
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,317
She is shunned by people.

267
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,845
She is haunted by the mocking
and rumours.

268
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,817
Don't you remember any of that?

269
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:13,918
So,

270
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
I hereby request you...

271
00:23:16,952 --> 00:23:19,209
to do us a favour...

272
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,196
and let Rong Le live in peace.

273
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,509
I must return and tend to
my wife's wound.

274
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,894
So long.

275
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:34,099
Fu Chou.

276
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,117
I hope you won't make my mistake...

277
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,000
and live in regret.

278
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,212
Between Prince Li and I,

279
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,112
we were never the same.

280
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,998
Ya Li, what do you
think about this tea?

281
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,209
The leaves are green,
the edge has a ruby red tint.

282
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,807
It has a light fragrance,
the natural scent of lily.

283
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,600
The tea is clear like an amber.

284
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,787
It has a rich flavour and
a tint of sweetness,

285
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,356
it's mellow and it lingers.

286
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,780
This tea is remarkable.

287
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,484
Your thoughts on the tea...

288
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,668
remind me of the person who sent them.

289
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,413
What she said when she
brewed the tea for me...

290
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,496
is almost the same as yours.

291
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,129
Who may that be?

292
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,447
Have I met her before?

293
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:49,561
You know her all along.

294
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,305
She is the wife of General Fu,

295
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,169
Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

296
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,751
I heard she opened a teahouse.

297
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,097
It's called the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

298
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,278
After she was married to General Fu,

299
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,722
he renovated the teahouse for her.

300
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:10,655
The two of them paid me a visit
and sent me these tea leaves.

301
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:13,501
Before this, I never expected
a good future for them.

302
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,751
But now, I feel like...

303
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,474
they are actually a perfect
match for each other.

304
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:23,877
Ya Li, what is on your mind?

305
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,488
The tea is overflowing.

306
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:32,150
Ya Li, I heard that...

307
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,911
while you were in Qingzhou,

308
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,656
you were getting along
very well with Wu You.

309
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,729
You look absent-minded just now.

310
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,540
Are you thinking about him?

311
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,109
Your Majesty, forgive me.

312
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,282
Pardon me for being so careless.

313
00:25:47,652 --> 00:25:48,739
It's okay.

314
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,664
Ya Li, I was once in your shoes too.

315
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:54,231
Don't feel embarrassed.

316
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:58,273
Ya Li.

317
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,519
Come.

318
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,668
I know I am right about you.

319
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,739
In this whole wide world,

320
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,353
you are the only one who
can win Wu You's heart.

321
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,637
Once Wu You succeeded the throne,

322
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:16,017
you will become the Empress.

323
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:19,667
When that happens,
I hope you remember me.

324
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,150
Thank you for the trust, Your Majesty.

325
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,006
Right, if you ever drop
by General Fu's house,

326
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,939
send my thanks to Lady Rong Le
for the tea she gave.

327
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,862
The Crown Prince never cares about
the nation's affairs.

328
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,309
When he learns about the
marriage alliance with Chen,

329
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,800
he sent in his plans right away.

330
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,539
He recommends the ladies
of the nobles he is close to...

331
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:52,941
just to get them to his side.

332
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,345
Does he really think I am
too foolish to see that?

333
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:58,109
I just can't rely on him
to do anything helpful.

334
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,440
Father, calm down.

335
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:02,688
Have an orange, it's sweet.

336
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,160
I brought this back
from the south for you.

337
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,960
I picked this orange myself.

338
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,709
I peeled this myself too.

339
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
You planted the tree as well?

340
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
Father, you are amazing!

341
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,880
How do you know that?

342
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,533
Fine. I am still considering...

343
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,481
which lady should be married
to Prince Zhen Bei..

344
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,191
I have no time for your chatter.

345
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:23,377
Why did you come here?

346
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,120
Father, this isn't about
anything important.

347
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,479
It's just that I am no longer a kid.

348
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:32,387
I learned a lot during my time
with Wu You in the south.

349
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,272
I think, to have my own career,
I must first have a family.

350
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,138
-So...
-Your Majesty.

351
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:40,097
Prince Li wishes to see you.

352
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
-Wu You is back?
-Yes.

353
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:43,401
Let him in.

354
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,342
Greetings, Father.

355
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:48,985
At ease.

356
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,086
Wu You, your hand is hurt.

357
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,920
Bring the physician here!

358
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:56,574
Never mind, this is no
serious wound.

359
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:58,771
-It's already dressed.
-Brother.

360
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:00,967
How is your wound?
Let me take a look.

361
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,587
Sit down.

362
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,206
Let me see it.

363
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,927
The cut is very deep.

364
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:08,433
Is it just as Father told me?

365
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,778
Prince Zhen Bei was ambushed
at Lake Qingliang?

366
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:13,628
Wu You, how is the situation
at Lake Qingliang?

367
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:14,969
Tell me what happened.

368
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,059
Father.

369
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,268
Prince Zhen Bei was ambushed by
the assassins from Western Qi.

370
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,929
But he got away safely.
He is in safety.

371
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,369
I ordered my men to escort him
back to the inn.

372
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,160
Did you hurt your hand
when you tried to save him?

373
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,554
Father, my hand...

374
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,960
Prince Zhen Bei wasn't
the only one there when I arrived.

375
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:42,664
There were Lady Rong Le and
Princess Zhao Yun.

376
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:44,234
-However...
-What is it?

377
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,909
Zhao Yun was hurt too?

378
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,856
Calm down, it was just
a scrap at her arm.

379
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,259
-She is safe.
-Zhao Yun is hurt?

380
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,854
Father, I must leave.

381
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,499
Sir Chen, I will help you up later.

382
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,228
Come on, are you all right?

383
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,058
Much obliged.
I am fine.

384
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,429
But your hand...

385
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,966
-Physician, dress the wound.
-Yes.

386
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,869
You should have seen how
dangerous it was.

387
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,942
Those men in black
were wearing masks.

388
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,356
They eyes are sharp like blades.
They swung their swords...

389
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,205
and charged right at us.

390
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:20,147
You know, it was so close.

391
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,682
I almost lost my arm.

392
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,680
It's all my fault.

393
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,850
I shouldn't have
made fun of you in the letter.

394
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,886
I should have said
you can't stay in your room.

395
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,520
Then you will keep yourself inside
the house and away from danger.

396
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,007
I am fine.

397
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,626
I am a skilled warrior.

398
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,233
This little wound is no big deal.

399
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,669
It doesn't hurt.

400
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:43,344
Do you think I can still get a fish?

401
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,855
Sure, I am the fish.

402
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,919
You can send the bait
and I will bite it.

403
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,014
That is more like it.

404
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,443
It's time for your medicine.

405
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,855
Come.

406
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:59,040
You can go now.

407
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:04,353
After my father finished the work
with marriage alliance,

408
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,143
I will talk to him about our wedding.

409
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,320
Who said I am marrying you?

410
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,257
You didn't even propose to me.

411
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,191
I took your bait just now.

412
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,699
You won't get rid of me.

413
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,604
-Take your medicine.
-I am not drinking it.

414
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,385
You need this to get well.

415
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,487
-No.
-Your need this to get well.

416
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,445
-No!
-Just drink it.

417
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:25,846
-No!
-Please!

418
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:29,766
I suspect that Fu Chou had
his men ready...

419
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,358
by Lake Qingliang.

420
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,824
But when the assassins
from Western Qi attacked the Prince,

421
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:38,862
his men never came in
to save Prince Zhen Bei.

422
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:43,154
I suspected he is
conspiring with Western Qi.

423
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,028
But he contributed much
during the rebellion at south.

424
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,433
He is renowned in the army.

425
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,351
If I depose him without
any solid evidence,

426
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:57,103
it might cause an uproar.

427
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,589
Besides, this is the crucial moment
for our alliance with Chen...

428
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,796
to launch a campaign against Wei.

429
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:05,227
Father.

430
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,197
I am against forming
an alliance with Chen.

431
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,340
I strongly disagree having
a marriage alliance.

432
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,560
Father, the affairs of two nations...

433
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,895
should never involve
the love of two young people.

434
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:22,237
Why must we sacrifice the happiness
of a young woman...

435
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,447
for the sake of glory?

436
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,855
Because you put gains
before everything, my mother...

437
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,476
spent her whole life in pain.

438
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,858
And now you are using another
innocent girl for your ambition.

439
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,242
Enough.

440
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,996
Don't bring up Lady Yun on everything.

441
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,833
Back then, I has no other choice
but to marry Fu Yuan.

442
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,040
But it's different now.

443
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,515
A marriage alliance...

444
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,367
might not necessarily be a sacrifice.

445
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,603
When we were having
a marriage alliance with Qi,

446
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,640
had you listened to my advices,

447
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:01,571
you and Rong Le would have been
a couple living in joy.

448
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,015
Do you still think the alliance
is a foul plan?

449
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,220
I made my decision.

450
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,800
I summoned you back to Zhongshan...

451
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,100
because of this matter.

452
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:19,271
If we can have Chen as our ally,

453
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,237
I will personally lead
our force against Wei.

454
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,800
I will complete my last goal
before I pass on the throne.

455
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,811
Wu You, tell me,

456
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,400
how was the situation at the south?

457
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,080
Father.

458
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,234
I went deep in cover in the south.

459
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:41,208
A dark force is
working secretly there.

460
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,850
I suspect...

461
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,896
the Sun family led by Sun Ji Zhou...

462
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,046
is working for a mastermind.

463
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:49,387
The south is still
in danger of falling,

464
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,868
and you still insist on leading
our army against Wei.

465
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,969
I am worried that the defence
of Zhongshan will be weakened.

466
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:58,256
The force at the south
will use this opening to invade.

467
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,920
I am aware of the danger
posed by the south.

468
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:05,763
This is why I sent you there.

469
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,671
Wei had their eyes on
our nation for a long time.

470
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,357
It's either now or never for us.

471
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,085
If Wei and Western Qi join hands,

472
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,640
the Northern Realm will be
under their total control.

473
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:24,340
Father, our most
pressing matter now...

474
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:25,907
is to get rid of the traitors.

475
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,604
Meanwhile, the people need to recover.

476
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:30,366
I am getting old.

477
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,587
I can't wait for you
to finish the pacification.

478
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,136
You and Wu Yu were
in the south for six months.

479
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:41,312
When I was going through
the scrolls in this study,

480
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,729
I feel like there is more to be done.

481
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,728
At night, I would stare at the moon.

482
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,960
It reminds me of your mother.

483
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Your mother made a request
before she passed on.

484
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,911
She wanted you away
from the fighting of politics.

485
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:59,362
She wanted a happy life for you.

486
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,560
I hope I could make that
a reality for you, but I can't.

487
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,889
However,

488
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,351
in this world I live in,

489
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,360
I am the most helpless father.

490
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,311
All that I can do for you now...

491
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,197
is to leave you a world
free from turmoil.

492
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,357
Father.

493
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,493
All right.

494
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,256
Enough about this.

495
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,296
I hope you can forget the past
and start a new life.

496
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,059
That is for the best.

497
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,916
Wu Yu...

498
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,156
talked to me about
forming his own family.

499
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,322
Don't fall too far behind.

500
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,960
I failed to protect Lady Rong Le...

501
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,800
and she was wounded because of me.

502
00:34:55,078 --> 00:34:56,831
While you were waiting for the ambush,

503
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,389
didn't you realise
Zongzheng Wu You was there?

504
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,174
It was in the middle of a fight,
we were focusing on Lady Rong Le.

505
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:06,606
I should be punished for not
noticing Prince Li's presence.

506
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,080
General, everything
was within our control.

507
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,760
We never expected Prince Li would
show up and ruin our plan.

508
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,352
We couldn't react in time.

509
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:19,983
Leave and get your punishment.

510
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,589
General Fu,
I have followed you for years.

511
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,103
I have always been loyal
and never made any mistakes.

512
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,264
This is my only error.

513
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,452
Please, show me some mercy for once.

514
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,465
I wish to follow you, General Fu.

515
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,127
Sparing your life...

516
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,670
is more than any mercy you deserve.

517
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,089
-General.
-Get out of my sight.

518
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,917
Yes.

519
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:12,901
<i>Zongzheng Wu You.</i>

520
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,441
<i>This is the just the beginning.</i>

521
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,760
Sir Xiao.

522
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,077
While the Princess and I were
at the lake, where were you?

523
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:31,229
She wants me to tell you
to stop protecting us.

524
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,924
But it can't be helped
if you want to spy on us.

525
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,294
Suit yourself.

526
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:40,723
General Fu.

527
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,276
General, let me send
this medicine to Her Highness.

528
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,028
-You can all go now.
-Yes.

529
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:28,479
Rong Le.

530
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,931
You are still recovering.
You shouldn't be standing.

531
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,963
Let me help you sit down.

532
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,683
I am waiting for an
explanation from you.

533
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,024
Finish your medicine.

534
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:47,967
You are hurt.
Don't bother yourself with thoughts.

535
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,843
You wanted me to be at the lake.

536
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,753
Did you want me to have
a good time or was it your plan?

537
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,841
Was that really an accident?

538
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:58,194
Don't you dare tell me
you don't know anything.

539
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,141
Finish your medicine.

540
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,581
Once you got well, I can take you
to any place you want.

541
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,528
I won't let you get hurt again.

542
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,240
You knew Prince Zhen Bei
is going to Lake Qingliang.

543
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,781
My brother wanted him dead.

544
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,080
You had order from His Majesty
to protect the Prince.

545
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,760
So you used me to save him.

546
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,494
You knew Xiao Sha would hesitate
when he sees me.

547
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:28,574
Then, he will miss the chance
to kill Prince Zhen Bei.

548
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,804
You had all of these planned.

549
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:32,970
You took every precaution there is.

550
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:35,819
But my safety was never
in your consideration.

551
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,360
-If I were killed...
-I won't let that happen.

552
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,514
I will never let you get killed.

553
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,050
It seems like I still have
some values after all.

554
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,189
You spent the last six months...

555
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,901
to earn my trust.

556
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,468
Now that you finally get it,

557
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,975
it would be a waste if you
don't use that trust to the fullest.

558
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,604
Rong Le, I never planned
for you to get hurt.

559
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,960
I wanted you to go because I knew
they won't hurt you.

560
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,925
But I never expect...

561
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,098
you would risk your life
for Prince Zhen Bei.

562
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,498
You have never met him before.

563
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,285
He was a complete stranger to you.

564
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,569
A stranger?

565
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,129
Your so-called stranger...

566
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,840
was willing to face the enemy
just to save me.

567
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,098
What about you?

568
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:40,512
You claim to be my husband,

569
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,046
that you will keep me safe
and love me as we grow old.

570
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,728
Will you give up your life for me?

571
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,920
I will,

572
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,937
if my life was mine to have,

573
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:55,376
if I were just an ordinary person,

574
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,476
I am willing
to give you all of me.

575
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,852
That includes my life.

576
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,812
If?

577
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,199
If that is the reality,

578
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,440
I would never become
a princess of Western Qi.

579
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,826
I wouldn't be married
to this land for my duty.

580
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,996
I wouldn't be my brother's pawn.

581
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,562
I would never married you...

582
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,440
or do your bidding.

583
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,608
Rong Le.

584
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,166
I admit that I used you.

585
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,242
I regret every second of it
when I know you are hurt.

586
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,680
I would rather take on those wounds
a thousand times more.

587
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:42,371
Do you know how much I wish...

588
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,287
I were the person
who came to your rescue?

589
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,399
All I know is that...

590
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,278
you sent me to face that ambush.

591
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,587
But it wasn't you
who saved me from it.

592
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,655
There are some decision in
this world that once they are done,

593
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,519
they can never be undone.

594
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Once the heart is scarred,

595
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,892
the wound may heal
but the scar remains.

596
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,072
That scar...

597
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,168
is not something that
can be healed with mere words.

598
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,336
Tell me why the scar Wu You
left in you can be healed so easily!

599
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,927
I saw the two of you standing
on the raft.

600
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,320
It was as though you two
had the world for yourselves...

601
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:26,515
and I am just an outsider.

602
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,040
He hurt you, lied to you
and used you!

603
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,148
He humiliated in front of everyone!

604
00:41:32,495 --> 00:41:35,714
If you could forgive him,
why can't you forgive me?

605
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:40,485
I won't ask to have your love
like he did.

606
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,938
I simply wanted you to forgive me
like you forgave him.

607
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,552
That is all I ask!

608
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,055
I am married to you for six months.

609
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:53,653
I admit it.

610
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,656
I was never in love with you.

611
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,400
But I did put in my effort for you.

612
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,480
I hope we can be friends,

613
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,381
soulmates or even a family.

614
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,875
Keeping each other company...

615
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,820
and grow old together.

616
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,608
But I am your husband!

617
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:13,521
Family, friends and soulmates,

618
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:15,688
those are not enough for me!

619
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:17,488
I want your heart to be mine!

620
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,766
Love me like you loved
Zongzheng Wu You,

621
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,278
that is what I wanted!

622
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,096
I know.

623
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,640
I am asking for forgiveness
and your love,

624
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,322
that is too greedy of me.

625
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,560
But after twenty years of living,

626
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,575
I never expected much or
wished for any sort of luxury.

627
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,736
Today, I will wish for one thing,

628
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:42,459
your forgiveness.

629
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:44,612
Just once.

630
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:48,157
Our marriage has always been a lie.

631
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,160
You know that you'll
use me more than once.

632
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,451
So, why do you keep on
lying to yourself...

633
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,160
and why do you want to
make things difficult for me?
