00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,790
Episode 19

3
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:38,208
Miss Sun, this is the
present Lord Wu You sent.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
These silver bracelets are beautiful.

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,880
They came in pair.

6
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:53,363
Miss Sun, is His Highness...

7
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:23,654
Brother, the rebels are advancing.
They almost reached the city.

8
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:27,260
Fear not, I order Agent Wu
and his men to set up ambush.

9
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,800
The south has been
plagued by the rebels.

10
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,956
But Fu Chou never succeeded
in getting rid of them.

11
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,498
It's high time we put
an end to this.

12
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Maybe Fu Chou wasn't trying
to get rid of the rebels.

13
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,581
Maybe this was his plan.

14
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
I ordered Agent Wu to search
for their backgrounds.

15
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:47,425
Most of them are desperate
fugitives who lost their homes.

16
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
These people are easy to
be talked into an uprising.

17
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,362
But at the same time,
they are easy to break.

18
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:05,456
Your Highness, the rebels are
recruiting sooner than expected.

19
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:08,162
They are getting impatient.
It's time to meet them in person.

20
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,400
Who made us lose our families?

21
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:27,602
Who took our homes from us?

22
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,732
It's the rich and powerful
from the city...

23
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,399
that took our land and food!

24
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,164
Today,

25
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:39,575
we will reclaim what's
rightfully ours!

26
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,949
We will make them pay.

27
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,135
For us!

28
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,039
And for our families!

29
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,248
Kill them all!

30
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,527
Kill them all!

31
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,240
Kill them all!

32
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,320
They are putting the civilians
at front lines.

33
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,531
They are using the people
as human shields!

34
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,227
I won't allow the
people to die in vain!

35
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:02,462
Kill them all!

36
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,278
Kill them all!

37
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,640
I, Zongzheng Wu You,
give you my word!

38
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,831
As long as you lay down your weapons,

39
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,788
I will give you what you need.

40
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,759
I will let you have a peaceful life.

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
I swear on my life!

42
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,910
I will not go back on my words!

43
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,320
All hail His Highness!

44
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,295
All hail His Highness!

45
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:16,649
All hail His Highness!

46
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,847
<i>The skirmish at
Qingzhou was pacified.</i>

47
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,200
<i>The Zheng family was prosecuted
for conspiring with rebels.</i>

48
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:25,301
<i>They hoarded the land for
their own during the war.</i>

49
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,415
<i>Their crime was informed
to the Imperial Court...</i>

50
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,081
<i>which angered His Majesty.</i>

51
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,998
<i>Zongzheng Wu You was ordered
to eliminate the Zheng family.</i>

52
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,333
<i>The Zheng family estate is to
be returned to the Imperial Court.</i>

53
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:41,552
As ordered by His Majesty,

54
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,500
the skirmish at the south
was pacified.

55
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,505
The Zheng family is no more.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,128
I remember the feat
of General Fu Chou...

57
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,831
which helped to weaken
the force of the rebels.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,080
You are hereby granted the
special silk from Qingzhou,

59
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,788
jade and rice grains...

60
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,986
as a token for your attachment
to the south.

61
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,963
Period.

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,881
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

63
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,142
Please accept the royal decree.

64
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:20,236
You are welcome, General Fu.
I must leave now.

65
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,751
Much appreciated.

66
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,495
Leave us be.

67
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:48,252
General.

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,872
I just came back from the south.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,269
Everything is going well there.
The people live in peace.

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,370
The land will soon
regain its prosperity.

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,456
I paid Lord Wu You a visit
in the south.

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,437
His Highness praised you
for the previous achievement.

73
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,831
His Highness achieved a great feat
and is high in morale.

74
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,558
He spent his time helping the people.

75
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,400
The Zheng family is eliminated.
The Sun family has a great influence.

76
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,309
Perhaps it's because
of His Highness' support.

77
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
When I arrived, His Highness
was playing chess with Miss Sun.

78
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:15,164
There are rumours in Qingzhou.

79
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,400
Maybe Lord Wu You really is
marrying Miss Sun.

80
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,418
General, I should go now.

81
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,454
All these gifts from His Majesty...

82
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:54,455
is a sarcasm to me
for not killing all the rebels.

83
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,889
I failed to get rid
of all the remnants.

84
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:01,836
This is a slap to my face.

85
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,058
Nicely done, Agent Wu.

86
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:39,690
Wu You, your swordplay has improved.

87
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,038
The battlefield is the best
training ground.

88
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,720
How does it feel to kill
the enemies along my side?

89
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,120
The Hidden Ones have some fame
among the vagabonds.

90
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,240
But we have always
worked in the dark.

91
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,779
Killing the enemies
on the battlefield...

92
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,758
is to complete what my father started.

93
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
The pain in my heart faded away.

94
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,533
This brings a tint of comfort.

95
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,151
It must have been hard
all these years.

96
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,257
The case from 16 years ago...

97
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,970
caused your whole family
to be executed.

98
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,717
You got away with your life,
but not your name.

99
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,950
You founded the Hidden Ones
with all you had.

100
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,495
You helped gather all the
information in the dark.

101
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,590
But I don't even have the means...

102
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:24,873
to retrieve your honour.

103
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,291
Wu You, I owe my life to Sir Qin.

104
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,262
He is also a good friend of my father.

105
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,073
I never blamed you
for what happened.

106
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,209
The one thing I was worried about...

107
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,305
was how you brought your guards
and took the bride from General Fu.

108
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,395
I thought you lost your senses...

109
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,400
and forgot about the unfinished
mission left by our master.

110
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,092
Now that you are on your feet again,

111
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,195
-that is a relieve.
-Don't worry, Brother.

112
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,441
I will walk the path
I am destined for.

113
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:58,460
I will do my best to
complete my mission.

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,447
Your Highness, you are back.

115
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:17,439
Have a seat.

116
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:33,737
Your Highness, have some tea.

117
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,559
What's wrong?
Are you not used to it?

118
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:50,072
The tea from Qingzhou has
a special flavour.

119
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,614
I couldn't get used to it at first.

120
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,284
But I slowly learned to enjoy it.

121
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,010
It is quite the unique flavour.

122
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,442
I lost the game of chess that day.

123
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:04,588
I will do my best today.

124
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:06,426
How about a few rounds?

125
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,219
I will pass for today.

126
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,554
Can you play a song for me instead?

127
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,243
As you wish.

128
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,289
This brat's handwriting
is getting better.

129
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,366
She has become more gentle too.

130
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:15,319
How is she right now?

131
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:22,248
What?

132
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,081
You miss the capital?

133
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,036
Yes.
Wait, no.

134
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,331
I am not in a hurry to go home.

135
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:31,399
Wherever you go,
that is where I will go.

136
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,617
In that case, the news from capital...

137
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,567
won't pick your interest.

138
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,120
Wait! What news?

139
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:41,748
Is His Majesty summoning you back?

140
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,235
I knew it, pacifying the rebellion
was a great feat.

141
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,290
There is no way he won't reward you.

142
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,932
Weren't you not in a hurry to go home?

143
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,587
Brother, stop messing with me.

144
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,211
Just tell what it is.

145
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,058
-Sir.
-Sir.

146
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,888
Greetings, Your Highness.

147
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:02,015
How may we be of help for you?

148
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:03,668
Your Highness.

149
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:08,413
I did as you ordered for
the case with Zheng family.

150
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,233
Those with crimes will be punished.

151
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,924
But the fortune involved with
the family is a huge sum.

152
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,739
There were debates
for the estates all along.

153
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,720
They are now occupied
by the fugitives.

154
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,362
They won't hand the land in.

155
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,793
How will Your Highness
deal with this issue?

156
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,277
I wish to listen to your suggestion.

157
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,080
I think while the Zheng family
was in charge,

158
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,733
they were greedy enough
to hoard lands for their own.

159
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:36,951
They used any vile means necessary.

160
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,123
Those lands were not used for farming,

161
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,855
but he won't let anyone use it.

162
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,352
We can used these lands
to relocate the fugitives.

163
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,055
Your Highness, why don't
we do them a favour for once?

164
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,547
We shall proceed with your plan.

165
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:53,861
The rebellion just ended.

166
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,363
The welfare of the people comes first.

167
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,960
There is no need for us
to fight with the people.

168
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:00,876
However...

169
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,289
What is Your Highness' concern?

170
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,152
I think the deeds to these lands
must be registered.

171
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,041
The province government will
support them to open up wasteland.

172
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,422
We cannot allow them to
sell the land...

173
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,271
to the other nobles.

174
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:17,951
We finally got rid
of the Zheng family.

175
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:21,123
If we have to deal with
another uprising,

176
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,629
that could be troublesome.

177
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,831
Yes.

178
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,081
I will proceed with
Your Highness' plan.

179
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,828
I leave this to you.
I have no worries.

180
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,688
Your Highness' trust
is much appreciated.

181
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,577
But Your Highness accomplished
the task in triumph.

182
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,193
His Majesty will surely reward you.

183
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,160
You might even regain your titles.

184
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
If His Majesty summons you
to express his gratitude,

185
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,000
there will be much works to be done,

186
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,198
do I have the permission
to proceed as I see fit?

187
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,177
Whatever His Majesty wants,

188
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,617
I am not going back.

189
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,414
Brother?

190
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,671
You are not going home?

191
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,206
Do you mean you won't
go back for time being...

192
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,501
or...

193
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,480
The provinces at south
is recovering from the battles.

194
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,240
They will soon return to their
respective glory days.

195
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,402
Serenity at the countryside.

196
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:16,844
Far from the game of power.

197
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,412
This is where I wish
to stay for the rest of my life.

198
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,963
If I must live here forever,

199
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,838
without my title...

200
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,012
in peace and far away from fighting,

201
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,061
I will gladly accept this life.

202
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,002
Brother, I thought you forgot
about what happened in the past.

203
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:36,113
You carry a great ambition
but you choose to live in peace?

204
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,212
Please, reconsider this decision.

205
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,330
Your Highness is the
centre of attention.

206
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,290
This is the chance of a lifetime.

207
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,123
Not only can you return with glory,

208
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,909
you might gain the title
as Crown Prince.

209
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,200
Teacher.

210
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,818
Something is best left unsaid.

211
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,331
My decision is certain.

212
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:55,542
It's pointless to persuade me.

213
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,370
Wu Yu, you wanted to go back.

214
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,240
Express my gratitude and
send my regards to our father.

215
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,869
Tell him about the decision I made.

216
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:06,667
Brother?

217
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,254
Brother?

218
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,007
But...

219
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,788
Ya Li?

220
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,406
Are you all right?

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,646
Don't worry, I am fine.

222
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,190
Is something bothering you?

223
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,831
Your Highness.

224
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:53,530
I heard you are not going
back to the capital.

225
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,132
Indeed.

226
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,039
But His Majesty is getting old.

227
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,888
As his son, you have to
carry out your duty.

228
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,440
Ya Li, do you want to go home?

229
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,217
Did you talk to me on your own will...

230
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:07,954
or your father's order?

231
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

232
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,136
I was simply asking.

233
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,000
The choice is still up to you.

234
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:16,456
Worry not.

235
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,206
If you wish to leave this house...

236
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,789
or even leave Qingzhou,

237
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:21,413
I will not stop you.

238
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,846
My father will never agree.

239
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,175
That might not be true.

240
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:29,851
The situation changes
from time to time.

241
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:31,741
Same goes for human heart.

242
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,789
Have you ever thought about...

243
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,560
spending your time
with me instead of...

244
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:39,750
the son from Zheng family?

245
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,920
Your Highness,

246
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,217
you knew it all along?

247
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,557
That is for sure.

248
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,969
The two of us are actually
facing the same problem.

249
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,029
I never wanted the others
to make me forget about the past.

250
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,018
The more you try to forget,

251
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:57,888
the more you remember it.

252
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,273
Which is why I gave you
these bracelet...

253
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,240
so you could put up a good act for me.

254
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,593
You hate it when people
force you to make a choice.

255
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,790
The more they demand you,

256
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,544
the more you hate it.

257
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,492
Which is why you accepted my gifts.

258
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
Isn't that right?

259
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,320
If Your Highness understands,

260
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:20,102
can you please help me?

261
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,856
I want to go back to the capital.

262
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:24,369
I want to be with the one I love.

263
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,152
Ya Li, please stand up.

264
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,518
Whether you can go back or not...

265
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,198
is not up to me.

266
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,102
It must be decided by someone else.

267
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,290
General Fu, there is no sign
of Zongzheng Wu You coming back.

268
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,888
Everything is quiet at the south.

269
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,707
Rumours said he is
renovating the manor.

270
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,520
He is turning that temporary house
into his permanent home.

271
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,123
He might never come back again.

272
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:59,015
His Majesty mentioned...

273
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,704
the rewards for those
who battled the rebels.

274
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,079
But he never mentioned
anything about Wu You coming back.

275
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,884
Don't you think is...

276
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:09,609
rather odd?

277
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:11,824
Do you need me to
investigate again in the south?

278
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,269
Don't bother.

279
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,015
If he does nothing, I do nothing.

280
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:19,864
Since Zongzheng Wu You
doesn't plan to return,

281
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:23,562
it would make our next move
in the plan a lot easier.

282
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:26,389
Right.

283
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,193
Another letter came from Western Qi.

284
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,466
They are rushing me to get
the Book of Mountains and Rivers.

285
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:32,884
But Lady Rong Le is...

286
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,748
Do not bother her with this matter.

287
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:36,158
I will figure something out...

288
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:37,979
to keep them preoccupied...

289
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,809
and keep them from getting in our way.

290
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
General Fu.

291
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,081
The sound must have come
from the Tranquil Garden.

292
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,036
I should go and take a look.

293
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,283
I can handle it.

294
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,988
It's so beautiful!

295
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:18,427
Wonderful!

296
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,360
This is so nice!

297
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:27,723
Princess, come on and
join us for the fireworks.

298
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,331
She is right.

299
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,742
Come on and join us.
It's not fun without you.

300
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,890
Go ahead, I can watch you play.

301
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,120
Join us.
It's not fun without you.

302
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,987
She is right.
Look at that.

303
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:41,421
The fireworks is not
as pretty without you.

304
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,032
Indeed!

305
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,600
You are a slick.

306
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,480
-I'll join you.
-Sure.

307
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,076
Look!

308
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:56,147
Princess, look at how pretty it is!

309
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,796
<i>Rong Le, do you know?</i>

310
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,946
<i>I would love to see
you smile every day.</i>

311
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,239
How may I help you,
Consort of Crown Prince?

312
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:38,248
His Majesty is not feeling well
and already went to bed.

313
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,965
I am going to have my sleep as well.

314
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:42,971
We must pay our respect to the
ancestor at the Imperial Temple.

315
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,320
If this is not about
something important,

316
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,474
you may leave now.

317
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:51,217
Mother, please take this seal from me.

318
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:53,702
Depose me of my title as
the Consort of Crown Prince.

319
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,394
What are you talking about?

320
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,818
You were always a generous and modest.

321
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,864
Why would you be so rude tonight?

322
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:04,301
Mother, as you know,

323
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
the Crown Prince...

324
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:09,163
has always been reckless
when it comes to relationship.

325
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,346
I advised him for his own good.

326
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,315
When there is nothing I could do,
I let him do as he pleases.

327
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:17,917
But his behaviour is
getting out of hand.

328
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:19,959
Enough.

329
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:22,782
I have talked to you
about these matters.

330
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,458
Husband and wife must
tolerate each other.

331
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,134
You are his wife.

332
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:29,454
You must endure what
the others could not.

333
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:35,892
If you wish to surpass
the others in this palace...

334
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:38,218
and secure authority for your family,

335
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:41,231
having a small quarrel
is nothing significant.

336
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,326
I held up for over a decade.

337
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:45,843
Even now,

338
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,840
I must still be cautious
of what I say...

339
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,680
and what I do.

340
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,315
Mother.

341
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,114
It's not that I can't
stand it anymore,

342
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:58,711
but I have no place in
His Highness' heart.

343
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,402
Before this,

344
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,670
he held a feast at the Eastern Palace
for a mere courtesan.

345
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,540
His Majesty was
furious because of it.

346
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,788
But His Highness disobeyed the order
and hides that girl in the palace.

347
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,879
His affection for her
is greater than before.

348
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,720
Tomorrow is the day
to pay our respect,

349
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,239
I advised him to get changed
and rest well.

350
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,916
Go to bed earlier.

351
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:19,863
But he disagreed...

352
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:21,882
and hit me.

353
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,850
Is this how you are hurt?

354
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,439
Do you need a doctor?

355
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,946
Insolent child.

356
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,012
Tomorrow is the day
we pray to the ancestors.

357
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,346
What if His Majesty sees
the wounds you are having?

358
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,164
The wounds mean little to me.

359
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,537
But if His Majesty finds out...

360
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,471
Your Majesty, what woke you up?

361
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,219
How can I possibly fall asleep?

362
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,629
That insolent prince
is simply licentious!

363
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,287
He failed his duty and now
he is disobeying my order?

364
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,036
The nation will be ruined
by his hands.

365
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,901
Your Majesty, calm down.

366
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,248
That was a simply a one-time mistake.

367
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,248
He was seduced by that woman.

368
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,456
Father, this is all my fault.

369
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:05,807
It's my fault.

370
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:09,290
I exaggerated the prince's wrongdoings
because I was upset.

371
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,731
He is loyal to Your Majesty.

372
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,290
-He will never lie to Your Majesty.
-Yes.

373
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:13,955
Stop defending his action.

374
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,740
His is my son and I know
very well what he is.

375
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,175
You may go now.

376
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:22,090
I will see to this matter.

377
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,318
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

378
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:38,366
Your Majesty, the matter of
the harem is part of my duty.

379
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,949
I failed you.

380
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,751
I apologise for my action.

381
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,686
I will resolve all the issues
in the harem...

382
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:46,569
and guide the Crown Prince...

383
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,498
so he may never worry you again.

384
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,676
My Empress, please stand up.

385
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:56,191
This is not your fault.

386
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:00,089
I am getting old.

387
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:03,203
Some works are getting
harder for me to accomplish.

388
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,188
You are still young.

389
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,958
You are not even much
older than he is.

390
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,738
Why would he listen to you?

391
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,872
We are married for 16 years.

392
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,440
But you have no child
of your own to rely on.

393
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:19,318
Your life in the palace
is not an easy one.

394
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:22,646
Your Majesty.

395
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,116
I never blamed you
for the life I have now.

396
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:27,307
During Fu Yuan' rebellion,

397
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,920
I was but a mere
peasant girl in my family.

398
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,748
But you already rebuilt this nation
on your own...

399
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,700
and was a hero admired by many.

400
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,758
Marrying you...

401
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:41,324
is the greatest honour of my life.

402
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,120
I am not a person with great wisdom.

403
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
All I ever know is to keep myself
away from risks.

404
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,676
I did it so I can stay by your side
for the rest of my life.

405
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,263
I understand.

406
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,138
I will have everything arranged
for you if I passed on one day.

407
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,147
I don't want the tragedy...

408
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,837
with Yun to repeat itself.

409
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,875
Princess Zhao Yun, are you here
to help us or make a mess?

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,936
Look at you, you got the flour
all over the place.

411
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,640
Ling Yue, I didn't mean it.

412
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,371
You did it on purpose!
Eat this!

413
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
Princess!

414
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,600
Ling Yue!

415
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,289
General Fu.

416
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,235
A kitchen is not a place for men.

417
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:24,885
What brings you here?

418
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,279
That night almost here.

419
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:42,606
I was thinking whether you would
join me for the dinner?

420
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,805
But it seems like...

421
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:46,329
you don't need me.

422
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,964
General Fu, why don't you
join us for the dumplings?

423
00:28:57,788 --> 00:28:59,423
What do you think, my lady?

424
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,280
General Fu, please wait for me
in the Tranquil Garden.

425
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,377
Thank you for the invitation.

426
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,400
I haven't had a good
appetite in so long.

427
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:22,365
Your cooking is quite remarkable.

428
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,998
I didn't make these.
Ling Yue and the others did.

429
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,956
You scared Zhao Yun
when you came in just now.

430
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,240
You are having a good mood.

431
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,641
But she left before she is even full.

432
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,206
General Fu, Princess Rong Le.

433
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,840
Princess Zhao Yun is on the carrier.

434
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,280
Ling Yue, it's been
a long day for you.

435
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:44,921
Have some dumplings for yourself.

436
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,119
General, do you need anything else?

437
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:51,718
Never mind. Thank you,
Miss Ling Yue.

438
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,205
I shall leave you be now.

439
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,589
This girl is getting
smarter by the day.

440
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:05,194
She is good in many ways,
but not very loyal.

441
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,320
I wonder what you
gave her as bribe.

442
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:08,969
She keeps helping you.

443
00:30:09,838 --> 00:30:12,014
But I think she is very loyal.

444
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:15,201
Think about this.
We are a family.

445
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:16,638
She is loyal to me.

446
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,099
I am loyal to you.

447
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,165
It's just the same, isn't it?

448
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,240
This place was once...

449
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:42,799
an empty and cold house.

450
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,560
I had no family or friends.

451
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,778
All that kept me company...

452
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,687
are the swords and blades.

453
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,360
When the day for reunion came,

454
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:55,706
all I ever saw in the dream
were bloodshed...

455
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,727
and the smoke rising
from battlefield.

456
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,939
But today, everything is different.

457
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:02,894
For the first time, I can feel...

458
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,280
the warmth of a family.

459
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,120
I have no family with me either.

460
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:12,769
But I could feel the serenity today.

461
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,160
Perhaps this is the
best way for me to live.

462
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:52,205
General.

463
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,640
But...

464
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,452
From now on,

465
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:58,911
the Western Qi and I
are no longer allies.

466
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,396
General, if you do this,

467
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,360
not only will you lose
the financial support,

468
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,956
-they might even expose you!
-I can deal with anything.

469
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:09,998
But I can never afford
to lose Rong Le.

470
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:13,642
She made up her mind
to severe her past.

471
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,540
I must not let Western Qi and the
Book of Mountains and Rivers...

472
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:17,988
to bother her life.

473
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,665
As for the Kite agents,
get rid of them.

474
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:23,568
Remember, Rong Le must
never find out about this.

475
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,196
Yes.

476
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:41,336
Your Majesty.

477
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,685
Your Majesty, you need the help
from Empress Dowager.

478
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,072
Without the medicine,
you will be in pain.

479
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:47,636
I am worried for you!

480
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,410
Nameless Guard!

481
00:32:55,546 --> 00:32:56,643
Yes.

482
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:58,028
How...

483
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,854
How is she lately?

484
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,540
Your Majesty, Her Highness is
doing well in General Fu's house.

485
00:33:05,704 --> 00:33:07,605
They have become more
intimate over the months.

486
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,973
Their life is rather happy.

487
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,148
Leave me be.

488
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:38,818
<i>Rong Le.</i>

489
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:44,286
<i>I hope you can live in peace
for the rest of your life.</i>

490
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,018
Crown Prince!

491
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:07,290
We were praying in
the Imperial Temple.

492
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,820
How dare you fall asleep.

493
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:11,508
Your manner is disrespectful!

494
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,836
You disrespected the sacred temple.

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,525
You should be punished for it!

496
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,197
Father, I apologise for my mistake.

497
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,914
But I was exhausted from
assisting you with the work.

498
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,373
I am feeling tired.

499
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,800
That's why I fell asleep.

500
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,081
I spend my days with work,

501
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,800
and now you have
more work than I do?

502
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
Father.

503
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,488
The south is at peace
and I am making preparation.

504
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:38,094
I am setting things in motion
for the campaign against Wei.

505
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,530
I discuss the plan with General Fu
until it's way over midnight!

506
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:44,525
Do you take me as a fool?

507
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:47,704
You spent your time in
dissolution with those women!

508
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:49,139
Father...

509
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:50,879
But...

510
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,514
Father, who is framing me now?

511
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,380
That is not true, Father!
That is not true!

512
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,958
You think I am framing you?

513
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,996
I want you out of here
to the Eastern Palace.

514
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,275
Get rid of those debauched women!

515
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,109
I want you to reflect
on your mistakes!

516
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,120
Do not come to the court again
without my permission!

517
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,360
Get out!

518
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:11,641
I will be on my way.

519
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
Calm down, Your Majesty.

520
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,714
The Crown Prince's action
may be unacceptable,

521
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,120
but what he said reminds me
of another issue.

522
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:30,217
The campaign has been
delayed for so long.

523
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,777
What is Your Majesty's next plan?

524
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,936
First, Wu You left the capital.

525
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,979
The rebellion at south
came right after.

526
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,984
All of these delayed the campaign.

527
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,236
Western Qi is not making
a clear stand either.

528
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:45,872
I sent my emissary to urge them
about the matter.

529
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,750
But their Emperor keeps
putting this matter on hold.

530
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,705
They won't let us pass through
their land or give us the provision.

531
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,428
I have the same suspicion.
Six months passed since the marriage.

532
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,560
But Western Qi is not showing
any sign of good will.

533
00:37:57,129 --> 00:38:00,478
It's like they have forgotten about
the Princess they sent here.

534
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,482
Other than the grains they gave
when Emperor of Qi arrived,

535
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,320
they have provided us
with no substantial help at all.

536
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,120
This is indeed worrying.

537
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:11,332
You are right.

538
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,636
But if we rush for the campaign,

539
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,452
I am afraid Western Qi
might break the alliance...

540
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:22,321
or even fish in troubled water.

541
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:26,919
They used a fake Princess
for the engagement.

542
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,840
It ended up in such a mess.

543
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,468
I...

544
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,758
am worried about this
marriage alliance with Western Qi.

545
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,247
Your Majesty.

546
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:40,164
I could feel something is off
about everything.

547
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,012
I am not sure
if I should tell you.

548
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:44,937
Xuan Ming, we are brothers by blood.

549
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,744
You can tell me anything.

550
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:50,025
I received reports.

551
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,247
General Fu has been contacting
Western Qi through letters.

552
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,126
But I am not sure about
the reliability of the source.

553
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:02,249
It came from a vagabond faction
called the Hidden Ones.

554
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,818
Besides, the Princess is married
to General Fu.

555
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:08,727
Writing letters to her family
is perfectly normal.

556
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,012
I dare not draw my own conclusions.

557
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,842
But General Fu's response
to this marriage alliance...

558
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:15,986
is rather peculiar.

559
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:17,411
You are right.

560
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,498
Xuan Ming, send you men
to keep watch at his manor.

561
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,680
If we can get our hands
on their letters,

562
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,729
we will have answers
for Western Qi's doings.

563
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,453
Understood.

564
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:51,839
Greetings, Your Majesty.

565
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:55,858
These are the tea leaves
you asked for.

566
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,321
I also brought Your Majesty
the best rose rouge from Qi.

567
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,035
I hope you like them.

568
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,560
I heard about this
from Princess Zhao Yun.

569
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,240
There are many fancy items
in the Rare Item Chamber.

570
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,294
The rumours are true.

571
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:19,054
Look at this rogue.

572
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,348
The colour is even more brilliant
than what we use here.

573
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,729
This is lovely.

574
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,245
If Your Majesty likes it,

575
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,439
I can order my men...

576
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:34,494
to bring the rogue here for you.

577
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,271
How thoughtful of you, Princess.

578
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,356
No, you are the General's wife now.

579
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,878
Have a seat.

580
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,676
Why did you ask me here, Your Majesty?

581
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,240
It's nothing important.

582
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,870
I haven't seen you in a long time.

583
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,561
I just wanted to have
conversation with you.

584
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,160
There is unease in the palace.

585
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,080
I am sure you have heard of it.

586
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,112
The Crown Prince's consort
has no time to talk to me.

587
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:09,923
So, I thought about you.

588
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,484
I appreciate the honour. It's my
pleasure to have this conversation.

589
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,118
These are the white jade
glaze cups you brought.

590
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,324
These are meant for tea.

591
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,040
They need someone who knows
to appreciate them...

592
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,875
so they can be useful again.

593
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,594
Today, I am returning them to you.

594
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,469
They could be your consolation
when you miss your home.

595
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,369
Thank you, Your Majesty.

596
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:43,445
But as of now,

597
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,004
I don't need them anymore.

598
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:49,554
Why?

599
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:52,456
Lady Rong Le, you have nothing
to be worried about.

600
00:41:52,587 --> 00:41:54,331
I am returning them as a gift.

601
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,570
It's has nothing to do
with the alliance.

602
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,724
Your Majesty,

603
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:03,238
they are the trinkets I brought from
Rare Items Chamber of Western Qi.

604
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,079
But I am married to a man
of Northern Realm.

605
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:07,927
I don't belong in Western Qi.

606
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,659
It's not adequate for me to keep them.

607
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,360
They should be left in the palace.

608
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,520
Don't you have any
attachment for Western Qi?

609
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,219
No.

610
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:21,182
I severed all ties with Western Qi.

611
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,443
Not even letters to your family?

612
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,312
Ever since I am married to General Fu,

613
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:33,630
I never contacted my family
in Western Qi.

614
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:36,633
Very well.

615
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,208
Have some tea.
