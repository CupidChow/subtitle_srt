" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,580
Episode 57

3
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,940
The three of you, come out!

4
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,020
Lin Shen?

5
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,420
Don't you think this scene...

6
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,780
seems quite familiar?

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,420
But you have long forgotten.

8
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,060
What do you want?

9
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,540
Don't worry.

10
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,020
Your death is yet to come.

11
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,580
After you finished your mission,

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,260
I will send you to
the afterlife myself.

13
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,900
Two of the traitor from our Creed
is inside this house.

14
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,900
Bring them out of here now.

15
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,220
Other than me,

16
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,860
there is no one else here.

17
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,860
If you don't believe me,

18
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,300
have a look inside.

19
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,260
Run!

20
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,700
Run!

21
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,580
Run!

22
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,380
Xiang Ying!

23
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,660
If we don't go now,

24
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,220
Xiang Ying will die in vain.

25
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,580
-Xiang Ying!
-Let's go!

26
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,500
A lowlife like you is no match for me.

27
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,260
The men of the Creed...

28
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,820
have no emotions or attachment.

29
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,620
You broke the rule.

30
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,820
You brought this onto yourself.

31
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,980
Hen Xiang.

32
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,300
Don't rush to your own death.

33
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,460
You deserve a better life.

34
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,220
Wherever you will go,

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,420
whatever you plan to do,

36
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,700
I can be there to help you.

37
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,340
You are the only family
I have in this world.

38
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,100
I will definitely do my best
to keep you safe.

39
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,380
This time,

40
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,260
we will go our separate ways.

41
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,740
Should fate brings us together,

42
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,820
I will be waiting for you.

43
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,700
Man Er!

44
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,860
Your Majesty, you are awake!
You are awake!

45
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,420
I was so worried!

46
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,860
I asked desperately for the
Empress Dowager to get some medicine.

47
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,740
Your Majesty,

48
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,220
she is not exactly heartless to you.

49
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,740
Why don't you just do as she says?

50
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,980
Stop risking your life.

51
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,060
Your Majesty,
trouble at the Cold Harem.

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,660
What is it?

53
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,260
Princess Rong Le went missing.

54
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,660
Please, Your Majesty!
Spare me!

55
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,380
We need to go, now!

56
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,380
So the Empress Dowager
of Western Qi...

57
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
really is Fu Yuan.

58
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,940
My daughter!

59
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,060
Guards!

60
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,820
-Yes!
-Search this place!

61
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,340
Hide yourself and don't come out.

62
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,740
-Go!
-Sister!

63
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,820
You escaped from
 the Cold Harem once again.

64
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,660
So, you are the mastermind
that staged everything.

65
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,700
With your brilliant mind,

66
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,340
you should have seen this coming.

67
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,700
I sent you to the Northern Realm...

68
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,540
as a pawn to alienate
the twin brothers.

69
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,620
Just as I expected, they are
madly in love with you.

70
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,100
Well done, you didn't disappoint.

71
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,700
We need to be cautious.

72
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,020
There are someone else here.

73
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,820
-Keep searching.
-Yes!

74
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,860
What is going on?

75
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,580
The two traitors of the Creed...

76
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,300
sneaked into the Cold Harem.

77
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,980
Xiang Ying is already taken care of.

78
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,140
Hen Xiang rescued this girl.

79
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,740
I bet Hen Xiang is
still here with her.

80
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,340
Where is Hen Xiang right now?

81
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,940
She left the palace.

82
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,140
Her daughter is still in my hand.

83
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,780
Why would she leave?

84
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,140
Where is my son?

85
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,380
Send her back to the Cold Harem
and keep watch on her.

86
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,540
If anything goes wrong there
before the noon tomorrow,

87
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,220
all of you will lose your heads.

88
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,420
Yes.

89
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,940
Let go of me!

90
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,220
I can walk on my own.

91
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,340
Why did you bring me here?
What do you want?

92
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,980
I just saved you.

93
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,180
If I were to hurt you,

94
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,180
you would have died
by Lin Shen's blade.

95
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,940
I know who you really are.

96
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,060
You are daughter of Qin Yong,
Qin Xiang.

97
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,380
You are Rong Le's sister.

98
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,060
I know you are worried for her,

99
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,340
I have a plan to save her.

100
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,220
But I need you to cooperate with me.

101
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,940
Why should I trust you?

102
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,260
It was you who took
my sister and her son.

103
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,380
You can stick that blade
into me now.

104
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,820
But Rong Le will surely get killed.

105
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,620
-Who is it?
-Stop right there!

106
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,940
Stop!

107
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,740
Come.

108
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,300
-Man Er?
-Do not come any closer.

109
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,980
Put that away.

110
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,780
I won't hurt you.

111
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,340
Enough of your pretending.

112
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,140
I know it all.

113
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,900
Your mother...

114
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,380
is that cursed Fu Yuan.

115
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,780
You are the child she gave birth to.

116
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,820
Man Er.

117
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,020
You remember it now?

118
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,340
So...

119
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,300
-Do you remember we once...
-All I want to know now...

120
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,340
is whether I am
poisoned because of you.

121
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,500
Or is it...

122
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
your mother's plan all along?

123
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,180
Were you forced to do her bidding?

124
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,780
You were poisoned...

125
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,500
because of me.

126
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,540
I have a bad memory.

127
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,060
I always thought...

128
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,700
you were only forced
into being her pawn...

129
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,460
and you had your own reasons.

130
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,220
But somehow,

131
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,580
I may have kept my guard against you,

132
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,740
there is always a voice telling me
that you will never hurt me.

133
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,340
But in the end,

134
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,820
it only made me hate you even more.

135
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,780
I did what I did...

136
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,580
because I have...

137
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,980
I have my own motives.

138
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,420
Your motives...

139
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,020
are to use my son...

140
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,060
and Hen Xiang's daughter...

141
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,140
as leverage against
 Fu Chou and Wu You.

142
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
You want to take over
the whole Northern Realm...

143
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,620
and realize your ambition of
unifying the whole land.

144
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,220
Yes!

145
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,020
All Emperors have the ambition
to conquer the world!

146
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,180
But...

147
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,020
I don't regret my actions.

148
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,260
If I were to be given another chance,

149
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,580
I would still do the same.

150
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,580
If I had another chance,

151
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,500
I would wish I've never been
to the Northern Realm and met Wu You.

152
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
I wish I have never met you either.

153
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,820
Man Er?

154
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,980
Man Er?

155
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,780
Man Er?

156
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,620
Man Er, stay still.

157
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,740
The poison inside of
you is acting up again.

158
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,940
It seems like I will be the winner.

159
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,020
In this little game of
power we are having,

160
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,500
I am destined to be the victor.

161
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,620
What do you think about my last move?

162
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,420
Isn't it spectacular?

163
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,060
Your precious son will be here soon.

164
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,140
Have a guess.

165
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,180
Is he here to save you...

166
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,980
or is he here for his wife and son?

167
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,900
Right.
The other man that comes with him...

168
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,820
is my beloved Fu Chou.

169
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,660
I forgot to mention.

170
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,780
The truth is, Chou...

171
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,580
was never my son to begin with.

172
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,420
Back then,

173
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,380
the child I gave birth to
after being violated by Rong Yi...

174
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,220
was safely taken to Western Qi as
soon as he was born.

175
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,700
As for Chou,

176
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,020
do you still remember...

177
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,860
your son with Lady Yun
that deceased?

178
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,340
That day,

179
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,220
I ordered Lin Shen to
get an infant's corpse...

180
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,140
and swapped it with your son
while Yun was unaware of it.

181
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,300
I raised that boy by my side.

182
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,300
Right under your nose,

183
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,100
I shaped him into your enemy.

184
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,740
I gave him the name Fu Chou.

185
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,620
Isn't this hard to believe?

186
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,580
You once came to the Cold Harem
to check the birthmark on his arm.

187
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,380
But I came prepared and fooled you.

188
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,340
Are you all right?

189
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,380
I will kill him right away!

190
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,340
Even until now,

191
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,460
you still couldn't bear to kill him?

192
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,900
Because of you,

193
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,220
I was willing to become an eunuch.

194
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,460
I gave up on my pride...

195
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,500
and single-handedly...

196
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,820
laced the Shilixiang Wine...

197
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,300
Qin Yong sent to the Emperor
with the Scorpion Toxin.

198
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,940
From that moment on,

199
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,660
my heart...

200
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,900
is all yours.

201
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,620
But him?

202
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,700
He used you.

203
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,900
He tortured you.

204
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,980
Even now,

205
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,220
you still can't have
the resolve to kill him.

206
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,260
Of course I would rather
have him dead right now,

207
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,500
but he deserves an end
much worse than a swift death.

208
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,380
You have done so much for me,

209
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,620
after our plan unfolds tomorrow,

210
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,460
you will earn the reward you are due.

211
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,220
Our plan for tomorrow...

212
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,780
must go on without any error.

213
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,100
Send more men to keep
watch on Qi as well.

214
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,420
He tried everything
just to save that girl.

215
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,700
I just checked.

216
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,420
There is nothing unusual at his room.

217
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,300
Send out the words now.

218
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,140
Tell the world I will
be waiting for...

219
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,780
Fu Chou and Wu You to
rescue their loves.

220
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,500
You...

221
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,740
Wicked woman and scoundrel!

222
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,700
Curse you!

223
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,020
Curse you!

224
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,300
Wait.

225
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,740
We still have use of him.

226
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,820
You can go now.

227
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,700
Your Highness, the Hidden Ones
have confirmed.

228
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,100
Consort Rong Le is being
imprisoned inside the Cold Harem.

229
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,500
That place is heavily guarded.

230
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,620
The men from the Creed are there too.

231
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
-The Creed of Vengeance?
-Yes, they are here.

232
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,740
The Creed has risen up again,

233
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,980
they must be planning something.

234
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,180
Your Highness, please be cautious.

235
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,820
At midnight,

236
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,700
I will infiltrate the palace.
The rest of you,

237
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,260
stay put outside the palace.

238
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,900
Bad news!

239
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,820
I just saw the billboard
of the royal palace.

240
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,620
At midnight, the Empress Dowager
is going to execute...

241
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,380
Princess Rong Le at the Qi De Gate.

242
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,580
Man Er.

243
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,180
Your love...

244
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,780
and hate...

245
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
are always so resolute.

246
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,700
When you love someone,

247
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,060
you give up your life...

248
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,820
and die for him.

249
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,180
When you hate someone,

250
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,100
you would be heartless...

251
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,780
and spare no mercy.

252
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,420
If that is what you think,

253
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,340
you should be letting me go...

254
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,980
so I won't hate you even more.

255
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,380
It's my destiny...

256
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,580
that when you came into my life,

257
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,380
you gave my life...

258
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,220
an actual purpose.

259
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,700
But in the end,

260
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,580
fate can be so cruel to me.

261
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,900
It gave me a chance...

262
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,140
to meet you,

263
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,660
fall in love with you,

264
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,020
but I could never be with you.

265
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,220
What are you talking about?

266
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,980
I don't understand at all.

267
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,460
You don't need to.

268
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,660
I only hope for you to be well.

269
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
That is all I ask.

270
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,420
No plan is perfect.

271
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,180
Life is fragile to begin with.

272
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,700
That's what makes it so precious.

273
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,300
I want you to live well.

274
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,700
You must remember what I told you.

275
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,740
Don't put yourself through hardship...

276
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,820
or any suffering.

277
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,100
Live on happily ever after.

278
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,740
What is this all about?

279
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,460
What do you want with me?

280
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,300
Man Er.

281
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,980
Take a sleep if you are weary.

282
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,740
Once you are awake,

283
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,540
everything will be over.

284
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,780
I made this decision,

285
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,460
I am ready to endure anything.

286
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,100
From the moment...

287
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,580
I decided to send you
to the Northern Realm,

288
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,180
I am ready for what comes next.

289
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,900
If...

290
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,620
I can't be the one
to make you happy,

291
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,020
I might as well...

292
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,340
grant you the happiness you deserve.

293
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,940
Never forgive me for this.

294
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,820
Hate me with all you have.

295
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,020
Only when the person
you hate is gone...

296
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
will you not mourn in sorrow.

297
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,740
As of now,

298
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,580
my wish came true.

299
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,260
I am willing to carry
your hate and love...

300
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,020
as I leave this world.

301
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,740
<i>I'm the one who made you leave me.</i>

302
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,820
<i>It's the ultimate goal that
I'm trying to achieve.</i>

303
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>When the cloud and the rain
hear about your life,</i>

304
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,060
<i>even they will stop and wait for you.</i>

305
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,060
Your Majesty, everything is ready.

306
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,540
I am ready as well.

307
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,220
Are you certain about this?

308
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,980
Let's start.

309
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,980
Yes.

310
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,860
<i>This is the last resort
I so stubbornly chose.</i>

311
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,180
<i>I promise you that I'll stop
after everything is done.</i>

312
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:20,660
<i>If you are willing to
believe in this world again,</i>

313
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,620
<i>please remember that...</i>

314
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,020
 <i>I once loved you.</i>

315
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,180
-There is no one inside,
-She is not in the Cold Harem.

316
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,900
This could be a trap.

317
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,540
Brother, I will cover you.
Go!

318
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,020
You must find our father and Rong Le.

319
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,620
Agent Wu, we will split up.

320
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,500
You know this place well.

321
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,940
I will search the area ahead.

322
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,420
Western Qi still have
three thousand Royal Guards...

323
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,700
and over a hundred thousand soldiers.

324
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,740
They are going to execute Man Yao.

325
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,420
They must have known
we are coming.

326
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,580
Why isn't anyone here?

327
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,020
The two of you are finally here.

328
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,820
Qi and I have been waiting
for quite a while.

329
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,180
I wonder if the scenery of
this land...

330
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,020
is good enough for the two of you.

331
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,380
So, you really are the
Empress Dowager of Western Qi.

332
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,100
Chou.

333
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,540
I haven't seen you in some time.

334
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,500
Don't you have the slightest interest
in I've been through recently?

335
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,540
We are only interested in your death!

336
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,660
If you plan to let them die,

337
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,060
come on and slay me.

338
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,180
Rong Qi!

339
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,420
How could you be so
cruel to your sister!

340
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,300
Chou.

341
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,580
They are Zongzheng Wu You's
father and lover.

342
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,060
Why are you coming
here so anxiously?

343
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,580
Even now, you are still
trying to fool me.

344
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,140
You may have raised me,

345
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,940
but you murdered my parent...

346
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,300
and set me against my own brother.

347
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,060
You tricked me into
believing you are my mother.

348
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,020
And now you are holding
my father hostage.

349
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,740
I shall severe all ties with you
once and for all.

350
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,220
I know you reconciled as brothers.

351
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,340
But I am surprised you
have grown so close.

352
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,820
I might as well...

353
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,980
give you another opportunity.

354
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,060
A chance to save a life.

355
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,500
What do you want?

356
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,260
The same thing I have always wanted.

357
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,780
I want the two of you
to have a death match.

358
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,380
I will hand over Rong Le
 and your father...

359
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,380
to whoever survives.

360
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,660
Both of you have great
skills in martial arts.

361
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,420
I am curious.

362
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,260
Which of you...

363
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,140
will come up on top?

364
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,420
After all the plottings,
you have only one motive.

365
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,540
You want our father to watch
as his sons kill each other.

366
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,580
Correct.

367
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,620
How about it?

368
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,540
Isn't this game...

369
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,100
rather intriguing?

370
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,740
Yun He.

371
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,020
Who do you think will
be the victor?

372
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,900
Who will be bested by the other?

373
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,620
Fu Yuan.

374
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,180
If Man Yao and my father die here,

375
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,620
I swear in the name of heaven,

376
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,340
all of you will be the tribute
for their funeral!

377
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,260
I was waiting for you to be here,

378
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,540
naturally, life and death
don't matter to me now.

379
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,380
Have you made up your mind?

380
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,780
I don't have time...

381
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,140
to wait for your deliberation.

382
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,700
Wu Chou.

383
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,660
Draw your blade.

384
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,140
Fine.

385
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,340
This is inevitable.

386
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,220
I was wondering which of us...

387
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,900
will be the winner.

388
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,580
Father?

389
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Father?

390
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,140
Well, you are twin brothers after all.

391
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,740
You coordinated to
each other's move flawlessly.

392
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
My Princes,

393
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,300
wipe that smirk from your faces.

394
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,060
The show...

395
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,060
is just starting.

396
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,620
My child!

397
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,180
My child!
Give me back my child!

398
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,260
If you hand my child over,

399
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,940
I am willing to do anything!

400
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,860
This is a beautiful child.

401
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,260
Such a shame.

402
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,020
Fu Chou.

403
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,620
Stop staring at your brother's child.

404
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,700
Look at her.

405
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,580
she is your daughter.

406
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,740
Hen Xiang gave birth to her...

407
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,340
and hid her away
to keep it a secret from you.

408
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,100
Isn't that right, Hen Xiang?

409
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,860
I was the one who taught
you the mastery over disguise.

410
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,300
Do you think your trick
can fool me?

411
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,180
Hen Xiang?

412
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,940
Qi, you are rather quiet today.

413
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Did you swapped right
under my nose again?

414
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,020
Your Majesty, calm down.

415
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,660
The Emperor has been ill.

416
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,020
He was holding off the pain
just to be here.

417
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,900
He had been coughing
before Your Majesty arrived.

418
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,260
The Emperor...

419
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,380
lost his voice from the coughing.

420
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Please, forgive His Majesty's manner.

421
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,620
Fu Yuan!

422
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
Let go of the child.

423
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,620
I will trade my life for them!

424
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,140
Come up here.

425
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,100
Hen Xiang?

426
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,180
Hen Xiang!

427
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,420
Do you think...

428
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,020
I would fall for your trick again?

429
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,020
Take a closer look.

430
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,020
That is your sister's child.

431
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,340
If you push your sister's son
into the fire,

432
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,540
I will give you back your daughter.

433
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,340
Stop!

434
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,060
Hen Xiang.

435
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,540
Stop right there.

436
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,220
Hen Xiang, listen to me.

437
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,980
Fu Chou, look at your daughter.

438
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,220
Her name is Nian.

439
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,620
She is a year old.

440
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,620
Hen Xiang, if you kill their son,

441
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,980
I can be sure to tell you
I will never forgive you!

442
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,540
I am warning you, Hen Xiang!

443
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,900
Lay down that dagger.

444
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,940
Chou.

445
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,180
You do share the same
trait as your father.

446
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,180
You are just as cruel as he is.

447
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,700
Qi.

448
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,300
Did you see that?

449
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,900
In face of desperate choices,

450
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,380
everyone can be selfish
and despicable.

451
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,060
Only you...

452
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,380
would rather betray your mother
and aid these outsiders!

453
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,540
Why aren't you saying anything?

454
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,500
Are you trying to defy me again?

455
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,140
Qi?

456
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,500
Qi?

457
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,860
Qi?

458
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,780
Say something to me!

459
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,300
I won't force you to do anything.

460
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,940
You can talk to me.

461
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,740
Say something to me.
Please!

462
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,540
Say something!

463
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,380
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

464
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:20,300
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

465
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:27,060
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

466
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:34,340
<i>The world is warm but
sincerity is easily gone.</i>

467
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,660
<i>My memories has evaporated and my
longing for you has turned to flowers.</i>

468
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,100
Brother Qi.

469
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,700
<i>The wind blows across my cheeks,
sending him away.</i>

470
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,500
I remember...

471
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,180
the desserts you once loved.

472
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,860
I made these desserts
specially for you.

473
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,100
I made these specially for you.

474
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,580
They are delicious.

475
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,660
Are you thinking about...

476
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,460
if the writings on this paper
are actually yours?

477
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,140
You liked my handwriting.

478
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,980
You often tried to copy me.

479
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,220
Your handwriting is getting better.

480
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,740
This is...

481
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,180
the jade pendant I have been
carrying since a child.

482
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,220
Carry it with you.

483
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,260
It will protect you...

484
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,300
while I am not around.

485
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,140
This is for you.

486
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,860
Brother Qi.

487
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,540
This statue you carved,
is it me?

488
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,220
Do you like it?

489
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,940
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

490
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,740
Press on this chord.

491
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,940
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

492
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,340
<i>The world is warm but
sincerity is easily gone.</i>

493
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,660
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

494
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,980
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

495
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:08,180
<i>It's inevitable that we part but
I just wish that it won't be so cruel.</i>

496
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,940
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>

497
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,580
Brother Qi?

498
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,620
Brother Qi?

499
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,860
Brother Qi?

500
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,020
Princess Rong Le.

501
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,780
Princess Rong Le,
you are finally awake.

502
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,380
Ke.

503
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,580
How long have I been asleep?

504
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,580
Just a while, about an hour or so.

505
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,780
Brother Qi, where is he now?

506
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,740
I mean the Emperor.

507
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,660
Ke.

508
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,340
Tell me.

509
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,020
Why does this medicine...

510
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,860
have the stench of blood?

511
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,780
Answer me.

512
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,940
Answer me!

513
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,100
Princess Rong Le,
stop asking me.

514
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,020
All you need to know...

515
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,140
is that you are cured
of the poisoning.

516
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,460
How did it happen?

517
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,740
You told me there was
only one way to cure this.

518
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,260
You said I have to transfuse the
poison to my child during the labour.

519
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,540
Was there any other way?

520
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,380
You found another tome?

521
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,740
What is this?
What is going on?

522
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,420
Tell me, Ke!
Tell me what happened!

523
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,940
Please, Princess Rong Le.
I can't tell you.

524
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Princess Rong Le, where are you going?

525
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,980
Princess Rong Le!

526
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,420
Fine, Princess Rong Le,
I will tell you.

527
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,820
Fu Yuan was once tormented
by the "Destined Poison".

528
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,500
In order to survive,

529
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,620
she transfused the poison
to her newborn son.

530
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,940
That is why His Majesty
had always been ill since young age.

531
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,500
He could only prolong his life
with medicine every month.

532
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,980
Which is why...

533
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,060
his blood contains the antidote
that will extend your life.

534
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,820
My master...

535
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,580
recorded another way to remove
the poison on another tome:

536
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,620
blood for blood,

537
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,900
a life...

538
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,940
for a life.
