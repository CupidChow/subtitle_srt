00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,380
Episode 40

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,300
Who are you calling
a bewitching woman?

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,460
Who are you?

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,700
How dare you talk back
to your superior?

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,780
I am the captain of
Lady Rong Le's bodyguard.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,540
I belong to her alone.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,580
Talking back to my superior?

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,340
You are not my superior.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,460
What rank does the bodyguard hold?

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,940
Besides,

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,980
she is not the real consort yet.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,820
Even if she does become one,

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,100
she has no right over the generals.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,380
You...

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,900
have no right to speak to me.

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,820
You are slandering
the name of Lady Rong Le.

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,380
I must defend Lady Rong Le's honour!

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,940
General Luo,

20
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,660
show some respect.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,900
You are quite the bold one.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,380
To protect the succubus,

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,020
you openly challenge
my patience on my feast.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,660
That vile woman seduces
His Highness with her charm.

25
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,260
And you...

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,900
got promoted because of a woman.

27
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,740
We are holding a feast for Luo Zhi
to welcome him.

28
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,500
Now that you use this move,

29
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,980
I might have to break
my promise with the officers.

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,900
This is just the first step.

31
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,140
I am trying to undermine his spirit.

32
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,060
Your Highness, Lady Rong Le,

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,740
General Luo and Captain Xiao
are fighting on the feast.

34
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,180
Is this the second step of your plan?

35
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,180
It's not part of the plan,

36
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,500
but this could be in our favour.

37
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Prince Li and Lady Rong Le arrive!

38
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,220
Greetings, Prince Li and Lady Rong Le.

39
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,460
I hear rumours about
her white hair.

40
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,980
I thought it was just a rumour.

41
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,780
It's actually true.

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,140
So that is why she is
hiding inside the manor...

43
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,140
and never show herself to the people.

44
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,340
Greetings, Prince Li.

45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,700
Lady Rong Le's hair is white.

46
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,380
This is amazing.

47
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Even with her white hair,
she won His Highness' heart.

48
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,700
She clearly has some skills up
in her sleeves.

49
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,020
The foods are getting cold.

50
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,820
Let them get up now.

51
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,700
At ease.

52
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,700
Much obliged, Prince Li and
Lady Rong Le.

53
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,380
General Luo and Captain Xiao.

54
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,500
You are in the middle of a feast.

55
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,740
Why are you holding swords?

56
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,820
Don't you know?
Except the Royal Army,

57
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,340
none of the officers can
bring weapon into this house.

58
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,620
I apologise.

59
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,740
I am willing to accept my punishment.

60
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,900
I was just itching for a challenge...

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,660
and wanted to test my skills
against Captain Xiao.

62
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,260
You are having a fight on
the feast His Highness holds for you.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
This is disrespectful to His Highness.

64
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,140
I do not care why
you got into a fight.

65
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,100
You made a mistake,

66
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,780
so you must be punished.

67
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,580
Guards.

68
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,140
Take General Luo and
Captain Xiao out of here.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,860
They will have 20 beatings each.

70
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,380
If you may, General Luo.

71
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,420
Please come with us, General Luo.

72
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Your Highness,
during the battle at the border,

73
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,460
General Luo showed his prowess
and led the army to triumph.

74
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,220
This feast is supposed
to celebrate his victory.

75
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,100
If you punish him,
that would be humiliating.

76
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,100
Please, do not punish General Luo.

77
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,260
I know.

78
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,020
The Luo Army has a strict discipline.

79
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,860
Punishment and reward
are given equally.

80
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,220
But just because the Luo Army
won a battle,

81
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,460
doesn't mean all the
mistake he makes...

82
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,220
can be overlooked.

83
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,940
General Luo returned victorious.

84
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,220
That was a job well done.

85
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,980
His Highness will reward him for that.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,300
But if he ignores the laws
because he won a battle,

87
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,460
no matter what feat you achieve,

88
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,260
it would be meaningless.

89
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,140
General Luo, will you accept
your punishment?

90
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Fine.

91
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,580
I disrupted His Highness' feast.

92
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,820
I startled Lady Rong Le.
I will accept my punishment.

93
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,020
But I will only accept punishment
from His Highness.

94
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,940
I will not be punished
by any other people.

95
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,740
You won't accept the
punishment from me?

96
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,740
-No!
-Why not?

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,100
I am a general.
I don't speak with courtesy.

98
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,180
There are something that might
hurt your feelings.

99
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,860
Please, do tell.

100
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,900
I will listen with open ears.

101
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,740
You just a woman.

102
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,940
You should do what a woman does.

103
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,980
You didn't carry out your duty
to accompany your husband,

104
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,220
instead, you walk around and
interfere with the national affair.

105
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,420
And now, you stood me up
on my feast for hours.

106
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,500
You came right in to punish me
and crush my morale.

107
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,060
I am the mighty General Luo
of the Luo Army.

108
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,700
Yet I was fooled around
by a mere woman!

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,260
Not to mention she is
a demon with white hair!

110
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,100
General Lou.
In the end,

111
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,700
you just won't admit your mistake...

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,620
because you disagree with my place.

113
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,540
You think that I am a woman...

114
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,220
who is incapable and
has no right to punish you?

115
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,100
In that case,

116
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,940
in order to convince you
of your mistake,

117
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,180
I have to impress you
with my capabilities.

118
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,740
Who do you have to impress me?

119
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,740
I heard you are great
at archery on horseback.

120
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,780
But we can't have a horse
running in here.

121
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,420
Archery shouldn't be a problem.

122
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,780
Please, show me what you have.

123
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,180
Guards, bring us two sets
of bow and arrows.

124
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,900
With all the officers and
His Highness as witnesses,

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
I challenge General Luo.

126
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
You are challenging me on archery?

127
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,900
You are biting off more
than you can chew.

128
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,460
I love a tough challenge.

129
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,780
Only by winning can I convince you.

130
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,260
I am the general of Luo Army.

131
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,580
Having an archery match with a lady...

132
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,780
will not bring me any glory
even if I win.

133
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,700
If this is too boring for you,

134
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,420
let's put in a wager.

135
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,100
With the bullseye as the mark,

136
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,220
the person who shoots
closer to the bullseye...

137
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,700
will win this match.

138
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,540
-If you win...
-If I win,

139
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,660
you will withdraw from the court
and never interfere again.

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,540
Then you will use
the Command Emblem as wager.

141
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,380
If you lose, the Luo Army...

142
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,380
will be mine to command.

143
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,620
Fine, you have a deal.

144
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,780
Don't be a crybaby when you lose.

145
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,500
It will be an awful sight.

146
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,820
Of course.

147
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,740
If I lose,

148
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,180
I will admit my defeat.

149
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,100
You'll go first, General Luo.

150
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,980
Great! Remarkable!

151
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,740
Great! That was amazing!

152
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,660
I am impressed by your
prowess in archery.

153
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,620
Just as I said.

154
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,460
You overestimated yourself.

155
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,300
The match is not over yet.

156
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,420
It's too early to tell
who will be the winner.

157
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,380
Guards.

158
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,620
What? Is she serious?

159
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,180
Is she being serious?

160
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,300
Do you admit your defeat?

161
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,620
Not a chance!

162
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,180
You lose, why won't
you admit the defeat?

163
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,700
If you shot first,

164
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,780
I would have made a better shot.
I want a rematch!

165
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,580
General Luo,
if this were the battlefield,

166
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
the enemy won't give you
another chance.

167
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,540
You are a general.

168
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,860
You should understand...

169
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,700
the duty on your shoulder.

170
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,300
What's cruel about the war...

171
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,100
is the difference of
defeat and victory.

172
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,380
What's done cannot be undone.

173
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,300
You lost today.

174
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,580
But all you lost is your pride.

175
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,900
If we were on the battlefield
and fighting against each other,

176
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,780
you would have lost
the whole Luo Army!

177
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,100
Do you know why you lost?

178
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,820
You made the greatest
mistake for a soldier.

179
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,660
You underestimate your opponent.

180
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,260
With my skill,
there is no way I can win.

181
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,540
But you were too
arrogant and confident.

182
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,940
You only use a third of your
strength for that shot.

183
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,460
As for me,

184
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,540
I used all my strength.

185
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,940
I lost.

186
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,180
I lost without any regret.

187
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,780
General Luo, you came back victorious.

188
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,980
I didn't get a chance
to congratulate you.

189
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,660
Let Madam Luo come in.

190
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,900
Mother!

191
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,380
Greetings, Your Highness
and Lady Rong Le.

192
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,300
Please, stand up.

193
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,580
You raised General Luo
into a fine warrior.

194
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,940
He did well in defending the border.

195
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,260
I am giving you this silk robe.

196
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,980
It carries my gratitude for you.
I hope you would like it.

197
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,380
Please, don't say that.

198
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,060
His Highness has
rewarded the Luo family.

199
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,660
I am already grateful.

200
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,860
I will surely appreciate this gift.

201
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,580
You insolent child.
Kneel down.

202
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,540
Mother, I let you down.
I lost the Command Emblem in a bet.

203
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,140
What?

204
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,660
Lady Rong Le.

205
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,540
Zhi's father hated gambling the most
when he was alive.

206
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,460
And this insolent son
used the emblem as a wager!

207
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,740
His action is such a
disgrace to the family.

208
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,940
I feel so ashamed by his action.

209
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,900
Seeing that General Luo
had too much drinks,

210
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,780
I pulled a prank on him.

211
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,100
The Luo Army is a crucial part
of our land.

212
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,300
And General Luo...

213
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,220
is a fine commander that
plays an important role.

214
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,420
The Command Emblem...

215
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,940
cannot be used so lightly as a wager.

216
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,980
Much thanks, Your Highness,
Lady Rong Le.

217
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,820
Zhi, show your gratitude now.

218
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,220
I believe General Luo...

219
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,940
will not let Prince Li
and I be disappointed.

220
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,060
I...

221
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,900
thank you for the mercy and kindness.

222
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,700
From now on,

223
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,340
the Luo Army is yours to command!

224
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,820
We will fight to our last breath
and at all cost!

225
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,980
It was a long match.
I am starving.

226
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,820
Let's start eating then.

227
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,620
Miss Sun.

228
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,300
Ya Li.

229
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,340
Ling Yue, what's wrong?

230
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,460
Lady Rong Le was kind enough
to let me stay here for the night.

231
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,260
You don't have to come here
to see me off.

232
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,620
Come.

233
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,340
Ling Yue, what happened?

234
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,220
Bad news, Ya Li.

235
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,100
Xiao Sha just told me.

236
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,060
General Luo has his eyes on you
on the feast last night.

237
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
He made a proposal
to His Highness to marry you!

238
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,020
A proposal?

239
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,980
You mean Luo Zhi did that?

240
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,180
Yes, it's the General Luo.

241
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,940
My father will never agree.

242
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
The Sun family is a noble bloodline.

243
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,380
None of the daughters were
married to commoner.

244
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,300
But His Highness agreed.

245
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,220
Ya Li, wait for me.

246
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,420
-Luo Zhi surprised me with his pick.
-Ya Li.

247
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,780
The army camp is his home.

248
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,500
He only ever saw Ya Li once.

249
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,740
And he came to me in private
to make a proposal.

250
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,220
This is the key moment
to execute our reformation plan.

251
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,860
Luo Zhi has command over the army.

252
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,860
If the Sun family becomes his in-laws,

253
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,700
our quest to undermine
the noble's influence...

254
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,580
might run into some troubles.

255
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,980
Normally,

256
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
I would disagree at once.

257
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,420
But Ya Li's marriage is at stake.

258
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,180
If she does has love for Luo Zhi,

259
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,980
there is no need to be
obsessed with our wild guess.

260
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,340
Perhaps...

261
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,740
she might get a
happy marriage after all.

262
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,780
Wu You, the reformation is important.

263
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,140
But Ya Li's marriage
is not expandable.

264
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,900
<i>Rong Le is trying to
marry me to General Luo?</i>

265
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,380
I could tell something
is off with Ya Li.

266
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,900
For the past year,

267
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,340
I am worried she might
feel too lonely.

268
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,780
She might start to be paranoid
after all the rumours.

269
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,860
Maybe Luo Zhi...

270
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,180
could bring some changes to her life.

271
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,060
<i>Did she...</i>

272
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,180
<i>Did she planned this all along?</i>

273
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,860
How about this?

274
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,500
Let me talk to her.

275
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,140
If she agrees,

276
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,100
there is no need to stop them.

277
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,660
If she disagrees,

278
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,020
we shouldn't worry too much.

279
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,620
Just turn Luo Zhi down.

280
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,860
A person's love...

281
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,820
cannot be manipulated so easily.

282
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,740
This is what I realised the most...

283
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
after I met you.

284
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,260
I was so fortunate.

285
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,740
After all the mistakes I made,

286
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,980
you are still here with me.

287
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,100
Ya Li.

288
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,380
Don't blame Lady Rong Le.
She is just...

289
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,620
Ling Yue.

290
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,380
Look at this.

291
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,820
I am not like you.

292
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,620
I am not one of the lucky ones.

293
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,660
I don't even have the chance.

294
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,340
You know?

295
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,820
When I learned that
you found your true love,

296
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,380
when I see Prince Li and Lady Rong Le,

297
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,900
my heart is so...

298
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,340
Why?

299
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,140
Why am I the only one
who can't make a choice?

300
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,100
Ya Li, I understand how you feel.

301
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,780
It's not that you
don't have the chance,

302
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,540
it's just that you missed it.

303
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,060
But remember,

304
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,540
when you meet someone
you can rely on...

305
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,940
and you are willing to
give him all your love,

306
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,140
you must hold onto the chance.

307
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,580
Love with all your courage.

308
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,180
Do not let go of the chance.

309
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,220
Even if I hold onto him,

310
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,580
will he ever become mine?

311
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,940
Of course.

312
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,420
You are such a nice girl.

313
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,020
You have your hands around him,
he can't get away.

314
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,620
Fine, stop hesitating
or worrying about it.

315
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,980
If you want something,
you need to work hard to get it.

316
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,100
But in the process of fighting for it,

317
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,140
if you face some setback
or anything unfair,

318
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,140
you must fight back.

319
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,100
Ya Li, listen to me.

320
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,340
As a weakling,

321
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,900
you are destined to have nothing.

322
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,860
You will always be hurt and be used.

323
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,060
Do you understand?

324
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,900
I thought this is about secrecy
and learn the people's life.

325
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,060
It's hard enough to
go out in disguise.

326
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,460
And now you are messing around.

327
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,940
Even the officers have seen you.

328
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,100
You need not fear the people.

329
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,900
I don't care what they say about you.

330
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,180
Don't be bothered by gossips.

331
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,780
Steamed cake for sales!

332
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,540
Steamed cake for sales!

333
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,660
Sir, have a cake for your wife.

334
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,260
-Sure.
-Here you go.

335
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
It has mashed dates and
brown sugar as filling.

336
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,180
I wish you stay sweet and loving.

337
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,940
Sweet and loving.

338
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
Thank you.

339
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,340
Sir, you are paying too much.

340
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,820
Sir, we are buying all of your cakes.

341
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,740
Please, send these cakes
to the refugee camp.

342
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,220
The wind is getting stronger
and the weather has gone cold.

343
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,820
Go home and get some rest.

344
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,420
Thank you, sir and madam.

345
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,260
You have such a kind heart.

346
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,700
I can go home earlier...

347
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,260
and listen to some stories
at the Serene Hill Inn.

348
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,340
Have a nice day.

349
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,100
I heard a lot of people
are going to the Serene Hill Inn.

350
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,780
Indeed, I go there every day.

351
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,420
The story is about
the Silver-Hair Demon.

352
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,140
You mean the story about
Silver-Hair Demon?

353
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,900
Right, the story went on for days,
it's getting more exciting.

354
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,980
-Is there really such demon?
-Let's go.

355
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,980
We need to be there
before the seats run out.

356
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,300
-Have some tea.
-Thank you.

357
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,980
This way, please.

358
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,780
-Please.
-Waiter, get some hot water.

359
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,340
I heard this is the most
famous teahouse in Qingzhou.

360
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,900
I never thought there would
so many people here.

361
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,340
It's quite different from the
graceful Moon Embrace.

362
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,980
Madam, are you from Zhongshan?

363
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,980
When I was on a business trip there,

364
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,420
I went to the teahouse
because of its fame.

365
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,340
The premise may be there,

366
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,180
but no one is there to welcome us.

367
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,860
I heard the teahouse is owned
by the Prince Regent.

368
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,180
Now, he is the only person...

369
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,220
goes there and sits
in silence for hours.

370
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,620
What a waste of good tea.

371
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
Come, have some tea.

372
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,980
The bard is here.

373
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,180
He is here.

374
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,860
Gentlemen,

375
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,980
we will continue the story...

376
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,540
of the Silver-Hair Demon.

377
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,300
The Silver-Hair Demon...

378
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,580
is the incarnation of a white vixen
after years of meditation.

379
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,300
It uses its charm to
seduce the heart of man.

380
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,260
It came out of nowhere
and bring chaos to the land...

381
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,460
and spends its time
around those with power.

382
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,580
This filthy creature is
the bringer of disorder.

383
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,380
The nation falls because of her
and there will be pandemonium.

384
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,100
War will ravage the land,
the people lives in flame.

385
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,060
I heard the wife of Prince Li
is a lady with white hair.

386
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,820
You mean her?

387
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,540
Gentleman,

388
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,540
something is better left unsaid.

389
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,020
Otherwise...

390
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,500
your head might end up being chopped.

391
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,060
I was right?

392
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,420
The Silver-Hair Demon
is Consort Rong Le?

393
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,180
She is not a consort yet.

394
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,060
Prince Li simply accept her
into the palace.

395
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,700
They are not married yet.

396
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,300
What is so odd about this?

397
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,780
What trouble could a lady cause?

398
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,460
You said she brings chaos,
do you mind explaining that?

399
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,220
Right, enlighten us.

400
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,300
-Come on, tell us.
-The Silver-Hair Demon...

401
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,660
is destined to be a evil entity...

402
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,020
and bring disaster to the world.

403
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,500
Maybe the earthquake at Zhuo...

404
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,020
is the disaster caused by the demon!

405
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,660
I heard that not only
does it drink blood,

406
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,940
-it eat brains too!
-Mother, I am scared.

407
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,940
If you don't behave,

408
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,180
the demon will suck your blood too.

409
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,660
Nonsense.

410
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,540
Prince Li is ever so benevolent.

411
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,380
He can't be seduced by the demon.

412
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,580
Right, I don't believe it either.

413
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Prince Li executed the reformation
and improved our life.

414
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,180
And you are slandering him
with rumours about a demon.

415
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
That is right.

416
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,660
If Prince Li is being
charmed by the demon,

417
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,820
he would have spent his days
in the arms of demon.

418
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,700
He will have no time for the people.

419
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,300
Prince Li is wise and brave,

420
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,540
there is no way he will
fall in love with the demon.

421
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,940
This bard is clearly trying to
stain His Highness' reputation.

422
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,700
-He is right!
-The bard is telling the truth.

423
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,500
You are just being ridiculous.

424
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,700
-Yes, you are being unbelievable!
-Miss, can I have this?

425
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,020
Of course.

426
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,300
Stop running around,
go back to your mother.

427
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,780
You are clearly spreading lies!

428
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,260
The bard is telling the truth!

429
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,060
-Nonsense!
-Lies!

430
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,660
Silence, gentlemen.

431
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,740
The story of the Silver-Hair Demon
is not over yet.

432
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,820
We will continue the story.

433
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,140
That Silver-Hair Demon...

434
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,780
She is...

435
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,100
She is the Silver-Hair Demon!

436
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,540
-Demon!
-Silver-Hair Demon!

437
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,660
Silver-Hair Demon!

438
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,540
She is just a child,
don't hurt her!

439
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,980
Man Yao, are you all right?

440
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,420
Your Highness.

441
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,660
Xiang Ying?

442
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,980
Princess Rong Le.

443
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,820
Your Highness,
I should have come sooner.

444
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,180
Lock this man up
and interrogate him.

445
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,580
Take him to the cell.

446
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,700
I shall leave now.

447
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,940
We cannot stay here.

448
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,620
We should leave.

449
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,460
Xiang Ying.

450
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,180
It must have been a
tough year for you.

451
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,820
Since you are in Qingzhou,

452
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,620
you can stay with us
if you have no place to go.

453
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,340
You can still be my
personal bodyguard.

454
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,300
I thank you for the offer.

455
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,420
I got used to the easy life.

456
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,220
I wander the land,
free from all worries.

457
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,220
I don't wish to have
my old life back.

458
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,260
Please, forgive me.

459
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,260
In that case,

460
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,300
I won't force you.

461
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,780
You were here for so long...

462
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,260
but you never came to me.

463
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,900
Perhaps that is the reason.

464
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,980
I am glad we meet again.

465
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,540
We meet because of fate.

466
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,860
But it is not a coincidence.

467
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,060
I went to the teahouse
about two weeks ago,

468
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,940
I heard the nonsensical
story of that bard.

469
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,540
I had my suspicion so I went there
for the next few days.

470
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,620
But I couldn't get any solid evidence.

471
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,100
I was surprised...

472
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,460
they actually waited
for you to go there.

473
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Your Highness.

474
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,700
I have searched the Serene Hill Inn.

475
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,980
We didn't find anything suspicious.

476
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,140
This is not your fault.

477
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,540
The mastermind must have
planned this for a long time.

478
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,380
They won't leave
any evidence behind.

479
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,620
That bard had a poison pill
in his mouth.

480
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,420
His Highness reacted fast enough to
stop him from killing himself.

481
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,340
That waiter even gave up
his own life...

482
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,900
just to frame Princess Rong Le.

483
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,260
I think this could be the doing
of Creed of vengeance.

484
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,420
I don't think the Creed did this.

485
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,020
They have been hunting me
since I left Princess Rong Le.

486
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,380
But three months ago,
the Creed disappeared.

487
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,900
The Creed disappeared?

488
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,620
I took the risk and
returned to Zhongshan.

489
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,380
The Eastern Suburb Inn is sealed off.

490
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,060
General Fu is now the Prince Regent.

491
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,420
He has all the attention.

492
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,260
Maybe he wishes to wipe
away the past, just like me.

493
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,460
However,

494
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,500
not only did the incident
framed Man Yao into a murderer,

495
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,700
the true motive of the mastermind...

496
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,140
is to sway the people
that don't know the truth...

497
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,620
into hating Man Yao...

498
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,140
and all who follow me.

499
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,660
If we lost the people's trust in us,

500
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,180
it might not bode well for the
progress of our reformation.

501
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,820
Troops of Northern Realm were
defeated by General Luo and his men.

502
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,180
They suffer a loss of morale.

503
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,180
Could they have infiltrated our land
to strike from the dark?

504
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,660
The mastermind knows well
about the south.

505
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,860
If they are really working
with the Northern Realm,

506
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,700
The consequences of the rumours...

507
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,420
will be even greater.

508
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,060
Leng Yan, you need to follow
the tracks of the rumour.

509
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,580
Pay attention to the officers' contact
with the Northern Realm.

510
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,660
Consider it done.

511
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,780
Your Highness,
let's return to the palace.

512
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,900
Your Highness.

513
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,460
Come, watch your steps.

514
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,540
Watch out.

515
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,740
We need to find the Blood Raven Root
before sunset.

516
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,780
We've searched for days
and this is a huge place.

517
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,300
There is no one around.

518
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,060
We don't even know
if this is Youji Mountain.

519
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,660
There is a rock there.

520
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,820
Ke, have a break.

521
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,460
Come on, Uncle.

522
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,780
So,

523
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,980
could the Blood Raven Root
be up there?

524
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,780
This cliff is barren.

525
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,020
Nothing grows here.

526
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,660
How could the devine herb grows here?

527
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,140
I will go and take a look.

528
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,540
Ke, slow down.
Take it easy!

529
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,060
Don't worry, I am used to doing this.

530
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,460
It should be me that goes first.

531
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,220
Thanks.

532
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,020
Are you all right?

533
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,900
I am fine.

534
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,980
Ke, are you all right?

535
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,340
I am fine.

536
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,620
It's you again.

537
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,660
Who are you?

538
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,380
I am a hunter from the downhill.

539
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
You mean someone else
came here before?

540
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,380
Yes, a bunch of people
came here last month.

541
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,860
They searched the woods for days.

542
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,540
What were they searching for?

543
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,260
It's the precious herb
that grows on the cliff.

544
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,180
Before this, we couldn't
reach the herbs that grows there.

545
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,980
That man was amazing.

546
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,140
He somehow got up to the cliff.

547
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,260
He even plucked the herb himself.

548
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,500
What was the herb?
Was is the Blood Raven Root?

549
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,620
I don't know what that is.

550
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,540
Anyway, it was bright red in colour...

551
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,820
and surrounded by thorns.
It's right on the cliff.

552
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
It's the Blood Raven Root.

553
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,820
Do you remember what
that man looked like?

554
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,820
I didn't get a good look.
I have work to do, so long.

555
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,660
We were too late.

556
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,220
We have to go home empty-handed.

557
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,300
This is strange.

558
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,500
Normal people don't need
the Blood Raven Root.

559
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,260
We need human blood
to feed the herb...

560
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,980
to make the hair dark again.

561
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,260
It will have a great impact
on the feeder's health.

562
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,100
No normal people would want this herb.

563
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,340
Who could have taken it?

564
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,140
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

565
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,500
<i>Our hearts are lifetime apart.</i>

566
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,700
<i>No one was here for us.</i>

567
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,180
<i>How to we keep living this life?</i>

568
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,860
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

569
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,020
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

570
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,740
This tastes good,
eat all you want.

571
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,580
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

572
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,140
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

573
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,460
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

574
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,700
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

575
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,660
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

576
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,260
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

577
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,660
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

578
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,820
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

579
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,540
<i>Our fate is intertwined
and I can't let go.</i>

580
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,780
<i>I must preserve the memories
that are wonderful.</i>

581
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,220
<i>I can't let you know how lonely I was.</i>

582
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,820
<i>This brings us to this stalemate.</i>

583
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,740
<i>I made this mistake...</i>

584
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,340
<i>because I was too selfish.</i>

585
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,420
<i>I walk in a desert,
but my heart is being flooded.</i>

586
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,700
<i>My heart is beating senselessly.</i>

587
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,980
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

588
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,420
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

589
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,700
<i>I asked for too much,
I hesitated for too long.</i>

590
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,020
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

591
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,260
<i>You were standing right behind me,</i>

592
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,620
<i>mocking the promise I made for you.</i>

593
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,100
<i>I must give it all I had...</i>

594
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,340
<i>to accept the lies of affection.</i>

595
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,540
This really is the Blood Raven Root.

596
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,780
<i>It never ends, love will fade.</i>

597
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,380
<i>The blossoms fall,
and I waited in silence.</i>

598
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,940
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

599
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,300
Your Highness.

600
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,260
Come in.

601
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,820
Your Highness.

602
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,460
The Empress Dowager asked
for you many times.

603
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,340
Your Highness should
return to the palace.

604
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,500
You have been in the army
for the past year.

605
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,300
Victory is finally yours today.

606
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,660
The officers are holding a feast
in the royal palace.

607
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,020
They are waiting for your return.

608
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,460
You took good care of this place.

609
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,900
The Tranquil Garden
hasn't change at all.

610
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,100
I followed your order.

611
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,020
I sent my men to clean up
the place every day.

612
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,300
Same goes for the
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

613
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,820
However,

614
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,940
there is no one there.

615
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,340
Everything has changed.

616
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,540
Let's head back.

617
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,980
How is my mother?

618
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,940
Is she still suffering
from the sickness?

619
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,620
She takes her medicine
on time every day.

620
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,860
After the treatment,
her condition has improved a lot.

621
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,980
She hasn't had any relapse recently.

622
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,380
It looks like her hysterical
psychosis is cured.

623
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,500
But she refuses to live in
the palace for recovery.

624
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,500
She insists to stay
in the Cold Palace.

625
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,860
Was it Senyan Palace?

626
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,980
Yes, I tried talking to her.

627
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,540
But she refuses to leave.

628
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,100
So I ordered my men
to renovate Senyan Palace.

629
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,780
Right, any reports from the south?
