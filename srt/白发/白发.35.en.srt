00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:32,808
Episode 35

3
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,702
You arbitrarily expanded
the army under your control.

4
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:37,414
By placing your army here today,

5
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:40,597
your intention to usurp power
and revolt is as clear as day.

6
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,891
How could you face those soldiers
who have followed you so loyally...

7
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,777
and the people of Northern Ream who
have trusted and respected you?

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
General Fu.

9
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,169
-Where's your conscience?
-Where's my conscience?

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,602
Today, I'm not afraid to say that...

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I have a clear conscience towards...

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,640
every people in the Northern Realm.

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,920
I would like to ask you instead.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
When I'm fighting in the battlefield,

15
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:08,955
what contributions have you
given for them?

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,330
Now, you claimed that you've
put down the rebellion...

17
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,743
in southern fringe as a prince.

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,386
Do you think that by doing so,

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,685
you can shadowed
the world with your merits...

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,834
and you can plead on
the people's behalf?

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,291
I don't care at all...

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,040
about your opinion on me.

23
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,327
Since you've no regrets about
the crime that you've committed,

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,837
I've brought along my army
to the palace.

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,175
I'm going to get rid of a traitor
like you with ill intention...

26
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:42,590
for those innocent people and
soldiers who were sacrificed...

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,882
in the southern fringe rebellion and
for my father who had died in vain.

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,779
Looks like you are going
to take the position...

29
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:51,517
as crown prince by force.

30
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,751
But I am different from you.

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,747
After all these years, I'm already
sick of all those slaughtering.

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,148
Of course, I believe that...

33
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:04,122
you are not willing to sacrifice your
soldiers from southern fringe too.

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
-Guard.
-Yes, General.

35
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,499
-Bring my wife here.
-Yes, General.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,717
<i>Man Yao.</i>

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
From the way you look,

38
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:02,220
are you going to take away
my wife again today?

39
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:04,466
How about you take a guess.

40
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,412
Do you think I'll let you
succeed today?

41
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,844
If you really treat her as your wife,

42
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,959
you won't drag her into
such dangerous situation.

43
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:13,809
It's not up to you or me to decide.

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,320
It's entirely up to her.

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,814
Are you willing to marry me?

46
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,609
I'm willing.

47
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,194
The daughter of Central Secretary,
Sun Ya Li...

48
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,103
is virtuous and pure.

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,052
She is very affectionate towards me...

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,499
and cares for me.

51
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,454
So, I've decided that after today,

52
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm going to take her as wife.

53
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,347
And I vow that...

54
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:53,023
she'll be my only wife in this life.

55
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,139
I won't have another ever again.

56
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,336
You won't divorce with
Man Yao so easily.

57
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,133
Where is she?

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
Prince Li,

59
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:09,690
since you are so caring about
the woman that I've thrown away,

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,560
I'll give this woman to you.

61
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,121
Let's see if you are willing
to accept this gift.

62
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
What did you do to her?

63
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,853
She is poisoned by...

64
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,602
Scorpion Toxin.

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,849
Those who are poisoned...

66
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:51,374
will suffer as if their whole bodies
are burnt by wild fire.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,395
It will call upon her deepest hatred.

68
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,265
Her mind will freeze
as if it is encased in ice.

69
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
As soon as it freezes,

70
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,222
the mind will be swallowed by hatred.

71
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,158
She will lose all conscience.

72
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,637
I suggest you to hold
yourself back first.

73
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,980
Since I've already made my promise,
I won't go back on my words.

74
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,624
If you act recklessly again,

75
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:08,953
the only thing you will get
is a dead body.

76
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,232
Retreat.

77
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
So, you kept her by your side...

78
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,760
just to use her to threaten me today.

79
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,050
Not only you are not worthy
to be the General of Defence,

80
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,270
you are not worthy to be
called a man as well.

81
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,814
You don't dare to
fight me face-to-face.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,680
Instead, you torture an innocent lady.

83
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,557
Today, it is not me or Man Yao...

84
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,198
who lose our faces in public.

85
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,670
It's you.

86
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,173
You are a despicable
and cunning low life.

87
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,800
You still don't understand.

88
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,539
Do you know who's the one...

89
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,160
that caused all of these?

90
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,631
When I marry Rong Le, I've never
thought of using her to threaten you.

91
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,600
It'll turn out like this today...

92
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:20,949
because of you.

93
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,720
You kidnapped her on our wedding day.

94
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,563
And you admitted in public...

95
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,071
that you had amorous past
with Rong Le.

96
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:30,779
Then, you took her away...

97
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,520
and locked her in Yun's Tomb
for three days and three nights.

98
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:37,170
Later on, you repeatedly barged into
my manor to take her away by force.

99
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:38,910
Prince Li.

100
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,680
When you took all of
those unscrupulous actions,

101
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,555
you should have known that...

102
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,080
as his husband,

103
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,152
this is how I'm going to treat her
for your action.

104
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,073
The endless sufferings that I had...

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
and the pain that
Rong Le is in today...

106
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,477
are caused single-handedly by you,
Zongzheng Wu You.

107
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,145
Now, she is poisoned
with Scorpion Toxin.

108
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,880
She has only one hour left.

109
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,874
If she doesn't consume the cure
in an hour's time,

110
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:12,287
then you'll have to watch
while she dies in pain.

111
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,000
As long as you promise...

112
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
not to harm the innocent lives of the
southern fringe soldiers behind me...

113
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:33,117
and are willing to give me the cure,

114
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:34,867
I can...

115
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,109
give you my life.

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Wu You.

117
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
You can't do that.

118
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,195
I don't want to take their lives
and I don't want yours either.

119
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
What I want...

120
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,407
What I want is for you...

121
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
to kneel and surrender to me.

122
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
Wu You, you can't surrender.

123
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,080
-Man Yao, no!
-Wu You!

124
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,920
You can't be Rong Le.

125
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,858
You are not Rong Le.

126
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:24,054
Hen Xiang.

127
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:26,673
Are you trying to ruin
my plan again, right?

128
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,299
Looks like you are really
going to betray me.

129
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,204
If that's the case,

130
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,697
I won't show mercy to you either.

131
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Hen Xiang, listen to me carefully.

132
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,718
If you act recklessly again,

133
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,000
I will make you feel like death
is a better option.

134
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,824
General Fu, no matter
what mistakes she did,

135
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,938
she was still your wife once.

136
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,364
Now, she had endured such sufferings.

137
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,585
Any wrongs she did
should have already been forgiven.

138
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Princess Rong Le once
treated me as her friend.

139
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm in debt with Prince Li as well.

140
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,108
If you really have me in your heart,

141
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,816
you'll let go of them for me.

142
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,975
You once told me that...

143
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,215
you'll stand by my side forever.

144
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,920
But you plead for them today.

145
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,990
If I let go of them today,
do you think that...

146
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,720
they'll let go of me in the future?

147
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,121
Sun Ya Li.

148
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,133
Do you wish to see me...

149
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,003
falling into the abyss as well?

150
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,371
Guards.

151
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:54,117
-Bring her away.
-Yes, General.

152
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,837
Zongzheng Wu You.
Let me remind you again.

153
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:07,781
One hour's time is almost up.

154
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,128
Are you going to surrender or not?

155
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Wu You.

156
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Wu Yu.

157
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,862
Remember what I told you today.

158
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,920
No matter what happened,

159
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
don't disobey me.

160
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,040
Promise me.

161
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,440
If things go wrong today,

162
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,542
the lives of the soldiers and
the people will be your priority.

163
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:41,921
Keep your strength.

164
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:45,141
Wu You, I promise you.

165
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,040
Yes, Wu You.

166
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Today, we are here to
settle our old scores.

167
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,800
I'll bear it alone.

168
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,271
Wu Yu has neither grievance
nor rancour against you.

169
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,720
I believe that you won't
make things difficult for him.

170
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,046
What I want is for you...

171
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,508
to kneel and surrender to me.

172
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,680
-Leng Yan.
-Yes, Your Highness.

173
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,907
Bring Prince Chen away.

174
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,160
Yes, Your Highness.

175
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440
Prince Chen.

176
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
Wu You.

177
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,720
I'll take my leave now.

178
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,896
<i>No!</i>

179
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,365
<i>Don't, Wu You!</i>

180
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,693
<i>I rather die!</i>

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,320
<i>Man Yao.</i>

182
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:05,207
<i>Please forgive me for
my wayward way once more.</i>

183
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,400
I...

184
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,001
surrender.

185
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,468
This is the only bottle of cure
that can save Rong Le.

186
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,320
Zongzheng Wu You.

187
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,656
You've always been arrogant and proud.

188
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,902
You've never respected anybody else.

189
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:55,097
But today, you have to
kneel and scrape below me.

190
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:59,246
I want you to remember that
you are defeated by me.

191
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,040
And you'll always be defeated by me.

192
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,326
Man Yao.

193
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,128
It's alright now.

194
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,683
It's alright now.

195
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,418
Man Yao, it's me.

196
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,008
I am Wu You.

197
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,815
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

198
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,320
Report!

199
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,861
General Fu.
After Prince Chen left,

200
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,397
the army from southern fringe has
retreated to south in midst of chaos.

201
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,657
And they are protected by warriors
of martial arts. We can't stop them.

202
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,258
General, Lady Rong Le is gone.

203
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,106
We've searched the whole manor.

204
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,121
And we've searched Prince Chen's
and Prince Li's Manor as well.

205
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,760
But we saw no sign of her.

206
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,231
<i>My memories has evaporated and my
longing for you has turned to flowers.</i>

207
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,461
<i>The flowers are falling one by one
with longing in every flower.</i>

208
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,604
<i>The wind blows across my cheeks,
sending him away.</i>

209
00:17:55,073 --> 00:18:01,052
<i>I just hope that at least
one of us can turn Gray.</i>

210
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,500
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

211
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:16,822
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

212
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,546
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

213
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,348
Wu You!

214
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,863
<i>Who said that the world
is flourishing?</i>

215
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,226
<i>There are greed and jealousy and
people's hearts are unpredictable.</i>

216
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:04,219
<i>You'll get nothing even if you can
find out about the truth.</i>

217
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,980
<i>I just hope that at least
one of us can turn Gray.</i>

218
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,475
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

219
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:26,345
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

220
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,946
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

221
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:39,154
<i>The world is warm but
sincerity is easily gone.</i>

222
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,560
Rong Le!

223
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,560
Save him.

224
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,299
I asked you to save him.
Do you hear me?

225
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,996
Save him!

226
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:23,463
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

227
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,780
<i>The world is warm
but sincerity is easily gone.</i>

228
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,749
If he dies,

229
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,840
I won't live as well.

230
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,326
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is hurting.</i>

231
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:48,739
<i>It's inevitable that we part but
I just wish that it won't be so cruel.</i>

232
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,369
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>

233
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,880
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>

234
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,548
<i>Sorrow and joy.</i>

235
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,633
<i>I'm torn between the two.</i>

236
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,229
<i>When affections...</i>

237
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,624
<i>and passion...</i>

238
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,858
<i>have burnt off with the good,</i>

239
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,633
<i>I know that we can't go back anymore.
I know that I have to leave you.</i>

240
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,047
<i>Ignorant is bliss.</i>

241
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,976
<i>The sound of flute from my memory
reminds me of the love we have.</i>

242
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,392
<i>When have it changed until
you no longer love me anymore.</i>

243
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,901
<i>I'm the one who made you leave me.</i>

244
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,094
<i>It's the ultimate goal that
I'm trying to achieve.</i>

245
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,402
If you could have done it earlier,

246
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,920
you won't have to suffer that much.

247
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,078
<i>They will stop and wait for you.</i>

248
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,370
<i>I can saw you turning
your back towards me.</i>

249
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,742
<i>I weep for the good times
we had that was broken.</i>

250
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,560
<i>I have so many memories of you
but it'll never be enough.</i>

251
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,697
Your Majesty,
take the medicine, quick.

252
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,000
Your Majesty.

253
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,398
<i>Where can I find the past you?</i>

254
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,766
<i>I'm the one who made you leave me.</i>

255
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:30,155
<i>It's the ultimate goal that
I'm trying to achieve.</i>

256
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:37,342
<i>When the cloud and the rain
hears about your life,</i>

257
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,873
<i>even they will stop and wait for you.</i>

258
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,121
<i>I can saw you turning
your back towards me.</i>

259
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,840
<i>I weep for the good times
we had that was broken.</i>

260
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:03,019
<i>I have so memories of you
but it'll never be enough.</i>

261
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,992
<i>The pain is unbearable.</i>

262
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,835
<i>I tried to capture you
but I've broken your wings.</i>

263
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,541
<i>This is the destiny that
I have no power to stop.</i>

264
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,547
<i>But even with my destiny,</i>

265
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,314
<i>Rong Le.</i>

266
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,279
<i>The cure in the dessert...</i>

267
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:35,403
<i>will keep you save for one year.</i>

268
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,821
<i>But I...</i>

269
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,552
<i>want to keep you save forever.</i>

270
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,908
<i>I promise you that I'll stop
after everything is done.</i>

271
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,318
<i>If you are willing to
believe in this world again,</i>

272
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:03,570
<i>please remember that...</i>

273
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,686
<i>I once loved you.</i>

274
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,452
As imperial physician, you still can't
determine her illness after so long.

275
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,240
What do I need you for?

276
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:32,308
General Fu, Lady Rong Le has
contacted a very poisonous toxin.

277
00:25:32,437 --> 00:25:34,988
Although it has been neutralised,
her body is heavily damaged.

278
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:36,265
This is inevitable.

279
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,752
Get along with it then! Quick!

280
00:26:18,238 --> 00:26:19,525
What should I do?

281
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,591
It's not supposed to be you.
I've asked Hen Xiang...

282
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,994
I've asked Hen Xiang
to take your place.

283
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,534
Why did it become the real you?

284
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,680
What should I do?

285
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,408
Atone for my sin.

286
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:51,622
The only thing I can do for the rest
of my life is to atone for my sin.

287
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,986
I need to atone for my sin.

288
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,239
General Fu, we still have
important things to do.

289
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:02,985
General Fu.

290
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:05,292
General Fu.

291
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,290
Important things.

292
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,641
Important things.

293
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,340
Chang Jian.

294
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:19,060
Chang Jian.

295
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,413
Chang Jian!
What are the important things?

296
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:23,714
Tell me!
What are the important things?

297
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,391
Chang Jian, I've replaced
Rong Le with Hen Xiang.

298
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,164
Why did it become
the real Rong Le? Why?

299
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,634
Why?

300
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:58,696
Quick.

301
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,080
-Quick!
-Your Highness, General Fu is outside.

302
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,300
Good.

303
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:08,179
Good. General Fu didn't
disappoint me after all.

304
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,533
Call him in!

305
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,781
Come in, General of Defence, Fu Chou.

306
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,163
General Fu!

307
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,173
General Fu.

308
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,346
General Fu.

309
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:37,651
General Fu. You are indeed
the pillar of Northern Realm,

310
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,094
the right-hand man that I rely on.

311
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:43,164
Don't worry.
I'll have a feast for the army.

312
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,099
And I'll reward them accordingly.

313
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,603
Come here.

314
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,040
General Fu.

315
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,520
Pass on my order.

316
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Add ten thousand soldiers to guard
the inside and outside of the palace.

317
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,160
Nobody can go out without my decree.

318
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,850
Besides, get me
ten thousands archers...

319
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,748
to surround the whole Zhongshan city.

320
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,505
If there's any suspicious or
unidentifiable people, kill them.

321
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:07,786
-Yes, General!
-Good. Get on with it then!

322
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:11,064
Great! General Fu.

323
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:13,011
You are indeed a
brilliant strategist.

324
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,018
You've turned danger into safety,
my great general.

325
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:17,451
Chang Jian!

326
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,240
General Fu.

327
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,910
Crown Prince...

328
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:32,455
is traitorous, fatuous
and incompetent.

329
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,891
He sells titles and ranks in secret...

330
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:36,783
and causes disorder in the court.

331
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,330
These are...

332
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,578
the evidences of your crime.

333
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,160
The late emperor had asked you
to hold the fort.

334
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:53,301
But you indulged in having fun and
slacked off with the court's affair.

335
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,919
That's why it will turn out
like this today.

336
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:58,681
The crimes that you had
committed are endless.

337
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,429
You should be punished to death.

338
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:01,886
Guards.

339
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:03,216
Yes, General.

340
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,475
Lock the Crown Prince up
in the Eastern Palace...

341
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,757
-and wait for further orders.
-Roger that.

342
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
Nonsense!

343
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:16,315
What nonsense!

344
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:19,181
Nonsense! Fu Chou!

345
00:30:19,927 --> 00:30:21,447
How dare you!

346
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:24,362
A low life! A traitor!

347
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,763
You've pushed me into
a trap that you've laid out!

348
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,160
Release me!

349
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:31,633
I am the Crown Prince.
This is my country!

350
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:35,108
Wait.

351
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:39,261
Your action is quite
inappropriate here, General Fu.

352
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,800
Even if the Crown Prince
has made a lot of mistakes,

353
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:44,202
we are still his subjects.

354
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,519
This...

355
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,295
You asked me what rights do I have.

356
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:56,317
I have the rights...

357
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:59,299
because I am the son of
the late empress, Fu Yuan.

358
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,840
-Son of Fu Yuan?
-Is that so?

359
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,367
Is that so?

360
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,040
According the rule of the ancestors,

361
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,800
the eldest son of the empress
will be the true Crown Prince.

362
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:14,763
If my mother wasn't banished from
the palace because of some traitors,

363
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:18,120
you wouldn't be
the Crown Prince today.

364
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:19,797
You...

365
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:21,762
Nonsense!

366
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,477
There are no proof.

367
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:24,885
Fu Chou.

368
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:27,351
How dare you pretend to be
the son of the royalty.

369
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,470
How bold of you!

370
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:32,633
You are just a traitor. You...

371
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:36,029
You are just a traitor!

372
00:31:36,237 --> 00:31:39,209
-Release me!
-Since all officials are here today,

373
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,844
I'll make things clear.

374
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:44,718
I'm the son of the late empress,
Fu Yuan.

375
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:47,853
The Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal
will prove that.

376
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:50,805
When the late emperor
enthroned the empress,

377
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,826
he told the world that...

378
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:56,297
the eldest son of my mother will be
given the title Crown Prince...

379
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,719
and become the
successor to the throne.

380
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,664
And it's a promise not to be changed.

381
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:02,966
Fake.

382
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:06,377
Fake! Those are fake!

383
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:09,451
Fake.

384
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,360
After verifying them,

385
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,304
the Golden Scroll and
Phoenix Seal are real.

386
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,334
-But...
-But?

387
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,840
But what?

388
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,177
If Sir Yang can't speak it out,
let me do it then.

389
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:50,962
Everybody knows that Empress Fu
and her son had passed away.

390
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:54,829
His Majesty had told us himself.
All of us here are witness to that.

391
00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:58,156
General Fu. You have the
Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal.

392
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:01,563
But they can't prove that
you are of royal blood.

393
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,897
That's right.
You are a fake.

394
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,032
Fu Chou, how bold you are.

395
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,080
How dare you pretend to be
the son of a royalty!

396
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,360
Guards, arrest him!

397
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,248
Arrest him!

398
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,981
From time immemorial, a traitor...

399
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:18,843
will never work alone.

400
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:21,113
He will have accomplice from the...

401
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,373
inside and outside of
the palace and the court.

402
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:24,987
Sir Lin.

403
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,569
If I remember correctly,

404
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:29,397
when my mother was still alive,

405
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:32,711
she was protective towards you
and she doted on you.

406
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:35,818
You are a second-rank officials.

407
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:37,553
When my mother was accused wrongly,

408
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,960
you didn't step up to defend her.

409
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:41,338
I don't blame you for that.

410
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:45,063
Because I understand that
as subjects, we need to play safe.

411
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:46,889
But now,

412
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:48,551
I've endured so much hardship...

413
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,189
to return to my rightful family with
the Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal.

414
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,160
And here you are,
trying so hard to stop me.

415
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:56,727
Did Zongzheng Wu You
promise you anything in return?

416
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,541
Or do you think that
Zongzheng Wu You...

417
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:02,366
will return to this court?

418
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:04,785
-Don't sling mud at me.
-Guards.

419
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,885
Bring Sir Lin out for interrogation.

420
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,928
Let's see how many traitors
are there still.

421
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:13,195
Fu Chou, you are just using
this chance to revenge.

422
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:15,054
Your mother has only
herself to blame...

423
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,760
for her death.

424
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:20,138
So, you've known from the start
that I'm the son of Fu Yuan.

425
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:22,243
-But you pretended to doubt me.
-You...

426
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:23,646
I never thought that...

427
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:26,063
you'll really have an ulterior motive.
Bring him away.

428
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,720
Let go of me!

429
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,229
Let go of me!

430
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,710
Fu Chou, how daring of you.

431
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,845
You are a traitor.

432
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:41,192
What are you doing? You...

433
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,687
My fellow officials, any of you...

434
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:50,401
have other objections?

435
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,362
-Greetings, Your Highness.
-Stand up.

436
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:58,621
Get up now!

437
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,350
He is a traitor!

438
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,320
You are a low-life. A traitor!

439
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:05,656
Fu Chou.

440
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:07,775
Fu Chou!

441
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:47,485
Why did it become the real Rong Le?

442
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,840
What do you mean?

443
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,706
According to our initial plan,

444
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,406
it's supposed to be Princess Rong Le.

445
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:00,097
I've already asked Hen Xiang
to replace her.

446
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,040
Why the real Rong Le...

447
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,100
will be the one at the square?

448
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,966
Did you put a spoke in my wheel?

449
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:09,881
Did you?

450
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,395
In order to protect Princess Rong Le,

451
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:15,866
how could you ask Hen Xiang
to take her place?

452
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,020
I heard that the plan this time
has gone very smoothly.

453
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:21,462
I thought you've already
thought it through.

454
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,020
I thought that you've given up
on love for the greater good.

455
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:30,640
You said that you love her.

456
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:34,918
But you didn't realise that
she's the one at the square.

457
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,801
Zongzheng Wu You...

458
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:39,621
has been able to identify her.

459
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,061
That's why he surrendered willingly.

460
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,140
You know it clearly yourself.

461
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,005
If she is not the real
Princess Rong Le,

462
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,000
you won't be able to fool
Zongzheng Wu You so easily.

463
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,360
All of you, get up!

464
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:11,382
Congratulate our young master...

465
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,978
that he has gotten his revenge...

466
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:16,911
and has completed a great cause!

467
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:20,633
Congratulations for completing
a great cause, Young Master!

468
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
Everybody,

469
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,200
evacuate at once.

470
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,559
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

471
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:58,122
<i>Our hearts are lifetime apart.</i>

472
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:03,138
<i>No one was here for us.</i>

473
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:06,636
<i>How to we keep living this life?</i>

474
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,142
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

475
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,991
Wu You!

476
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,448
<i>We have thrown away
the fate that we got by chance.</i>

477
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:23,765
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

478
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:27,995
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

479
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,381
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

480
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:36,808
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

481
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,989
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

482
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:45,476
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

483
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,720
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

484
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,368
<i>We are not holding hands
but you are holding my heart.</i>

485
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,200
Why is the princess still unconscious?

486
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,389
She has been unconscious for so long.

487
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,746
<i>I've locked you in my heart...</i>

488
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,009
<i>and I've locked you in my dream.</i>

489
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,840
Sir Xiao.

490
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,480
She will be fine, right?

491
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:22,182
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to kill him.

492
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,255
Are you crazy?

493
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:27,391
Ever since General Fu and
princess came back to the manor,

494
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:31,599
General Fu has sentenced all the
guards in Tranquil Garden to death.

495
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,868
Even Chang Jian is punished.

496
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:36,261
General Fu stood guard beside...

497
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:39,151
the princess without rest,
without drinking and without eating.

498
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,333
If you barge in suddenly,

499
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,239
you'll lose your life.

500
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:45,606
As the princess's bodyguard,

501
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:48,585
I've failed my duty for not
being able to protect her well.

502
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:50,298
Now...

503
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,920
Now, she has already become like this.

504
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:56,190
Am I not going to avenge her
because I care for my own life?

505
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:57,658
Xiao Sha.

506
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,442
I feel the same as you.

507
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:02,911
I'm very upset that she is hurt.

508
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,599
But now, we are the only ones left...

509
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:08,449
who are with the princess.

510
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,174
If anything happens to us,

511
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:13,392
who is going to protect her?

512
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,240
Who is going to take care of her?

513
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:54,142
You are awake.

514
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,080
Where is Wu You?

515
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,800
Where is Wu You? Tell me.

516
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,320
How is he now?

517
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,055
You've been unconscious for two days.

518
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,949
Don't think about other things.

519
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,469
Get a good rest...

520
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:19,719
and let your body recover, alright?

521
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,120
Don't touch me.

522
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:38,450
I hate your face that
faked innocence so much.

523
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:42,010
You pretended to care about me,

524
00:41:42,646 --> 00:41:45,391
but you are actually
plotting about how to use me.

525
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:48,189
-I didn't do it.
-You didn't do what?

526
00:41:50,255 --> 00:41:53,247
You didn't use me to threaten Wu You?

527
00:41:54,326 --> 00:41:57,086
You didn't personally feed me
the toxin by force?

528
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,724
Or you didn't send someone to
bring me into the palace...

529
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:03,059
so that I can be humiliated in public?

530
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:04,816
I didn't know that she was you.

531
00:42:05,263 --> 00:42:09,200
If you don't want to tell me whether
he lives or not, then leave.

532
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,757
Now, I don't want
to look at you at all.

533
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,524
And I don't want to talk to you.

534
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:19,229
You make me feel that...

535
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,498
I'm a disaster to others
as long as I'm still alive.

536
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,292
Rong Le, let's not think about
other things for now, alright?

537
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,150
Where is Wu You?

538
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,261
I want to see him.
