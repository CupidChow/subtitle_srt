00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,260
" Princess Silver "

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,820
Episode 41

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,460
Lady Fu refuses to live in
the palace for recovery.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,780
She insists to stay
in the Cold Palace.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,740
Was it Senyan Palace?

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,460
Yes, I tried talking to her.
But she refuses to leave.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,060
So I ordered my men
to renovate Senyan Palace.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,420
Right, any reports
from the south fringe?

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,860
Southern fringe is
carrying out a new policy.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,300
It has shown result
for the past one year.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,140
Qin Yong?

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,100
Back then, Qin Yong was able to carry
out the people-based transformation...

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,900
because of Lady Yun's help.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,260
It enabled Northern Realm
to build up strong army...

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,420
and enrich the people in a very short
time after we recovered from war...

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,180
to become a force itself.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,020
Too bad Qin Yong lack judgement.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,180
That's why his
people-based transformation...

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,780
had failed in the end.

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,860
Your Highness, this new policy...

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,740
is carried out together by...

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,100
Prince Li and that consort of his.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,620
Her?

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,420
Any other news?

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,260
We have a secret message
from Qingzhou.

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,780
It is said that recently,
there are some rumours in the city.

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,740
It's rumoured that...

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,020
there's a Silver-Hair Demon.

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,580
What Silver-Hair Demon?

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,700
They say that the consort
is a Silver-Hair Demon.

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,740
Some said that this consort...

32
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,900
used the be a general's wife
in Northern Realm.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,620
They said that she's a wanton...

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,020
and had eloped with
Prince Li to the southern fringe.

35
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,140
This rumour has spread
like a wild fire in that city.

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,140
Pass down my order.
Find the source of the rumour.

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,580
Yes, I understand.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,460
-Follow me to Senyan Palace.
-Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,500
Mother.

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,980
Chou.

41
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,940
Greetings, mother.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,340
Chou. Finally, you are back.

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,620
Mother.

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,260
I had been engaging in war
for the past one year.

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Please don't blame me for not being
able to take care of you by my side.

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,220
Look at you. You've been
separated from me for so long...

47
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,260
until we are so estranged.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,980
That's not true.

49
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,780
I'm gratified that you are putting...

50
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,660
the country before you.

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,060
-Why would I blame you?
-Yes, mother.

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,220
Your Majesty, food is ready.

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,420
Come. Let's eat.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,860
After you, mother.

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
I remember that when I was young,

56
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,460
you...

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,620
were always so distant and cold.

58
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,740
And you never ate with me.

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,180
Actually,
I only understood later on...

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,580
that you were leaving me
with all the good food...

61
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,100
while you sat aside to eat
those leftovers in secret.

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,900
Unfortunately,

63
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,580
I still don't have a way...

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,180
to hold a feast for you.

65
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,100
But don't worry, mother.

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,700
I'll hold a coronation ceremony
for you in a few days' time...

67
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,340
to welcome you back to the court.

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,980
It's all because of my mental illness.

69
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Fortunately I've recovered now.

70
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,300
I won't drag you down
that much anymore.

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,580
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,140
We've been through life and death
to be together.

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,100
I'll fulfil my duty well as your son.

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,420
Where have you been
for the past one year?

75
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,860
You never came back to Zhongshan.

76
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,580
You know how worried I am towards you?

77
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,300
I know.

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,340
For the past one year,
I had been travelling north.

79
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,180
I had reclaimed the lands
that were taken away...

80
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,860
by Wei one year ago.

81
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,900
North?

82
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,260
Why don't you go south?

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,740
Do you mean the southern fringe?

84
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,700
As for southern fringe,

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,380
it is guarded by Zongzheng Wu You's
highly organised army.

86
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,660
We can't underestimate their strength.

87
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,580
I had sent some shock troops
to southern fringe before.

88
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,540
But they were annihilated.

89
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,220
My thought is, before I can
be sure of my enemy's strength,

90
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,340
I won't act recklessly.

91
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,980
I need to observe them first.

92
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,060
If I were you,

93
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll send forth a fleet
to defeat them...

94
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,820
once and for all before
they become fully fledged.

95
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,660
But this is just
an opinion of a woman.

96
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,140
You can just listen
and forget about it.

97
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,180
You are worried about the country too.

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,580
I understand.

99
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,460
Serve the wine.

100
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
-Mother.
-Wench!

101
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,820
-I'm going to kill you.
-Mother.

102
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,380
I'm going to burn you to death.

103
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,100
Look at your face scar.
I'm going to burn you to death.

104
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,860
-Please spare my life!
-Mother.

105
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,420
-I'll burn you to death!
-Mother!

106
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,180
-Spare my life!
-I'll burn you to death.

107
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,260
-I'll burn you to death!
-Mother!

108
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,940
Don't just stand there!
Take her away! Quick!

109
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,820
Quick.

110
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,060
It's alright now, mother.

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,220
-Ask them to stop. Don't burn me.
-Mother.

112
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,940
-Don't burn me! Ask them to stop!
-It's alright now.

113
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,260
-It's alright now, mother.
-Don't burn me.

114
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,860
-Don't hit me.
-I'm in control of this palace now.

115
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,980
Nobody will hurt you.
Don't be scared.

116
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,820
Don't be scared.
It's fine now.

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,060
-Don't hit me.
-It's fine now.

118
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,980
Today is such a wonderful day.

119
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,060
If it wasn't for the celebratory wine
bestowed by His Highness upon us,

120
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,620
I would have been sober
for more than half a year.

121
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,460
Brother. Let's drink till we drop.

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,620
Alright!

123
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,860
Did you see that?

124
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,460
Silver-Hair Demon!

125
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,740
You are drunk.
You must have seen it wrongly.

126
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,900
That's right.
That is General Luo Qiao's tent.

127
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,060
He is a bold and powerful man.

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,820
No demon will dare get close to him.

129
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,060
Let's take a look anyway.

130
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
-Let's go then.
-Let's go.

131
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,940
This...

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,380
-General Luo Qiao!
-General Luo.

133
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,700
-General Luo!
-There, look!

134
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,860
Silver hair.
It's the Silver-Hair Demon!

135
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
The Silver-Hair Demon
has killed General Luo.

136
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,980
Your Highness, this is the
overall situation of the incident.

137
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,580
The three soldiers who had
discovered the body first hand...

138
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,060
are now under supervision.

139
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,900
They just had a fleeting glimpse
of a person with silver hair.

140
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,340
But it's possible that they saw
wrongly because they are drunk.

141
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,300
Question them carefully.
We can't miss out on any details.

142
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,940
But most importantly,

143
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,740
we can't let this news spread
and create further panic.

144
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,900
Luo Army has always been very strict.

145
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,260
They had blocked the news
from spreading at once.

146
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,660
But tonight is a special night.

147
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,060
Many of them were drunk
in the celebratory feast.

148
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,420
We can't be sure that
the news won't leak.

149
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,660
This is indeed a sticky business.

150
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,940
The one who created the rumour...

151
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,860
seems to know us like
the back of his hand.

152
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,460
He acts very cautiously...

153
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,660
and leaves no trail behind.

154
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,060
The scariest part is,
he is quite the schemer.

155
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,980
He knows that he can
manipulate the people...

156
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,180
through rumours and mystery.

157
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,540
Your Highness.

158
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,900
-Please back me up, Your Highness!
-General, don't be rude.

159
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,460
General Luo Qiao is
a close brother of yours.

160
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,300
That's why His Highness has been
investigating on it all night long.

161
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,180
But we can't just look at
one side of the story.

162
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,940
Lady Rong Le is with
His Highness for the whole night.

163
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,460
Please give us the order...

164
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,020
so that Luo Army can depart
immediately to the border.

165
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,540
What is your purpose for doing so?

166
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,260
I know clearly that...

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,140
the death of my brother is done
by someone with ulterior motive.

168
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,180
His aim is to use my brother's life
to make us waver, to threaten you...

169
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,180
and to put the blame
on Lady Rong Le.

170
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,260
If we continue to stay
at the outskirts of Qingzhou,

171
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,740
this case will be out in the open
tomorrow morning. Everybody will know.

172
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,380
This will affect the people's loyalty.

173
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,460
Although my brother's life
is important,

174
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,460
we can't ruin the reputation of...

175
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,340
Your Highness and Lady Rong Le.

176
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,540
You believe in Lady Rong Le?

177
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,100
Yes.

178
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,100
If she is in a killing rage
and blood-lust,

179
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,940
there will be no survivor
in this manor.

180
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,300
Moreover, when I met her that day,

181
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,300
although her hair is silver,
she still looks like a normal person.

182
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,620
But she is willing to
stay inside this manor...

183
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,660
because she doesn't want
to startle the people.

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,180
Such a kind person like her
won't commit murder.

185
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,220
Please rise.

186
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,580
The man who planned this
is unfathomable.

187
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,100
Whether you leave or not,

188
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,300
I'm sure that this will only
get worse and worse.

189
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,900
So, the thing that you should do
is not to run away with your soldiers.

190
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,780
You have to use your reputation...

191
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,860
reassure your soldiers.

192
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,020
You've won victories
after victories in the battlefield.

193
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,940
Are you going to lose
to this kind of evil plot?

194
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
You believe in Lady Rong Le.

195
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,620
I hope that you can believe in me too.

196
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,300
I won't let General Luo Qiao
die in vain.

197
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,700
Yes, Your Highness.

198
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,260
Thank you for your teachings.

199
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,980
I'll go back to the military camp now
to order them...

200
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,780
to stay on high alert and
gather any evidences that I can.

201
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,940
Leng Yan.

202
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,340
The Serene Hill Inn that
I had asked you to seal up,

203
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
unseal it immediately.

204
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,340
Restore everything to normal.

205
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,260
Just like nothing had ever happened.

206
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,220
Are you trying to lure them out?

207
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,820
The murdering schemers
are trying to create panic.

208
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,140
But if everything has
gone back to normal,

209
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,420
they will be the one panicking.

210
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,180
Now, we don't have any evidence.

211
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,140
But when the time comes,

212
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,300
they might show their flaws.

213
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,220
Yes, Your Highness.

214
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Sir Sun.

215
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,420
Now, His Highness is
very cautious towards us...

216
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,780
aristocratic clans.

217
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,820
Is it safe for us to meet
each other in your manor?

218
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,980
No need to panic.

219
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,460
Come, sit down and have some tea.

220
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,020
If you are not guilty,

221
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,340
then you have nothing to be afraid of.

222
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,900
But Sir Sun,

223
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,900
I think His Highness has found out
that I embezzled the military funds.

224
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,540
Although Prince Chen
didn't point me out in the court,

225
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,860
his warning was bright and clear.

226
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,260
Do we have a whistle-blower
in the court?

227
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,300
I had already warned you not to be
too greedy in the first place...

228
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,260
so that you won't end up
like Zheng family.

229
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,100
But have you ever listened to me?

230
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,220
Luo Zhi is back in the court now.

231
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,980
His Highness has increased...

232
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,980
his effort in suppressing
us scholars with the poor.

233
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,260
It's possible that
he'll punish Cai family...

234
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,540
as an example to others.

235
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,420
I've regretted my doings.

236
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,260
Given that we are both
prominent clans in Qingzhou...

237
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,860
and we are old family friends,

238
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,380
please save me and my family.

239
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,220
You have exaggerated.

240
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,780
Here.

241
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,180
Sir Sun, save me.

242
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,700
Sir Cai.

243
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,060
Have you heard about
a rumour lately among the people...

244
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,980
saying that a Silver-Hair Demon had...

245
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,300
bring calamity to the country
and had seduced the prince?

246
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,100
Are you saying that...

247
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,540
I didn't say anything.

248
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,220
But if you are smart,

249
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,420
you should know what you have to do.

250
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,500
Please give this to Miss Ling Yue.

251
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,020
Miss Sun. Why don't you
give it to His Highness yourself?

252
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,140
If I give this to Sister Ling Yue,

253
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,580
she will think that it's
for Lady Rong Le.

254
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

255
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,820
It makes no difference
whether I give it to...

256
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,420
His Highness or Lady Rong Le.

257
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,980
You just need to give it to Ling Yue.

258
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,460
I've overstepped.
Please forgive me, Miss Sun.

259
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,940
Ya Li.

260
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,420
You know how to use some tricks now.

261
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,580
-You may leave now.
-Yes, Miss Sun.

262
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,140
You are in a good mood today, father.

263
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,740
Ever since I came to Qingzhou,

264
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,860
it has been a long time
since I last see your smile.

265
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,220
Looks like you've
thought things through.

266
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,580
I'm extremely glad.

267
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,820
You've always asked me to
get close to His Highness.

268
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,380
Only now have I understood
your purpose.

269
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,580
You always said that...

270
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,860
His Highness is the chosen one.

271
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,460
I have to marry him and
become his consort...

272
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,100
so that I can be future empress.

273
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,340
Only then can we consolidate
the foundation of Sun family...

274
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,820
and secure my happiness
for the rest of my life.

275
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,900
Since you've understood this theory,

276
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,060
I'll be straightforward with you.

277
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,380
You need to know that...

278
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,900
although His Highness
looks like he's close to me,

279
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,220
he has been guarding
himself against me.

280
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,140
Now, more than ever, you need
to get close to His Highness.

281
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,180
If this marriage alliance
is successful,

282
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,380
the foundation of Sun family
will be secured.

283
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,540
You are His Highness's teacher.

284
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,980
Now, you are the provincial governor
of Qingzhou with the most power.

285
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,740
I just don't understand.

286
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,820
If you just remain within bounds,

287
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,020
nothing can shake the foundation
of Sun family, right?

288
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,340
So what if I'm His Highness's teacher?

289
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,620
So what if I'm the
provincial governor?

290
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,460
From the surface, it looks like
Sun family is prospering.

291
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,060
But we are actually hollow underneath.

292
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,740
The more integrated
the transformation is,

293
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,940
the more loss Sun family will suffer.

294
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,060
I have the most power in the court...

295
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,860
but it's just an empty title.

296
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,380
In order to carry out
this transformation,

297
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,780
His Highness has arrogated
all authority to himself.

298
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,020
It's like being close to a tiger.

299
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,140
I've been losing sleep
because of this anxiety.

300
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,140
But father,

301
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,380
Rong Le and His Highness
love each other.

302
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,900
Nobody can take His Highness
away from Rong Le.

303
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,540
Same goes for me.

304
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,940
How will I be able...

305
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,420
to become his consort?

306
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,060
Where there's a will, there's a way.

307
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,220
As long as you treat His Highness
wholeheartedly, he might waver.

308
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,860
Moreover, you can still form
a marriage without feelings.

309
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,300
You should have learnt your lessons...

310
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,580
from the humiliation
you received in Zhongshan.

311
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,060
Feeling is just a tool
to control the weak.

312
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,900
It's worthless.

313
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,020
Is it...

314
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
really worthless?

315
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,580
Ya Li, Sun family will either...

316
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,420
become His Highness's family
and share the world with him...

317
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,420
or we will be his enemy.

318
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,180
We can only fight
to our last breath...

319
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,460
against such capable man like him.

320
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,660
Is this the only way?

321
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,780
Among the two choices,

322
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,580
you know that which one
will be better...

323
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,060
for Sun family, for you and for me.

324
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,540
Even if worst comes to worst,

325
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,060
if the marriage alliance
is successful, he'll let go...

326
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,500
of the Sun family for your sake.

327
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,740
Ya Li, everything that
I'm doing now...

328
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,820
is for you sake.

329
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,140
Think about it.

330
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,260
Your Highness.
Something bad had happened.

331
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,900
The bard that we had caught...

332
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,940
has suddenly died in jail
without any reasons.

333
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,140
I'm afraid that we have rats
working in the prison.

334
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,340
Now, the person behind the scene
is getting more and more daring.

335
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,180
Looks like he has known that we
don't have any concrete evidence.

336
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,140
How dare he do this
right under our noses.

337
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,020
Your Highness.

338
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,100
These are all nonsense.

339
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,580
In order to force you to
divorce Lady Rong Le,

340
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,820
they are quick to believe that
she's the murdering demon.

341
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,620
Did Cai Yan He think that
I won't know his motives...

342
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,260
if he didn't do it himself
but by instigating...

343
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,460
his former disciples from
Cai family to complain to me?

344
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,580
Your Highness, I've found out that...

345
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,780
Serene Hill Inn is here in Qingzhou
for more than one hundred years.

346
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,500
It is a famous inn.

347
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,140
Although people of all sorts
gather in this place,

348
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,020
nobody has dared
cause trouble in this place.

349
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,820
Word is, this place is under
the government protection.

350
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,980
According to rumour,
the mysterious owner of this inn...

351
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,980
is very close to some
high-rank officials in the court.

352
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,740
Could it be Cai Yan He?

353
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,900
Cai family has prospered in southern
fringe for one hundred years and more,

354
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,620
but Cai Yan He is not a person...

355
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,660
who can carry out such perilous plan.

356
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,300
Ever since the transformation
is carried out,

357
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,500
because of the land distribution
of fiscal policy,

358
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,060
the scholars in southern fringe
are threatened.

359
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,740
And the one with the most losses...

360
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,340
will be desperate enough
to take this risk.

361
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,980
-Are you saying that Sun...
-Let me go in!

362
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,220
What is it, Ya Li?

363
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,540
It's dinner time.

364
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
If you don't have anything important,
please allow me to excuse myself.

365
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,620
Miss Sun,
this is His Highness's habit.

366
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,860
During this time of the day,
His Highness will be off limit.

367
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,460
If you have anything urgent,
you can tell me first.

368
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,500
Your Highness,
please forgive me for my rudeness.

369
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,460
But after thinking it through,

370
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,860
you are the only one I can
think of who can save me.

371
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,940
What do you mean?

372
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,820
When you were banished
to Qingzhou because of...

373
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,420
the Yun's Tomb incident back then,

374
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
is the promise you
made to me that time...

375
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,380
still holds true?

376
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,860
Princess, look.

377
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,980
You've cooked these personally
for His Highness.

378
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,580
So, of course you should
personally invite him for dinner...

379
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,340
in order for it to be more formal.

380
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,580
It has already become a habit for us
to have dinner together every day.

381
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,780
Why do you want me
to personally invite him?

382
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
What do you have in your mind?

383
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,700
Is he not going to come
if I didn't invite him?

384
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,300
I'm saying that because you look
so anxious and impatient.

385
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,180
That's because you've tricked me...

386
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,260
saying that I've treated him
shabbily by preparing...

387
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,980
only simple food for him every day.

388
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,940
Although I'm still not
very good at it this time,

389
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
I still want him to have a taste.

390
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,100
Yes. Only His Highness...

391
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,340
is able to stomach the food
that you made.

392
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,100
A good night with good wine...

393
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,700
served with good food.

394
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,220
Everything is ready.

395
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,700
Now, you'll only have to invite
His Highness here for dinner.

396
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,220
Go and invite His Highness.

397
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,580
When you were banished
to southern fringe,

398
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,380
I was not willing to be
married to Zheng family.

399
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,020
So, you had given me
this silver bracelet.

400
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,100
And we had covered up for each other.

401
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,100
Do you still remember about it?

402
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,820
Of course I do.

403
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,700
But I too remember that
Zheng family is here no more.

404
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,340
And I had already settled
the issue for you.

405
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,500
I didn't break the promise between us.

406
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,060
If there's nothing else,
I'll have to leave.

407
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,700
Now that I think of it,

408
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,180
when I was under
your protection back then,

409
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,260
it was the most peaceful...

410
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,860
and happiest moment in my life.

411
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,740
I had been thinking lately.

412
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,820
If I can continue
to stay by your side,

413
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,460
maybe I won't need to
go through so many hardship.

414
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,780
Ya Li.

415
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,420
-You shouldn't say this.
-Your Highness.

416
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,940
I know that this is wrong.

417
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,540
I had tossed and turned,
thinking about it lately.

418
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,380
I'm not sure if I should
confess to you.

419
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,820
But I heard that...

420
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,900
Lady Rong Le is thinking about
marrying me off to General Luo Zhi.

421
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,540
And recently, my father...

422
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,980
has been forcing me to make
a choice for my marriage.

423
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,900
After giving it some thoughts,

424
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
I think that although
I feel bad for Rong Le,

425
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,260
I have to fight for myself.

426
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,540
Princess, this...

427
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,580
Say no more.

428
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,900
Ya Li.

429
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,700
You should be very clear that...

430
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,300
besides Man Yao,

431
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,220
I love no other.

432
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,940
Of course I know that...

433
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,060
Rong Le is the only one in your heart.

434
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,260
And I had seen with
my own eyes that...

435
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,860
you had sacrificed yourself
for Lady Rong Le.

436
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,380
I had fallen for the
wrong person once.

437
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,660
So, I know better than anyone that
you are the only one...

438
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,300
in this world who has real sentiments.

439
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,980
You just need to give me
some love and warmth.

440
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,140
I just need a little bit of them...

441
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,100
and I'll live with no regrets forever.

442
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,980
Ever since you saved me
in the palace regardless of your life,

443
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,700
I've already fallen in love with you.

444
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,900
Ya Li.

445
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,420
Have some respect for yourself.

446
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,140
The smell in this room...

447
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,700
is from the calming incense
that I had made myself.

448
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,180
I wonder...

449
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,980
if you've ever dreamt of me.

450
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,980
Princess, don't be sad.

451
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,420
Maybe this is just a misunderstanding.

452
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,940
I don't blame Wu You.

453
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,780
And I trust him.

454
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,740
I just never thought that...

455
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,700
Ya Li...

456
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,140
will be in love with him.

457
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,300
Princess Rong Le.

458
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,020
His Highness has brought Miss Sun
back to southern fringe...

459
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,940
because she looks so desolate.

460
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,380
It's only normal that...

461
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,620
Miss Sun feels grateful
for His Highness.

462
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,340
Ya Li is dainty with a harsh life.

463
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,820
She has such dominant father...

464
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,900
and her feelings was once
used by Fu Chou.

465
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,580
So, I've always had
a tender affection for her.

466
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,780
And I hope that...

467
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,260
she can find her true love.

468
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,580
And I don't want her to be
involved in family fights.

469
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,140
Before this,

470
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,220
I mentioned about Luo Zhi's
marriage proposal to her.

471
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,020
I didn't force her as well
since she's not willing to.

472
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,820
But I never thought that...

473
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,420
Princess,

474
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,540
what are you going to do then?

475
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,900
There's nothing that I can do.

476
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,940
I just know that...

477
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,860
I believe in me and Wu You's feelings.

478
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,460
I'm tired. I want to rest.

479
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,180
Then...

480
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,660
what about the surprise that
you've prepared for His Highness?

481
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,060
Take them away.

482
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
I'll...

483
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,180
let Wu You take care of it himself.

484
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

485
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,180
Man Yao has eaten her dinner?

486
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,060
Why didn't she wait for me?

487
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,980
Princess is asleep already.

488
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,940
Did she suffer a relapse?

489
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,460
Your Highness, she heard about
the Silver-Hair rumour today.

490
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,900
She's not happy about it
and she's exhausted.

491
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,620
So, she has had an early night.

492
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,780
The Silver-Hair rumour?

493
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,780
She's not someone who
will be affected by rumours.

494
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,660
Take good care of her.

495
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,060
Yes, Your Highness.

496
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,500
Please help me, Your Majesty.

497
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,260
Now,

498
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,140
who else can I save?

499
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,460
Your Majesty, Prince Regent is back.

500
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,940
He has always shown you respect.

501
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,500
If you beg him, he might be able
to spare Lan's life.

502
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,180
Lan?

503
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,380
Which Lan?

504
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,460
She is my younger sister.

505
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,260
She has served you before.

506
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,940
Recently, she has been transferred
to Senyan Palace to serve Lady Fu.

507
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,740
But I haven't been able to find her
for the past few days.

508
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,660
After some efforts,
I found out that...

509
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,540
when Prince Regent came back that day,

510
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,540
Lan had accidentally splashed
some tea on Lady Fu.

511
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,180
So, Lady Fu had kicked and hit her.

512
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,940
And after that, she went missing.

513
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,940
If I want to save her,

514
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,140
I'm afraid that you are the
only one who can do that.

515
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,380
I heard that...

516
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,540
Prince Regent is going to enthroned
Lady Fu as empress dowager.

517
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,540
What?

518
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,820
Empress dowager?

519
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,300
-Yes.
-You said that...

520
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,260
he's going to enthrone her
as empress dowager?

521
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,420
Yes. Prince Regent said that
she has recovered.

522
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,180
She has recovered?

523
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,780
Then, has she regained...

524
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,980
all of her memories in the past?

525
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,540
She is going to be
empress dowager now.

526
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,900
I'm the empress.

527
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,060
I've taken her place.

528
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,180
She won't let go of me.

529
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,420
Your Majesty, no matter what,
you are the previous empress.

530
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,780
Fu Yuan is just a woman who has
just recovered from insanity.

531
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,620
She won't be a threat to you.

532
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,940
And there's Prince Regent.

533
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,460
He has always been
respectful towards you, right?

534
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,180
People like you...

535
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,900
know nothing.

536
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,820
-Your Majesty.
-Do you know...

537
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,980
what kind of a person Fu Yuan is?

538
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,820
She came back from hell.

539
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,900
She is just like the demon itself!

540
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,540
-Your Majesty.
-She's here to take our lives.

541
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,820
-What's wrong with you, Your Majesty?
-She's here to take our lives!

542
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,340
-Your Majesty!
-Go out.

543
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,020
Go out! Go out now!

544
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,500
Please save me.

545
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,300
All these years,

546
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,460
I've been putting
my pride in my pocket.

547
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,940
I've never fought for anything.

548
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,220
It's all because of self-preservation.

549
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,540
I've dedicated my whole life
to this palace.

550
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,100
I've dedicated myself to His Majesty.

551
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,780
But now,

552
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,860
His Majesty is dead.

553
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Crown prince is dead.

554
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,100
Wu You has left.

555
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,460
The people who I can rely on
in the past are gone.

556
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,220
I can't rely on them anymore.

557
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,020
Now,

558
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,380
Fu Yuan is back.

559
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,180
When she comes back,

560
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,180
she won't let go of me.

561
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,020
She'll make me wish that I'm dead.

562
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,980
Why?

563
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,580
Just like Sister Yun,

564
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,460
we've never wanted to hurt anybody!

565
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,460
I'm a devoted believer,

566
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,620
a loyal servant to Buddha.

567
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,060
Why are you treating me like this?

568
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,220
Why did you put me
in such a sorry state?

569
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,260
Why?

570
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,660
This is so unfair!

571
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,860
Why would the late empress
pass away suddenly?

572
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,540
There are rumours from
the harem saying that...

573
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
she didn't die from illness.

574
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,460
They say that she hanged herself.

575
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,860
The maidservants found out about it
when they brought her dinner.

576
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
Impossible.

577
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,860
The late empress
is from a clan of scholar.

578
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,900
She has always been smart, cautious
and has taken care of herself well.

579
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,300
-That's right.
-Even Prince Regent...

580
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,980
has treated her with courtesy.

581
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,220
Why would she commit suicide?

582
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,540
That's right.

583
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,140
Arrival of His Highness!

584
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

585
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,820
Please rise.

586
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

587
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,620
All of you here are
the pillars of the country.

588
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,260
I've summoned you here today...

589
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,900
because of one thing.

590
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,580
I want to enthrone Empress Fu
as empress dowager.

591
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,260
I want to give her back the
Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal...

592
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,940
and bring her back to
the ancestral temple.

593
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,300
As for the details,

594
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,340
I can only decide after
I've discussed with all of you.

595
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,180
-This...
-This...

596
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,820
From the way you look,

597
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,260
is there any objection?

598
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,060
Your Highness, the late empress
had just passed away yesterday.

599
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,180
If we are so quick to enthrone
the empress dowager,

600
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,860
-I'm afraid that it's unacceptable.
-Why is it unacceptable?

601
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,700
She has just passed away and the truth
behind her death is still uncertain.

602
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,540
The late empress has fallen ill...

603
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,620
because she misses the late emperor
until the illness has taken her away.

604
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,100
Now, the late empress is
together with the late emperor.

605
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
What truth do we need
to be certain about?

606
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,540
Please be rest assured.
I'll take care of...

607
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,700
the funeral of the late empress.

608
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,260
No need to worry about it.

609
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,380
Your Highness, if I may be so bold.

610
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,380
Fu Yuan's identity is vague at best.

611
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,340
Enthroning empress dowager
will affect the country.

612
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,220
-Please reconsider.
-Insolent.

613
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,900
Fu Yuan is my birth mother.

614
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,820
She was the previous empress
of the last sovereign.

615
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,500
How can her identity be vague?

616
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,180
What objections do you have?

617
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,060
Your Highness, Empress Fu has
passed away more than 10 years ago.

618
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,020
We can't be sure of
this woman's background.

619
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,260
And without proof, how can
she be the model for all woman?

620
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,380
And how can she make
the people submit to her?

621
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,980
Yang Wei.

622
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,540
You've served the
late emperor for many years.

623
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,780
Are you really unable to
recognise Empress Fu Yuan?

624
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,660
His Highness,
I had served the late emperor.

625
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,220
Of course I know about Empress Fu.

626
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,740
And I know very well whether
or not she's qualified...

627
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,180
to be the model for all women.

628
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,940
So, no matter she is
Empress Fu or not,

629
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,940
I won't allow her to be
empress dowager.

630
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,860
Yang Wei.

631
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,180
How dare you talk back
to your superior.

632
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,980
I think you have had enough to be
the minister of Ministry of Rites.

633
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,340
Even if...

634
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,820
I'm not the minister of
this Ministry of Rites,

635
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,940
I'll never recognise Fu Yuan
as empress dowager.

636
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,260
Yang Wei!

637
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,780
You are a senior official who had
served for more than 10 years.

638
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,620
Among all the others here,
you should have known better!

639
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,500
That day, in this very place,

640
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,180
you had doubted my identity.

641
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,540
Now,

642
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,340
you want to do the same?

643
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,220
You've defeated our enemy
and brought peace to the country.

644
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,780
They are great merits.

645
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,820
But if you enthroned her
as empress dowager,

646
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,380
I'm afraid that from now on,
the court will be in chaos...

647
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,940
and it'll be a disaster for
the country and the people.

648
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,180
The merits that you've
achieved before this...

649
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,140
will be gone in a split second.

650
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,100
My mother is a weak lady.
How can she bring chaos to the court?

651
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,460
Southern and northern regions
are all the same!

652
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,460
Why do you have to condemn
such a weak lady?

653
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,740
You just say that she'll endanger the
nation and accuse her for something.

654
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,060
Her honour...

655
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,860
is not something that others
can look down on easily.

656
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,380
Guards!

657
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,100
This...

658
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,220
My fellow officials. Now,

659
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,900
any of you still have objections?

660
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,660
Your Highness.

661
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,740
The coronation for empress dowager...

662
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,740
is under the Ministry of Rite's duty.

663
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,100
Other officials in this court...

664
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,100
have nothing to do with it.

665
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,940
If you insist on your decision...

666
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,300
to enthrone Fu Yuan
as empress dowager,

667
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I'm willing to be punished
for being disrespectful.

668
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,100
I'll retire and go back to
my hometown. From now on,

669
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,420
please look for others
to take my place.

670
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,220
Sir Yang.

671
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,740
Sir Yang.

672
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,500
We'll discuss about
the coronation of...

673
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,940
empress dowager again next time.

674
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,780
Your Highness, according to custom,

675
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,180
late empress should be buried
together with the late emperor.

676
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,660
But she is not given the title
as empress dowager yet.

677
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,420
What kind of funeral
should we give her?

678
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,020
How would I know about these
overelaborated formalities?

679
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,220
By the way, remember...

680
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,820
not to let anyone see
the looks of the late empress.

681
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,580
I understand.

682
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,740
How could a person
who's living well...

683
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,580
commit suicide just like that?

684
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,100
By the way,
don't tell mother about this.

685
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,780
It'll only make her worry.

686
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,420
Lately, she has recovered
from her illness even more.

687
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Arrival of Her Majesty!

688
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,780
Greetings, mother.

689
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,740
Chou.

690
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,900
You have to take care of yourself.

691
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,060
Health is more important.

692
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,940
Thank you for your care.
I'll remember it.

693
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,860
Mother, have a seat.

694
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,620
Why do you...

695
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,140
have so many reports today?

696
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,340
Yang Wei...

697
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,100
has left his post.

698
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,820
After he left his post,

699
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,340
Some of the vice ministers
from the Ministry of Rites...

700
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,220
have quit their job as well.

701
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,380
It's normal to have more work
when you have less people.

702
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,940
It's not a big deal.

703
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
-Chou.
-Mother.

704
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,540
I won't blame Sir Yang...

705
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,940
for what he did.

706
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,580
He's just being more cautious
because this concerns...

707
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,380
the benefit of the nation.

708
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,500
If you want to hire him
to work for the court again,

709
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,940
I won't mind it as well.

710
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,500
I know Yang Wei quite well.

711
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,780
With his temper by nature,
since he has left,

712
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,540
he won't be coming back anymore.

713
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,580
Mother.

714
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,660
I've been...

715
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,420
delaying your coronation
again and again.

716
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,340
Do you really don't mind about it?

717
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,300
You said it many times.

718
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,700
I know. You have
no choice but to do it...

719
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,780
because of the current situation.

720
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,780
Thank you for your
understanding, mother.

721
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,580
Somebody lacks judgement.

722
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,020
If they want to leave,
let them go then.

723
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,740
No need to rack your brains for it.

724
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,300
Mother.

725
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,300
You don't understand.

726
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,900
All the officials in this court...

727
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,140
have stayed behind...

728
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,380
not because they are willing
to serve me wholeheartedly.

729
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,020
They did it for the benefit
of Northern Realm only.

730
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,060
After this coronation incident,

731
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,980
I can see it even clearer now.

732
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,300
Although I've been ruling
Northern Realm for more than a year,

733
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,620
these officials...

734
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,820
still haven't submit themselves
completely to me.

735
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,300
I have my Armour Army to force them.

736
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,620
But...

737
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,140
it's not enough to suppress
the arrogance in them.

738
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,740
That is because...

739
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,820
you are not ruthless enough.

740
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,460
Chou, as the ruler of the country,

741
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,060
you are too soft-hearted.

742
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,100
Mother.

743
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,340
Making them submit by force...

744
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,620
is of the worst plan.

745
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,380
Although I can't say that
I'll be a sage,

746
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,220
I don't want to be a tyrant as well.
