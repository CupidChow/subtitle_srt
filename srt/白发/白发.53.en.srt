00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,639
" Princess Silver "

2
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,516
Episode 53

3
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:41,370
Chang Jian,
I don't care what it takes,

4
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,140
I want you to find out where
Fu Yuan is at all cost.

5
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,699
Your Highness, there is no one
in the Lingxiao Palace.

6
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,150
According to the guards,

7
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:50,051
the Empress Dowager
went missing three days ago.

8
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,508
We searched everywhere,
she is nowhere to be found.

9
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,815
I suspect this might have
something to do with Lin Shen.

10
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,135
Witness said Lin Shen went
into the Lingxiao Palace.

11
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:01,254
-Maybe the two of them...
-She's been working with Lin Shen.

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,468
It's just that we never found out.

13
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,123
Fu Yuan was never my mother.

14
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,625
Perhaps...

15
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,673
she never even sees me as her son.

16
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,056
Very well, you may go now.

17
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:18,762
Yes.

18
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,681
Chou.

19
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:57,231
Kill them!

20
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,758
Kill them.

21
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:02,985
Chou.

22
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,100
Kill them!

23
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:09,906
Kill them!

24
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,640
Zhao Yun.

25
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:51,600
Wu Yu?

26
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,374
How are you?

27
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,375
I am fine.

28
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,957
It's been two years,

29
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,898
how have you been?

30
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,548
Look what I have for you.

31
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,780
Flowers are blooming on the hill,
come on and pick some plum blossoms.

32
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,860
Pretty lady, are you a guest here?

33
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,323
Will you join us?

34
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:20,756
Don't be rude.

35
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:22,497
She is not a guest.

36
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,580
We are not going for the flowers.

37
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:27,175
Go on without me.

38
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:33,979
Ke?

39
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,688
Zhao Yun, don't take this wrongly.

40
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,371
You can stay here all you want,

41
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,260
don't think of yourself
as an outsider.

42
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,025
For me,

43
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,936
you have always been like a family.

44
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,478
You are also...

45
00:04:58,084 --> 00:04:59,964
Go after her if you want.

46
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:01,986
Never mind.

47
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,726
She is Captain Xiao's sister.
Her name is Xiao Ke.

48
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:06,896
She is always so reckless
when she talks.

49
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,298
But on the inside, she is
actually kind and gentle.

50
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,272
I doubt she will be angry
because of this.

51
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:15,366
Wu Yu.

52
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:18,105
You still don't understand
what a girl really wants.

53
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,465
When she is truly
in love with someone,

54
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,189
but he never cares much for her,

55
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,560
she will surely be upset.

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,440
I remember the time
when Qian Yi had to travel far away,

57
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:32,586
so he ordered his men
to sent me a stem of plum blossoms.

58
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,366
I didn't understand at first.

59
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,417
But he explained to me
when he returned.

60
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,348
'In the land full of wonders,

61
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,554
these plum blossoms
shall be my token for you.'

62
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,031
This is a token of love and yearning.

63
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,626
And now she is giving you
this as present.

64
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,820
Don't you see what
she is trying to tell you?

65
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,857
She is not the same as other girls.

66
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,901
Grab onto the chance
when it presents itself,

67
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,835
do not let regret take its place.

68
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,938
Wu Yu, you missed your chance once.

69
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,610
Do not let her down this time.

70
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,193
Ke?

71
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,865
Brother.

72
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,782
-Did someone upset you?
-I am not upset.

73
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:42,559
You on the other hand
have been gloomy lately.

74
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,250
You are always here
and you don't talk to people.

75
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,015
How are you feeling?

76
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
Ke.

77
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,497
If something is bothering you,
you can always let me know.

78
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,855
If you keep it inside your heart,

79
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,381
you might never get
the chance to say it again.

80
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,761
Well, since you talked me into this,

81
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,556
I don't mind letting you know.

82
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,638
Actually, it was you who has been
keeping everything inside your heart.

83
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,807
I wanted to talk to you,
but I don't where do I start.

84
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,050
Brother, Ling Yue is already...

85
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,851
She is gone,

86
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,641
stop thinking about her.

87
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,140
Even you have learned to cheer me up.

88
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,914
It seems like you are
no longer just a child.

89
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,443
Of course.

90
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,136
I know a lot of things.

91
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:41,936
But all of you keep
protecting me like I am a kid.

92
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:46,225
Can you tell me who upset you now?

93
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,159
It's all because of
that stinking Wu Yu!

94
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I asked him to pick
some flowers with me,

95
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,039
but he chased me away.

96
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,315
What?

97
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,122
He chased you out?

98
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,135
I can't allow that,
I should teach him a lesson.

99
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,269
It's all right.

100
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:03,995
He has always been nice to me.

101
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,176
But a pretty lady was there too.

102
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,280
He didn't want to
leave her there by herself.

103
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:10,381
Ke,

104
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,247
be honest with me,
are you in love with Prince Chen?

105
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:14,664
No way!

106
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,963
So, why are you blushing?

107
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,491
Stop being so jealous.

108
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,451
The lady that talked to Prince Chen...

109
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,151
was Princess Zhao Yun.

110
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,076
She is Princess Zhao Yun?

111
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,063
Princess Rong Le mentioned her before.

112
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:33,505
She was married to Chen
for the sake of Northern Realm.

113
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:35,163
She is amazing.

114
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,138
I have been wanting to know her.

115
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,842
I should have give her
a proper welcome.

116
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,196
Are you still mad?

117
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,158
I was never mad at all.

118
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:50,758
It's all because of
that stinking Wu Yu!

119
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,870
Greetings, Prince Chen.

120
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,896
Your Highness.

121
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:04,874
This is the peace treaty signed by
Prince Regent himself.

122
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:09,019
As token of good will, our troops
at the border have retreated.

123
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:11,101
I wonder where Prince Li is right now.

124
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,287
Prince Regent ordered me to hand it
over to His Highness personally.

125
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:20,981
Sir Chang.

126
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,861
What rank do you hold
as of this moment?

127
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,844
I am now the captain of Royal Guards.

128
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,472
You are only a captain.

129
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,897
Why should my brother be summoned
by someone like you?

130
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,241
You should be glad
that I am even here.

131
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,151
If Fu Chou is showing any good will,

132
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,448
he should have come here personally.

133
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,914
Ever since His Highness
came back from Chen,

134
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,521
he was very tired and
is now busy with national affairs.

135
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,697
He doesn't have the time to come here.

136
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:52,766
He doesn't have the time?

137
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
He hurt my brother and
poisoned Rong Le.

138
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,831
And with this insignificant letter,

139
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:01,594
he is trying to get our forgiveness?

140
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,312
My brother and Rong Le may
have a generous heart,

141
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:07,697
but I won't let it pass so easily.

142
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:10,427
Wu Yu, have some manner.

143
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,111
Brother.

144
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,614
I will be accepting
this letter for treaty.

145
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:27,621
My troops in the border
will retreat as well.

146
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,929
Brother.

147
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,054
-You are letting him go?
-Pass a message for me.

148
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,631
Once I have everything in order,

149
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,652
Man Yao, Wu Yu and I will...

150
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,604
pay our father a visit in Zhongshan.

151
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,644
In that case, I take my leave.

152
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,250
-Brother!
-What is it now?

153
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,090
If you have nothing better to do,

154
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,518
I do have a task for you.

155
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:58,945
I am sure you know Man Yao
and I are going to have a wedding.

156
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,854
How are you going to prepare it?

157
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,230
Why are you asking my opinion?

158
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,154
Ask your beloved brother in Zhongshan.

159
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,940
What has he done to
prepare your wedding?

160
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,790
Wu Yu.

161
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,740
Both the north and the south
are withdrawing their troops.

162
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,820
There will be no war at the border.

163
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,475
Prince Li will fix a date...

164
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,537
for his wedding...

165
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,554
 with Consort Rong Le?

166
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,258
A double delight!

167
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,022
A day worth celebrating
for the nation!

168
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,715
Great!

169
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,445
-Great!
-Such a good news!

170
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,220
Great!

171
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,037
<i>Brother Wu You, Princess Rong Le,</i>

172
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:46,743
<i>forgive me for leaving
without a proper farewell.</i>

173
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:50,322
<i>I appreciate your kindness
for taking me in these few days.</i>

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,721
<i>You will always be my family.</i>

175
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:56,271
<i>You taught me how to be brave...</i>

176
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,455
<i>so I could be strong enough...</i>

177
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,454
<i>to leave the shelter you provide...</i>

178
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,409
<i>and live a life of my own.</i>

179
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,047
<i>Me and my child...</i>

180
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,860
<i>will send you our best wishes
from a land far away.</i>

181
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,192
I am surprised,

182
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,054
Zhao Yun is much stronger
than any of us thought.

183
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,930
I am worried because
she is all alone.

184
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,365
And she is expecting a child.

185
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,940
Man Yao, this might be for the best.

186
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,988
Calm down.

187
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,539
I am sure Zhao Yun will
take good care of the child.

188
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:06,973
She will give the child
a normal yet happy life.

189
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:09,277
They won't follow the
footsteps of Qian Yi.

190
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,742
Don't be too worried about this.

191
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:15,816
Think about the child
that you are carrying.

192
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,500
Wu You, do you want our child
to be a boy or a girl?

193
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,338
Either are good.

194
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,760
What matters is we need more children.

195
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,777
They will follow you
like little flies.

196
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,709
They should be following
you like little flies.

197
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,793
You will get your hands
full with them,

198
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:36,261
they would be a great nuisance.

199
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,100
No way.

200
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,959
You are always so patient with
the kids in School of Wisdom.

201
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,302
Besides, I have you by my side.

202
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,482
Man Yao, you have my word.

203
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,643
I will do all I can...

204
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,228
to create a world of
peace for our children.

205
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,448
I will not let them...

206
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,859
suffer the same fate as those children
in School of Wisdom,

207
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:13,797
to be born into
a world of chaos...

208
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,860
and couldn't decide their own fate.

209
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:17,695
Wu You,

210
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,178
I have faith in you.

211
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,248
All I hope for our children...

212
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,359
is for them to be born safely
and watch them grow up.

213
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,193
I want them to have a happy life
with their loved ones.

214
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:34,582
They could witness the peace
of this land.

215
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,860
Your wish will come true.

216
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,140
-This is a good news.
-Great!

217
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,380
The whole nation
should celebrate this.

218
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,128
The south was once
plagued by war,

219
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:44,584
the people lived in suffering.

220
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,889
But the land is now prospering
and people have a quality life.

221
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,780
The peace treaty is ratified.
The civil war is over.

222
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,785
From now on, you don't
need to live in hiding.

223
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,562
You are right.

224
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,527
I blamed my father when I was little.

225
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,930
If he hadn't rush to his death
for those his wishful pipe dream,

226
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,490
I wouldn't have lost my family...

227
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:08,120
and went through so much
pain in the Creed.

228
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,502
But from what I see now,

229
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,750
his dream might finally
come true after all.

230
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:16,938
All thanks to Prince Li and
Consort Rong Le...

231
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:18,712
for executing the
People's Reformation.

232
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,682
Reformation?

233
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,059
You mean Rong Le?

234
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,854
You were cooped up inside the house.

235
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:31,161
You didn't know many of the policies
were Rong Le's ideas.

236
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,681
I heard...

237
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:36,716
she once got her hands on
the Book of Mountains and Rivers.

238
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,185
Indeed.

239
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,201
She lost many things
because of the Book.

240
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,813
When she came back from Chen,

241
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,355
she found the Book once again.

242
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,635
That was truly fortunate.

243
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,131
Xiang Ying, do you still go to
Prince Li's manor often?

244
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:03,404
I am too ashamed to face them.

245
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,647
Let's go.

246
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,247
Fine!

247
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,465
Your Highness, I just
returned from Qingzhou.

248
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,860
The letter for our treaty
has been passed to Prince Li.

249
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,983
He agreed to withdraw the troops.

250
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,263
Send this letter to Prince Li
as soon as possible.

251
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,245
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

252
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,527
Your Highness.

253
00:18:06,657 --> 00:18:09,662
Prince Li will soon
marry Princess Rong Le.

254
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,894
They will be holding a wedding.

255
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,929
Your Highness,

256
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,607
aren't you going to
tell Prince Li about...

257
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,139
the missing of the Emperor?

258
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:43,795
They are getting married.

259
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,779
Let's not spoil the mood
for them with this news.

260
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,142
I don't...

261
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,143
I don't wish to bother them.

262
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,156
How about this?

263
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,214
Keep tracking down my father.

264
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,751
When you found him,
send your men to inform Prince Li.

265
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,403
Yes, I shall go now.

266
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,955
Chang Jian.

267
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,328
Hold on.

268
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:11,776
Come with me.

269
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,353
All of these...

270
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,575
are the stuff Rong Le left in
the Tranquil Garden.

271
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,001
Get your men and
send these to Qingzhou for her.

272
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,876
Yes.

273
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,868
Ke?

274
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,089
This stomachache is killing me!

275
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,900
What's wrong?

276
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:59,114
Stomachache!

277
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,620
You are just fine.

278
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,418
This is a clinic,
leave if you are not sick.

279
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,226
I got this half of a tome for you.

280
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,630
I have tonnes of them laying around.
I don't need another.

281
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,200
But...

282
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,374
Lone Frost Tome?

283
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,755
But this belongs to my master.

284
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,622
I have been searching for years.

285
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,199
Where did you get this?

286
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:29,978
It was from a veteran.

287
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:32,362
He found this half a tome by accident.

288
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,027
He gave this to me as a tribute.

289
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,773
I thought you would like this,

290
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,660
so I am giving it as a gift.

291
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,692
Stop being mad at me
for what happened that day.

292
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,500
It was my fault.
I apologise for that.

293
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,924
I regret every second of it.

294
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,710
I was about to go after you,

295
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,074
but I couldn't leave Zhao Yun
standing alone at the yard.

296
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:56,872
After all, she just lost everything.

297
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,662
You know who Princess Zhao Yun is.

298
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,740
Anyway...

299
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,900
Get out of here, now!

300
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,260
I know it was my fault.

301
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,220
I am sorry, please forgive me.

302
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:17,852
I didn't mean it.

303
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,791
Ke? You accepted my gift!

304
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,409
Why are you still mad at me?

305
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,736
Ke?

306
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:28,319
Ke?

307
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,534
How long has she been sleeping?

308
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,862
Your Highness,

309
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,004
Her Highness has been sleeping
since this afternoon.

310
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,056
-Bring Miss Xiao Ke here.
-Your Highness.

311
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,900
She was here this morning.

312
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,985
She said being narcoleptic
is a normal sign for pregnant women.

313
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:15,851
I will get her right away.

314
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,478
She needs to be groomed have
her meal when she wakes up.

315
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,956
Understood? Heat up the food.

316
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:26,247
Yes.

317
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,179
Change the water in here.

318
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:30,132
-Yes.
-Your medicine has gone cold.

319
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,158
Follow the prescription
and prepare another dose.

320
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:33,354
Yes.

321
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,100
You, stay here.

322
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,810
Tell me,

323
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:44,202
was there anything unusual
about her daily routines?

324
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:03,753
Your Highness.

325
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,889
I heard Consort Rong Le is expecting
a child, I came to pay a visit.

326
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,697
Congratulations, Your Highness.

327
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:15,989
I appreciate the visit.

328
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:20,084
You came just in time,
I have some questions for you.

329
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,672
It's all right, ask away.

330
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,060
How old were you
when the Creed took you in?

331
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,347
I was too young when
they recruited me.

332
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,493
I was an orphan,
I didn't know my exact age.

333
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,201
How was your life in the Creed?

334
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:42,840
The children the Creed took in...

335
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,781
are either orphans or abandoned kids.

336
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,187
The training was harsh and cruel.

337
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,856
In each and every training,

338
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,843
we were divided into teams
to slaughter each other.

339
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,876
Only one from each team...

340
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:57,022
can survive by sending
the others to their deaths.

341
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,061
I was able to survive
because Young Master...

342
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,694
Fu Chou saved me.

343
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,638
Did he went through the same
bloodshed just to survive?

344
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,720
Just the same as us.

345
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,199
That was how he survived.

346
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,997
There was even...

347
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,578
more cruelty than we had.

348
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:21,053
There was a rule in the Creed.

349
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,011
Any who are able to
kill the Young Master...

350
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,020
can regain their freedom and leave.

351
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:26,779
While the rule was in effect,

352
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,180
he was the target of many
assassination attempts.

353
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:30,896
Not only that,

354
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,039
in order to fuse his mind
with more hate,

355
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,058
he had to suffer the pain...

356
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:37,516
of being pierced by hooks.

357
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,620
When we were just kids,

358
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,416
your so-called father hunted me down.

359
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,437
I lost my name and my home.

360
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,985
I was on the run and
there was no shelter for me.

361
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:58,777
Your Highness.

362
00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:01,664
Seeing that Consort Rong Le
is safe and sound,

363
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,980
I shall not take
any more of your time.

364
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,008
I should get going.

365
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,138
Why did you disguised yourself
to sneak into the Man Yin Chamber?

366
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:44,627
Hand this to Rong Le for me.

367
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,981
Are you trying to hurt her again?

368
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,492
I won't do anything to harm her.

369
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:53,839
I have important questions for her.

370
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,343
Please, trust me.

371
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:15,542
I have been sleeping for so long.

372
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,641
After such a long sleep,
you must be starving.

373
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:20,277
Bring in the food.

374
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:28,484
I can't possibly eat so much.

375
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,180
They say your appetite will change
when you are pregnant.

376
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,356
I had no idea what suits
your taste the most.

377
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,626
Ke?

378
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,781
Ke?

379
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:47,098
Ke?

380
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,520
Is there anything wrong with my child?

381
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,665
Ke? How is Man Yao?

382
00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:59,057
It's nothing, both you
and the child are fine.

383
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,358
Both of you are fine.

384
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:08,746
Princess Rong Le, I just remembered
the tonics are still on the stove.

385
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,171
I have to go now.

386
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,940
She looks so distracted,

387
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,933
she must have quarrelled
with Wu Yu again.

388
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,620
Should you check on him?

389
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,289
Enough about him,
take your medicine.

390
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:31,828
Okay.

391
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,892
Ke? What's wrong?

392
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,418
Leave me alone.

393
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:14,855
It's all right.

394
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:17,283
I won't ask.

395
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:19,732
Let it all out.

396
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,798
Wu Yu,

397
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,708
I have a question for you.

398
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,105
I have no idea how I am going
to solve this.

399
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:43,898
What is it?

400
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:45,553
So,

401
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:49,436
if a woman had to choose
between saving herself...

402
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:51,573
and the life of her child,

403
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:53,921
what would be the right choice?

404
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,900
Silly girl.

405
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,318
You are crying because of this?

406
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,300
You are still young,

407
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:03,210
you are not married yet
and have no child.

408
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,567
Thinking about this problem
will only make you anxious.

409
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,796
-You don't understand at all!
-What?

410
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,313
-Your Highness.
-Brother.

411
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,729
Why are you here?

412
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,472
Your Highness.

413
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,454
Princess Rong Le's health
is getting worse by the days...

414
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,309
not because of any illness.

415
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:50,867
She is poisoned.

416
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:53,396
She ordered us to keep you
in the dark.

417
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,938
I got this tome recently.

418
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:58,652
I realised the poison in her body
is actually the Destined Poison.

419
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,056
The cure to this poison...

420
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,100
is to use a golden needle...

421
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:05,813
and transfuse it to the child
during the labour.

422
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,053
With that done, the poison
can be completely cleansed.

423
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,766
But the child...

424
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,038
have to use medical substances
to prolong his life.

425
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,831
The vitals will become weak,

426
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:20,028
he might die at anytime.

427
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,058
Brother.

428
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,813
Don't be too upset.

429
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:35,951
At least we know there is a cure now.

430
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:37,911
As for whether we are using it or not,

431
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,892
let Rong Le make the decision.

432
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:43,252
We cannot let Man Yao
find out about this.

433
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,137
From now on,

434
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,694
only the three of us will
know this secret.

435
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:52,673
Go.

436
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,940
Come on.

437
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,980
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

438
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,782
<i>to melt it.</i>

439
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:14,552
<i>I am destined to fail as I met you.</i>

440
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,460
" Victory for Zongzheng "

441
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,637
<i>I miss you but I can only gaze
at you in silence.</i>

442
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:29,091
<i>You are keeping me out with your care.
Although we are together, I feel lost.</i>

443
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,473
<i>I will wait even if it takes forever.</i>

444
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,370
<i>I endure all the
loneliness just for you.</i>

445
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:44,179
My child, look.

446
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,007
This is what your mother looks like.

447
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:51,051
You will need to keep this in mind.

448
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,452
<i>I will shield you from
the coldness of night.</i>

449
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:04,597
<i>As long as I can be with you,
I'm willing to choose the cold</i>

450
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:06,634
Man Yao.

451
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,500
This statue doesn't
resemble you at all.

452
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,813
Man Yao.

453
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,681
Can we bring the wedding forward?

454
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,380
I can't wait any longer.

455
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,460
Sure.

456
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:37,841
You can have the wedding
anytime you want.

457
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,537
I am fine with your choice.

458
00:32:41,997 --> 00:32:43,322
Actually,

459
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:46,666
we don't really need a grand wedding.

460
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:48,979
I am well aware of...

461
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:51,379
your love for me.

462
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,549
Right.

463
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,159
I recently received the stuffs
Fu Chou sent from Zhongshan.

464
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,403
I even asked the messenger he sent.

465
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,052
There was no letter for you.

466
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,430
We have no news on the Emperor.

467
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,949
Maybe he is still frustrated.

468
00:33:21,414 --> 00:33:23,110
He couldn't put those
feelings into words.

469
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,209
That is why he didn't send us letter.

470
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,968
Do you still...

471
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,310
hate him?

472
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,539
I thought about all the
plottings against us.

473
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:41,264
I bet Fu Yuan is the mastermind.

474
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:43,688
But I fell for her trickery.

475
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,140
I accused him with all the blames
without any evidence.

476
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:50,068
If I had stayed calm,

477
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,076
if I had exposed Fu Yuan's scheme,

478
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,780
maybe all of us would know
the truth sooner.

479
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,550
My mother...

480
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:03,653
would have been...

481
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,925
It's not too late.

482
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,950
As long as we are alive,

483
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:19,633
we can still make it in time.

484
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,002
Ke, the medicine is all dried up.

485
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,888
Princess Rong Le,
what brings you here?

486
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,759
I am sorry for spoiling your tonic.

487
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,071
I will brew another dose for you.

488
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,741
Ke.

489
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,061
I know it all.

490
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,443
I just want to hear it from you.

491
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,613
Princess Rong Le,
don't worry about it.

492
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:33,217
I will think of another way
to save the child.

493
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:37,038
The most pressing matter now
is to cleanse the poison in you.

494
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,375
The child?

495
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:42,877
What's wrong with the child?

496
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:45,834
What happened to my child?

497
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,250
Judging by the look on your faces,

498
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:51,980
I thought I am having another
relapse from the poison.

499
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:55,186
I was worried I might not be able
watch him grow up.

500
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:57,356
What happened to my child?

501
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:01,571
Tell me! Say something!

502
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,320
Tell me the truth, Ke!

503
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:06,744
Ke!

504
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,533
This is the only way
to remove the poison.

505
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,662
Princess Rong Le!

506
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,245
Princess Rong Le?

507
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,489
This Destined Poison...

508
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,491
actually has a cure?

509
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,940
Did Wu You...

510
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,580
know about this?

511
00:37:49,663 --> 00:37:51,039
Man Yao.

512
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,156
Where were you just now?

513
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,533
Man Yao?

514
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:03,423
What's wrong?

515
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,873
Can you feel it?

516
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,068
I hope our child...

517
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,588
can be away...

518
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:49,171
from all the harms and pain.

519
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:54,048
I want him to live happily
for the rest of his life.

520
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,728
Wu You.

521
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:01,209
Do you understand what I meant?

522
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,129
You know everything?

523
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,925
-Man Yao.
-I am sorry.

524
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:17,788
Please, forgive me.

525
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,651
I can't agree to your plan.

526
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,250
Not a chance.

527
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:27,696
This is our child.

528
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:30,527
We can't be so cruel.

529
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,654
What about me?

530
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,626
So, you are willing
to leave me behind...

531
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,946
and be so cruel to me?

532
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,747
I couldn't leave you.

533
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,555
But I cannot bring myself
to trade his life for mine.

534
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,902
Man Yao.

535
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,580
Listen to me.

536
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:09,410
We can figure out a perfect plan.

537
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,378
We can have the child first.

538
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,620
Cure yourself of the poison
for the time being,

539
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:20,624
Ke will use every remedy she has
to extent our child's life.

540
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,057
Trust me, we will have time
to look for a cure for him.

541
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:27,135
-We will make it work, trust me.
-No!

542
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,750
I am willing to take the risk,

543
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,406
but I can't let our child
be in danger.

544
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,980
I have suffered enough
from this poison.

545
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:43,456
I can't allow my child
to suffer this all over again.

546
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:47,498
Wu You, think about this.

547
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,995
What if our child comes
into this world...

548
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,426
and in the best days of his life,

549
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,717
he finds the love of his life...

550
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,782
but he has to bid
this world farewell?

551
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,666
Don't you know
how cruel this is for him?

552
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,980
<i>After all of those hardships,
we are no longer young.</i>

553
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,460
<i>I'm doomed to live
in loneliness forever.</i>

554
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,869
<i> It's bad but I can't help it.</i>

555
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:35,380
<i>Are you suffering just like me?
Are you in turmoil as well?</i>

556
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,283
This is why you carved this statue?

557
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,903
So that in the future...

558
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,271
I could tell him...

559
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:45,313
his mother has died?

560
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,810
Is that it?

561
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,401
<i>Let's drink to forget our worries
and bottoms up for...</i>

562
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:17,915
<i>you who have turned Gray.</i>
