00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,380
Episode 31

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,140
Why do you keep following me?

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,900
You are going wherever I go,

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,860
can't you make your own decision?

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,020
-This is not fun at all.
-Are you going to gather the herbs?

7
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,860
Your Highness, movement at
General Fu's manor.

8
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,740
-What is it?
-Miss Xiao just came out,

9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,540
the guards are following her.

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,660
That fool.

11
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,660
Let's go.

12
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,940
Miss Xiao.

13
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,260
You are going
to the eastern outskirts,

14
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,180
how do we end up in the western city?

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,300
I didn't mention the
eastern outskirts.

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,900
I said western outskirts.

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,180
Did you hear that?
Did you get it?

18
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,500
Listen closely, I am going
to western outskirts for herbs.

19
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,500
It's the bamboo forest
at western outskirts.

20
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,260
Let's go and gather some herbs!

21
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,180
Hey, pay for that!

22
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,980
<i>What is taking him so long?</i>

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,940
Where is she?

24
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,940
Search for her!
Don't let her get away!

25
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,140
Yes!

26
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,700
-Split up and search!
-Yes!

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,060
You actually came here.

28
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,620
Of course.

29
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,260
With my wits, I can easily
tell you are in trouble.

30
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,580
So, I came to your rescue.

31
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,860
You silly girl,  what have
you got yourself into?

32
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,380
Why are the guards after you?

33
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,260
How would I know what
they want with me?

34
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,620
They started following me
after I came out from the manor.

35
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,020
I couldn't shake them off.

36
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,220
Same goes for the garden entrance.
Soldiers are blocking it.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,860
I have been locked up for three days.

38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,940
I must come out before
boredom kills me.

39
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,940
What about Man Yao?

40
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,700
She couldn't get out.

41
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,340
She sent me to get help.

42
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,820
I saw you at the market
and I thought you can help.

43
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,220
Nicely done.

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,220
You actually know I can help you.

45
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,740
But judging from the circumstances,
there is no other way.

46
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,620
We must charge right in there.

47
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,260
While Fu Chou is gone,

48
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,300
I can get reinforcement
and save Man Yao.

49
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,300
Okay, I will inform
the Princess right away.

50
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,940
Where are you going?

51
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,460
Why would you want to
go back into that hellhole?

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,580
Come with me.

53
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,100
What is taking Xiao Ke so long?

54
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,780
Maybe she is compromised.

55
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,580
What do we do now?

56
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,820
Xiao Ke was our last hope to get help.

57
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,900
I can't just wait here.
I need to escape.

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,460
This is still a safe place.

59
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,980
You can stay here for now.

60
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,380
Your Highness,

61
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,380
you are going by yourself?

62
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes.

63
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,940
Wait here.

64
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,980
I will find a way to
get you out of here.

65
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,340
Be careful.

66
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,940
Prince Chen,
what is the meaning of this?

67
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
Someone broke into my house.

68
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,780
I have been tracking the thief.

69
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,940
I found out the thief is
in General Fu's manor.

70
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,020
Stand aside, I am going in
for investigation.

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,740
I am afraid you are mistaken.

72
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,340
Your house is heavily guarded,
why would anyone break in?

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,900
What thief would be bold enough
to hide in here?

74
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

75
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,700
I am certain of it.

76
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,980
I must search this manor.

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't you dare get into my way!

78
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,860
Search!

79
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,500
-Search!
-Yes!

80
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,020
Someone is in here.

81
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,940
Come out!

82
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,340
-Come!
-Let go of me!

83
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,060
Your Highness, we found a girl.

84
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,740
Ling Yue?

85
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,460
-Let go of her.
-Prince Chen.

86
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,460
-Where is Man Yao?
-She couldn't wait for help,

87
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,340
so she got out on her own.

88
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,060
She escaped?

89
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,020
If she is in a hurry to leave,

90
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,860
it must be about something important.

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,220
Could it be about my brother?

92
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,780
<i>No one is living in this shack.</i>

93
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,660
<i>Why is someone sending food here?</i>

94
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,220
Your Master, have some food.

95
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,140
<i>Fu Chou?</i>

96
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,380
<i>Isn't he on the march
with His Majesty?</i>

97
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,940
<i>Why is he still here?</i>

98
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,620
How was his resolve after I left?

99
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,660
Is he wavered?

100
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,860
Not at all.

101
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,940
He longed for that position.

102
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,980
Now that the opportunity
presented itself,

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,700
he will surely hold onto it.

104
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,860
Young Master.

105
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,860
He is much more avaricious
than we expected.

106
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,460
If he gets what he wanted eventually,

107
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,300
not only will he kill
Zongzheng Wu You,

108
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,940
your life will be at risk too.

109
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,740
He wants to kill me? I doubt...

110
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,660
he is capable of that.

111
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,260
Keep an eye on that Crown Prince.

112
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,780
This is the moment when
all of our patience is tested.

113
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,100
Tell him to be patient.

114
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,500
I don't want him to ruin my plan.

115
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,340
I understand.
You need not worry.

116
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,900
What's the matter?
How is your wound?

117
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,180
It's been years.
I'll be fine.

118
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,620
I believe this will be the last time.

119
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,940
Soon,

120
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,460
Zongzheng Wu You will
experience the pain I suffered.

121
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,380
It's been over two decades,

122
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,340
over seven thousand nights.

123
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,820
Not a second goes by without me
waiting for this day to come.

124
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,220
-He and his father owe me this.
-Xiang Ying?

125
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,980
Lady Rong Le, come with me.

126
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,780
I am sorry but you must
hide in here for now.

127
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,220
Ling Yue is still at the manor.

128
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,860
Can you get her out of there?

129
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,620
General Fu will soon
realise you are gone.

130
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,340
The manor will be heavily secured.
I doubt I can even get inside.

131
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,500
But don't worry.
Ling Yue is your friend,

132
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,100
General Fu won't hurt her.

133
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,260
You have my thanks.

134
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,700
Please, do not say that.

135
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,300
Like I said, your wish is my command.

136
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,700
I will not regret my decision.

137
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,820
<i>After the attack at Lake Qingliang,</i>

138
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,540
<i>General Fu punished me.</i>

139
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,740
<i>He left me at the shack.</i>

140
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,540
<i>No one came to my help.</i>

141
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,660
Xiang Ying?

142
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,620
Xiang Ying?

143
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,420
Xiang Ying?

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,700
You were following Fu Chou's
order for the attack.

145
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,780
But I never thought he would
hurt you so badly.

146
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,420
This is too much for punishment.

147
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,020
It's his order.

148
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,580
He wants me to keep you
safe at all cost.

149
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,540
I failed my duty and
failed to protect you.

150
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,260
I deserve this punishment.

151
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,100
I have no complaint for it.

152
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,740
But you saved me despite
what I did in the past.

153
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,980
I am eternally grateful.

154
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,100
From now on, I shall follow you.

155
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,020
I will give it my all to serve you.

156
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,620
Xiang Ying, did you know
Fu Chou is still here?

157
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,660
I didn't know.

158
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,060
He secretly came back
and hide in the shack.

159
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,820
What is he planning?

160
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,500
He no longer trusts me.

161
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,580
I have no access to these
important information.

162
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,220
Do you know anything
about his background?

163
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,340
I swear I will serve you
to repay your kindness.

164
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,260
I can do whatever it takes
to fulfil your order.

165
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,820
But he was once the master
I sworn to serve.

166
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,180
The General's past...

167
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,340
is not something I can betray to you.

168
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,340
Very well, I shall not pry.

169
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,180
Get up.

170
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,220
I have an important favour for you.

171
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,820
This is the tactical layout plan
I found in Fu Chou's study.

172
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,580
The troops deployed inside and
outside the capital are marked.

173
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,940
I overheard Fu Chou's
conversation with Hen Xiang.

174
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,020
They have an agreement with
the Crown Prince for a mutiny.

175
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
What is your next plan?

176
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,580
I need to stop this.

177
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,980
-You want to expose his plan?
-No.

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,140
I must stop this tragedy
from happening.

179
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,460
No matter how carefully planned
a mutiny is,

180
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,500
there are sure to be casualties.

181
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,900
Bring this and rush to Prince Li.

182
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,260
Tell him what happened.

183
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,740
What about you?

184
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,060
I am going to the main camp
and talk to His Majesty.

185
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,140
Okay.

186
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,020
I will do as you ordered.
Please, watch your back.

187
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,900
Rong Le must have gone
to the south for Wu You.

188
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,420
Bring her back to me.

189
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,020
If you fail,

190
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
only death awaits you.

191
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,500
Yes.

192
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,740
Why isn't His Highness here yet?

193
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,100
The Court started hours ago.

194
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,940
Yet the Crown Prince is still absent.

195
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,060
What exactly happened?

196
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,700
Right, what happened?

197
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,940
The Crown Prince arrives!

198
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,460
Long live the Crown Prince.

199
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,660
At ease.

200
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

201
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,540
I stayed up all night
to read through your scrolls.

202
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,500
My father's duty is not an easy task.

203
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,300
As his son,

204
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,260
I couldn't do much to help him.

205
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,100
That is indeed my fault.

206
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,940
You made it sounds so noble.

207
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,060
You were clearly drunk last night.

208
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,100
I bet you couldn't
wake up this morning.

209
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
-You...
-Isn't that right?

210
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,100
Ever since His Majesty
left with the army,

211
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,940
the Eastern Palace has been
filled with joy and ecstasy.

212
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,660
Do you really think none
would find out?

213
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,020
You...

214
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,140
Your Highness,
I have a plan to suggest.

215
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,140
-Speak.
-Your Highness.

216
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,260
His Majesty leads the march.

217
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,540
But the army needs more provision.

218
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,100
The eastern region
was struck by disaster.

219
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,660
The yield is much less
than previous years.

220
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,340
All the people have now
are the seeds for planting crops.

221
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,940
It's almost impossible
to get extra provisions.

222
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,700
What's wrong with seeds?

223
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,300
The warriors are fighting at
the borders, they can't get starved.

224
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,620
Besides, my father is leading
the army himself.

225
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,940
We will take everything,
including the seeds.

226
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,580
Yes, Your Highness.

227
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,260
We cannot let His Majesty and
the warriors get starved.

228
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,740
But this concerns the harvest
of the following year.

229
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,780
If Your Highness ignore
the consequences...

230
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,220
and force the people
to hand over the seeds,

231
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,220
I am afraid without the seeds
to plant the crops,

232
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,220
we might cause an uprising.

233
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,460
If there is an uprising,
just suppress it.

234
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
We have thousands of soldiers.

235
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,580
A few farmers can't harm us.

236
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,620
Absurd! How could you
make such decision?

237
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,740
We may have thousands of soldiers,

238
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,220
but the people is the foundation
of our nation.

239
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,060
Not only are you going
to take their food,

240
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,580
you even threaten to kill them.

241
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,460
You are nothing more than a tyrant!

242
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,300
You are the merciful one.

243
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,500
Then you should get the provision.

244
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,980
-But...
-Send out my words.

245
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,660
Prince Chen will be in charge of
getting the provisions.

246
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,140
He has ten days.

247
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,580
If he fails, punishment
by martial laws.

248
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,340
-You...
-Dismiss!

249
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,540
But this is...

250
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,180
General Fu arrives!

251
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,580
At your service, Your Majesty.

252
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,940
I just came back from the patrol.

253
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,020
I was informed Your Majesty
wanted me to join the meal.

254
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,860
I was surprised and
worried at the same time.

255
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,420
Sir Fu,

256
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,740
you mean having a meal with me
is too formal for you?

257
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,060
No, Your Majesty.

258
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,620
I am grateful for
Your Majesty's kind offer.

259
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,540
We are in a camp, not the palace.

260
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,980
Formality is not needed.

261
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,260
Have you seat.

262
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,580
Much appreciated, Your Majesty.

263
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,660
Our priority for this battle
is the pre-emptive strike.

264
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,580
We need to be one step ahead.

265
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,700
Our army marches before
the enemy does.

266
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,180
We need to hasten
the march afterwards.

267
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,500
General Fu, do you have
any plan for this battle?

268
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,900
I think Your Majesty's plan
is well thought.

269
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,860
I went on countless battles
when I was young.

270
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,660
I claimed many victories.

271
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,740
I still carry the ambition.

272
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,500
But age got the better of me.

273
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,740
It can't be helped if I feel
the lack of strength in myself.

274
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,580
General Fu, you are young and strong.
You are a great warrior.

275
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,540
With so many years of experience
in leading the troops,

276
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,700
you should be giving me
advice on the strategy.

277
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

278
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,380
Your Majesty, we have reports to make.

279
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,460
-Let them in.
-Yes.

280
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,580
We left in a hurry and
didn't carry enough provisions.

281
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,060
We have only left for days.

282
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,340
But the provisions are
what make the army whole.

283
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,300
Precautions are needed.

284
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,700
General Fu, write a letter for me
to the capital.

285
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,340
Urge the Crown Prince to get ready.

286
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,260
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

288
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,220
Your Majesty, we have reports...

289
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,500
General Fu.

290
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,060
You may leave now.

291
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,140
Yes.

292
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,260
Generals.

293
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,340
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

294
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,100
Your Majesty.

295
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,780
Have a seat.

296
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,540
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

297
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,100
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

298
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,780
His Majesty is not feeling well.

299
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,220
-Get the royal physician now!
-No!

300
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,420
It's been a long time
since I led the troops.

301
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,100
We left the palace in a hurry.

302
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,060
I am simply not used
to the environment. I am fine.

303
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,340
If you summon the royal physician now,

304
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,900
it will draw attentions.

305
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,060
The morale of the army will waver.

306
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,260
But Your Majesty's health
comes before everything.

307
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,020
Your Majesty was feeling unwell
in the palace.

308
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,100
The main camp of the army
is even more crude.

309
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,260
The march could be tiring.
I am worried for you.

310
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,020
Your Majesty,
maybe we should turn back.

311
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,180
Imbecile!

312
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,660
-Your Majesty.
-The army is marching.

313
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,660
We cannot turn back during a march.

314
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,820
If someone had said the same thing,

315
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,300
I would have punished him
for disrupting the morale.

316
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,660
I apologise, Your Majesty.

317
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,900
I apologise for the mistake.

318
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,660
Please forgive me.

319
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,020
At ease.

320
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,620
What you have to report, Generals?

321
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,060
Your Majesty.

322
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,980
Who is it?

323
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,940
Insolent woman. This is the army base,
you cannot enter.

324
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,940
Leave now!

325
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,340
I am the wife of General Fu Chou.

326
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,980
I have an urgent report
for His Majesty.

327
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,220
Inform him now!

328
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,180
If you delayed this
important information,

329
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,260
you will pay with your life!

330
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,180
These two strongholds are crucial.

331
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,980
We need to take down
these strongholds.

332
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,340
With them out of the way,

333
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,460
the Wei army will be
pushed to a corner.

334
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,820
Your Majesty, a woman claims
to be General Fu's wife.

335
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,020
She wishes to see you.

336
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,540
Rong Le?

337
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,220
Why is she here?

338
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,180
Eunuch Chen.

339
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,540
-Your Majesty.
-See if it really is her.

340
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,380
If she is here, bring her to me.

341
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,460
Don't let Fu Chou see you.

342
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,940
Yes, Your Majesty.
Consider it done.

343
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,900
Generals, you may go now.

344
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

346
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,820
At ease.

347
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,740
Much appreciated.

348
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,780
Eunuch Chen, keep watch outside.

349
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,300
Yes.

350
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,180
Did something happen
back in the capital?

351
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
I came here...

352
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,620
to advise you to withdraw the army.

353
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,860
When the people know peace
and everything is calmed,

354
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,500
we can still take down Wei.

355
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,580
Who sent you to tell me these?

356
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,060
-Your Majesty.
-The outcome of this campaign...

357
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,260
will decide the fate
of the Northern Realm.

358
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,820
I planned this for so long,
I can't possibly withdraw now.

359
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,260
If you came after the main force.

360
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,020
to try what Wu You did...

361
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,140
and persuade me to
cancel the campaign,

362
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,460
then don't waste your time.

363
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,380
-Go home.
-That is not what I came for.

364
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,820
There are some situations
in the capital.

365
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,300
The Crown Prince is
conspiring with others...

366
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,300
to launch a mutiny while you are away.

367
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,740
Isn't this weird?

368
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,060
Princess Rong Le came
all the way here.

369
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,660
But she didn't go to Fu Chou.

370
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
-She is meeting His Majesty instead.
-This is odd.

371
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,060
Did something happen in the capital?

372
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,260
I bet this has something
to do with Prince Li.

373
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,660
If Fu Chou and Prince Li
stand against each other,

374
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,180
which side will the Princess choose?

375
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,100
Who cares? Our duty is to serve
the Emperor and win this war.

376
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,580
Don't worry about the other matters.

377
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,980
You are right.

378
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,300
The Crown Prince
is working with someone?

379
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,540
Impossible.

380
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,100
I have everything ready before
I left for the march.

381
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,300
The Armour Troops stay in Zhongshan.

382
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,700
Fu Chou is right by my side.

383
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,620
The Armour Troops won't
make any sudden move.

384
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,460
The command of Royal Army
is with Wu Yu.

385
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,940
Wu You will secretly deploy...

386
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,460
the army from the south
to the capital as precaution.

387
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,500
If the Crown Prince
tries anything foolish,

388
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,260
he would be digging his own grave.

389
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,220
General Fu is here?

390
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,980
This isn't right.

391
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,860
I saw him in the manor
before I came here.

392
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,660
Fu Chou is in his manor?

393
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,860
Impossible.
I just summoned him moments ago.

394
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,220
General Fu.

395
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,460
General Fu, why are you here?

396
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,820
His Majesty is planning
the strategies inside.

397
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,940
No one should bother him.

398
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,060
If there is anything,
please come again tomorrow.

399
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Your Majesty.

400
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,460
I have urgent report to make.

401
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,900
General Fu, His Majesty
didn't say anything.

402
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,700
Perhaps you should
come again tomorrow.

403
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
The military affair cannot be delayed.

404
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,940
Pardon my intrusion.

405
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,180
General Fu!
You cannot go in there!

406
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,460
General Fu!

407
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,820
Get out!

408
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,340
At your service, Your Majesty.

410
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,860
What is so urgent?

411
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,820
What is so urgent that
you ignore my order...

412
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,580
and charge into my camp?

413
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,580
Weather Prophet Qin forecasts that...

414
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,660
there will be a downpour tomorrow.

415
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,420
It will go on for two days.

416
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,540
Our camp is located in a lowland.

417
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,020
I think we should be ready
to leave tonight.

418
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,380
Before the downpour arrives,

419
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,980
we must find another spot
for our main camp.

420
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,140
That is our best option.

421
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,620
We shall proceed as you planned.

422
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,540
Please grant me the Tiger Emblem.

423
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,340
I shall deploy the troops tonight.

424
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,620
Very well.

425
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,060
Order General Li, General Wei
and the other officers...

426
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,300
to my camp to discuss it.

427
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,060
I will see to this matter myself.

428
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,460
General Fu.

429
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,700
You are bold enough
to disobey my order.

430
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,660
What do you plan to do
with the Tiger Emblem?

431
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,260
You gave me the order
when we were having the meal.

432
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,380
You want me to assist you.

433
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,500
The march is tiring.

434
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,500
Your Majesty is getting old.

435
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,020
Relocating the main camp...

436
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,220
should be left to me instead.

437
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,660
Your Majesty.

438
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,500
Please grant me the Tiger Emblem.

439
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,100
You really are a devoted officer.

440
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,060
You remember every word I told you.

441
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,460
Do you still remember...

442
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,460
when you returned victorious...

443
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,540
after you pacified the skirmish
at the south?

444
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,020
We had a tour around the
Royal Garden together.

445
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,700
I told you that...

446
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,780
you remind me of my younger self.

447
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,900
Of course I remember.

448
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,820
Your Majesty values my talent.

449
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,180
I will remember that till
the day I die.

450
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,260
Liar!

451
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,900
We never go to the
Royal Garden together!

452
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,140
You are not Fu Chou!
Who are you?

453
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Guards!

454
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,140
Guards!

455
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,540
-Yes.
-Search for the girl.

456
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,900
Yes!

457
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,060
Rong Le came without permission.

458
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,100
What did she tell you?

459
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,340
What made you suspect my identity?

460
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,260
You are right.

461
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,300
I never went to the
Royal Garden with you.

462
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,780
But I do remember that...

463
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,620
you once told me...

464
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,660
you looked a lot like me
when you were younger.

465
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,540
Do you remember that?

466
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,900
You...

467
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,740
General, she is not here.

468
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,100
Where is Rong Le?

469
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,540
Where did she go?

470
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,220
She...

471
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,180
She is gone.

472
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,220
She is gone.

473
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,100
General Fu, everything is in place.

474
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,060
All the entrances are sealed off.

475
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,740
What exactly are you planning?

476
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,060
Guards!

477
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,620
Stop wasting your time.

478
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,780
All the officers in this camp...

479
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,180
are working for me now.

480
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,980
General Fu, a letter from your manor.

481
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,140
Send out my order.

482
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,340
Split up and search for Rong Le.

483
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
Remember.

484
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,780
Capture her alive.

485
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,380
-Yes!
-You...

486
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,420
You...

487
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,540
What did you do to me?

488
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,780
Why do I feel so weak?

489
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,940
I can't even muster any strength.

490
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,020
Your Majesty, calm down.

491
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,660
Fear not.

492
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,460
This is just a special brew from
the royal physician.

493
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,900
He used two different herbs...

494
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,060
to mix into your meals.

495
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,780
It will render you immobile for now.

496
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,780
You will live.

497
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,060
How dare you!

498
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,420
Who are you?

499
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,540
Even if you really are Fu Chou,

500
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,060
I have rewarded you
and granted you ranks.

501
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,380
I made you the first rank general.

502
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,540
I gave you the right to command.

503
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,980
I gave you the reward you are due.

504
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Why did you conspire
with Western Qi...

505
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,180
and try to kill me?

506
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,140
That is a good question.

507
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,580
Your Majesty, don't you remember?

508
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,020
You once sent your men after a child.

509
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,100
You are Fu Yuan's son?

510
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,020
Impossible.

511
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,940
That child is dead.

512
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,820
Captain Xiang said...

513
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,100
the child fell into the river.

514
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,340
Please understand that...

515
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,260
this is known as
'rebirth from the ashes'.

516
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,540
If you hadn't thought he was dead,

517
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,180
how would he survive?

518
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,220
He would have died.

519
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,420
So you joined the army...

520
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,780
and climbed up the ranks...

521
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,620
just to have revenge on me?

522
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,020
Fu Chou?

523
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,420
A name of vengeance.

524
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,300
I never expect it to
have such meaning.

525
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,700
You are not my son!

526
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
I raised you in
the Cold Palace for years.

527
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,300
That was more than merciful for you.

528
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,460
Blame Fu Yuan if you must!

529
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,860
Fu Yuan set you up...

530
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,300
because you betrayed her first!

531
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,980
You are not Fu Chou.

532
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,460
No one...

533
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,140
would address his mother by name.

534
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,180
Who are you?

535
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,420
You...

536
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,740
are as disgusting as you were before.

537
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,420
You are the eunuch that served
Fu Yuan, you are Lin Shen!

538
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,740
So, you still remember me.

539
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,300
If you remember who I am,

540
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,820
you should be aware of...

541
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,260
how cruel you were to me and Fu Yuan!

542
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,260
Do you remember?

543
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,580
Now that you know who I really am,

544
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,780
I cannot allow the others...

545
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,300
to find out.

546
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,900
Open your mouth.

547
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,380
Open your mouth.

548
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,820
Where is the Tiger Emblem?

549
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,380
You...

550
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,620
You always thought...

551
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,780
you have control over everything.

552
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,900
But you never realise...

553
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,260
the whole army...

554
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,820
is now under my command.

555
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,140
Guards!

556
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,700
-General.
-Keep watch here.

557
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,340
No one enters or leaves.

558
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Yes.

559
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,260
Your Majesty?

560
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,980
Your Majesty, how you feel?

561
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,180
Are you all right?
Your Majesty?

562
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,540
Your Majesty?

563
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,660
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

564
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,260
Your Majesty?

565
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,020
Your Majesty?

566
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,540
Your Majesty?

567
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,180
I am taking you out of here.

568
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,500
Wu...

569
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,020
You...

570
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,540
Wu You?

571
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,100
You want me to go to Wu You...

572
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,020
and tell him what happened here?

573
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,100
Lady Yun...

574
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,300
Lady Yun's tomb?

575
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,300
The jade...

576
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,340
There is someone suspicious.
Search over there.

577
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,580
-Yes.
-Your Majesty.

578
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,100
I am taking you with me.

579
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,700
Your Highness, this is
His Majesty's order.

580
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,620
You should leave now.

581
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,820
The camp is under their control.

582
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,340
Leave before it's too late.

583
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,780
You can't escape if you
take him with you.

584
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,180
I can stay and look after His Majesty.

585
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,020
Prince, go before you ran out of time.

586
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,980
But you will be in grave danger.

587
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,900
My life doesn't matter.

588
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,660
I hope Your Highness...

589
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,500
won't let His Majesty's trust...

590
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,620
and Prince Li's love for you
go to waste.

591
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,100
-Your Highness.
-No, I can't.

592
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,180
I must take you out of here.

593
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,540
Go, Princess. Just go.

594
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,740
You are out of time.

595
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,580
Princess, just go!

596
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,340
Stop right there!

597
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Stop.

598
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,700
Report!

599
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,820
Lieutenant, Prince Fan Yang
has returned.

600
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,300
What? Inform General Fu right now!

601
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,580
-I will stall him.
-Yes!

602
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,140
Prince Fan Yang returns,
who dare block his way?

603
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,540
Order from the General.
No one shall enter the camp.

604
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,020
His Majesty is in the camp.

605
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,700
Which general gave the order?

606
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,660
Stand aside and make way!

607
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,780
His Majesty appointed me
as the vanguard...

608
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,820
and must be deployed
to the border against our enemy.

609
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,900
But there have been some situations.

610
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,100
I must report to His Majesty now!

611
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,140
But someone told me
the camp is sealed off.

612
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,180
Not even I am allow to enter.

613
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,700
Is it true?

614
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,180
Your Highness misunderstood.

615
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,100
It was His Majesty that
gave us the order.

616
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,220
We didn't mean to stop you.

617
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,340
Princess Rong Le, General Fu's wife...

618
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,340
came into the camp without permission
and obstructed our operation.

619
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,580
His Majesty is furious and
wishes to punish her.

620
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,980
But she got away.

621
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,580
We couldn't find her.

622
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,860
We are ordered to search for her.

623
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,020
-Princess Rong Le?
-Assassin!

624
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,460
Stop right there!

625
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,460
Arrest him!

626
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,100
Stop!

627
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,300
Your Majesty!

628
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Your Majesty, what happened to you?

629
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,380
Brother, what is going on?

630
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,220
What happened here?
Who was the assassin?

631
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,300
Brother?Guards!

632
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,700
Who was it?

633
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,860
-Your Majesty?
-Summon the physician!

634
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,140
Yes.

635
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,980
Your Majesty?

636
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,700
Your Majesty?

637
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,500
What is going on?

638
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,780
What happened?

639
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,700
Who was the assassin?
