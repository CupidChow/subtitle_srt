00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:32,665
Episode 15

3
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,417
Here, have some water.

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,080
Before the soldiers catch up to us,

5
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
we need to plan our next move.

6
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,819
Wherever you go, I will follow.

7
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,480
Same goes for us.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,551
The effect of the drug is fading.

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,265
Don't worry about me.

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,720
However,

11
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,042
I think we should split up...

12
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:06,736
or we'll all be arrested.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,572
Long Yue is right.

14
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,788
We are in the same boat,
we are sisters in arms.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,808
Everyone needs to
have her own goals.

16
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,790
You shouldn't follow me
and give up on your future.

17
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:21,397
Princess, where are you going?

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,285
I don't know.

19
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,704
I am no longer a princess.

20
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,371
I once thought...

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,320
Western Qi is where my home is...

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,320
and the Northern Realm
is where my duty calls.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,892
But now,

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,053
there is no place for me anywhere.

25
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,687
The world is vast, there will be
a safe harbour for us.

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
Miss Chen Yu.

27
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:52,094
Are you planning to travel the land
and learn the way of the lute?

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,005
I am going to Chen.

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,654
I heard the music there
vigorous and passionating.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
It's much different
from the music here.

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,431
What about you, Xiao Wei?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,218
I am...

33
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:02,821
I am going to Western Qi.

34
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:06,275
I worked for Western Qi
in the Teahouse for years.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,558
But I never knew what
the land is like.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,338
Speaking of which,

37
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,828
Your Highness,
it reminds me of Lian Xin.

38
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,336
I wonder how is her life
with her husband.

39
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,346
I have no attachment for Western Qi.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
However, while I am still young,

41
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,661
I wish the see the places
I have never been to before.

42
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,601
Not bad.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,406
The horizon is endless.

44
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,250
We must not bind ourselves
in this small land.

45
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:38,179
I pretended to be a
merchant for so long,

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,227
but I never got the chance
to visit any places, what a shame.

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,750
Long Yue, will you come with me...

48
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,664
and witness the wonders of the world?

49
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:48,172
Certainly.

50
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,203
In that case, I bid
all of you farewell.

51
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,860
We will each go our separate ways.

52
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,804
Nothing will ever change,
we will meet again one day.

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,410
Come.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,240
Brother, I'll lead the men
and go after them.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Not even the owl can sense them.
This is our last bet.

56
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,548
You take the right
and I take the middle.

57
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,170
-Make haste.
-Yes.

58
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:21,515
Man Yao!

59
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,602
Run, they are catching up to us.

60
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:28,978
Run!

61
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,880
The assassins from
Creed of Vengeance.

62
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:29,957
Get on the horses, keep searching.

63
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:35,240
-Long Yue.
-Hurry up.

64
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,400
Brother?

65
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:57,607
What's wrong?

66
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,296
Do you think I am gone?

67
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,990
I should have seen this coming.

68
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,361
You lied to me again and again.

69
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:13,265
You will surely deceive me once more.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,640
Trusting you was a mistake.

71
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,520
Not bad.

72
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
Before I get the Book of
Mountains and Rivers,

73
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,898
I will never let you escape my grasp.

74
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,793
What do you want with the book?

75
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,113
You lied to me.

76
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:34,222
You said you want it
to save Western Qi,

77
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,462
to strengthen the army
and help the people.

78
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,878
But the truth is you conspired
with Fu Chou...

79
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,504
and lied to both sides.

80
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,449
You used the alliance as a cover...

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
for all of your evil plans.

82
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,040
Have you ever considered the outcomes?
If the war breaks out,

83
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,452
the people of Western Qi
will be ravaged by chaos.

84
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,649
None of these is your concern.

85
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,760
As long as you hand over the book,

86
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,506
return to Zhongshan
and marry Fu Zhou,

87
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:02,387
a year from now,

88
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,611
everything will be over.

89
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,615
I will create a distraction.

90
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,174
When the spy of Western Qi
becomes a traitor,

91
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:19,777
I am sure you know what
the outcome will be.

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,012
Run, leave me!

93
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,474
Brother.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,640
Do you really want
Long Yue to die for you?

95
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,000
Honour and loyalty
can never coexist,

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,897
Your Majesty, Your Highness,
this shall be my last wish!

97
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,200
Long Yue!

98
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
Long Yue!

99
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,578
-Long Yue!
-Run, run while you can.

100
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,624
-Long Yue!
-Run.

101
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,336
Long Yue!

102
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,975
Long Yue!

103
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:15,671
Long Yue!

104
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,384
Long Yue!

105
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,392
Long Yue!

106
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,962
Rong Le.

107
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:03,698
Stop resisting.

108
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,738
You will never get what you want.

109
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:31,860
I lied to you about the book.

110
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,158
I never found it.

111
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,160
You will get it over my dead body.

112
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:45,685
Even without the book,

113
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,133
you must return to Fu Chou...

114
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,535
and fulfil your duty.

115
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,880
Then all he will ever get
from me is a dead corpse.

116
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,412
Bring them in.

117
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:12,230
You...

118
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,635
Long Yue is already dead.

119
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,971
Do you honestly want these people...

120
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,137
to die for your sake?

121
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,499
Your Majesty, I left the trace for...

122
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,593
Princess!

123
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,671
Princess, save me!
Princess!

124
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:40,532
What are you waiting for?
Keep it going!

125
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,360
Princess!

126
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:44,815
Stop!

127
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:07,284
Please, spare their lives.

128
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,980
They have nothing to do with this.

129
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,890
They don't know any details.

130
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,510
I will go with you to Zhongshan.

131
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,645
I will marry Fu Chou.

132
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,240
Whatever you want of me,

133
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,589
I will do it.

134
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Very well,

135
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,560
let's go.

136
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:39,859
Man Yao? What happened here?

137
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,040
By order of the Empress,

138
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,377
from now on, we will
be serving Your Highness.

139
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,520
We wish you all the joy
for your wedding with General Fu.

140
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:46,930
We are grateful for
Her Majesty's courtesy.

141
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:48,484
Leave the stuffs here.

142
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,449
This wedding robe is so beautiful.

143
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Nonsense, it's not the robe,

144
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,226
it's the Princess that is beautiful.

145
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,354
General Fu is has a dashing look,

146
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,230
you could make a
perfect couple together.

147
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,992
Fine, enough of your chatter.

148
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,270
Leave us be.
The Princess needs to rest.

149
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,822
Go on, leave us be.

150
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,425
Princess Rong Le, I still think
my brother Wu You is better,

151
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,094
but if you choose General Fu
over him, I will still support...

152
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,027
Aren't you Miss Man Yao?

153
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Princess,

154
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,166
you look just the same as
Miss Man Yao from the Teahouse.

155
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:32,486
Could it be...

156
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,128
No, I need to tell
Brother Wu You about this.

157
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,202
He is searching for you
like a mad man.

158
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,398
Princess.

159
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,148
Princess Zhao Yun is just
being ridiculous.

160
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,621
I hope you don't mind her.

161
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Your Highness, I was a coward.

162
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,405
If I had let them kill me back there,

163
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:08,077
you wouldn't be trapped
in here like a hostage.

164
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,818
It's all may fault.

165
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:31,550
" The Princess' Manor "

166
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:33,092
Congratulations.

167
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:35,226
We wish you all the happiness.

168
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,972
Thank you.

169
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,864
Thank you.

170
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,364
After today,

171
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,080
I will never let go of you.

172
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,480
There is no need to regret this.

173
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,726
Brother, this is all my fault.

174
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:41,699
When I saw Man Yao on the street,

175
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,477
I should have taken her with me.

176
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,130
But I the personal bodyguard
of Princess Rong Le...

177
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:48,489
came out of nowhere
and was looking for a fugitive.

178
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,287
We fought just like that.

179
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,335
-She got away.
-What did you say?

180
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,890
It's Man Yao...

181
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,992
You said when you met Man Yao,

182
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:59,942
-you had a fight with someone?
-Brother, I didn't mean it.

183
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,800
It's their fault.
They took me for someone else.

184
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,408
But they are from Western Qi.

185
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,979
I can't argue with them.

186
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,893
When you met Man Yao,

187
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:10,532
you also ran into Xiao Sha,
Princess Rong Le's bodyguard?

188
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:12,538
Yes, it was Xiao Sha.

189
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,432
Princess Rong Le is
unreasonable and insistent.

190
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,094
But Miss Mao Yao is
sensible and lady of wisdom.

191
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:22,974
There is no way
they are the same person.

192
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,760
Besides, Princess Rong Le
is from the royal family.

193
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:26,929
She is used to a life of luxury.

194
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,216
She can't be the mistress
of a teahouse.

195
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,646
But if she is the princess,

196
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
why did she make ripples
in the bath water?

197
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,964
Unless,

198
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,446
someone just dived into the water.

199
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:59,299
That stirred the water.
She was trying to cover it.

200
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,633
Brother, where are you going?

201
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,185
Brother!

202
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,646
Brother Wu You, I have
something important for you.

203
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,420
Princess Rong Le is Miss Man Yao
from the Teahouse.

204
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,195
What are you talking about?

205
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,322
Brother.

206
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,199
Rong Le and Man Yao
are the same person?

207
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,591
-Yes!
-How is this possible?

208
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,537
Xiao Sha, Rong Le's bodyguard...

209
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,680
showed up the same time as her.

210
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,107
My goodness, we have been fooled!

211
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,880
Congratulations.

212
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:38,532
Congratulations.

213
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,890
Thank you.

214
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,411
-Congratulations.
-Thank you for the blessings.

215
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:44,177
Thank you.

216
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:45,520
Thank you.

217
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,800
-Sir Yang.
-We wish you all the joy...

218
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,339
in this marriage.

219
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:50,749
Thank you, Sir Yang.

220
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,782
Congratulation for marrying
such a beautiful wife.

221
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,236
Thank you for the blessing.

222
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,390
General Fu, before the consummation,

223
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,224
you can at least show us...

224
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,233
what your wife actually
looks like in person.

225
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:10,356
Yes, the Princess have been
in our country for months.

226
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,453
But no one has ever seen her face.

227
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,260
Before this, she said
it's the custom of Western Qi.

228
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,040
The mask must be removed by
the husband on wedding day.

229
00:23:20,508 --> 00:23:23,729
Now that you are marrying her,

230
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:27,442
why don't you take off the mask
after the wedding ceremony?

231
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:31,353
Show us just how much
of a beauty she is.

232
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:33,467
Indeed.

233
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,308
-Take the mask off.
-Yes.

234
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,120
Greetings, Crown Prince.

235
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,439
Don't you dare make a fuss here.

236
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,280
All of you backed off when
the Princess proposed.

237
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:45,482
Enough of your chatter.

238
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,274
Back off to where you came from.

239
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,347
Greetings, Crown Prince.

240
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,180
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

241
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:53,672
Congratulations.

242
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,459
You are devoted to
serving the country,

243
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,160
a role model for all
the officers here.

244
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,609
If Wu You could see the
big picture like you do,

245
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,651
my father wouldn't have been
so worried for him.

246
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,514
It's a bliss to marry
Princess Rong Le.

247
00:24:10,597 --> 00:24:12,548
General, it's time for the ceremony.

248
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,053
Very well.

249
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,040
The marrying couple, pay your respect.

250
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:23,093
To heaven and earth.

251
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,111
To the parents and ancestors.

252
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,339
To each other.

253
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,007
Hold on!

254
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,873
Prince Li actually came to my wedding.

255
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:13,494
I appreciate this greatly.

256
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:16,156
Your Highness is right on time.

257
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,041
I hope you can calm down.

258
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,392
After the ceremony is done,

259
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,367
I will be there to serve you.

260
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,810
Prince Li, this way please.

261
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,840
Good.

262
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,674
This is great.

263
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,327
But I would like to see just how
Princess Rong Le looks like...

264
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:38,020
and whether the rumours are true.

265
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,933
Prince Li, you are
being too hasty.

266
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:59,026
I advice Your Highness
to have more patience.

267
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,030
As for the wedding veil of my wife,

268
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,369
I think it's more adequate for me
to take it off.

269
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,370
Your concerns are unnecessary.

270
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,637
General Fu, the ceremony
is not complete yet,

271
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,344
you are not husband and wife.

272
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,025
So, how does it count...

273
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,216
to make us a married couple?

274
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,585
After the consummation.

275
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,514
I believe Princess Rong Le
would agree with me as well.

276
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:29,065
How shallow your mind can be?
They judge a book by its cover.

277
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,890
Even Prince Li has the same habit.

278
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,175
Your turned me down that day.

279
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:35,872
You were so determined.

280
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,219
And you came all the way
here today to unveil me?

281
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:40,937
What do you want from me?

282
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
Is Prince Li trying to make
a mess out of this wedding?

283
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,840
Prince Li, stop it!

284
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
It was your fault for
being so arrogant.

285
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
You refused to marry the Princess.

286
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,840
General Fu sees the bigger picture...

287
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:08,823
and marry the Princess for peace.
You have no right to be so angry!

288
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,816
I was ordered by His Majesty
to witness this wedding.

289
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:13,844
If you ruin the peace
between the nations,

290
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:16,517
I will make a report to
His Majesty right away!

291
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,785
Go ahead.

292
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,661
Even if His Majesty is here,

293
00:28:21,152 --> 00:28:23,472
I am still going to see her face...

294
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,707
and find out how she looks like.

295
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,664
Guards!

296
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,731
Prince Li wishes to have bloodshed
in my manor today?

297
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,751
Xiang Ying.

298
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,952
I never wish to have
a feud with anyone.

299
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,109
If Your Highness insists on
forcing my hand,

300
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,633
then I shall not hold any punches.

301
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,941
Since you are married to me,

302
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,724
you are my wife.

303
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,323
Don't worry.

304
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,621
I won't let you suffer from any harm.

305
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,461
I thank you for the concern.

306
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:22,924
But there are some matter...

307
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,307
that only I can put an end to.

308
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,367
If I let Your Highness see my face,

309
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,402
will you finally give up on me?

310
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,076
It's you?

311
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,168
It really is you.

312
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:24,019
You have been feeding me lies.

313
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,427
You saw what you want.

314
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:31,457
Can you leave me be now?

315
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,280
Perhaps I should go with you.

316
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,115
Where are you going?

317
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,520
What do you think?

318
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,971
General Fu and I
finished the ceremony.

319
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,175
Where else would we go?

320
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,172
Are you really going to marry him
and go into consummation?

321
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,098
Don't you remember
what happened that night?

322
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,360
I don't care if it means
anything to you.

323
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,120
You are mine now.

324
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,159
Other than me,

325
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,542
you will marry no one!
Come with me!

326
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,033
Your Highness.

327
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:46,146
Prince Li doesn't have the
slightest respect for me.

328
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:48,562
Today,

329
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
I am marrying Princess Rong Le.

330
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:54,429
You came here without any invitation.

331
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:57,353
I take it as you are
sending your blessing.

332
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,096
But you insulted my wife.

333
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,945
And now you want to take her from me.

334
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,715
Do you even remember that...

335
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:07,651
this marriage is bestowed
by the Emperors.

336
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,051
Fate of the nations is at stake.

337
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,355
You are acting on arrogance.

338
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,086
Don't you have any loyalty
to His Majesty?

339
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:16,328
Do you honestly think...

340
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:18,193
all the ladies in this land...

341
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,737
can be owned and
ditched as you please?

342
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:26,189
You are no righteous man yourself.

343
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,684
You have no right to lecture me.

344
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,481
If I want to take her as mine,

345
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:34,587
I don't need to smear her honour.

346
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:38,836
Prince Li, mind your words!

347
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,080
-There is no way the Princess...
-That is enough!

348
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,323
I thought you just wanted to use me.

349
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,177
But I was so wrong about you.

350
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,600
This marriage alliance is set.

351
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,055
If you do have some love left for me,

352
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,307
you wouldn't push me
to such desperation...

353
00:32:57,545 --> 00:32:59,956
and place us in this predicament!

354
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,957
I don't understand...

355
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,713
why you are doing all of these.

356
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,108
Do you really not know...

357
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:11,609
why I am doing this?

358
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,142
I don't.

359
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:17,141
I never understand your thoughts.

360
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:27,507
Brother!

361
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:30,019
Man Yao?

362
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,580
It really is you.

363
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,569
How could you do this?

364
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,565
You were flirting with my brother...

365
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:39,077
while planning a wedding
with someone else?

366
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,688
What about my brother?

367
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,486
What's done is done.
I have nothing to say.

368
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:58,923
The marriage alliance
was interrupted...

369
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,023
all because of me.

370
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,315
I will take on all the responsibility.

371
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,860
Your concern is not needed.

372
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,165
All you need is a divorce.

373
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:39,467
Now that we paid our respect
to the heaven and earth,

374
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:43,094
we are a married couple.

375
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,409
No matter what happens next,

376
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:48,912
I...

377
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,410
will always be there
to share your burden.

378
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,193
General Fu really is a
person of great sentiment.

379
00:34:58,453 --> 00:34:59,841
This is touching.

380
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,019
But if you want to spend the rest
of your life with my woman,

381
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,783
you must go through me first.

382
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,903
I will take her with me!

383
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:09,772
Don't you dare stop me!

384
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,400
Brother, run!

385
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:03,143
What did you say?

386
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:05,072
How insolent can he possibly be?

387
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,160
He charged into the manor
and took General Fu's wife!

388
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,897
He is out of his mind!

389
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:10,588
Father, calm down.

390
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,979
Maybe Wu You was just
acting on impulse.

391
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:15,276
He may have been blinded
by Princess Rong Le.

392
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,723
How is Princess Rong Le
the same person as Man Yao?

393
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,957
Good question.

394
00:36:20,183 --> 00:36:23,030
The Princess' plan was
well thought and deliberate.

395
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:26,592
I wonder what kind of scheme
the Western Qi has in place.

396
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:29,845
How are we going to
resolve this situation?

397
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,257
I sent my men after him, however...

398
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,550
However, the place he went into...

399
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,292
it's not where I dare to trespass.

400
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,349
Where is he now?

401
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,240
Why are you doing this?

402
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,206
Zongzheng Wu You,
what do you want from me?

403
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,835
What else could I want?

404
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,620
No matter how much I love you,

405
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,289
it's not worth it to take by force!

406
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:23,545
Yes, the mighty Prince Li
is no ordinary folk.

407
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,440
You used all sorts of tricks...

408
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,573
-to make me fell for it.
-Tricks?

409
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,680
Didn't you do the same to me?

410
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,246
You are the Princess of Western Qi.

411
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,960
But you disguised as a mistress
of the teahouse.

412
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:41,069
While we were writing
down our wishes,

413
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,372
you were planning
to marry another man!

414
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,679
Who am I to you?

415
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:48,951
Yes, I was planning
to marry General Fu.

416
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,883
What's wrong with that?

417
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:52,751
You plotted against me
at every corner.

418
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,063
You used me to get the
Book of Mountains and Rivers.

419
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,526
You never had one bit
of true love for me!

420
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,288
I had no love for you?

421
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,004
If I had none, what did you have?

422
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:04,826
You wouldn't tell me
who you really are!

423
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,192
You planned every step
and kept me in the dark!

424
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:08,919
Don't you dare lecture me!

425
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,080
Yes, I am in no place to lecture you.

426
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,326
We are both pawns for each other.

427
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:15,908
We fed lies to each other.

428
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,495
But I failed because
you were one step ahead.

429
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,166
You took everything from me.

430
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,046
And what did I take from you?

431
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,074
I took you with me?

432
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,087
Did I stole you heart?

433
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,000
Right.

434
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,040
Or is it you that took
the book from me?

435
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,707
How is that book yours?

436
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,040
You said Qin Yong was your teacher.

437
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,400
Your father had him killed.

438
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:45,512
You killed the whole family.

439
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:49,288
And now you take his work
and made it rightfully yours?

440
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,447
It's just like how you took my heart.

441
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,815
You think that people has no heart,

442
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,005
you see us as your property!

443
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,560
-This is madness!
-This is sacrilegious!

444
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,089
What is the General going to do now?

445
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:28,568
This is insane.

446
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,453
What do we do now?

447
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,837
We had enough troubles.

448
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,920
Long live Your Majesty.

449
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,560
At ease.

450
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,961
Where is Wu You?

451
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:08,266
Your Majesty, His Highness
is inside the royal tomb.

452
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,186
Open the door!

453
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,865
His Highness sealed the entrance.

454
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,480
A contraption was installed
when we designed the place.

455
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:18,619
Once it's sealed,
it can only be open on the inside.

456
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,360
Otherwise, the tomb
would have been ruined.

457
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,087
He is been in there for so long.

458
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,466
What if he never comes out?

459
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,744
Brother!

460
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,334
Brother, just come out!

461
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,807
It's me, Wu Yu!

462
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,575
Our father is waiting for you!

463
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:34,266
Brother!

464
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,800
Insolence!
What does he want this time?

465
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,102
General Fu.

466
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,547
You knew the owner
of Moon Embrace...

467
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,702
is Princess Rong Le all this time?

468
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:48,720
I was unaware of it.

469
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:51,885
You didn't know?
When she was making her choice,

470
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:54,027
all the men were afraid to be chosen.

471
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,986
But you stepped out and
accepted her cup of tea.

472
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,110
Your Majesty.

473
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:04,905
This marriage concerns
the peace of two nations.

474
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:08,904
Since both Prince Chen and
Prince Li turned the Princess down,

475
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:11,155
I as the officer of Northern Realm...

476
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,382
is willing to share this burden.

477
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,246
Are you telling the truth?

478
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,899
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

479
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:20,931
I will hand in my Armour and retire
in order to earn your trust.

480
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,273
Father.

481
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,054
All of these happened because
Wu You turned her down.

482
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,045
General Fu is not at fault here.

483
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,334
Your Majesty.

484
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:37,285
General Fu serves the army for years
and achieved countless feats.

485
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:39,375
He is trying to do
what's best for Your Majesty.

486
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,105
If he retires now,

487
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,272
it might deal a significant blow
to the army's morale.

488
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,498
Please, reconsider this decision.

489
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,530
Please, reconsider this decision.

490
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,145
When are you going to let me go?
