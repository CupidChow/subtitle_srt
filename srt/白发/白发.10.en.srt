00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:10,317
Episode 10

3
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,277
You have been...

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,431
stuck in this manor for too long.

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,811
You even refused to
go out with Prince Li.

6
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:21,565
I'm sorry that I had made you worry.

7
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:23,804
But you are not well.

8
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:26,883
I wish to accompany you in the house.

9
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:29,510
I didn't mean to blame you.

10
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:31,968
If you want to be filial to me,

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,079
go to Chengxi for me tomorrow.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,188
What is it that you need
that is so urgent?

13
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:41,428
I heard that the Rare Item Chamber
in Moon Embrace Teahouse in Chengxi...

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,381
specialises in selling
one-of-a-kind treasures.

15
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:47,313
His Highness is a
regular customer there as well.

16
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:50,150
I want to decorate the house
in order to welcome him.

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,070
I heard they just brought in some new
high quality treasures and jade ware.

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,023
But the servants
don't know how to choose.

19
00:00:58,162 --> 00:01:01,075
I understand. Tomorrow, I'll go
there personally to pick them out.

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,883
Great.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,671
But from their shapes,
I think they are both female.

22
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,885
I'm different from you.

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,553
I have my own mission.

24
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:24,021
Why did they have a
Western Qi's tool in this manor?

25
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:28,693
Don't you think that
this is a very familiar scene?

26
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:36,098
Wu You, what are you thinking?
You have a faraway look.

27
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,892
Are thinking about Man Yao?

28
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,571
Wu Yu.

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,590
You have monitored
Man Yao before this, right?

30
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:48,934
I did it because I was
too clueless back then.

31
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,982
I thought that you'll be distracted
from serious work because of a girl.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,549
I never thought that you are actually
a very calculative and lethal man.

33
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,210
No only you managed
to defeat Yu Shi Hai,

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,681
you managed to heroically
save a beauty too.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,981
You are really good.

36
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:03,021
Did you find anything
when you monitored her?

37
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,942
No, I found nothing.

38
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,121
Nothing aside from running into her
repeatedly outside of the teahouse...

39
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:08,584
and the House of Fragrance.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,604
You are the one who said that
there's something wrong with her.

41
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,234
That's why I sent someone to
keep an eye on the teahouse.

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,261
But in the end, I found nothing.

43
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:20,652
Man Yao...

44
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,090
knows some martial arts skills.

45
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:25,264
Female from Western Qi.

46
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,637
-Greetings, Your Highness.
-General Fu.

47
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,838
You are loyal and are of valuable
service to the emperor and the nation.

48
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,522
There's no need for these
conventional courtesies.

49
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

50
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,299
General Fu.

51
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,340
I've always admired you.

52
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:49,371
But you had rejected all
of my previous invitations...

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,319
with the reason being you are still
recovering from your wounds.

54
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,223
I wouldn't dare to
reject your invitation.

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,204
That's why I came here
right after I recovered.

56
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,704
Great. After you.

57
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,482
After you, Your Highness.

58
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,049
Go away.

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,196
You have great foresight and
you are both brilliant and courageous.

60
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:16,564
You are the pillar of Northern Realm.

61
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,519
But lately, you haven't been to
the court, claiming to be sick.

62
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,764
May I know the reason?

63
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,311
Southern fringe is stable now.

64
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:28,156
His Majesty is now making preparations
for the war against Wei.

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,300
I'm just a general
who leads the soldiers.

66
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:33,692
I'm not very familiar with
other affairs in the court.

67
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,471
So, I think it's better for me
to recuperate...

68
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:38,287
and prepare myself for war.

69
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,076
I am a grounded person and yet...

70
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,408
I get to meet with
the capable general.

71
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:47,013
Looks like you have really
given me an honour to meet you.

72
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,168
-The honour is mine.
-General Fu.

73
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:54,126
If I make any other mistakes
in the court from now on,

74
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:57,323
please be so kind
to snap me out of it.

75
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,905
You are too kind, Your Highness.

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
It's my duty and my honour...

77
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:06,528
to be in service for His Majesty
and Your Highness.

78
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,072
Cheers, General Fu.

79
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:11,893
Cheers, Your Highness.

80
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,422
Thank you.

81
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:10,843
This tea is indeed very fragrant.

82
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:14,131
And this is a very exquisite tea set.

83
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:17,933
I personally picked out this tea set.

84
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,846
This is the crème de la crème
of a tea set.

85
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,906
Listening to you talking
about tea and steeping tea...

86
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:26,269
make me feel like drinking tea
is a refined activity.

87
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:27,968
You are too kind, General Fu.

88
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,611
You didn't come here today...

89
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,577
just to drink tea. Am I right?

90
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:36,385
Are you suggesting that
I'm the kind of person...

91
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,488
who knows only
how to fight and won't...

92
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,451
come here specifically
for a cup of good tea?

93
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,023
I won't dare to do that.

94
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:44,085
You lead the army
to protect the nation.

95
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,239
You abide the laws and
you are an intellect.

96
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,752
You are well-applaud
as the scholar-general...

97
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,449
in all of Northern Realm.

98
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,902
You are too kind.

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,855
-Farewell.
-Miss Sun.

100
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,555
The goods in Rare Item Chamber
are indeed delicate and unique.

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,153
Everything here is exquisite.

102
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:07,363
I'm too dazzled by all of these.

103
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,182
Miss Sun, which one do you like?

104
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,224
Miss Sun.

105
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:16,874
Miss Sun, please have a look.

106
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,868
This is a pair of newly-made
icy jadeite jade cups.

107
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,804
They're made from the same block of
jade that came from western region.

108
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:26,199
The jade cups have the same veins
and they are totally the same.

109
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:28,949
There is only a pair of these
in this Rare Item Chamber.

110
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:31,112
Just like the man and woman
in this world.

111
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:34,899
When fate comes,
they'll each meet their other halves.

112
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,088
Please let my master
fulfil her desire...

113
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:41,689
to have this pair of jade cups.

114
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,908
You shall own these cups
since it's fate for you to find them.

115
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,163
Please go to the tearoom
downstairs and wait for a while.

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,640
Ping.

117
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,380
Send these jade cups
to Miss Sun's manor.

118
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:58,718
Alright.

119
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:04,583
Miss, the tea leaves that you requested.

120
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:05,865
Thank you.

121
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,066
Miss Sun, we can leave now.

122
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:12,654
Alright.

123
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,687
Greetings, Prince Li.

124
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,451
Greetings, Prince Li.

125
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,313
My servant doesn't know the rules.
I'm sorry for that.

126
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,596
It's fine.

127
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,184
I'll take my leave then.

128
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,710
Your Highness.

129
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:38,282
Unfortunately, our master
is with a customer today.

130
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,235
Please wait while I inform her.

131
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,852
Who is it that is so important?

132
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,523
He is the General of Defence.

133
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,394
No need to inform her then.

134
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm the one who invited
General Fu to come here for tea.

135
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,711
But my master
didn't mention about it.

136
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,780
Miss Sun.

137
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,822
Meeting by chance is a rare thing.

138
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,379
How about we go inside to
have a cup of tea together?

139
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,299
Sure.

140
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,976
After you.

141
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,456
My lady, Prince Li is here.

142
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:11,446
Tell him that I'm not in.

143
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,808
What is it? You want
to hide from me again?

144
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,627
Greetings, Prince Li.

145
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:24,377
General Fu.

146
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,165
Why are you here?

147
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,780
I happened to pass by this place.

148
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:30,558
So, I came in to have a cup a tea.

149
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,919
Nothing else.

150
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:34,855
If you need to talk to Miss Man Yao,

151
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,828
I'll take my leave now.

152
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:40,091
Slow down. I'm not here
for anything important.

153
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,419
Meeting by chance is a rare thing.

154
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:45,491
How about you sit down and
we can all have a cup of tea?

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,470
By the way, this is Miss Ya Li,
the only daughter of Sir Sun,

156
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:51,155
the Central Secretary
of Northern Realm.

157
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,794
After you, Miss Sun.

158
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,968
Cheers, Your Highness.

159
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,427
No need to be so polite, General Fu.

160
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:13,183
General Fu.

161
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,625
The emperor and crown prince
think highly of you.

162
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:19,766
You are the pillar of Northern Realm.

163
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,879
Since you have something to
discuss with the general,

164
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,713
it'll be inconvenient for me
to stay here.

165
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,980
I shall take my leave then.

166
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,581
Man Yao, if you are not here,

167
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:32,394
who is going to serve us the tea?

168
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,349
No need to be so uptight.

169
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,060
I don't have anything
important to say.

170
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,958
I just feel like having a chat
with the general suddenly.

171
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:47,816
Drink up.

172
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:54,514
Coward.

173
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,552
Princess Rong Le will not eat you.
Are you going to go in or not?

174
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,585
-Sir.
-Now I know.

175
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,999
This is the reason Wu You let me out.

176
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,022
Good for him.
He went to meet his lover.

177
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,110
And he set me up with
this old, ugly and fierce princess.

178
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:12,197
Look. He even asked that blockhead
to keep an eye on me.

179
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,315
What are you looking at?
And you!

180
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,780
Why did you follow me along?

181
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,948
Every day, you either pester Wu You
or following me around.

182
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,727
I'm following you around?

183
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,563
I'm just afraid that you'll bully
Princess Rong Le.

184
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,143
You like Wu You, right?

185
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,217
If you like Wu You, go to the owner
of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

186
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,322
-No use to come to this princess.
-You...

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,783
Such a dummy. I follow you
because I'm afraid that you'll...

188
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,069
Stop right there.

189
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:42,365
-What are you doing?
-Aren't you going to go inside?

190
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,100
Go inside and ask Miss Ling Yue
to get ready.

191
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,953
-The sooner the better.
-Yes, sir.

192
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,980
Prince Chen, Princess Zhao Yun.
Please go in now.

193
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,820
Captain Xiao of the Princess Manor
has personally come to welcome us.

194
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:55,906
Welcome.

195
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,474
Today, the tea that you prepared...

196
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:12,686
is different from the usual.

197
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,084
Even I have never tasted
this kind of tea before.

198
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:18,533
General Fu, you are really
well-respected.

199
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,711
I don't know anything about tea.

200
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,213
I just feel that although
this tea is bitter,

201
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,220
the aftertaste of it
is sweet in the mouth.

202
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:31,501
To be able to give out
such a comment...

203
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,860
shows that you are just being modest
about your knowledge in tea.

204
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,560
I'm different from
the privileged and the wealthy.

205
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,273
I'm just a person
from the lowest social strata.

206
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,680
I lead a vagabond life for a living.

207
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,785
So, drinking is just
a way of survival.

208
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,710
I really don't know
how to savour a tea.

209
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:50,343
Your life is just like this tea.

210
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,820
There's sweet after sweat.

211
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:54,152
That's why you can taste
the flavour of this tea.

212
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:55,813
Unlike somebody...

213
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,313
who has already tasted
all the tea in this teahouse...

214
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,370
but never been able
to taste the flavours.

215
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,222
It's just a thoughtless comment.

216
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:08,071
Of course I'm in no way comparable
to His Highness's knowledge in tea.

217
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,094
I just only understand
the meaning of...

218
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,541
drinking tea after
your explanation just now.

219
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,042
The tea that you chose is in
accordance to the life of the drinker.

220
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,494
Miss Man Yao, it's really admirable...

221
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,092
that your teahouse is so successful...

222
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,629
although you are
the only one managing it.

223
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,124
But this time, what I have tasted...

224
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:29,421
is different from
what you have tasted.

225
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,212
How about we listen to
Miss Sun's thought on this?

226
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:41,090
I'm not that smart. I don't know
how to distinguish flavours of tea.

227
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:45,402
For me, all the tea in this world...

228
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,999
is bitter and astringent.

229
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,638
I don't know why...

230
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:54,924
but the tea today
has a sour bite to it.

231
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,191
But it's alright.

232
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,206
It suits my feelings
and my appetite today.

233
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:04,466
We have the same taste, Your Highness.

234
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:06,552
That's why we are always
in perfect unison...

235
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:08,413
when we are on the battlefield.

236
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,062
In battle, you have great foresight
and you are very decisive.

237
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:15,661
You can win easily even without me.

238
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:19,750
As for court, I hope that you
have a clear look on things,

239
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,897
can distinguish right from wrong
and can go side by side with me.

240
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:25,775
As for other things,

241
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,726
if you have taken a fancy
to the things that I like,

242
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:33,763
I would suggest you to be
careful with your actions.

243
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,080
Thank you for your advice.

244
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:44,952
But I think that the matter
with the heart...

245
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:46,763
is all about fate and destiny.

246
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:48,425
It's not up to us.

247
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:30,497
Miss Sun, be careful.

248
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,252
I'm fine.

249
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm too clumsy.

250
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:38,007
Please pardon me,
Your Highness, General Fu.

251
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,567
I don't feel well suddenly.

252
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:43,452
I think I'll take my leave now.

253
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:55,096
-You are not going to check on her?
-No need.

254
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:58,016
Just now, General Fu said that
he's going back already, right?

255
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:01,212
Please be a gentleman and
escort Miss Sun home.

256
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:07,765
I'll take my leave now.

257
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,741
You should stay away from him.

258
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,140
You don't have any rights...

259
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:20,929
to question the people
I called friends.

260
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:24,416
Fu Chou is a complicated man.

261
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:26,901
For me,

262
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:29,131
I think that you are more
complicated than he is.

263
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,335
Man Yao, are you saying this...

264
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,462
to provoke me on purpose?

265
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:37,552
Your Highness, I'll be leaving now.

266
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
Are you angry at me...

267
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:43,149
because of Fu Chou?

268
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:45,604
I won't dare to do that.

269
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:53,694
After you.

270
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,307
Miss Sun, the carriage is ready.

271
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:04,997
-You can go out first.
-Yes, Miss Sun.

272
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,961
Do you have something to say,
Miss Sun?

273
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:13,979
We have met once
in the southern fringe.

274
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,982
How have you been, General Fu?

275
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:20,625
Miss Sun, you are...

276
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:22,729
Two years ago,

277
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,719
I ran into a battle when I was
in my hometown alone.

278
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,409
I want to thank you
for saving me back then.

279
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:35,229
Madam.

280
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,141
I see.

281
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:39,327
I was just merely helping out.

282
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,785
I'm ashamed that I had forgotten
about it while you never did.

283
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:47,674
After you saved me,
you left immediately.

284
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:51,239
So, I never had the chance
to thank you.

285
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,962
I feel very unease about it.

286
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,534
This is nothing.
You don't have to take it to heart.

287
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,704
Miss Sun, let me escort you.

288
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,056
After you.

289
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:13,947
Well, this will do.

290
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,161
Safe journey, Miss Sun.

291
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:51,616
Princess Rong Le, long time no see.

292
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,216
Where are Ling Yue and Lian Xin?

293
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,412
Lian Xin has gone back to
Western Qi to get married.

294
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,025
Our princess is worried that
Ling Yue will be upset.

295
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,824
So, she gave her a few days to rest.

296
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,740
Princess Rong Le, Wu Yu is the one
who wanted to meet you today.

297
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:08,682
He insisted to come here to meet you.

298
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,492
I'm here to pay my visit.

299
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:32,567
Why does this tea taste so bad?

300
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,377
Is it that bad?

301
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,257
Let me have a taste.

302
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,331
It's indeed bad.

303
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,432
This is incomparable to the tea
in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

304
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,550
Princess Rong Le, let me bring you
to the teahouse to taste their tea.

305
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,826
I heard that the Rare Item Chamber
has some brand new dresses again.

306
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,580
And they are all imported.

307
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,420
We can't find those in the palace.

308
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,344
Let go and taste the tea there.

309
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,581
Our princess is still having flu.
It's better for her to stay home.

310
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,420
Please go back,
Princess Zhao Yun, Prince Chen.

311
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,300
Princess Rong Le,
you are still having flu?

312
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,140
Our princess is not feeling well.
Please go back, Princess Zhao Yun.

313
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,900
Princess Rong Le
hasn't even rejected me.

314
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,901
How dare you reject me in her stead?

315
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,616
Sir Xiao, this is the very first time
I invite Princess Rong Le.

316
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Moreover, more reason for her
to drink tea if she has flu.

317
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,380
Tea can relieve and detoxify the body.

318
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,443
Maybe she'll get better
after drinking tea.

319
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:25,586
-Don't you think so, Princess Rong Le?
-Princess Zhao Yun is right.

320
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,260
I don't really feel well today.

321
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:35,244
Princess Zhao Yun, Prince Chen.

322
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,220
How about we go there...

323
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,205
Princess Rong Le. Today,
we keep on inviting you sincerely.

324
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,123
But you keep on rejecting us.

325
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,500
Is this how Western Qi
treats your guest?

326
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:46,143
Princess Rong Le is not like this.

327
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,197
Princess Rong Le, let's go.

328
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,927
I have lost.

329
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,437
It's already so late.
Aren't you going to go back yet?

330
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:29,958
It's not every day that
I can play chess with you.

331
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:32,030
Can we play one more round?

332
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,663
Alright.

333
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:42,189
Wu You!
Look who I've brought along.

334
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,220
Such a coincidence. I've brought
Princess Rong Le with me too today.

335
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,380
Both of you can use
this chance to have a chat.

336
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,821
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.
I am Man Yao.

337
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,136
Miss Man Yao, please rise.

338
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:17,859
Wu You, come and have
a talk with Princess Rong Le.

339
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,731
Prince Chen.
Are you going to marry me?

340
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:44,206
I...

341
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,620
If you want to take off my mask today,

342
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,165
it means that you are going to
marry me and be my husband.

343
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,365
I...

344
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,465
-I forgot.
-Wu Yu.

345
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,886
This is the custom of Western Qi.

346
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:59,065
Only the groom can take off the mask.

347
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,147
You are too rude.
Apologise to Princess Rong Le now.

348
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:05,683
Quick.

349
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,657
I'm sorry, Princess Rong Le.

350
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,675
Wu Yu, you are too rude.

351
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,317
Princess Rong Le, my brother
has indeed offended you today.

352
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,396
Let me apologise to you in his stead.

353
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:26,921
Please forgive him.

354
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:34,529
That day, you purposely make things
difficult for me in the great hall.

355
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,915
Now, Prince Chen is trying
to take off my mask.

356
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,500
But he is not willing to marry me.

357
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,300
Are both of you trying to
embarrass me on purpose?

358
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,061
I can't be sure that you didn't
put anything into the tea...

359
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:46,827
that will make me embarrass myself.

360
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,549
Princess Rong Le,
please don't mind them.

361
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,310
This is just a little game
that we like to play.

362
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,403
Since Prince Li is inviting
Princess Rong Le to drink tea,

363
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:03,223
it won't do for the rest of us
to continue staying here.

364
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:06,596
If Prince Li and Princess Rong Le
need anything,

365
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,354
you can just call me anytime.

366
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,683
Wu You,
Princess Rong Le is still here.

367
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:17,524
Prince Li, Prince Chen,

368
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,167
Princess Rong Le is still sick.

369
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:21,885
I'll have to bring her back first.
Farewell.

370
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,519
Princess Rong Le.

371
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,271
Usually, Brother Wu You
is not like this.

372
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,289
Wu You, how can you do that?

373
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,267
What's so good about Man Yao?
Compared to Princess Rong Le...

374
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,390
I'm going to visit
the House of Fragrance.

375
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:42,205
Wait for me.

376
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,795
It's better for you to go back now.

377
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:49,687
Do you really hate it
that much to be with me?

378
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,919
I'm doing this for your own good.

379
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,531
If you're really doing it
for my own good,

380
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,256
stop avoiding me already, alright?

381
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,220
Forget it.

382
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:15,255
It's already late anyway.

383
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:18,244
I'll see you next time.

384
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,660
I'm so scared.

385
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:35,222
You did very well just now.

386
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,362
-Really?
-Really.

387
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,020
I never thought that
you'll be so smart.

388
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,327
You have portrayed the princess well
with your talks and your expression.

389
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:48,199
-Even I...
-No, Sir Xiao. It's nothing.

390
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,674
I just managed to learn
how to be a little bit like her...

391
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:52,782
because I have served her
for some time now.

392
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:56,059
But we still need to be careful
from now onwards.

393
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:58,410
Even now,
my heart is still beating wildly.

394
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,111
It'll be alright.

395
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,432
Looks like I've guessed wrongly.

396
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,828
Looks like love can really
make someone become dumb.

397
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:23,927
Even the wise Wu You
has become it's victim.

398
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,290
How is it possible that
Princess Rong Le and Miss Man Yao...

399
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,009
are the same person?

400
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,980
They are totally different.

401
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,923
Princess Rong Le is a spoilt
and wilful girl. And she's ugly.

402
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,070
Not only Miss Man Yao
is pleasant-looking,

403
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,462
she is very sophisticated.

404
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,367
They are totally different.

405
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:44,097
Moreover, Princess Rong Le is
so aloft and she is a pampered girl.

406
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,726
How can she be
the master of a teahouse?

407
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,852
Are you happy now? Your cleverness
has overreached itself.

408
00:26:52,016 --> 00:26:53,696
Now, you have offended both parties.

409
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:59,617
It's been so long since I last
see you. I miss you like crazy.

410
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:03,088
I'm going to visit the Northern Realm
and I'm going to travel fast.

411
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,596
I'll be meeting you in ten days' time.

412
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,890
Long Yue, I'm not dreaming, right?

413
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,908
My brother is coming to
Northern Realm to meet me.

414
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,984
I just received this message
from the Kite.

415
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,895
It's definitely true.

416
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,633
Long Yue, take a look at me.
Have I changed in any way?

417
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:20,943
Did I become thinner? I didn't...

418
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,387
-rest well lately.
-Enough.

419
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,100
You are still the same.

420
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,300
And you are still beautiful.

421
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:29,029
Every time he writes to me,
he's always so worried.

422
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,375
He feels that I didn't eat well,

423
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,610
didn't take good care of myself
and didn't take my medicine.

424
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,428
Prince Li often comes here
to look for you.

425
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:37,607
You have to be careful.
Don't spill the beans.

426
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,171
I understand.

427
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:58,130
A messenger from Western Qi
has sent us a letter of credence.

428
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:02,168
The Emperor of Qi is
coming here personally...

429
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,220
to sign the treaty with me.

430
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:06,283
After that,

431
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,684
we'll have no worries for
the upcoming war against Wei.

432
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:14,412
I'll entrust you to
facilitate this meeting.

433
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,631
But we are still undecided
about the marriage alliance.

434
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:20,636
I'm afraid that it'll affect
the alliance between us.

435
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,655
We are almost done with the
preparations for the war against Wei.

436
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,784
This alliance is a must.

437
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,417
I will not let anything
affect this alliance.

438
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,617
What is your plan then?

439
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:38,301
Western Qi has chosen Wu You
for this marriage alliance.

440
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:40,147
So, of course...

441
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,521
we need to give Wu You a push first.

442
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,157
Brother, please advise Wu You
not to be so headstrong.

443
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,002
But with his personality...

444
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,632
If he refuses to do it no matter what,

445
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:55,587
we'll think of another way then.

446
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:01,022
I heard that Princess of Western Qi
is interested in Prince Chen.

447
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,737
Since young,
Wu You cares more about...

448
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,021
Wu Yu than he cares for himself.

449
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,891
Alright, I understand.

450
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,323
General Fu.

451
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,537
I had searched far and wide for this.

452
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,490
I hope that it will be to your liking.

453
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:09,978
Great sword.

454
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:12,671
Crown prince must have heard
about your meeting with Prince Li.

455
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:14,064
He's getting antsy.

456
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,809
-You may go out now.
-Yes.

457
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:24,030
When will the Emperor of Qi
reach Zhongshan?

458
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:28,204
He'll reach here within three days.

459
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,852
You may go out now.

460
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,408
Yes.

461
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,558
Emperor of Qi is reaching soon.
What is your plan?

462
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,803
You know what my intention is.

463
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:54,084
I will not accept this marriage.

464
00:30:57,228 --> 00:31:00,902
Back then, His Majesty has his
own difficulties too with your mother.

465
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,761
If he didn't marry Fu Yuan,

466
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,998
the Northern Realm today
will not be like this.

467
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,140
You don't have to talk about
the past with me.

468
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,180
You are not here today...

469
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,780
just to pass on a decree telling me to
accept the marriage alliance, right?

470
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,344
Your father has exhausted
himself for this alliance.

471
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,482
He's not as healthy as before anymore.

472
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:23,145
If you are really unwilling,

473
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,859
let Wu Yu marry her instead.

474
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:30,925
I don't want.

475
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,541
Father is being too partial.

476
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,125
Same with you too, uncle.

477
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,055
I knew that you are
eavesdropping on us.

478
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:40,273
Uncle.

479
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:44,291
No matter it's me or Wu Yu,
we won't accept this marriage.

480
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,610
Officially, this alliance is fake.
We just want to strengthen our forces.

481
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,210
Because of some dignity,

482
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,180
we want to put the people in dire.

483
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:52,380
And personally,

484
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,660
we have feelings and everyone
has their own aspirations.

485
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,452
I don't want to be like His Majesty...

486
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,198
who can make a bargain with marriage.

487
00:31:58,355 --> 00:32:00,396
I don't want to be
unfaithful like him.

488
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,060
You are right, Wu You.

489
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:05,646
Wu You.

490
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,841
Have you fallen in love with someone?

491
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:09,192
I...

492
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,252
I have things to do. I have to leave.
Both of you can continue.

493
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:23,373
Looks like I've guessed correctly.

494
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:27,024
Actually, His Majesty
has already made a plan for you.

495
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,746
If anything untoward happens
in the war against Wei,

496
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:33,027
he'll let all of you go back to the
three states in southern fringe.

497
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:35,032
After the treaty with Western Qi,

498
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,925
the Central Secretary,
Sir Sun Ji Zhou...

499
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,042
will be sent back to
the southern region.

500
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:41,324
The prominent family of Sun...

501
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:43,471
has been taking roots in that
three states for a long time.

502
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:46,769
He can best assist you to settle down
in the southern region if needed.

503
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:50,654
How is His Majesty?

504
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,886
If His Majesty knows that
you are asking about him,

505
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:58,421
of course he'll be so gleeful
that all of his illness will be gone.

506
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:36,107
The arrival of the Emperor of Qi!

507
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,466
-Greetings, Princess Rong Le.
-Greetings, Princess Zhao Yun.

508
00:34:01,593 --> 00:34:03,219
Princess Rong Le,
you have a sore throat.

509
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,281
So, I have brought along
some sore throat medicine for you.

510
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:08,596
Thank you, Princess Zhao Yun.
Have a seat.

511
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,660
Princess Rong Le, you are so capable.
You are even good in wood-carving.

512
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:14,012
I just learnt it.

513
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,689
This looks easy, but it's actually
quite difficult to carve.

514
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,606
It's slippery if your hands are wet.
I've already ruined many of them.

515
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:23,241
Princess Rong Le, I have never
seen you so happy before.

516
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,890
Are you very close with your brother?

517
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,483
That's right.
We don't have any other siblings.

518
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,340
So, it's just me and him on our own.

519
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,060
My brother told me that
when I was young,

520
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,533
he made me a box of
wood sculptures to play with.

521
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,921
I'm so envious of you.

522
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:43,322
Unlike me who have no other siblings.

523
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:47,866
You have Wu You and Wu Yu, right?

524
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,580
Actually, I'm quite scared of Wu You.

525
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:54,838
And that Wu Yu
likes to bully me all the time.

526
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:57,113
Princess Rong Le.

527
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,849
If only you can be my real sister.

528
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,752
If you marry Wu You,
you'll be my real sister-in-law.

529
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,892
Princess Rong Le,
did I say something wrong?

530
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,100
Actually, Wu You is very kind.

531
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,300
He always sends someone to
take care of me and protect me.

532
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:24,564
But he never says it out loud.

533
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:28,069
Princess Rong Le,
don't ever fall in love with Wu Yu.

534
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,427
He is just a heartbreaker.

535
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:35,018
Why do I feel like
compared to Wu You,

536
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:37,629
you are more worried about that dummy?

537
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:41,306
That's not true.
I'm just worried that he'll bully you.

538
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,980
Princess Rong Le,
can you teach me how to carve?

539
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:46,185
Be careful, Princess Zhao Yun.
Don't cut your hand.

540
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,323
Princess Zhao Yun, if you like it,

541
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,380
just ask someone to
send it to your manor.

542
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,540
Don't be like Princess Rong Le.
She has so many cuts on her hands.

543
00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:53,766
Ling Yue.

544
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,170
No. I want to personally make one
to be given as gift too.

545
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,286
Even if I'm not good in it,
at least I have put my heart in it.

546
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:03,370
Just like Princess Rong Le's
regards for her brother.

547
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,999
I have to do it myself.

548
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,280
I'll be fine.

549
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:10,117
Princess Rong Le, His Majesty
is going to come to the manor soon.

550
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:12,827
It's better if we keep
Princess Zhao Yun away for a while.

551
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,414
She has a close relationship
with Prince Li.

552
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,220
I'm worried that
there will be troubles.

553
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,291
But I feel pity for
Princess Zhao Yun...

554
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,894
because she is always alone.

555
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,075
She is still young. It'll fine for her
even if she makes some mistakes.

556
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,983
I have always treated her
like a younger sister.

557
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,882
I can't bear to see her sad.

558
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,244
What is it, Princess Zhao Yun?

559
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,847
It's nothing.

560
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:43,932
Princess Rong Le,
is this really your brother?

561
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:47,278
Why do I feel that
it looks like Wu You?

562
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:21,745
Long live the Emperor!

563
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:23,172
Rise.

564
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

565
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:31,425
Have a seat, Emperor of Qi.

566
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,209
Thank you, Emperor of Northern Realm.

567
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:47,833
You came here despite
the long distance.

568
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,532
I'm really touched by your sincerity.

569
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,212
From now on, we'll work in unity...

570
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,493
to defend against our enemies.

571
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:59,122
You are very courageous
and full of compassion.

572
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,860
We'll work well together.

573
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,848
Although you are young,

574
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,890
I feel that we can
get along very well.

575
00:38:07,446 --> 00:38:10,049
I built this nation with
blood and sweat.

576
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:11,851
According to our custom,

577
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,580
when we have visits from
honoured guests,

578
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,900
we'll welcome them
with a hunting party.

579
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:18,512
What do you think about that?

580
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:22,818
My warriors are brave and
are good shooters as well.

581
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,005
How about we let our warriors
compete against each other?

582
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:28,384
Excellent.

583
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:33,557
Those with the most hunt
will be rewarded handsomely.

584
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,580
Same goes to me.

585
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,779
Long live the Emperor!

586
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,229
Princess Rong Le.

587
00:38:57,255 --> 00:38:58,575
Princess Rong Le.

588
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,580
His Majesty has to go to the palace
for a feast before he can come here.

589
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,440
I know. Ling Yue. Look at me.

590
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,656
-Do I look well?
-Yes. Everything looks good.

591
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,493
You look very well and
your dress is beautiful too.

592
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:13,678
Is the room for my brother ready yet?

593
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:16,175
Don't worry, Princess Rong Le.
I have already cleaned it up.

594
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,742
As soon as I heard that His Majesty
is permitted to stay in this manor,

595
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:21,803
I have been cleaning it up for him.

596
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:25,085
Princess Rong Le.
His Majesty is here.

597
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,868
-Brother!
-Rong Le.

598
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,780
I miss you.

599
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,232
Quick. Let me take a look at you.

600
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,381
Look at you.
You have become thinner.

601
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,153
But at least, you look well.

602
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,790
Did you take your medicine on time?

603
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,040
Yes, Ling Yue will make sure
that I take them every day.

604
00:39:47,203 --> 00:39:49,710
How are you feeling, brother?
Why do you I feel that...

605
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,881
you don't look so well?

606
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,448
This is an exhausting journey.

607
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:57,908
How can I possibly look well?

608
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,561
You shouldn't have
come here in person.

609
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:01,901
This is a long and arduous journey.

610
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:03,528
The world is in chaos now.

611
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:05,314
And you are not feeling well too.

612
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,380
I'm here in one piece, right?

613
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:12,935
Moreover, this alliance
is very important to Western Qi.

614
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:15,870
Besides, I want to
come here to see you.

615
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:18,688
I'm worried that
they'll bully you here.

616
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:21,967
With you here, who dares bully me?

617
00:40:26,272 --> 00:40:29,523
By the way, I'm just one step away
from The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

618
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:35,227
That's great.

619
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,578
Compared to the book,

620
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,678
your safety is more important to me.

621
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:43,156
Believe me.
Give me some time.

622
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:45,752
I promise to let you
do as you please,

623
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,800
to do anything you want...

624
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,427
and to marry whoever you want.

625
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,406
I know you are worried about me.

626
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:55,169
But you have to believe in me too.

627
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,480
I'll definitely keep
my promises to you.
