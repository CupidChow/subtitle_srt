00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,300
Episode 16

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,671
When are you going to let me go?

4
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:35,736
We will each take a step back.

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,778
Forget about all the unpleasant past.

6
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,066
Okay?

7
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,921
I don't care if you lied
about your identity.

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,059
I don't care if you
approached me with motives.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,773
I don't care what happened
between you and Fu Chou.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,476
I can leave those in the past.

11
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:54,574
Man Yao.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,503
What's done is done.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,620
Blaming and loathing each other...

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,225
is completely meaningless.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,741
I promised you.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,009
Your future is my future too.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,364
Future?

18
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:13,619
There is no future between us.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,700
I do want to marry you.

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,612
I also believe...

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,902
it doesn't matter if
that book was a fake,

22
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:22,704
when you handed it to me,

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,900
you were hoping I can
keep it safe, right?

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,932
What does it matter?

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,414
Fu Chou and I completed the ceremony.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,249
Speaking about this
won't make a difference.

27
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:39,211
I will find a way to get
the dissolution letter.

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,260
You are the Emperor's favourite son.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,622
But you are not all mighty.

30
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,191
No,

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,901
you have to trust me.

32
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,589
I can't trust you anymore.

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,956
In mere days,

34
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,766
I was deceived again and again.

35
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,638
Since we can no longer
trust each other,

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,780
what is the point of staying together?

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,737
Let it go.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,178
This day is destined to come
since the day you turned me down.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,716
We have different
backgrounds and stands.

40
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,601
We may have felt love,

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,144
but we were never
honest to one another.

42
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,026
We should just let go.

43
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,855
Let us become strangers.

44
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,086
It's better than a life of
distrust and pain.

45
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,062
Is that what you want?

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,900
This is my wish.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,820
Please, grant me this last wish.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,700
Do you think Fu Chou
will truly love you?

49
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,140
That is not your concern.

50
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,020
Have you ever loved me?

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,373
If you did,

52
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,820
how much did you love me?

53
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,072
I have one final request.

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,260
Keep me company for
another three days.

55
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,277
I, Zongzheng Wu You,

56
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,382
will give you all of me.

57
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,836
I will never give up on you.

58
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,489
I won't let the world down,

59
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,211
or you.

60
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,299
It's been three days.

61
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,933
The door is opening.

62
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,940
What is going on?
Where are they?

63
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,210
No one came out.

64
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,673
She is coming out.

65
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,460
She came out dressed in that?

66
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,737
What happened in the last three days?

67
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,359
Brother.

68
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,069
Your Majesty.

69
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,739
It really is you.

70
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,420
You are Princess Rong Le.

71
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,540
Yes.

72
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,034
During the feast,

73
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,716
both you and the Emperor
of Western Qi were there.

74
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:02,254
You allowed the fake Princess
to choose her husband.

75
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:05,504
What exactly are you planning?

76
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,660
You are supposed to marry my son.

77
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:12,284
You should have stayed
inside the manor.

78
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,094
But you spread your lies everywhere
and seduced Prince Li.

79
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,673
You beguiled General Fu.

80
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,395
You tried to alienate
my two most important officers!

81
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,620
You caused disruption
to the Imperial Court.

82
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,249
This is outrageous!

83
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:26,229
-Guards!
-Yes.

84
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,173
Arrest her and lock her up.

85
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,175
-She will be put on trial!
-Your Majesty.

86
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,321
-Your Majesty.
-General Fu.

87
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,875
Do you want to plea for her?

88
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:41,716
She brought shame to you!

89
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,619
You will be humiliated
for your whole life!

90
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,359
You should be hating her!

91
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,843
Your Majesty.

92
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,432
For the time being,

93
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,107
while we just signed the treaty
with Western Qi,

94
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:56,940
imprisoning the Princess of Western Qi
might cause an uproar.

95
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,462
It might not bode well for us.

96
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,250
Which is why I suggest...

97
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:03,525
Your Majesty to calm down
for the sake of greater good.

98
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,609
Father.

99
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,580
All of these happened because Wu You
turned down the engagement...

100
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,026
and took the bride.

101
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,737
General Fu shouldn't be blamed.

102
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:15,965
Silence!

103
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,339
What happened today...

104
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,820
is brought on us
because she wants revenge.

105
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:23,014
-Your Majesty.
-My decision is certain.

106
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,690
Say no more.

107
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,020
-Lock her up.
-Yes.

108
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,446
Let her go!

109
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,598
-Let her go.
-Let her go?

110
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,740
Thanks to her insolence,

111
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,229
we are all placed in this predicament!

112
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:56,540
What happened back there
was my doing alone.

113
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,165
The others are innocent.

114
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,336
But she lied about her identity
to approach you.

115
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,944
She lied to approach me...

116
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,010
to fulfil the six-month agreement
we made in the main hall.

117
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,116
But she has chosen another man.

118
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:12,887
I gave her the right of choice.

119
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,160
Wu You.

120
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,660
Please, Your Majesty.

121
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,860
Let my mother rest in peace.

122
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,820
Since Prince Li plead for you,

123
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,620
this shall be the end of this matter.

124
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,620
From now on, no one
shall mention this again.

125
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,957
Is that clear?

126
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,209
Yes.

127
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,819
Your Majesty, I will
leave with my wife now.

128
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,529
Brother!

129
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:08,845
Brother!

130
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,100
Ling Yue.

131
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,359
Help the Princess change
into these clothes.

132
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,322
Yes.

133
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,580
This should have been done
three days ago,

134
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,704
but the wedlock drink is still needed.

135
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,580
After all, this is part
of the wedding.

136
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,237
With this done,

137
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:43,103
it will be good omen for us both.

138
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,556
The meaning behind wedlock drink...

139
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,909
is for the husband
and wife to live as one,

140
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,878
they will never be separated.

141
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,020
I know you understand well enough...

142
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,281
the two of us will never become
a real married couple.

143
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,232
Which is why this drink...

144
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,079
is simply meaningless.

145
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,740
I need to have a word with my wife.

146
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,860
You may go now.

147
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,286
Yes.

148
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,895
Your Highness, I'll be right there.

149
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,227
I'll be standing by.

150
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,258
It must be hard to
put up an act all day.

151
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,580
There is no need for acting
while we are here.

152
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,823
I brought shame to you.

153
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,580
You must have hated me for it.

154
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,033
Why would you pretend nothing
has ever happened?

155
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,470
Nothing happened between you
and Prince Li in the tomb.

156
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,331
The Yun's Tomb is the resting place
for Lady Yun, Prince Li's mother.

157
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,140
No matter how vile he can be,

158
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
he would never do anything
to disrespect you...

159
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,295
inside his mother's tomb.

160
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,032
You know him well.

161
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,660
You like him a lot.

162
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,260
He brought you into his mother's tomb
for three whole days.

163
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,340
He seems to be deeply
in love with you.

164
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,540
This conversation we are having,

165
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,884
don't you think it's strange?

166
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,861
I can forget what
you two did together.

167
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,155
I care not about what the others say.

168
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,700
Reputation is just show
for the strangers.

169
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,382
Besides,

170
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,649
everyone can be a topic for gossips.

171
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,770
But there is something
you must remember.

172
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:09,790
From now on,

173
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,153
you are the wife of General Fu
of Northern Realm.

174
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,580
No matter how much you like someone,

175
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,680
you must tell no one.

176
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,354
Did you forget?

177
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,733
This marriage is just a deal
you brokered with Western Qi.

178
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,240
Whatever the motive is,

179
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,409
a marriage is no child's play.

180
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,417
Since you are married to me,

181
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:32,199
from now on, each and every
action of yours...

182
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,748
no matter how humiliating
it is to me,

183
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:36,715
must not be humiliating to you.

184
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:38,826
What do you mean?

185
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,826
You saw it at the tomb today.

186
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:44,042
I may be the General of Defence,

187
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,820
I may have achieved
great feats for this nation,

188
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,472
but at the most crucial moments,

189
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,620
Prince Li's words
weigh more than mine.

190
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:52,948
I do want to protect you and save you,

191
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,004
but I cannot do it all the time.

192
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,460
Even under such circumstance,

193
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,309
I will do my best to keep you safe.

194
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,340
You might not even believe this,

195
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,174
but when I married you,

196
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,376
it's not just because
you are the Princess of Qi.

197
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:20,367
When we first met,

198
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,350
you could understand the song I wrote.

199
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,471
At that moment,

200
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,750
I feel like you are the
only person in this world...

201
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,827
that understands
the shackles in my heart.

202
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:32,430
After all this time, I am used
to giving up and sacrifices.

203
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,294
But for once,

204
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,041
there is something that I want.

205
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,140
I am flattered, General Fu.

206
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:44,254
Those are just some
nonsense I told that day.

207
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,541
How could I possibly
understand your thoughts?

208
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,900
That will never be a reality.

209
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,300
It's not that you couldn't,
it's just that you won't.

210
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,540
Rong Le.

211
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,268
You see me as an enemy.

212
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,322
That's only because...

213
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,359
we planned your future without
asking for your thoughts.

214
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:07,834
You felt like you are tricked...

215
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,246
and disrespected.

216
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:10,934
Isn't that true?

217
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,017
You and my brother were
planning this for years.

218
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,660
You knew who I am and you
pretend like you know nothing.

219
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,390
I played right into your hands.

220
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,105
I hope you take my words for it.

221
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,410
I will treat you well.

222
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,789
Treat me well?

223
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,620
Then you should get a divorce.

224
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,873
-Not now.
-When?

225
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,343
A year later.

226
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,540
A year? The same excuse again.

227
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,369
Who knows what kind of scheme
you and my brother will have?

228
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,079
I don't wish to achieve anything.

229
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,657
I simply want...

230
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,384
to have a chance at you.

231
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,340
A year-long plan
and you claim it's for me?

232
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,636
If this were six months ago,

233
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,180
I might have bought it.

234
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,176
But when you said it just now,

235
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,891
it's simply felt ridiculous.

236
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,784
It doesn't matter whether
you believe me or not.

237
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,620
All I want to know...

238
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,626
is what you need.

239
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,100
I hereby give you my word.

240
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:14,143
I will respect your decision.

241
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,107
I won't demand anything unacceptable.

242
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:17,398
Not until...

243
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,101
you are willing to
become my real wife.

244
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,706
That day will never come.

245
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,375
If a year has passed...

246
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,214
and you still refuse to accept me,

247
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,449
I will end this marriage.

248
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,391
You will be freed.

249
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,015
You have my word for it.

250
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,980
Rest well.

251
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,460
When did you find out she is
the Princess of Western Qi?

252
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,036
I only found out on
the day of their wedding.

253
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,180
You spent so much time with her
and you didn't notice it?

254
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,000
And you said you are
good with riddles.

255
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:46,697
Why didn't you see this coming?

256
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,500
It was all your fault.

257
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,448
You always said the sight of
her terrifies you.

258
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,740
I wouldn't dare to
get any closer to her.

259
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,878
She was so nice to me.

260
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,829
Whatever the reason is,
I shouldn't suspect her.

261
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,243
Look at how it ends.

262
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:03,172
The Princess you like
broke my brother's heart.

263
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,249
I don't even know who
I should side with now.

264
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,140
Right now,

265
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,651
Brother Wu You must be very upset.

266
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,820
He locked himself up
in the tomb for days.

267
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,489
I wonder how he is holding up.

268
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,309
Why don't we pay him a visit?

269
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,157
Don't talk to him about
the Princess or Miss Man Yao.

270
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,444
Tell him about the recent good news.

271
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,258
Try to cheer him up.

272
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,395
Prince Chen.

273
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:40,458
Captain Xiang, how may I help you?

274
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,907
Your Highness, someone made
a report that a few days ago,

275
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:48,040
you allowed your men to commit
heinous crime to search for a girl.

276
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,549
A dozen of lives were lost.

277
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:50,874
His Majesty is now furious.

278
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,973
I am sent here to bring you in
for investigation.

279
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,244
How is this possible?

280
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:56,942
Wu Yu is afraid of everything,
he would never do that.

281
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,049
I need to inform Brother Wu You.

282
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,780
It's fine, calm down.

283
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,710
I know the Supreme Court well enough.

284
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,090
It'll be okay.
They just have some questions.

285
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,045
My father will never wrong me.

286
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,933
As for you, stay here and wait for me.

287
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,936
Remember, do not bother
Wu You with this.

288
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,492
Okay, it's all right.
I am going now.

289
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:47,728
<i>If a year has passed...</i>

290
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:50,458
<i>and you still refuse to accept me,</i>

291
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,468
<i>I will end this marriage.</i>

292
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,625
<i>You will be freed.</i>

293
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,338
<i>You have my word for it.</i>

294
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:08,256
Princess?

295
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,757
Princess, what's wrong?

296
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,617
Princess?

297
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,191
You can let it all out if you want.

298
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,712
Brother Wu You!

299
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:22,207
Bad news!

300
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,220
Wu Yu is...

301
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,623
Brother Wu You.

302
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:37,444
Look at yourself.

303
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,201
Lady Yun won't rest in peace
if she sees you like this.

304
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,353
Pull yourself together!

305
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,476
Wu Yu needs you to save him.

306
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,819
While you were searching
for Man Yao on the street,

307
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,243
Wu Yu's men turned on him.

308
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,956
Someone made a report saying
that he led his men in heinous crimes.

309
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,980
A dozen of lives were lost.

310
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:05,837
Wu Yu is now arrested
by the Royal Guards.

311
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,248
Brother Wu You, you must save him.

312
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,922
Brother Wu You?

313
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,540
Brother Wu You?

314
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,507
Let's go.

315
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,719
At your service, Your Majesty.

316
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,758
You finally decided to come out.

317
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:30,595
Look at what you have become.

318
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,994
I have heard about
Prince Chen's arrest.

319
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,700
I gave the order to
search for the girl.

320
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,852
Prince Chen was just following order.

321
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,958
The men caused troubles.

322
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:42,488
Whatever the reasons are,
they are still my men.

323
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,198
Prince Chen is innocent.

324
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,813
Take a good look at this!

325
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:50,123
More than ten people were killed!

326
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:54,207
You wreaked havoc to the city
for one peasant girl!

327
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,307
And you made it sound so lightly...

328
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:57,971
and admit it without hesitation.

329
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,024
I bet you think I won't punish you.
Isn't that right?

330
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,284
For the commotion my men caused,

331
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,231
I will take full responsibility.

332
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,706
I will see to it that...

333
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,538
all the involved families
are relocated.

334
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:11,961
You...

335
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,993
Your Majesty.

336
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,498
The real culprit is yet to be found.

337
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,221
We don't know the truth for sure.

338
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,959
Even if Prince Li made
an error in his line of duty,

339
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:25,829
he takes the initiative
help the victims' families.

340
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:28,576
That calls for consideration
for leniency.

341
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:29,829
Never mind.

342
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,664
I, Zongzheng Wu You,

343
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:33,900
will give up all my titles
and be exiled.

344
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,005
Together with Wu Yu,
I hand in my resignation.

345
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,570
Since you are determined
to leave the capital,

346
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,183
you will have my permission.

347
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,226
Your title as the prince is removed.

348
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,055
With the name as son of the Emperor,

349
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,140
you will be sent to the south
to manage the land there.

350
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:58,800
Your Majesty.

351
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:00,624
Your Majesty loves Prince Li deeply...

352
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,692
and can't bear to see Prince Li and
Prince Chen suffer.

353
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:05,920
But lives were lost.

354
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,913
It's not something that
can be made up with titles.

355
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,140
Your Majesty, how do we
explain this to the people?

356
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:14,999
The Princes broke the law.

357
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,992
They must be punished
like other citizens.

358
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,540
Sir Yang.

359
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,449
His Highness saw you
as his right-hand man.

360
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:22,725
How could you turn your back on him?

361
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,900
Sir Yang has compassion
for the people.

362
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,414
You obey the laws to your heart.

363
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,380
I respect that.

364
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:33,872
In that case,

365
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,700
Prince Li won't receive
a death sentence.

366
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,216
But he must be punished.

367
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:41,001
Fifty beatings to him.

368
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,384
Go on.

369
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,519
Your Majesty.

370
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:04,217
The campaign against Wei
will be launched soon.

371
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,020
Managing both the nation's and
military affairs might be too tiring.

372
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,636
Your Majesty once ordered Prince Li
to aid you in the affairs.

373
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,745
Now that Prince Li is stripped
of his ranks and titles,

374
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,900
and there are much works to be done,

375
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,060
I wonder which of the princes...

376
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,798
will be able to aid Your Majesty?

377
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,894
The other princes are still too young.

378
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,180
They are not interested
in national affairs.

379
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,574
-And the Crown Prince is...
-Your Majesty.

380
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:32,903
I understand Your Majesty's concern.

381
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:34,112
However,

382
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,820
the Crown Prince is
still under house arrest.

383
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,968
He had his time to reflect.

384
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,251
From now on,

385
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,179
he is freed from the house arrest.

386
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:44,866
He must return and assist me.

387
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,491
Yes.

388
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,900
Your Majesty.

389
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:54,706
I have a request to make.

390
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,435
Officer Sun, what is it?

391
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:59,264
The autumn is upon us,
the weather has gone cold.

392
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,084
My health is not as well
as it should be.

393
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:04,863
I am too old for the work too.

394
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:09,233
I am willing to follow Prince Li
to the south and assist him...

395
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,940
and at the same time return
to Qingzhou for retirement.

396
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:14,540
You are willing to assist Wu You.

397
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:16,357
I am grateful for that.

398
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,866
Permission granted.

399
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:20,610
I appreciate the consideration.

400
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,865
General Fu.

401
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:54,996
His Majesty gave the order.

402
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,743
I must go to the royal study
for discussion.

403
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,190
Congratulations, Your Highness.

404
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:02,520
General Fu, likewise.

405
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:04,848
I thank you for the help.

406
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,380
I have both the lady and power
that I wanted.

407
00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:11,563
That mere peasant that has nothing....

408
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,300
has no mean to cause us any troubles.

409
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,878
This city is finally rid of
that cursed Zongzheng Wu You.

410
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,260
The Northern Realm...

411
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,672
will be mine!

412
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,781
Congratulations, Your Highness.

413
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,860
Your goal is realised.

414
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,468
Xiang, come over here.

415
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,983
What do you need?

416
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,675
I will give it to you.

417
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,306
How about the title of
Fair Consort of Crown Prince?

418
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:08,949
Your Highness, I am just a commoner.

419
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,817
I have no place in the palace.

420
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,750
I dare not ask for any title.

421
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:15,194
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

422
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:16,967
What do you want then?

423
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,400
You can let me know.

424
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,407
My birthday...

425
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,330
is two weeks from now.

426
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,929
Will Your Highness invite some
of those officers you are close to?

427
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:28,790
Why would you want to invite them?

428
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,420
I may not have a title,

429
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,860
but I want the world to know that...

430
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,693
I am already yours.

431
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,900
Even if I am a present
from General Fu,

432
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:44,555
when I see him again,

433
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:47,759
I don't wish him to see me
as a mere songstress.

434
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,216
I want to be...

435
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,157
Your Highness' treasure.

436
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,261
Good.

437
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,700
You have my word.

438
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:58,369
You will live a decent life.

439
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,664
No one will ever look down
on you again.

440
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,486
What is going on? I don't know.

441
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,300
Hurry up.

442
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,106
Father, are we leaving for
somewhere far away?

443
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,903
Yes, we are going back to Qingzhou.

444
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,439
We will probably stay there
for some time.

445
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:33,824
Come on.

446
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:38,144
Is this part of your work
in the Imperial Court?

447
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,700
-You may go now.
-Yes.

448
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:50,466
You need not worry.
This is a good news.

449
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,553
I requested to be sent there.

450
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,790
Father, are you retiring from
your career as an officer?

451
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,236
You are returning to
our hometown for retirement?

452
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,767
Congratulations, Father.

453
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,272
Why didn't you think about your life?

454
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,873
By good news...

455
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,664
I actually meant your marriage.

456
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:17,563
Please, don't make fun of me.

457
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,610
I would never arrange
your marriage lightly.

458
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,300
I remember the
fortune teller once said...

459
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,077
you are destined to
live like a phoenix.

460
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,866
You stand out in the crowd.

461
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,619
The husband I am picking for you...

462
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,595
is none other than Prince Li.

463
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:34,356
He is the man above all.

464
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,583
The prideful son of heaven.

465
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,538
Father, the engagement of
Prince Li and Princess Rong Le...

466
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,768
made a great wave
throughout the land.

467
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,759
I may be living in the inner manor,

468
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,516
but I have heard about it too.

469
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,180
-Come on.
-Father!

470
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,860
You need not be worried about
Prince Li's future.

471
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:55,247
He was only acting on impulse
with the engagement.

472
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,754
He won't make the same mistake again.

473
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,049
I could tell earlier that
His Majesty is still...

474
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,914
not impressed by the
Crown Prince's behaviour.

475
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,092
His Majesty punished Prince Li
as a reminder.

476
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,176
It's for his own good.

477
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,085
Prince Li will go on an
ordeal in the south.

478
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,589
Soon enough,

479
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,114
His Majesty will find an excuse
to summon him back here.

480
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,038
Father, I am worried that...

481
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,350
Prince Li is already
in love with someone.

482
00:36:18,582 --> 00:36:20,182
He will never marry me.

483
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:21,823
It doesn't matter.

484
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,481
He requested to be
exiled in the south.

485
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,233
It means he wants to severe the past.

486
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,843
With influence of Sun family
in Qingzhou,

487
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:32,558
and the time you will
be spending with him,

488
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:34,961
you are almost certain
to become his consort.

489
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,466
Father.

490
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,911
I don't want it.

491
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,288
This is more than just
about your marriage,

492
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,914
it also concerns the
honour of Sun family.

493
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,307
Yu Shi Hai placed the wrong bet.

494
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,410
His family failed after
three generations.

495
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,549
I don't want to witness
the Sun family fail in my hands.

496
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,950
Get up. As the daughter of Sun family,

497
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:01,227
this is the only time
you can forget yourself.

498
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,042
Sixteen years ago,

499
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,472
His Highness lost the protection
from his mother's family.

500
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,371
I took the risk of being killed
like Qin Yong and became his teacher.

501
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,980
It was an wager.

502
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:21,815
What if he does become the Emperor?

503
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,633
He will repay us with
a thousand times more.

504
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,760
Once you married him,

505
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,785
you can use your family name
to gain his trust.

506
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:31,897
This isn't hard on you.

507
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,184
Send this to Qingzhou.
When they see this,

508
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,976
they will know what to do.

509
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Prince Li, Zongzheng Wu You,
is exiled to the south.

510
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:46,281
Naturally,

511
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
we need to prepare a warm welcome.

512
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,349
Yes, consider it done.

513
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:53,303
How are the matters in the manor?

514
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,159
Everything is set for the Princess.

515
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:56,986
My men are keeping watch on her.

516
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,432
She keep herself in
the Tranquil Garden.

517
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,484
She won't find out about anything.

518
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,067
Take good care of her.

519
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,757
General, Central Secretary Sun
sent a letter for you.

520
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,187
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

521
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,591
Sun Ji Zhou.

522
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,472
Isn't he leaving for Qingzhou?

523
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,742
<i>I never got the chance for proper
farewell since we met in the south.</i>

524
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:29,514
<i>It's time for my leaving again.</i>

525
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:30,819
<i>This is urgent.</i>

526
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,377
<i>Can we meet in the
Flying Swan Tavern?</i>

527
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,387
If this is about something urgent,

528
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,647
he should be inviting me
to his manor instead.

529
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:42,486
Why would he want to meet
in a place with crowd?

530
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,550
Something is at miss.

531
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,675
Maybe it's best to turn him down.

532
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,757
No bother.

533
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:51,844
I want to see just what...

534
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,620
Sun Ji Zhou is up to this time.

535
00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:00,277
Miss Sun?

536
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,110
I hope you are not offended.

537
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,080
I invited you here in
the name of my father.

538
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,442
I was being presumptuous.
I apologise for that.

539
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,620
Please, come in.

540
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,137
Why do you invite me here, Miss Sun?

541
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:21,521
If this is something
within my capability,

542
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,520
I am willing to give you a hand.

543
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,237
Please have a seat and hear me out.

544
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,955
Please.

545
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,670
I have been thinking about this.

546
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,835
I had to ask for your help.

547
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,411
Thank you.

548
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,784
I don't want to follow
my father to Qingzhou.

549
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,834
I wish to stay by your side.

550
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,740
What you said...

551
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:08,260
is not something I would
draw any conclusion on.

552
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,899
I have been admiring you
for a long time.

553
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,180
Ever since we met in the south,

554
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,945
I have been having dreams...

555
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,260
about how astounding you are.

556
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,910
You must have had too much drinks.

557
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,620
It's the wine talking.

558
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:39,848
Let's pretend I didn't hear a word.

559
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,569
No, my mind is clear as day.

560
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:44,800
I may have been raised
in the inner manor,

561
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,898
but I have great respect
for the heroes.

562
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,846
Since the moment I saw you,

563
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,129
I wait for a day when
my dreams come true.

564
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,119
All I ever do...

565
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,020
was to look at you from distance.

566
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,740
Every month, I will sew one
of these fragrance pouch.

567
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,100
I could only hide my thoughts...

568
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:16,251
inside these needle works.

569
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,254
-Miss Sun.
-Please, hear me out.

570
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,700
I am afraid if I don't speak now,

571
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,180
I could never muster
the courage again.
