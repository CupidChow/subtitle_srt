Episode 18

3
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:36,705
Do you know any physicians
that you trust?

4
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,533
It's best if he's an apothecary.

5
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,120
Help me take a look
at this decoction dregs...

6
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,264
to see if there are
any problems with it.

7
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:45,367
Where did you get this from?

8
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,813
I took this decoction every day
when I'm in Western Qi.

9
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,526
It's supposedly a treatment for
my headache and my memory loss.

10
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,374
Now that I think about it,

11
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,860
maybe this concoction...

12
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,552
is the source of my headache
and my memory loss.

13
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:00,246
Are you saying that the
Emperor of Qi is trying to harm you?

14
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,241
I don't know.

15
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,270
After everything that
I had experienced,

16
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:12,253
I can't trust him or the people of
Western Qi anymore.

17
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,548
I don't know how could he be
so cruel to his own family.

18
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:19,173
I couldn't even budge his plan...

19
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,627
even when I threaten him with my life.

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,860
I even think that...

21
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,797
maybe I'm not even
the princess of Western Qi.

22
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,460
No need to be so disheartened.

23
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:36,898
Maybe he had no choice
but to sacrifice you for the country.

24
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,420
We'll find a way to deal with it...

25
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,881
if we really find out that
this dregs is problematic.

26
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:44,908
I'll entrust this to you then.

27
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,536
I've always considered you
as my best friend.

28
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,788
It's my honour that
you are willing to...

29
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,644
entrust this task to me today.

30
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:56,128
I'm really happy for you now that
you've pulled yourself back together.

31
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,195
You have always known me very well.

32
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:00,007
You know that...

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,235
I won't be willing to live
a life of falsehood and hoax.

34
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,959
Even if they love me.

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,340
I want to know...

36
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:10,143
who am I,

37
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,208
where do I come from...

38
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,620
and where am I going to go.

39
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,600
-Feather duster.
-Be careful with it.

40
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,555
Vegetables.

41
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,016
What is wrong with you, Lady?

42
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,740
Bring her to the physician.

43
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,626
It's dangerous to let this
beautiful lone lady lie here.

44
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,538
-This lady looks fine just now.
-What happened?

45
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,410
-Why did she suddenly faint?
-Quick. Bring her in.

46
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,247
-Alright.
-Quick.

47
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:11,105
Miss Chen Yu. Nobody will come in now.
You can open your eyes already.

48
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,961
Thank you, Physician Li.

49
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,140
You've made such an effort to
get here. Are you in troubles?

50
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,246
This decoction dregs
is very important.

51
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,020
Please help me to
check it's component.

52
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,560
And please keep this to yourself.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,780
This is easy. But a decoction dregs
is different from the actual herbs.

54
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,453
Their shapes and properties
have changed.

55
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,516
I think I need a few days
to carefully examine it.

56
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,005
I'll wait for your news then.

57
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:37,553
Thank you for your help.

58
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,740
-General.
-What is it?

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,780
Miss Chen Yu has
gone out for a while...

60
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:53,089
to buy rosin and
other things for her zither.

61
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:56,353
After that, she fainted because she
was ill and was sent to the physician.

62
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:58,349
She has gone back after a while.

63
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,232
-Where's my wife?
-Lady Rong Le has returned safely.

64
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,276
She had stayed put in the
teahouse for a whole day today.

65
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,511
And everything else is normal
for others in the manor.

66
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,340
-How is she feeling?
-I think she is feeling better.

67
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,591
Laughter was heard coming out
from the teahouse.

68
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,522
Since the teahouse has been reopened,

69
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,722
Lady Rong Le has put
all of her energy into it.

70
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,910
You can be rest assured, General.

71
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,461
When she is busy,
she will forget about the past...

72
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,180
and stay by my side without worry.

73
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,448
If she likes to go to the teahouse,
let her be.

74
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,434
She can find happiness in the
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

75
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,914
I believe that one day, in this manor,

76
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,077
she'll find the same happiness here.

77
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,055
General, if you have really
fallen in love with her,

78
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:49,217
our...

79
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,204
This is not something
you should intervene in.

80
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,769
Yes, General.
I've spoken out of turn.

81
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,648
Pass down my orders.

82
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,540
Find me the best tailor in the city.

83
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,768
I want to give my wife a new dress
of the highest quality.

84
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,033
I want her to attend the
Eastern Palace banquet in style...

85
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:19,719
as the wife of the General of Defence.

86
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,440
Yes, General.
I'll pass on your orders.

87
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,519
-Lady Rong Le.
-Lady Rong Le.

88
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:48,974
Princess Rong Le.

89
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,679
General Fu had this dress
made specifically for you.

90
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,548
Look how pretty it is.
Do you want to try it on?

91
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:57,723
No need. I'll put it on when
it's time for us to leave.

92
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:01,668
And these are sent by
General Fu as well.

93
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,670
I heard that they are gifts
from His Majesty.

94
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,582
Princess, these red dates are
the tributes from Qingzhou.

95
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,171
Red dates?

96
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,708
I heard that these red dates
are the specialties of Qingzhou.

97
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:23,736
Qingzhou has given
a lot of them as tributes.

98
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,966
That's why His Majesty has
given them to his subjects.

99
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,949
General Fu knows that you love them,
that's why he has sent them to you.

100
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,940
Qingzhou is teemed with these.

101
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,566
If you love them so much,

102
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,500
I'll bring you to my manor
in Qingzhou...

103
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:48,154
and let you eat your fill.

104
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,297
Is it good?

105
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,597
Princess, no matter what
His Majesty gave,

106
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,037
General Fu will send those gifts
to you right after he received them.

107
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:10,465
Princess, General Fu is here.

108
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,414
Thank you for the dress.

109
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,060
Do you like it?

110
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,263
Clean up and change into it
as soon as possible.

111
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,741
We can't let the Eastern Palace
wait for too long.

112
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,641
-Alright. Let's change now then.
-Yes, Lady Rong Le.

113
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,733
Congratulations, Crown Prince.
Congratulations, Lady Xiang.

114
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,133
Zhao Yun.

115
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
Come.

116
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,121
Greetings, Your Highness.
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

117
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,865
Your Highness, this lady is...

118
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,200
She is Princess Zhao Yun.

119
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,781
Her father was conferred upon a
title because of his contributions.

120
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,670
But he has passed away long time ago.
Now, she is staying outside.

121
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:04,949
But my father dotes on her,

122
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,860
so she can still move freely
in the palace.

123
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:09,968
Crown Prince.

124
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,939
I've brought you some good wine.

125
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,500
Come, my lady.

126
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,336
-Greetings, Lady Xiang.
-Greetings, my lord.

127
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,918
Greetings, Fair Consort
of Crown Prince.

128
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,307
Long time no see, Princess Zhao Yun.

129
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,077
Please send my regards
to your uncle and your family.

130
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,340
Arrival of General Fu!

131
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,284
-General Fu.
-Lady Rong Le is here.

132
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,781
Xiang, quickly say your thanks
to this benefactor of yours.

133
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,720
Greetings from me and
my wife to you, Crown Prince.

134
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,860
You have exaggerated just now.

135
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:43,454
Lady Xiang is different now.
There's no need for thanks between us.

136
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

137
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,224
I wish that you'll always be
young and pretty, Lady Xiang.

138
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,004
Thank you, General Fu.

139
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:52,003
Thank you, Lady Rong Le.

140
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:53,743
<i>So, this is my stand-in.</i>

141
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,925
<i>Is she a chess piece that my brother
has put in the Northern Realm...</i>

142
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,954
<i>or is she the mouthpiece for Fu Chou
to send words to the Eastern Palace?</i>

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,711
-Lady Rong Le is here.
-She is indeed a princess.

144
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,634
-That's right.
-Her elegance is outstanding.

145
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:09,370
-Look at her.
-Xiang, accompany Lady Rong Le.

146
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,913
She is so beautiful.

147
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
General Fu, after you.

148
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,780
After you, Your Highness.

149
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,124
I can tell that this dress
is of the finest silk.

150
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:22,053
Only the Rare Item Chamber is able
to make such high quality dress.

151
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:23,894
It suits your elegance, Lady Rong Le.

152
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,340
Zhao Yun.

153
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,820
-That's so good.
-She's so pretty.

154
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,128
Lady Rong Le, please wait.

155
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:35,548
Thank you for coming here today.

156
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,933
That day, we didn't get to talk much
in the General's Manor.

157
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,006
Now, you have become
the general's wife.

158
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,290
Life is unpredictable.
I hope that...

159
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,260
you can look after me in the future.

160
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:47,222
You are the crown prince's
favourite right now.

161
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,475
I should be the one who
asks you to look after me.

162
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,203
Compared to the deep affection
between you and General Fu,

163
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,589
this favour that
I get is just nothing.

164
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,019
Do you know...

165
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,957
why the people are treating you
so politely today...

166
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,850
in this banquet?

167
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:03,688
General Fu.

168
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:05,853
Out of respect to you,

169
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,624
I have chosen each guests
carefully beforehand.

170
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:12,131
I want to make sure that your wife
is treated like an honoured guest.

171
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,405
Thank you, Your Highness.

172
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:17,661
General Fu, I don't get it.

173
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,846
What did the woman seduce you with...

174
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,661
until you are trying
so hard to protect her?

175
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,542
And you even kept it
a secret from her.

176
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,364
Since he wants to keep it as a secret,
what is the reason for you...

177
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,458
to reveal it to me?

178
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,100
I just feel that it's unfair
for General Fu.

179
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,700
This is a secret between us.

180
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:41,267
I hope that you won't betray me.

181
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:45,745
Lady Xiang, all the guests are here.
When can we start?

182
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,648
The banquet is going to start now.
Let's take our seats.

183
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:53,398
Thank you, Your Highness.

184
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:58,651
Come.

185
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:00,705
I'm very happy today that...

186
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,877
you are able to attend the birthday
banquet of my beloved Lady Xiang.

187
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,195
I wish for her to be
young and happy always.

188
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,585
Come, let's cheers.

189
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,540
Sit down.

190
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:25,434
Princess Zhao Yun.
Let's drink together.

191
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:29,147
-Come. Let's drink together.
-Let go of me!

192
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,211
How dare you reject
my invitation to drink together?

193
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,717
-Let go of me.
-I'm honouring you by doing so.

194
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,657
-How dare you reject me?
-Let go of me!

195
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,137
-If I ask you to drink, then drink it!
-Get lost!

196
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:43,425
You are drunk.

197
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,220
I think it's better for you
to go back and rest.

198
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:47,872
I'm sure that the crown prince
won't mind.

199
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,388
It's you.

200
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,400
How dare you critic me again here?

201
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,182
Your Highness.

202
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,998
I'm very happy today and
I would like to ask you a favour.

203
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,287
I'm very gleeful today as well.

204
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,260
What is it that you want?

205
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:05,863
As long as Lady Xiang agrees,

206
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,509
I can give you anything.

207
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:11,486
Please allow me to take in
Zhao Yun as my concubine.

208
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,586
In your dream!

209
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,495
If you marry me, you won't
have to depend on others.

210
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:21,619
Prince Qing He's Manor is one of
the richest lot in this city.

211
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,340
I think that both of you
are quite a match.

212
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,689
What do you think, Lady Xiang?

213
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,869
You are right, Your Highness.
I'll leave it to you to decide.

214
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,703
-Alright, then I'll...
-So what if he's rich?

215
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:36,782
I heard that he's a Casanova. Not only
he has many wives and concubines,

216
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:39,693
he even defiled his maidservants.
How can he be a good match?

217
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,156
You are such a wench.

218
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:43,937
Others don't dare to say it...

219
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,679
but I'm not afraid to do so.

220
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,226
You are fickle and lascivious.
Everybody knows about...

221
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,389
your relationship with that
Zongzheng Wu You.

222
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,513
You were with another
before you were married...

223
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,593
and in Yun's Tomb, you even...

224
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,984
Looks like he has indeed
had too much of a drink.

225
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:10,370
General Fu, he is drunk.

226
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,860
Please forgive him...

227
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,815
out of your respect for me.

228
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,787
Your Highness.
I feel a little bit light-headed.

229
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,209
I wish to go back to change.
I'll be back soon.

230
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,026
Go ahead.

231
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,197
Be careful.

232
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,241
I'm really impressed with
your actions, General Fu.

233
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,279
The son of Prince Qing He
likes to frequent the brothels...

234
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:39,263
and he has many wives and concubines.

235
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,976
He has no regard for himself
and has humiliated other's wife.

236
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,534
It's good that General Fu
has taught him a lesson.

237
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,500
If he has done wrong,

238
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,803
he should have been prepared
to get the punishment he deserves.

239
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,735
Is this a warning for me?

240
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,780
I won't dare to do it.

241
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,020
I can't help but to blurt it out
when I saw the deep affection...

242
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,110
between General Fu and Lady Rong Le.

243
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:07,395
I don't feel well.
I'll take my leave now.

244
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,580
Please uphold justice for me.

245
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:17,544
Your Highness!

246
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,117
Your Highness.

247
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:23,022
-Please uphold justice for me.
-This...

248
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,993
What happened?

249
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,360
When I went back to
my room to change just now,

250
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:30,283
I saw that my maidservant
had hung herself to death...

251
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,850
as soon as I opened the door.

252
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:33,222
What?

253
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:36,775
Your Highness, before the banquet,
I saw the son of Prince Qing He...

254
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,140
harassing Xiao Cui.

255
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,820
I don't know what happened.

256
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,326
Nonsense!

257
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,580
Your Highness.

258
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,999
My personal maidservant
is dead on my birthday.

259
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,960
Such an ominous incident.
If this spreads, I'm afraid that...

260
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,722
Lady Xiang,
don't treat me so unjustly.

261
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,340
From now on,

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,220
none of the people from your manor
shall step a foot in here.

263
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:57,935
Kick him out!

264
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,731
Your Highness!

265
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:03,622
I'm innocent!

266
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,830
Thank you, Princess Rong Le.

267
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:12,795
Lady Rong Le,

268
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,180
if you have been offended by
the incident just now,

269
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,020
we can go back to our manor.

270
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,289
Crown Prince.

271
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,993
-We'll take our leave first.
-Farewell.

272
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,518
Please wait, General Fu.

273
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,468
Today's incident...

274
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:45,336
has displeasured both of you.

275
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:47,617
It's my fault for being
not attentive enough.

276
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,307
This is a gift from the crown prince
to express his regrets.

277
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:00,489
Thank you to the crown prince
and to you, Lady Xiang.

278
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:02,928
Farewell.

279
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,632
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

280
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,332
Mistress.

281
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,951
This is the prescription derived
from the decoction dregs.

282
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,425
There's no problem with it.

283
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:23,558
It's just some normal medicine
meant for headache.

284
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,671
There are some valuable tonics
in it as well.

285
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,711
I think they were added
because your body is weak.

286
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,597
Are you sure that it's really safe?

287
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,922
He is my most trusted physician.

288
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,716
To make sure that he's right,

289
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:38,270
I had asked other physicians
to check it out as well.

290
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,985
And the dregs turned out fine.

291
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,299
Looks like I've think too much.

292
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,620
Chen Yu.

293
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,779
I'm surprise that you
have done this...

294
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,406
so well and so carefully.

295
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,707
I've been wading
in this city since young.

296
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,044
I've gotten to know
people of all sorts.

297
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:57,052
That's how I'm able to hold my place
in this savage place.

298
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:58,714
But you have to be careful.

299
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,316
I was followed when I went
to the apothecary house that day.

300
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,415
I think that person
works for General Fu.

301
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:09,136
He guards against me...

302
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:11,018
and I'm suspicious about him.

303
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,604
By the way,

304
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,533
when you were in the
House of Fragrance,

305
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,976
do you know about this dancer
named Hen Xiang...

306
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,659
who is very beautiful...

307
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,396
and is a skilful dancer?

308
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,483
I've never heard of her.

309
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:29,822
But if she's as outstanding
as you say she is,

310
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,978
why did nobody know about her?

311
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,885
That's why I need you to
investigate on her for me.

312
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,849
I want to see if she's really
from the House of Fragrance.

313
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,576
I want to know when did
she come to the city...

314
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,771
and how did she end up dancing
in the General's Manor.

315
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,787
Don't worry, Mistress.
Just wait for my news.

316
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:52,686
" Eastern Suburb Inn "

317
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,500
Why did you ask me to
come here so urgently?

318
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,500
I want to see you.

319
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,913
Have you found the things I need?

320
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,583
These are all the secrets I had
collected from the Eastern Palace.

321
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,892
It includes the clique that the
crown prince and officials are in...

322
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,127
together with the transactions
and their secret meetups.

323
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,480
This is it?

324
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:39,169
You took a risk in front of my wife
to ask me to come here...

325
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,782
just to show me
these kinds of useless things?

326
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,180
Hen Xiang, remember.

327
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,639
From now onwards,

328
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,220
unless it's a very
important matter, or else,

329
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,170
don't come out from the palace
without permission. Understand?

330
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:58,553
I don't wish to stay
at the Eastern Palace.

331
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,300
I don't want to see the crown prince.

332
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,380
And I don't want to take pains to
cater to a person that I don't like.

333
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,278
What nonsense are you talking about?

334
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:08,025
Now, everything we do has
to be for the greater good.

335
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,266
Keep a close eye on that crown prince.

336
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,246
He'll be of use to us in the future.

337
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,980
Do we really have to do this?

338
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,980
You are the only one I trust.

339
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,062
Although this is quite risky,

340
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,935
I trust no other but you.

341
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,260
Alright.

342
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,022
I'm willing to do anything for you.

343
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,186
Don't worry. The Eastern Palace
is under my control now.

344
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,940
I'm just worried about...

345
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,900
that princess of Western Qi.

346
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,655
She has nothing to do with
the things that you need to do.

347
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,940
I know you. In the banquet today,

348
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,500
you have really gotten angry for real.

349
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,980
If you have fallen in love with her,

350
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,300
it'll affect our grand plan.

351
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:05,938
Take a good care of yourself.
I have to leave now.

352
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,399
Father.

353
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:29,992
Greetings, father.

354
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,248
Father.

355
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,093
-Why did you call me here?
-Spoiled brat!

356
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,529
The music from your banquet
in the Eastern Palace...

357
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,150
was so noisy until I could hear it
from my resting chamber.

358
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:47,058
And you did it just to celebrate the
birthday of a woman from public house.

359
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,356
Even the censorate
has complained to me.

360
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:52,054
They say that you have
no talents, no morale...

361
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,159
and are not worthy
to be a crown prince.

362
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,296
Please calm down, father.

363
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,060
I'm just using my concubine's birthday
as a way...

364
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,906
to bond with my brothers, nieces
and my some of my close officials.

365
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:08,508
Go back to your palace today
and get rid of that woman.

366
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:11,763
If you do this again, I'll strip you
of your crown prince title.

367
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:16,593
Yes, father.

368
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,714
Thank you for forgiving me.

369
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,192
Consort, my personal
maidservant is dead.

370
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,911
I just want to buy in two maidservants
of mine from outside of the palace.

371
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,220
Why do you have to
make things difficult for me?

372
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,871
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell
His Highness about it?

373
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:44,600
Are you going to ignore the imperial
rules just because he dotes on you?

374
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,913
Now, all of the servants are
like the weathercock.

375
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:48,126
They're all trying to get
in your good grace.

376
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:49,501
You can just choose from them.

377
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,460
Why do you need to buy them
from outside of the palace?

378
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,139
-Your Highness.
-Xiang.

379
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,431
You better tone it down.

380
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,710
My father has found out about
the birthday banquet.

381
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,419
He wants to kick you out
from the palace.

382
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,013
It's my fault for dragging you
into this, Your Highness.

383
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:14,155
Please release me from the palace.
I'll leave now.

384
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:16,283
Xiang, quick.

385
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:17,569
Get up.

386
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:20,703
His Majesty was just dressing me down.

387
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:22,743
He didn't punish me.

388
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,578
Moreover, now,
besides the Eastern Palace,

389
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:27,748
who else can he trust?

390
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:30,407
You just need to stay in
the Eastern Palace quietly.

391
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,747
And he'll forget about it
in a few days' time.

392
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:36,502
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,658
How could you
feign compliance like that?

394
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,725
Looks like you don't really care
about His Majesty anymore.

395
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:47,851
Are you the one who
complained about me?

396
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,626
Do you need me to remind you again?

397
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:53,238
Now, you don't have your family
to protect you anymore.

398
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:55,876
Your life or death is in my hands.

399
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,440
Don't use His Majesty to scare me off.

400
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,020
I'm doing this for your own good.

401
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,081
But you've always
conjectured me with malice.

402
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:07,715
Fine.

403
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,220
I won't advice you anymore
from now on.

404
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,457
But I want to remind you
one last time.

405
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,585
Unpalatable advice benefits conduct
and good advice jars on the ear.

406
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,919
You'll understand what I mean by that
if you ever happened...

407
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:22,106
to get into deep troubles one day.

408
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,515
-You!
-I'll take my leave now.

409
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:27,989
So gloomy!

410
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,820
You are such a gloomy person!

411
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,646
Xiang, come and drink with me.

412
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,300
Let's forget about her.

413
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,003
Princess Rong Le, Princess Zhao Yun
is here to see you.

414
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:08,991
Zhao Yun.

415
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:10,779
You have something to tell me?

416
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,660
Princess Rong Le.

417
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,731
Today, I heard news from the palace...

418
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,661
saying that the son of Prince Qing He
has been sent to the fringe.

419
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,152
Finally, I don't need to
see him anymore.

420
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,272
Thank you, Princess Rong Le.

421
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,977
No need to thank me.
You are my sister.

422
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,410
It's only right for me
to help my sister.

423
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:32,161
Princess Rong Le. This is the
red dates from Qingzhou.

424
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:34,264
I know you love these.

425
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:36,273
Brother Wu You has sent them to me.

426
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:39,289
Actually, he wants me
to send them to you.

427
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,213
Zhao Yun, it has taken you
one month to think this through.

428
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:53,732
Let's just talk
about us today, alright?

429
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:57,252
Princess Rong Le,
I know that you are a kind person.

430
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,213
You didn't mean to lie to
me and Brother Wu You.

431
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,241
You must have had your
own difficulties too...

432
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:05,038
regarding the matter between
you and Brother Wu You, right?

433
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,076
Have a taste of it.

434
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,060
I'll use food to plug your mouth.

435
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,771
It's tasty.

436
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,456
Princess Rong Le.
Look how beautiful your writing is.

437
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,578
Wu Yu always ridicules me...

438
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,310
about my spidery writing since young.

439
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:29,951
Can you teach me how to write?

440
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:32,470
After I practise my writing,
I'll write a letter to Wu Yu.

441
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,773
He'll be so surprised.

442
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:37,271
Sure. Come on then.

443
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,382
My writing has improved.

444
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:08,909
You are getting better at it.

445
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,020
Princess Zhao Yun.
Let me take a look at it.

446
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,246
Here.

447
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:17,609
It still looks ugly.

448
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,020
Ling Yue.

449
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,420
Do you mean me or my writing?

450
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,333
I mean your writing.

451
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,852
Ling Yue! You!

452
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,260
-Stop running around.
-Stop running, stand there!

453
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:35,344
-She's waving the brush around.
-I'm going to draw on your face!

454
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,820
You!

455
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:40,486
Ling Yue, how dare you
say that it's ugly?

456
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:43,265
-Save me, Princess Rong Le!
-Stop right there!

457
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,676
Tell me, is it ugly?

458
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:51,733
Stop running!

459
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,940
<i>Rong Le.</i>

460
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:01,927
<i>I'll be satisfied as long as
you are happy.</i>

461
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,427
<i>But when can this
happiness of yours...</i>

462
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,194
<i>belong to me?</i>

463
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,820
General Fu.

464
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,907
It's rare to see her so happy.

465
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:17,981
Let's...

466
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,220
give them some time alone.

467
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,457
-I got you! How dare you say that!
-Don't run!

468
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,860
I'm going to doodle on your face.

469
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,129
Let me wipe it off for you.

470
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,751
-I can't wipe it off.
-Enough, Princess Zhao Yun.

471
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,140
Let's go and wash it off.
We can just wash it off with water.

472
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:52,016
You look quite fine.

473
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,618
Alright. Let's go.

474
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,022
Let's go.

475
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,054
" General Fu, it's been so long.
How is Rong Le? "

476
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,611
" I'm here to ask about the book. "

477
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,760
" Have you gotten any clues from her?
Don't force her. "

478
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:11,014
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

479
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,693
What did the Emperor of Qi say?

480
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:15,318
He's asking me...

481
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,772
about Rong Le's condition recently...

482
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,375
and do we have
any updates on the book.

483
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:23,769
The Emperor of Qi believes that
the princess has gotten the book...

484
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:25,469
but she's not willing
to give it to him.

485
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:28,316
Could it be that she has
given it to Prince Li?

486
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:31,864
I think that it must be related
to Zongzheng Wu You.

487
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,660
It's possible that...

488
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:36,480
they broke off because of the book.

489
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,860
How's the situation in
the southern fringe lately?

490
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,046
Zongzheng Wu You neglects his duty and
loiters in his manor all day long.

491
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,590
He wouldn't meet anybody.

492
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't think he'll pose
any threats...

493
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:49,573
to our grand plan.

494
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:51,748
Don't let down
your guards against him.

495
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:53,541
Wu You is very good...

496
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,485
in concealing his true self.

497
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,516
He might seem nonchalant,
but he can set the world alight.

498
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,340
We have to learn from
the mistakes of Yu Shi Hai.

499
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,740
We can't let ourselves
end up like them.

500
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,850
By the way, have you gotten any news
on the seven mysterious men...

501
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,660
that appeared on my wedding?

502
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:12,728
I'm too incompetent. I still haven't
found anything about them.

503
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,917
No matter what, we have to know
the ins and outs about them.

504
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,010
I'm still worried about him.

505
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:24,105
-Go to the southern fringe for me.
-Yes, General Fu.

506
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:34,585
" Qingzhou "

507
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:46,358
Wu You.

508
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:47,811
Wu You.

509
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:51,209
You are playing chess
with yourself again?

510
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,115
How are you going to improve
if you play with yourself every day?

511
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,844
Soon, I'm going to be
better in it than you do.

512
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,820
Have you done your chores?

513
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:03,299
I just simply went through
all of them.

514
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,650
I'm not like you.

515
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,370
The public affairs here are a mess.

516
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,444
My head is spinning
just by looking at them.

517
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:10,199
Moreover, the scholars here
are very powerful...

518
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:11,838
and their relationships
are very complicated.

519
00:31:11,991 --> 00:31:14,982
All of them are very cunning.

520
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:17,203
I can't deal with them.

521
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:20,523
Luckily, Sir Sun is willing to help.
So, I've left everything to him.

522
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,560
Wu You.

523
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:26,331
I've sent the red dates to Zhao Yun
regularly just like you asked.

524
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,315
You should forget
about all the things...

525
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,180
that happened in the city.
You have to pull yourself together.

526
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,255
The three states of southern fringe
and the whole of Northern Realm...

527
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:35,973
are depending on you.

528
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,195
Greetings, Your Highness.

529
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,542
Your Highness, I've prepared
some snacks for you.

530
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:48,175
Miss Sun, you've came right on time.

531
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,003
I heard that you are
very skilful in chess.

532
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,340
How about you finish off
this round with Wu You?

533
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,019
Let me learn something from it.

534
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:57,214
I'm not that good.
You are too kind, Your Highness.

535
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:00,649
My father has left
this manor in my care.

536
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,553
I wouldn't dare to waste my time
to play chess here.

537
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,089
Your servants can attend to
the matters in the manor.

538
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:08,359
But you are the only one
who knows how to play chess.

539
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:12,023
Your priority is to take
a good care of Wu You, right?

540
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,780
Stop joking around, Your Highness.

541
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:18,170
-I'll take my leave first.
-Ya Li.

542
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,780
How about we play a round
of chess together?

543
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:23,595
In the meantime, you can
update me about your father.

544
00:32:24,587 --> 00:32:26,690
That's right. Take a seat.

545
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,128
Wu You, please start now.

546
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,845
I want to see how are you going
to resolve this chess.

547
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,104
We can't resolve it anymore.

548
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:36,750
After the piece that you've put down
just now, it has become a stalemate.

549
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,344
How about we discard this round...

550
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,319
and start anew?

551
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:52,864
Your turn.

552
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:04,444
I thought that you are going to
play chess with that person only.

553
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:22,843
-Sir Xiang.
-Sir Zheng, long time no see.

554
00:33:23,192 --> 00:33:24,992
General Fu has sent me
to remind you that...

555
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,728
it has always been
fair and square between us.

556
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:31,310
You took our money
but we see no result.

557
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:34,651
It makes the general
questions your loyalty.

558
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,500
I wouldn't dare to be disloyal.

559
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,637
I've been under the general's care
for so many years.

560
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:40,387
Of course I'll repay him.

561
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:44,413
But it's not easy to get close
to Zongzheng Wu You.

562
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,460
He won't budge no matter what.

563
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,651
After he reached Qingzhou,
no matter how we plead to meet him,

564
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,200
he'll reject us.

565
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:55,706
The only thing that I heard is that
he spent a lot of time...

566
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,221
with the daughter of Sun Ji Zhou.

567
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,456
Isn't it better for our plan...

568
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,331
if Zongzheng Wu You does nothing?

569
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,841
I was just about to report
to you about that.

570
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,334
-General.
-Sir Qin will be leading this plan.

571
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,850
The poor here is foolish and ignorant.

572
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:18,515
-We can whip up a chaos easily.
-Get it done then.

573
00:34:19,302 --> 00:34:20,542
General.

574
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,929
You know that...

575
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:26,597
as soon as the war starts,
money will be gone very fast.

576
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:29,486
I wonder if you could sponsor us
a little bit more?

577
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,678
As long as this is successful,
you'll be rewarded handsomely.

578
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,445
How dare you ask money
from the general?

579
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:36,781
Sir Zheng.

580
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,203
You assume importance
by amassing troops.

581
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,940
You keep those who can help you,

582
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,085
not those ungrateful scums
that are of no help.

583
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,199
I understand.

584
00:35:05,577 --> 00:35:08,457
My son. The southern fringe has
always been a flourishing place.

585
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,904
Recently, the amount of refugees
that has revolted...

586
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,891
is way higher than that of
the amount in poorer places.

587
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,980
Something is not right.
We have to investigate on it properly.

588
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:24,428
<i>Father knows that
Wu Yu and I are innocent.</i>

589
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,902
<i>He sent me here...</i>

590
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:27,634
<i>to shield me from troubles,
to let me take a breather...</i>

591
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,708
<i>and to investigate on
this incident secretly.</i>

592
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:33,076
<i>From his secret letter,
he wrote that something is not right.</i>

593
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:34,547
<i>But...</i>

594
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:37,328
<i>the scholars here are very powerful
and they are deep-rooted here.</i>

595
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,715
<i>The government here is weak.</i>

596
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:40,894
<i>And the army here is understaffed
and has no power.</i>

597
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:43,167
<i>I don't know where to start.</i>

598
00:35:58,153 --> 00:35:59,513
Greetings, General Fu.

599
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:04,429
I've sent the money to the southern
fringe just like you've requested.

600
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,490
But my master would like
to ask you about the book.

601
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:10,063
Do you have any news about it?

602
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:12,411
Zongzheng Wu You neglects his duty...

603
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,461
and is having fun all day long
in the southern fringe.

604
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,980
He doesn't act like a person
who has gotten the book.

605
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:22,292
Maybe the princess has never
gotten her hands on the book.

606
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:23,695
Maybe...

607
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:26,368
she had said that just to spite him.

608
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:29,495
Tell the Emperor of Qi that...

609
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:32,213
if I have any news about
The Book of Mountains and Rivers,

610
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:35,310
I'll tell him everything
without pause.

611
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,869
One more thing.
His Majesty wants to remind you...

612
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,190
to take a good care of the princess.

613
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:42,718
He'll continue to support you.

614
00:36:42,854 --> 00:36:44,534
But if anything happens to her,

615
00:36:44,698 --> 00:36:48,237
you won't be able to deal
with the consequences.

616
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,620
She is my wife.

617
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,464
Of course I'll love and respect her.

618
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,995
Please ask...

619
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,746
His Majesty to be rest assured.

620
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:59,267
That's for the best. Farewell.

621
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,799
One day soon,
I'll be free from your threats...

622
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,644
and become the master of this world.

623
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,377
I believe that...

624
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,388
as long as you put your mind to it,

625
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,340
you'll be able to do that.

626
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,236
How's the preparation...

627
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:33,879
for the fake identity?

628
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,986
Of course it's seamless.

629
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Princess, letter from Miss Chen Yu
of the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

630
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,358
Such a beautiful lady.

631
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,913
If you look closely,
she's a bit similar to you.

632
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,980
But she's not as pretty as you.

633
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,888
Lady Xiang is from Western Qi.

634
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,500
Could it be that my brother...

635
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:12,384
Xiao Sha.

636
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,060
-What is it, Princess?
-I need to ask you something.

637
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,047
Have you ever seen this lady before?

638
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:23,473
Never.

639
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,260
I heard that Moon Embrace Teahouse
has some new tea coming in.

640
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,100
I would like to take some from you
so that I can send them to the palace.

641
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,270
Would you mind if I do that?

642
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:52,880
You can help yourself with them.
No need to ask for my permission.

643
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,283
Thank you.

644
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:57,298
Everything in this manor
belongs to you anyway.

645
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,399
I hope that it'll be as you said.

646
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,970
I hope that one day,

647
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,129
your heart will belong to me too.

648
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:21,723
Sir Sun.

649
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,474
Zheng family has been here
for centuries as well.

650
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,302
We have produced generations
of high-ranking officials.

651
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,291
And we are bonded with your family
through several marriages.

652
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:32,307
The hundreds acres of land in the
eastern suburb is a wasteland.

653
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:34,514
Why can you claim the land...

654
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:36,717
while I cannot?

655
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,998
Are you going to do as you please
regardless of centuries-old rules...

656
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:43,382
of the major clans here just
because you are the princes' teacher?

657
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:44,956
What nonsense.

658
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,192
The land in the eastern suburb
is not without it's owner.

659
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,437
Those farmers are tired
of raising crops.

660
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:51,664
They chose to willingly serve
the Sun family instead.

661
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,620
So, of course that land belongs to me.

662
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,089
It's not a wasteland without owner.

663
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:58,363
Don't be angry.
Everything can be discussed.

664
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,780
-Calm...
-Lately,

665
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,623
during the chaos in
the southern fringe...

666
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,072
where refugees flee in disorder
and lands turn to waste,

667
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,722
you've taken mean advantage of us.

668
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,220
You've swallowed up many of our lands.

669
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,900
Now that General Fu has
brought us peace again,

670
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:13,239
why did you poke your nose
into the eastern suburb...

671
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,922
that has always been under me?

672
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:16,216
Are you trying...

673
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:19,085
to be the local despot of Qingzhou?

674
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:20,807
-You...
-Sir Zheng.

675
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,940
If are fighting to be
the local despot here,

676
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,474
then what about the
Emperor of Northern Realm?

677
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:28,454
-Your Highness.
-Wu You, you came right on time.

678
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,445
I don't want to sit here as
an accessory anymore.

679
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,171
It's better if you take over.

680
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,078
You must be Prince Li.

681
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,170
I'm seeing you for the first time.
Forgive me...

682
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,772
for the slip of my tongue.

683
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:41,837
I wouldn't dare to let you
address me as Your Highness.

684
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:46,643
A third of Qingzhou belongs
to the Zheng family.

685
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,053
I'm just a passer-by. The land I own
is just the one I'm standing on.

686
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:53,319
Compared to the great Zheng family,

687
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,121
I'm nothing.

688
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,169
You've exaggerated, Your Highness.

689
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,006
Thanks to our ancestors,

690
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:01,034
my family has been here for centuries.

691
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,620
We have always dealt with
the land affairs on our own.

692
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,792
We wouldn't dare
to trouble you with it.

693
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,881
What do you mean, Sir Zheng?

694
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,792
All the lands in this nation
belongs to the emperor.

695
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,012
Only His Majesty has
the final say on them.

696
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:16,977
There are no rules about
dealing with the lands on our own.

697
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,660
I have no interest in
this kind of thing.

698
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:21,731
If it's a centuries-old rules,

699
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:23,895
then both of you can
sort it out yourself.

700
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

701
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:29,852
Sir Sun.

702
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,796
The number of people in your family
has always been on the thin side.

703
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:35,798
You have no successor at all.

704
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,980
All the lands that you've
fought for will just...

705
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:40,166
become the dowry for your
daughter in the future.

706
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:41,327
You!

707
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,154
How about you marry
your daughter to my son?

708
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:47,533
Then we'll become a family
bonded by marriage.

709
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,583
When the time comes,
I'll give these lands...

710
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,614
to you as betrothal gifts.
How about that?

711
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:17,708
Miss Sun, don't worry.

712
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,707
You are the apple of his eyes.

713
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:22,440
Your father won't let you marry
that idiotic son from Zheng.

714
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,854
How about you ask
His Highness for help?

715
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:28,665
If you have His Highness's supports,
Zheng family can do nothing to you.

716
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,540
Even if I manage to free myself
from Zheng family,

717
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,026
my father will still force me
to marry someone I don't love.

718
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:39,835
I don't even dare to get close
to His Highness.

719
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:41,605
If my father knows about it,

720
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:44,422
he'll give me two choices
to choose from.

721
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:47,286
I have to choose
either His Highness...

722
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,220
or the son of Zheng family.

723
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:52,192
But both of them...

724
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,609
are not the ones that I want.

725
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,624
Miss Sun, what are we going to do?

726
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,140
If only I could go back...

727
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,460
to Zhongshan.

728
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,780
Miss Sun,
Prince Li has sent you a gift.

729
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,010
Such beautiful silver bracelets.
There is a pair of them.

730
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:38,919
Miss Sun, is His Highness...
