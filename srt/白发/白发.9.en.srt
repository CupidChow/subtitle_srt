00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,560
Episode 9

3
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,312
I really want to know what's
so good about this.

4
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:49,123
Is it good because you
are protecting each other,

5
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:51,368
is it because you
got rid of a dissident...

6
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:54,038
or is it because you can
treat human lives as nothing?

7
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,730
That's not true, Your Highness.

8
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,895
If you are worried about the matters
regarding Prince Chen...

9
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,038
Today is my birthday.

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,837
How about I use my luck today
to ask the crown prince...

11
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:18,726
to beg for Prince Chen's pardon
from His Majesty?

12
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:20,858
No need.

13
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,381
Anybody who did wrong
has to be punished.

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
No matter it’s him or anybody else.

15
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,090
You mentioned about luck.

16
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,992
Today, it's your birthday.

17
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:36,409
But I would like to take
something from you.

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,791
What is it that you wish
to take from me?

19
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,106
-Father!
-Please think again, Your Highness.

20
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,665
-You can't do that, Your Highness.
-Your Highness!

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,720
I want to take your head.
How about that?

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,160
Wu You.

23
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:18,568
You threaten an
officer's life in public.

24
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,298
Are you trying to revolt?

25
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:24,654
Let's see who's the one
trying to revolt here.

26
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:28,199
Sir Yu, looks like you
haven't taken a look...

27
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:32,167
at the content of the ten art
of war books that I had given you.

28
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:52,236
How is it, General Fu?
Do you understand now?

29
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,667
Do you think we can
still settle this in peace?

30
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
I can't be sure of the authenticity...

31
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:00,766
of this name list.

32
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,800
It doesn't if you are not sure.

33
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,481
I believe that Sir Yu
is very clear about it.

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,298
The ten scrolls on the floor...

35
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:12,303
contain the names of all those who are
involved in this rank-selling case.

36
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,630
Sir Yu might be able
to kill Li Zhi Yuan.

37
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
But you won't be able to kill those...

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,920
thousands of witnesses whose names
were recorded by him, right?

39
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,055
Sir Yu.

40
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:23,577
Is Prince Li telling the truth?

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,480
Crown Prince, this is slander.

42
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:30,471
Prince Li, you can't prove us guilty
with your words alone.

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,727
What are you trying to do?

44
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:38,259
Father, we can't just let go
of the foundation that...

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,290
our family has built
for generations today.

46
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:43,191
His Highness dares to
accuse us in public...

47
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,948
and point his sword at you.
So, no need to be courteous to him.

48
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:49,341
Yu Wen Jie. You are just
struggling for nothing.

49
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,573
I know that you are very courageous.

50
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:53,493
Even if you don't care
about your own safety...

51
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,600
or the safety Prince Chen
who is in jail,

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,605
you care about the safety of that
mistress from the teahouse, right?

53
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,878
Please think carefully.

54
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,288
If you can let go of me today,

55
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,311
we can start anew.

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,203
And we will let go of your woman.

57
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:58,234
Sir Yu.

58
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,350
Nobody dares to threaten me.

59
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,173
And nobody can threaten me.

60
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,744
Prince Li, you really
don't care for that woman's life?

61
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Guards, bring that woman over.

62
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,081
You dare touch her?

63
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,645
Wen Jie.

64
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:40,676
Prince Li, you are the one
who forces my hand.

65
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,181
This matter...

66
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,940
involves the many lives and honour
of Yu family for three generations.

67
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,556
I won't let you leave
this place easily.

68
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,101
Guards! Close the door!

69
00:06:58,363 --> 00:06:59,923
Don't you dare!

70
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,840
A decree from His Majesty.

71
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,965
As decreed from His Majesty,

72
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:27,503
it's unforgivable that the
father-son duo of Yu...

73
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,764
is involved in rank-selling
and has duped His Majesty.

74
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,220
They will be stripped of their ranks,
their properties confiscated...

75
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,749
and will be sent to
Supreme Court for trial.

76
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,840
The manor of Yu will be taken back
and Prince Li will be in charge of it.

77
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,286
-Signed, His Majesty.
-So, you came prepared.

78
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,082
Scoundrel, it's time
to admit to your crime.

79
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
Yu Shi Hai.

80
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,480
You are always smart as a rule,
but this time a fool.

81
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,213
Do you think that...

82
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:53,982
you'll be able to threaten me?

83
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:58,411
You sell ranks for own profits and
kill the innocent. Such grave crimes.

84
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,799
Today, I won't let go of anyone within
the three generations of your family.

85
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,947
Guards! Arrest all of them!

86
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:07,218
Roger that!

87
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,978
Your Highness, let me
send you back to the palace.

88
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:33,831
Farewell.

89
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:38,111
Let's go.

90
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,345
-Your Highness.
-Leng Yan.

91
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,901
Find someone to clean up this place...

92
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,417
and seal the door.

93
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,280
Nobody can enter this manor
without my permission.

94
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:51,975
Yes, Your Highness.

95
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:54,947
You are really good, Wu You.

96
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:57,221
You managed to solve
this case in seven days' time.

97
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,815
I would like to thank you of behalf...

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,394
of those who had died unjustly.

99
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,200
Go back to your manor
and pack your clothes.

100
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,520
Stay at my place tonight.

101
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,720
What?

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,692
Stay at your place? Why?

103
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,171
Someone is coming in tomorrow.

104
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,720
I have some work for you.

105
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:12,931
Wu You.

106
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,074
I just came out from jail.

107
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,185
I still have wounds all over my body.

108
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,129
Let me rest for two more days.

109
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:22,671
You've been resting in jail for seven
days with good food and good sleep.

110
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,746
You still want to rest?

111
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,607
So, the treatment
that I got in jail...

112
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,517
I knew that you treat me best.

113
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,132
I'm in jail. Of course you'll send
someone to take care of me, right?

114
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:39,592
Alright. I'll go and pack now
and move over to your place.

115
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:11,722
Father.

116
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,120
There's always a way out.
It's still not over for us, right?

117
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:16,868
-Crown prince...
-Shut up.

118
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:19,929
Beware of eavesdroppers.

119
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,360
If you had known
it would come to this,

120
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,384
you wouldn't have acted thus.

121
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,598
Who asked you to act on your own?

122
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,806
Now, we have totally
offended Prince Li.

123
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:36,674
Zongzheng Wu You is evil.
He is treacherous and ruthless.

124
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:39,212
Usually, he looks like he paid
no attention to public affairs.

125
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,680
He must have done a lot of
evil things behind our back.

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,952
And that low-life Li Zhi Yuan.

127
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:46,174
How dare he haunt us even in death.

128
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,042
Everything is in the past now.

129
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:53,576
I've decided to offer
all of my properties...

130
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,934
for His Majesty to prepare
for war against Wei...

131
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,425
in order to beg for our lives.

132
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,775
Father.

133
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,672
Our house is already confiscated.

134
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,360
If you donate all of that,

135
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,199
what are we going to do
when we get out?

136
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,456
Our lives are already on the line now.

137
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:11,242
How can you still care
about those money?

138
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,910
Now, we need to raise our guard
against crown prince.

139
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:18,936
Crown prince? He's on our side.

140
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,567
-He won't leave us to die.
-Idiot.

141
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,892
Now, for the crown prince,

142
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:26,738
we are a liability
just like Li Zhi Yuan.

143
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,676
Then we are totally done for.

144
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:35,813
Not necessarily.

145
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:41,105
I have already prepared for this.

146
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,610
All these years,

147
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:44,778
I have a detailed record
on all the money...

148
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,627
that was sent to the
crown prince palace.

149
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:49,678
And I have another copy
just in case anything happens.

150
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,402
As long as the crown prince visit us,

151
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,977
I'll have a way to make him
keep us alive.

152
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,700
What did the crown prince say?

153
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,573
His Highness said that no matter
how they interrogate you,

154
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
admit to nothing.

155
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,085
Sit back and observe.
When the time comes,

156
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:19,994
His Highness will send
someone to save you.

157
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:53,554
How dare him, Yu Shi Hai.

158
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,673
I had trusted him.

159
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
How dare he betray me and did
something so hurtful to the nation.

160
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,588
He deserves to die.

161
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,138
And you. First, you lost
in the war against Wei.

162
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,621
Now, you sell ranks to earn money?
What did you do?

163
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,307
Father, I'm innocent.

164
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,826
Although I'm quite close with Sir Yu,

165
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,372
I have never been to
the Ministry of Personnel.

166
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,450
And I have never seen
this name list before.

167
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:21,132
Your Majesty.

168
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,541
Prince Li has entrusted me
with all the evidences...

169
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,289
that are related to this case.

170
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,630
The account book...

171
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,601
has shown that it's indeed the
work of the Ministry of Personnel.

172
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,352
But when Sir Zhao was still alive,

173
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,466
the letter that he passed
on to Prince Chen...

174
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,531
has accused His Highness directly.

175
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:40,980
Father. That letter is used
by Prince Chen to slander me.

176
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,866
Please render me a
fair judgement, father.

177
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,405
Your Highness.

178
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,975
Why are you so anxious
to defend yourself?

179
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:51,791
When we get the statement from
the father and son of Yu family,

180
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,746
everything will be clear then.

181
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,097
Minister Sun. You are still ill.

182
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,936
And yet you have to deal with
the aftermath of Yu Shi Hai.

183
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,497
If everybody in the court
was like you,

184
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,116
I wouldn't have so much on my plate.

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,421
Your Majesty.

186
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,877
I'm no longer young.

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
I don't have any sons.

188
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:17,883
So, it's only right for me to serve
the country until the very end.

189
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:21,030
If I had a son,

190
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,746
I would have gone back
to my hometown...

191
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:25,727
to enjoy the rest of my life.

192
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:35,227
Your Majesty. Yu Shi Hai and his son
have committed suicide in jail.

193
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,760
What?

194
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,102
I already ordered the guards
to keep a close eye on them.

195
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,202
How did they still manage
to commit suicide?

196
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,856
Prince Fan Yang.

197
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,541
Investigate this case together
with the Supreme Court.

198
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,434
Don't let any of
their affiliates get away.

199
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,840
Yu Shi Hai and his son...

200
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,478
are proven guilty for
selling ranks and titles.

201
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,071
They have committed grave crimes
by breaking the imperial rules.

202
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,454
Cut off their heads and display them
as a deterrent for public.

203
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,808
The three generations of Yu, including
their relatives and servants...

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,497
will be sent to
the border as soldiers.

205
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,880
Brilliant decision, father.

206
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:10,516
We need to be swift to get rid
of traitors like them.

207
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,640
The crown prince has befriended
the traitors and has a bad conduct.

208
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,998
He is to be confined to the
Eastern Palace until further orders.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,236
Yes, father.

210
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,038
Thank you for your forgiveness.

211
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,199
Prince Fan Yang.

212
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,840
Go to Prince Li's manor
to pass on my decree.

213
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,372
Reward him for contributing
to this case.

214
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:33,450
His three states in southern fringe
will be tax free for five years.

215
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:36,347
From now on, all the matters
regarding those states...

216
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:39,612
no need to be reported to the court.
Just report to Prince Li's manor.

217
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

218
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:52,668
Your Highness!

219
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:54,396
Your Highness.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,860
We have already taken care of
the father-son duo as you asked.

221
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:03,806
Did you find it?

222
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,400
We found this account book
in another courtyard of Yu family.

223
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,978
It contains all of the records
written by Yu Shi Hai himself.

224
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,960
I have no choice but to
sacrifice him to protect myself.

225
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,329
I'm sure that he'll understand.

226
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,156
Creed of Vengeance leaves no trace.
You can be rest-assured.

227
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,207
We won't leave a trail.

228
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:42,221
Don't worry. You have
done me a great favour.

229
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,198
I will reward you handsomely.

230
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,174
The Creed of Vengeance
doesn't need any rewards.

231
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,160
We just hope that you can support us
when you become the emperor.

232
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,768
Creed of Vengeance
will be at your service.

233
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,252
But now, you have lost
a right hand man.

234
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,981
Do you have any other
more useful supports...

235
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,217
to help you defeat Prince Li
and secure the throne?

236
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,615
" Lush Greenery and Good Harvest "

237
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:15,313
" Pavilion of Enjoyment "

238
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,959
Wu You, I can't do it anymore.

239
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,417
I can't.

240
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:36,264
Yu Shi Hai has made this manor
into such luxurious place...

241
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,223
with so many contraptions.

242
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:40,122
He deserves to die indeed.

243
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,954
Such excellent workmanship.

244
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,182
Such excellent workmanship.

245
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,721
Wu You.
Where did you find this expert?

246
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,807
He's acting so out of the world
and so crazily every day.

247
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,960
-Is he dependable?
-Master Xin.

248
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,906
You have already searched
for two days. Any clues?

249
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,075
It must be here somewhere.

250
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:02,321
Qin Yong is very smart.

251
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:04,198
He must have hidden it...

252
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
in an open place.

253
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,071
The entrance to the secret room
must be located at...

254
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
the most unexpected place.

255
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:12,688
Old man Xin.

256
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,276
I had already searched this place
inside out for two days with you.

257
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:18,606
We even checked
every crack in the wall.

258
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,536
Besides Yu Shi Hai's secret weapon
and illegal punishment room,

259
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,086
we found nothing.

260
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:26,237
We didn't even find a trace of that
secret room that you talked of.

261
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,331
Master Xin.

262
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,120
How long will it take?

263
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
I can't be sure.

264
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,394
Wu You. No need to
trouble yourself so much.

265
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,139
We can just tear
the whole place down, right?

266
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:39,076
Nonsense.

267
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:41,344
For a secret room that is
built by Qin Yong,

268
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,040
if you could find it by
tearing the house down,

269
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:44,438
it wouldn't be a secret room.

270
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,760
Let me tell you.

271
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,342
If you tear down the house,
the secret room will be destroyed.

272
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,457
And you'll get nothing.

273
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:52,375
How dare you talk like that to me.

274
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,480
-I can punish you for this disrespect.
-Wu Yu.

275
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
Wu You.

276
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,400
Let this old man find the house alone.

277
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,160
We didn't rest for two days already.

278
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,833
Look at him.
He's still very energetic.

279
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,471
I'm already exhausted.
I can't do it anymore, Wu You.

280
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:30,092
Let me clean it up myself.
I wouldn't dare to trouble you.

281
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,369
I'm the one who knocked into you.
It's my fault.

282
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:34,284
I wouldn't dare to blame you.

283
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,348
Are you blaming me for the
matters regarding Lian Xin?

284
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,764
I wouldn't dare to blame you.

285
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:41,498
What if you suspect me again?

286
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,719
I investigated on Lian Xin...

287
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,734
because I noticed that she brought
ill will towards the princess.

288
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,555
You didn't betray the princess.
Why would I investigate on you?

289
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,308
Your hand is bleeding.
Let me take a look.

290
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,160
Let me take a look.

291
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,687
Why are you crying?

292
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:04,092
If someone sees you like this,
they'll think that I had bullied you.

293
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
Stop crying.

294
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:14,083
Is a cut to the hand so painful?

295
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:15,746
Yes, it is!

296
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:19,149
Alright. I'll cut myself too
so that I can feel what you feel.

297
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:22,905
What are you doing? Don't you know
that finger cut are extremely painful?

298
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,417
Idiot.

299
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,506
When I came here
during the party last time,

300
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,057
I had the geography here memorised.

301
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,754
But this place is heavily guarded.
We have to be careful.

302
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,040
-Aren't you an expert in contraptions?
-Enough.

303
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,190
It has been so many days and
we can't even find the secret room.

304
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,680
-Let alone the book.
-Stop being so noisy.

305
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:29,443
It won't be so easy to find the
secret room designed by Qin Yong.

306
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,181
I never thought that they'll be
searching for the book too.

307
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,535
But looks like they are
not very successful in it.

308
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,067
Qin Yong is indeed the
wisest man on earth.

309
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,978
The contraptions that he designed
are indeed extraordinary.

310
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,859
It means that we still have a chance.

311
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,049
Who is it?

312
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,432
Your Highness, what happened?

313
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,833
-Give chase now!
-Yes, Your Highness!

314
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,409
Your Highness, if you want to
give chase in that direction,

315
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,639
you can just forget it. Because
the contraptions will get them.

316
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,960
No need to be so anxious.

317
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,400
Really?

318
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,760
Princess, find a chance to escape.
I'll take care of them.

319
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,300
Don't be so nervous.

320
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,716
Follow me.

321
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,091
Princess, how did you
know this place so well?

322
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:28,043
Follow me.

323
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:42,811
Right, left, left, right, right.

324
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,272
Follow my steps.
Don't take a wrong step.

325
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,915
-Long Yue.
-I'm fine, Princess.

326
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,891
Let's leave this place first.

327
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:40,502
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

328
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:45,441
-Mistress.
-Take a seat now.

329
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:48,466
Let me take a look.

330
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:49,811
I'm fine.

331
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:57,970
Thank you, Princess.

332
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,707
You're welcome.

333
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:02,991
If it wasn't for you who had
protected me from harm last night,

334
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:06,236
I would have been
the one with injuries today.

335
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:09,298
We had gone through
so many dangers together.

336
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,515
We can be considered as
sworn friends already.

337
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,368
It's my duty to protect you, Princess.

338
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,988
This Yu family's fort is
indeed full of contraptions.

339
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,419
And it's heavily guarded.

340
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:25,083
But after yesterday's incident,

341
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,186
it'll be hard for us to
sneak inside again.

342
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,080
I had been to the manor twice.

343
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:33,965
I keep on feeling a sense of
familiarity with that place.

344
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:35,872
Yesterday, I woke up suddenly.

345
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,785
The structures of
those doors and walls...

346
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,120
are designed based on
the Eight Trigrams.

347
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,574
The grass, woods, flowers and stones
are the variables.

348
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:48,895
Princess, I have always felt
puzzled about one thing.

349
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,687
With Prince Li's
affection towards you,

350
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,455
you can totally request him...

351
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:55,206
to let you tour the
whole manor with him.

352
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:58,321
Why do you have to sneak in like that?

353
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,947
You know that...

354
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:09,446
I have lost my memories.

355
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,926
I treat everyone...

356
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,154
in this world as strangers.

357
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,824
Those who treat me well,

358
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,528
I'll consider them as
my friends and family.

359
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,563
Those who treat me badly,

360
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,718
I'll consider them as my enemies.

361
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:27,252
But after that, I realised that...

362
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,179
the hearts and feelings of the people
in this world are not black and white.

363
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,292
I came here for my brother
and for Western Qi.

364
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,559
I think I did the right thing.

365
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,000
But I'll often dream
and wake myself up.

366
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:42,097
I feel that one day,
they'll forget about me.

367
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,260
And they'll leave me here alone.

368
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,000
I sent Lian Xin away.

369
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:50,770
I feel that I had given her
the best option.

370
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:54,460
But sometimes, I will feel angry.

371
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,320
Why did she betray me?

372
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,670
I need to find the book.

373
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:00,853
So, I have to get close.

374
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,556
But I vaguely feel that...

375
00:27:04,996 --> 00:27:06,316
if...

376
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,801
I can't treat him with honesty,

377
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:11,647
then I shouldn't get too close to him.

378
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:15,395
So, this is the reason you
avoid Prince Li so often.

379
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,080
Long Yue.

380
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,127
If you truly like a person,

381
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:25,879
are you supposed to
ask for nothing in return...

382
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:29,368
and you'll be satisfied as long
as everything goes well for him?

383
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:39,476
In this world, everybody
treats feelings differently.

384
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,047
Some, give their all.

385
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,920
And some, use it
for their own advantages.

386
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,471
You have to ask yourself...

387
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
whether or not you wish
for something in return.

388
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:56,889
Thank you.

389
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:59,510
I feel much better now.

390
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,340
Mistress. A customer
has insisted to meet you.

391
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:15,863
Is that him?

392
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:18,209
Go, mistress.

393
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:47,973
You are so beautiful.

394
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,739
I have fallen in love with you.

395
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,875
I have many lands and many servants.

396
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,849
Why don't you go back with me?

397
00:29:03,803 --> 00:29:05,283
Why are you laughing?

398
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:09,161
If you go back with me, you'll be able
to enjoy untold wealth and glory.

399
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,529
It's better than depending
on others for a living...

400
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,734
and live in humiliation, right?

401
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:17,024
I thank you for your offer.

402
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,200
But too bad that...

403
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,226
I have a broad outlook in life.

404
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,661
It's better for you to come back after
a few year when you have grown up.

405
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,119
Don't look down on me.
People like you...

406
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,007
only care about fame and gain, right?

407
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,120
The things that you offered,
I can easily get them myself.

408
00:29:34,684 --> 00:29:38,374
I rather have a man who
is young and handsome.

409
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,989
I have fallen in love with you too,
Princess Zhao Yun.

410
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,379
You...

411
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,240
You have seen through me?

412
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,803
It doesn't matter.

413
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:50,509
Wench. Let me tell you.

414
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:53,931
I'm here to test you.
Stay away from Brother Wu You.

415
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:56,096
He is already engaged.

416
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,625
Princess of Western Qi is
noble, elegant, beautiful and wise.

417
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,571
She is way better than you.

418
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:04,298
I'm trying hard to avoid Prince Li.

419
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,640
But he's the one who
always kept me by his side.

420
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,562
If you could spend more time
with your Brother Wu You,

421
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:11,914
then he wouldn't
have time to look for me.

422
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:13,398
You...

423
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,200
You are such a bully!

424
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:27,932
Have you found out who are
the people that sneaked in that day?

425
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:31,222
That day, I was too far away.
So, I didn't have a clear look.

426
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,973
But from their shapes,
I think they are both female.

427
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,648
Your Highness.

428
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:37,408
They might be the female assassins
from Creed of Vengeance.

429
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,870
Creed of Vengeance?

430
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:41,811
I have found out that those who tried
to assassinate you in the teahouse...

431
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,455
came from the Creed of Vengeance.

432
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:46,762
Creed of Vengeance is a gang that
became popular in recent years.

433
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,637
Their business focuses on
stealing secrets and assassinations.

434
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,389
But it's very pricey to hire them.

435
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,588
The assassination of Sir Zhao
and other officers...

436
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,803
together with the death
of Yu Shi Hai and his son...

437
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,494
are their doings.

438
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,599
How dare they do that.

439
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:03,203
A gang dares to meddle with
the public affairs of the nation?

440
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,068
Only the Eastern Palace is able to
pay such a high price...

441
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:08,758
and commit such grave crimes.

442
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,247
I already sent someone
to pursue and capture them.

443
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:13,344
I never thought that they'll still
dare to send someone forward.

444
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:14,667
I don't blame you.

445
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:17,340
No matter it's Sir Zhao
or Li Zhi Yuan,

446
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,800
they are always there
right on the dot.

447
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:22,710
They leave of trace and they
are as silent as the wind.

448
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:25,921
Looks like they have already
infiltrated themselves into the court.

449
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,720
That's why they can be so precise.

450
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,144
Wu You. Let me investigate this
together with Leng Yan.

451
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
We can't let them escape this time.

452
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:37,047
The crown prince is getting
more and more rampant.

453
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:39,199
If he really become
the emperor one day,

454
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,523
there will be no peace in this world.

455
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:43,723
Wu You.

456
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:45,952
You asked us to search for
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

457
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,406
It means that you still remember
Lady Yun and Minister Qin's behest.

458
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,265
How about we use this chance...

459
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,520
-to pull down the crown prince?
-Wu Yu.

460
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,960
I have my own plans.

461
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,612
This is not something that
should be spoken aloud.

462
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:02,345
Yes, Wu You.

463
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,400
Master Xin, did you find anything?

464
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:09,320
I found this just now
when I search the manor.

465
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:11,219
This is weird.

466
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,035
Why will they have a
Western Qi's tool in this manor?

467
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,910
-Western Qi?
-Western Qi?

468
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,197
That's right.

469
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:22,153
Although this climbing hook
is not something rare,

470
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,680
the way it was tied is very special.

471
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,120
You know that the weather is
very rough in Western Qi, right?

472
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
It's very windy and sandy over there.

473
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:32,154
So, in order to prevent
the rope from tearing,

474
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,058
they will use a complicated way
to tie their hook.

475
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,053
And every once in a while,
they'll retie it again...

476
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:40,496
to make sure that it's sturdy.

477
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:44,891
So, the people who sneaked
into the manor that day...

478
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:46,716
are people from Western Qi.

479
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,723
Your Highness, there is a lady
outside asking for you.

480
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:55,013
She said that she is the mistress
of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

481
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:25,655
Have a drink, Your Highness.

482
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,269
This is indeed a good tea.

483
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:45,673
You love tea.

484
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,421
So when I got this new tea,
I thought of you immediately.

485
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,680
That's why I brought it to you.

486
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,833
People who love tea will know what's
best to be eaten with the tea.

487
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,710
This box of red dates
has a subtle sweetness to them.

488
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,533
It's best to be eaten with the tea.

489
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,374
Have a taste.

490
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

491
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,719
How is it?

492
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,896
The fragrance of dates with the
fragrance of tea. Sweet with a bite.

493
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,736
They are excellent match.

494
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,393
If you like it,

495
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:24,653
I'll ask them give one
to you, only you.

496
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:44,847
Looks like you really like this place.

497
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,509
Maybe it's the grass or the trees.

498
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,754
I have a sense of familiarity
with this place.

499
00:34:51,913 --> 00:34:54,849
This manor is occupied by
Yu Shi Hai and his son for so long.

500
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:56,765
It's such a waste.

501
00:34:57,738 --> 00:35:00,992
No wonder Leng Yan said that
you were caught by Yu Wen Jie...

502
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:03,354
the last time because
you were wandering around.

503
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,313
I'm sorry that I had troubled you.

504
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,410
I planned to bring you here
for a tour...

505
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,327
after everything is settled at first.

506
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,401
I never thought that you'll lose
your patience come by yourself.

507
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:15,733
You don't welcome me?

508
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,325
If you like it, I can show you around.

509
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:21,081
But, it's better if you
don't wander alone.

510
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:23,279
There are many contraptions here.

511
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,440
If you triggered them accidentally,
you might get hurt.

512
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:30,315
With you here, I can't possibly
wander around myself.

513
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:32,659
Please show the way.

514
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:43,135
Before this, I heard that
this fort is very deep...

515
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:45,018
and the buildings
are very complicated.

516
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:46,762
Today, looks like...

517
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:48,906
if this place is without
those contraptions,

518
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,782
it will be a gorgeous
and breathtaking place.

519
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:57,135
When I gave you Man Yin Chamber,
it didn't seem like you enjoy it.

520
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,964
But you are so interested
in this manor.

521
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,745
The threshold of your manor
is very high.

522
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,706
Everything in the manor
belongs to you.

523
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:10,038
Others can't touch it
without permission.

524
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,734
You gave me a chamber
without any reasons.

525
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:14,370
How could I accept it?

526
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,441
No matter how high the threshold is,
it's not set for you.

527
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:20,802
As long as you are willing,
I can give the whole manor to you.

528
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:22,396
How about that?

529
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:29,392
If other people hear about this,
they'll misunderstand.

530
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,400
You are a nobility.

531
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:33,614
It's already bad enough
that you're associated with me.

532
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,201
We had known each other for so long.

533
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,562
Have I ever cared about
your name, background,

534
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:39,234
status or rank?

535
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:42,736
At first, I thought that you
don't care for all of these as well.

536
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:46,988
Nobody can truly be
oblivious about them.

537
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:49,682
No matter you think,

538
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,178
it'll still be impossible for us.

539
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,270
Then why did you come to me?

540
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:04,110
Is it really because of
the scenery in this manor?

541
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,047
Or do you have other intentions?

542
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,729
What are you doing?

543
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,826
Don't you think that
this is a very familiar scene?

544
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,820
I don't understand what you mean.

545
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:46,431
If you don't like me here,

546
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,401
then I just won't come again.

547
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:03,493
Nothing is definite in this world.

548
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,367
A status or a standing...

549
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,472
is a matter of personal choice.

550
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:09,948
The things that are
important to you today...

551
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:13,334
might become a thorn
in your heart in another day.

552
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,570
The things that you
deemed impossible...

553
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:18,222
might become possible
in the near future.

554
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,585
When my teacher, Qin Yong,
built this place in the beginning,

555
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,798
he never thought that his people-based
transformation will fail.

556
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:30,210
When Yu Shi Hai transformed
this manor with glee,

557
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:33,778
he never thought that Yu family
will one day be destroyed.

558
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:38,294
Man Yao.

559
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,640
Things are always changing.

560
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,152
A little fire can burn this manor
into nothingness.

561
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:47,391
People are forgetful.

562
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,440
No matter how glorious
a family is for generations,

563
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,513
people can forget about it completely.

564
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:55,273
Those that need to be forgotten
will be forgotten.

565
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:57,274
So,

566
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:01,107
if there's something
in front of me that I want,

567
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,426
I'll do my best to
grasp it in my hands.

568
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:07,696
Nothing can stop me.

569
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,960
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

570
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:17,931
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

571
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:25,455
<i>I wait for the warmth
of your gaze to melt it.</i>

572
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,014
Your Highness, it's raining.

573
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:35,641
<i>I miss you but I can only
gaze at you in silence.</i>

574
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:38,141
<i>You are keeping me out with your care.</i>

575
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:44,190
<i>Although we are together,
I feel lost.</i>

576
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,999
Looks like the sky
wants to keep you here.

577
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:51,023
Even God is helping me.

578
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,549
This place used to be a library
built by my teacher.

579
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:04,928
It was my favourite place.

580
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:08,318
When I was young, I can stay here
for the whole afternoon.

581
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,191
Now that I can stand here
again with you today,

582
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,750
it's like the peaceful time
back then...

583
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,829
has come back to me again.

584
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:23,568
What is it?

585
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:25,666
Nothing.

586
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:32,264
<i>In a blink of an eye,
my hair has turned silver.</i>

587
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:36,077
<i>I'm fated to live in loneliness
without any regrets.</i>

588
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:38,462
That's right. Hug her.

589
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,403
Wu You is indeed very capable.

590
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:51,060
<i>I'm willing to wipe away
your blood and wounds for you.</i>

591
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:55,280
<i>I'm willing to live
in darkness for you.</i>

592
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:57,780
<i>As long as I can be with you,</i>

593
00:40:58,147 --> 00:41:00,336
<i>I don't mind to...</i>

594
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:01,862
Your Highness.

595
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:03,628
I should go back.

596
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,956
<i>hide in the dark.</i>

597
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,325
Why did she leave?

598
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,400
How can you let her leave
at time like this?

599
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:24,625
Just now, you shouldn't
have let her leave.

600
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,244
With my swaggering experiences,

601
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:29,503
both of you care for each other.

602
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,452
I think you might be able
to capture her heart and her kiss...

603
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,801
very soon.

604
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:37,085
I can achieve my goal
without having to do that.

605
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,426
Wu You. You have really
fallen in love with her, right?

606
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,207
-Look how shy you are.
-Shut up.

607
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,942
If you don't like to hear it,
then I won't speak of it.

608
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,286
Stop looking.
She has already left.

609
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:11,573
Ya Li.

610
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,696
You are always so out of it recently.

611
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:17,155
I'm very worried about you.

612
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,799
Ya Li.

613
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:23,252
Father.

614
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:25,548
What is it, father?

615
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,376
You have been stuck
in this manor for too long.

616
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,146
You even refused to
go out with Prince Li.

617
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,413
I'm sorry that I had made you worry.

618
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,738
But you are not well.

619
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,861
I wish to accompany you in the house.

620
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,416
I didn't mean to blame you.

621
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:46,887
If you want to be filial to me,

622
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,990
go to Chengxi for me tomorrow.

623
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:53,231
What is it that you need
that is so urgent?
