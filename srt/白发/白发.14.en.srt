Episode 14

3
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:13,248
" Tranquil Garden "

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,162
This is the Tranquil Garden.

5
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:17,688
This is the resting chamber
that I had prepared for you.

6
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,439
If you are not satisfied
with the decorations,

7
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,876
I'll ask them to redecorate it again.

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,811
Watch the steps.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,472
Wu You.

10
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,354
Did you find anything?

11
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:57,938
The bathroom is just straight ahead.

12
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:01,110
But it was used by my friend just now.
So, it's still a little bit damp.

13
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:04,330
-No need to look at it then.
-Why not?

14
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:09,867
Your Highness,

15
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,055
do you mind?

16
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:14,806
I don't mind.

17
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,180
After you, Your Highness.

18
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,249
After you, Your Highnesses.

19
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:43,602
Your Highness.

20
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:47,054
Why are these still here?
Clean them out now.

21
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:48,387
Yes, General Fu.

22
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:15,542
Although this bathroom is not as
luxurious as the one in the palace,

23
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:17,437
it's spacious enough.

24
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:20,549
Of course a general's manor
won't be as good as a palace.

25
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,985
Sorry to have put you
to such inconvenience.

26
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,447
Your Highness.

27
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,312
Are you sure that
she never left the general's manor?

28
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,603
Yes.

29
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:00,960
Pass on my words.

30
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:04,881
We have to keep an eye on every person
that goes out from the manor today.

31
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,807
I don't believe that she can
disappear into thin air.

32
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,018
Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,067
Please have a seat.

34
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,161
Let's go.

35
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,968
Is she among this group of dancers?

36
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,698
Prince Li, please have a seat.

37
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:10,030
When did your personality changed,
Wu You?

38
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,290
When did you start to
have interest in beauty?

39
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,487
Man Yao?

40
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:16,346
So, that's how my stand-in looks like.

41
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:23,807
Wu You, you are too rude.

42
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,308
You are indeed as fair as the rose.

43
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,133
An outer-worldly beauty.

44
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,632
What is your name?

45
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:40,216
I am Hen Xiang from
House of Fragrance.

46
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,881
Good.

47
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,383
Good.

48
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:50,476
If you don't mind,

49
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,326
I'll be serving you, Your Highness.

50
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,363
Great.

51
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:56,963
That's great.

52
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,740
Have a seat.

53
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,291
You may leave now.

54
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,721
Bring in the wine.

55
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:31,526
Is this Shilixiang wine?

56
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:36,716
You are indeed very knowledgeable.
This is indeed the Shilixiang wine.

57
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,791
Your Highness, have a taste.

58
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,740
Wu You, this is the Shilixiang wine
that I stole from your manor.

59
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:03,365
At first, I thought that
it can lower her guard.

60
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:10,908
Thank you for the wine.

61
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,803
But I had just recovered
from my illness.

62
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:16,137
The doctor had warned me
off against alcohol.

63
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:18,737
I don't feel well...

64
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:21,356
just by inhaling
the smell of the wine.

65
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,655
I'm sorry for being
not attentive enough.

66
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,555
Bring us some tea.

67
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:55,392
Cheers, Your Highness.

68
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:56,932
Cheers.

69
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:58,274
General Fu.

70
00:09:58,526 --> 00:09:59,646
Cheers.

71
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,650
Cheers, Your Highness.

72
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,641
This is indeed a good wine.

73
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,681
I heard that this wine
no longer exists.

74
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:16,809
Where did you get it?

75
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,373
I got it from a friend as gift.

76
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,682
Sixteen years ago,
everyone in the royal feast...

77
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:29,672
acclaimed that
it was the best wine in town.

78
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:32,358
Nobody knew what happened...

79
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:36,050
but my father was so furious until
he sentenced the Qin Family to death.

80
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:39,687
Such a waste to lose
such an excellent vintner.

81
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,540
Qin Yong didn't even get to
pass on his skills.

82
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,009
The Qin Family is well-known
for his loyalty.

83
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,896
But his family was exterminated
just because he sent in...

84
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:55,837
a jug of quality wine to the palace.

85
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,724
His whole family was slaughtered
in a blink of an eye.

86
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,731
Every scholar in the world
mourns his death.

87
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,071
As the crown prince of this nation,

88
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,374
you are not sorry for the loss of his
capabilities in managing a country...

89
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,975
but are sorry for the loss of
his wine-making skills?

90
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,014
His passing is very
woeful and regrettable.

91
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,618
You are wrong, Princess Rong Le.

92
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:20,074
Minister Qin was once
my father's most trusted aide.

93
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,220
He must have committed
treason to the emperor.

94
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,492
Or else, his whole family
won't be exterminated.

95
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:27,465
Am I right, Wu You?

96
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,325
Wu You.

97
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:35,585
Qin Yong used to be your teacher.

98
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,317
The wine that was made by him
is one of the kind only.

99
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,131
You should make an exception.

100
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,853
Or else, it'll be your greatest regret
if you don't drink it.

101
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,043
Wu You.

102
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:46,202
Come.

103
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,940
This is such an oversight.

104
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,662
I forgot that Prince Li
does not consume wine.

105
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,545
Bring in some tea for
Prince Li instead.

106
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,410
Wu You.

107
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,730
Let's go home.

108
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,979
Come, my lady.

109
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,181
Come. Get into the carriage, Xiang.

110
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,831
I'll get in first.

111
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,780
Farewell, Your Highness.

112
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,415
I know that
you didn't do it just to help me.

113
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,580
What is your purpose of doing it?

114
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,450
I admit that I did it for a purpose.

115
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:37,682
But I'm very glad that
you are willing...

116
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,762
to trust me.

117
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,505
Now, do you want to
continue staying here...

118
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,250
or do you want to go back to
the Princess Manor with Xiao Sha?

119
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,482
Do I have a choice?

120
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,590
You have already arranged everything.

121
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:54,852
The lives of Long Yue
and the others are in your hands.

122
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,140
And Xiao Sha is always by
my side to keep an eye on me.

123
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:59,256
Now, you want me to choose?

124
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:02,361
However,

125
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,445
you won't be able to
control me always...

126
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,953
and I won't be your string puppet.

127
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,389
You always took me by surprise
with your fierce determination.

128
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,220
-Man Yao.
-Don't call me Man Yao.

129
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,548
I'm the Elder Princess of Western Qi.

130
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm not someone you can look down on.

131
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,260
You must have worked so hard
to carry out your duties, Sir Xiao.

132
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,572
Your Highness...

133
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,628
Looks like you have
arranged everything.

134
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:25,616
You have taken away
all of the people...

135
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,110
that I'm familiar with.

136
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,148
Now, both your identity
and your purpose here...

137
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:34,241
can be exposed easily.

138
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,735
We can't let the people of
Northern Realm know about it.

139
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,289
So,

140
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,548
it's better to be cautious.

141
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,306
Are you saying that Fu Chou is not
the people of Northern Realm?

142
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:46,116
Since you are going to
place me under house arrest,

143
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,214
no need to sugar-coat it.

144
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,786
Since you already know,

145
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:08,399
give me The Book of Mountains
and Rivers then.

146
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,303
I'll keep my promise.

147
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,983
After you are married for one year,

148
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,897
you can come back to
our home in Western Qi.

149
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,029
Home?

150
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,060
Where is my home?

151
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,860
Do I have a home?

152
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,862
I only care about...

153
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,797
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

154
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,508
You are right.

155
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,121
The book is with me.

156
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:53,553
-But I have a condition.
-Tell me.

157
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,434
Let my people live.

158
00:16:56,452 --> 00:17:00,698
Chen Yu, Ling Yue,
Xiao Wei and Long Yue.

159
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,260
No harm shall come to them.

160
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:04,061
Alright.

161
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,260
Xiao Sha.

162
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,570
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Bring her to them tomorrow.

163
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,041
Yes.

164
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,099
Beauty.

165
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,468
Your Highness.

166
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:23,431
-You are drunk.
-I'm not.

167
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm not drunk.

168
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,735
You want to run away?

169
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,860
Where can you run to?

170
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,860
Naughty girl.

171
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,593
-Who are you?
-I...

172
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:55,365
You! This...

173
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:56,851
Beauty.

174
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:59,499
-Beauty.
-Your Highness.

175
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,134
-Your Highness.
-It's alright.

176
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:05,006
Beauty, let me take a look.

177
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:06,887
You...

178
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:10,951
Are you mad?

179
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:13,364
You...

180
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,902
How can you bring a girl from a
public house into your Eastern Palace?

181
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:20,284
Have you ever shown me
any respect as your wife?

182
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:23,502
If the emperor and my father
know about this,

183
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,329
how am I going to cover it up for you?

184
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,860
Your father again.

185
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,022
You are using your father
to threaten me again.

186
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,460
Yes.

187
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
You scholars are very powerful.

188
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,112
All of you looked down on me.

189
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,667
Ever since I marry you,

190
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:41,880
I have never made things
difficult for you.

191
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,039
I had turned a blind eye to it...

192
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,374
when you enjoyed yourself
with those women out there.

193
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,288
But Your Highness,

194
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,617
how can you bring a lowly wench
into the Eastern Palace?

195
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,354
-You...
-Eastern Palace...

196
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,637
is just a wall apart
from your bed chamber.

197
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,495
It's my fault.

198
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,910
Please kick me out from the palace,
Your Highness.

199
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:09,306
Beauty, please stand up. You...

200
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,076
You are just a woman.
You know nothing.

201
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,157
Don't you know who she is?

202
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,667
She was given to me by General Fu.

203
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,686
Do you know who General Fu is?

204
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:23,669
I've put in so much effort
to get him under my rank. You...

205
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:29,420
If you keep quiet,
nobody will know about this.

206
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:31,762
At any rate, if you spread this out,

207
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,586
you'll be getting it from me.

208
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,012
Leave now!
Leave us!

209
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,784
I can't believe you.

210
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,071
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

211
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,054
Leave.

212
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,319
Beauty.

213
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
Beauty.

214
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,231
Beauty.

215
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:14,788
Beauty.

216
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,000
Beauty.

217
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,676
Your Highness,
after you drink this cup of wine,

218
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:28,756
I'm all yours.

219
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,062
I'll drink it.

220
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,660
I'll drink it.

221
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,133
Beauty.

222
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:52,905
Beauty.

223
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,477
You are here.

224
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,739
You are a scumbag who wrecks
the country and ruins the people.

225
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,233
You have ruined so many
nice ladies out there.

226
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:16,246
You deserve to suffer.

227
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,064
The Shilixiang Wine in
the general's manor...

228
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:20,267
is from a winery in this city that has
started to sell this wine recently.

229
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,897
It's called Shilixiang,

230
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,728
but after I checked the wine recipe,

231
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,022
it's different from
the secret recipe of Qin Family.

232
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,740
They just imitate the original wine
so that they smell the same.

233
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:31,122
But they taste different.

234
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,391
Any matter regarding Qin Family
is a taboo in Northern Realm.

235
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:36,355
They still dare to imitate him.

236
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,220
The winery didn't mention
anything about Qin Family.

237
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,154
They just took advantage
of the wine's name...

238
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,772
that was so famous
more than 10 years ago.

239
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,541
The people didn't know the relation
between this wine and the old case.

240
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm afraid that they are
just taking a huge risk for profit.

241
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,055
The mind of a businessman
is really unpredictable.

242
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:56,273
That's not right.

243
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,741
It's impossible that Fu Chou will be
ignorant to the secret of Shilixiang.

244
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,448
But why would he take the risk...

245
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:06,354
to use this restricted wine
in his banquet?

246
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:09,549
I've already investigated about it.
On the surface, General Fu...

247
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:11,796
and Miss Man Yao don't have
any special relationship.

248
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:14,135
Agent Wu said that
she is in the general's manor.

249
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,673
But we have found nothing.

250
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,220
Agent Wu is never wrong.

251
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,452
He must have found out
about something.

252
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,568
I keep feeling that
it's a very strange night.

253
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:28,979
Did we miss out on some details?

254
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,077
Man Yao turns up in
the general's manor.

255
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,996
Without any regards if the etiquette,
the unmarried princess...

256
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,233
went to the manor of his fiancé
to check out the house decorations.

257
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,696
Not to mention...

258
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,149
the lead dancer in the banquet
who is quite good in martial arts.

259
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,643
And Fu Chou actually gave such a
dangerous woman to the crown prince.

260
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,062
Not to mention...

261
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:56,177
the Shilixiang wine that was
purposely used in the banquet.

262
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:00,622
Everything is very suspicious.

263
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,982
But it seems like
they are somehow unrelated.

264
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:07,626
Do I need to go and ask for
Agent Wu's guidance?

265
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:10,604
No need.
We have to find Man Yao first.

266
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:14,297
Fu Chou is not just aiming...

267
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,822
to curry favour with the crown prince.

268
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,616
If we want to know his real purpose,

269
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:21,851
I think that everything
will come to light...

270
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:23,717
when we find Man Yao.

271
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:03,976
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

272
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,369
Yesterday night,
I was too exhausted...

273
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,428
until I slept like the dead.

274
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:11,027
Yesterday night?

275
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,446
What happened yesterday night?

276
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,431
Why can't I remember anything?

277
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,972
Why did you make fun of me,
Your Highness?

278
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:29,089
Looks like I've worked you
too hard yesterday night.

279
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,994
No need to pay
your respect today.

280
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,540
Come, let's do it again.

281
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:36,795
-But your wife...
-No need to care about her.

282
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:38,106
No.

283
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:39,693
Your Highness.

284
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:42,695
This is my first day here.
I don't want to be seen...

285
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:45,004
as the spoiled one
just because you dote on me.

286
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,139
Actually, you don't need
to be so attentive to me.

287
00:26:48,347 --> 00:26:50,747
I already know that
you are very nice to me.

288
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:53,243
Good.

289
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,423
Good.

290
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,395
So, you know the basic principles.

291
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:05,805
Such a sensible woman.

292
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,255
I can't let Princess Rong Le
marry General Fu.

293
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,471
She belongs to Wu You.

294
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,673
This Man Yao from
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

295
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:20,729
I'll make you stay away from
Wu You for sure.

296
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:24,819
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

297
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:32,334
Excuse me, where did the people
from the teahouse go?

298
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:33,737
They are closed for
several days already.

299
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,066
This is weird.
They were doing very well.

300
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,198
But they just close down
suddenly like that.

301
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:43,688
Did she really think that she can
become the wife of a prince?

302
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:46,407
Is that why she shuts down
her business?

303
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,207
Leng Yan.

304
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:52,875
We have to find her even if we have
to turn the city upside down.

305
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,060
Yes, Your Highness.

306
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,639
Maybe Man Yao didn't
manage to find the book yet.

307
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,407
Rather than spending so many
manpower to search for Man Yao,

308
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:05,482
we could just use that
manpower to find the book.

309
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,540
Wu You.

310
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,710
This is the first time
I've ever seen you so flustered.

311
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:32,394
Didn't you look for her
for the sake of the book?

312
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:35,667
Wu You, in your heart,

313
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,791
Man Yao is more important than
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?

314
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,514
Have you really fallen in love
with Man Yao?

315
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,162
Wu You!

316
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:48,818
Why are you here again?

317
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:51,065
I went to the teahouse today.
Everybody said that...

318
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,756
the shop has been closed
for several days.

319
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,961
Did you know where Man Yao go?

320
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:58,875
Don't come here to pester him.
Wu You has enough troubles already.

321
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:01,188
We have been looking for her
for days as well.

322
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:04,189
Even Wu You
doesn't know where Man Yao is.

323
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,760
Could it really be that
she's in real danger?

324
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:11,499
Although I hope that Wu You
can be with Princess Rong Le...

325
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:12,791
That's right.

326
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,850
She must be in danger.

327
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:19,732
Wu You, she will be fine.
It's just a slip of my tongue.

328
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:25,537
With Man Yao's personality,

329
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,976
she won't let go of the things
she wants and just leave like that.

330
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:31,872
Moreover, this is a big city.

331
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,832
It's impossible that someone
can disappear without a trace.

332
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:36,634
Unless...

333
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,946
Unless something had happened to her.

334
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,570
She will be fine, Wu You.

335
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,803
Let's split out to look for her.
We will be able to find her for sure.

336
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:46,985
If she's really in captivity,

337
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:48,843
rather than looking for her in secret,

338
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,548
we should make a scene out of it...

339
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,866
so that her captors
have nowhere to hide.

340
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:56,634
Wu Yu, bring along your guards to
search for her in the city with me...

341
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,620
in the name of
searching for a fugitive.

342
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,194
Search very nook and cranny.

343
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,460
Alright.

344
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:04,712
Wu You, it was a thoughtless
comment just now. Don't be anxious.

345
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:07,277
You better leave.
Stop pestering Wu You. Let's go.

346
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,100
Quick. Let's go.

347
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,289
Have you seen this lady before?

348
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:17,005
-No.
-You'll be rewarded if you do.

349
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,540
No.

350
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,128
Have you seen this lady before?

351
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,137
No.

352
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:29,883
Have you seen her before?

353
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,263
No.

354
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,776
Have you seen this lady before?

355
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:42,078
That day, I did see a young lady
walking on the street under the rain.

356
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:44,560
But it's too dark.
I can't see clearly.

357
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,934
Officer, give me some money now.

358
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:49,664
Off you go.

359
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:58,044
Prince Li is
looking for a fugitive.

360
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:00,263
Those who obstruct
the search will be killed.

361
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:03,734
Give it to us.

362
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,260
Officers!

363
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,551
These belong to us, officers.
Nothing to do with the fugitive.

364
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:15,832
Looks like Prince Li is just as bad.

365
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,944
You officers are
traitors to the people.

366
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,930
You are just a bunch of robbers.
I'm going to report on you.

367
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,714
General Fu, just like what
you have expected,

368
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,460
Prince Li and Prince Chen
are searching...

369
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,301
from house to house to look for
Miss Man Yao in the city.

370
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:56,219
This is quite unexpected actually.

371
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:59,408
Zongzheng Wu You has never
bothered himself with women.

372
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,742
It's not like him to
act so desperately.

373
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,690
You had added the fuel
to the fire right on time.

374
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,544
The Eastern Palace will rely
more heavily on you now.

375
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,131
Greetings, Your Highness.

376
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,823
Sir Xiao.

377
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:34,122
Are you bringing me
to your master now?

378
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:35,711
Your Highness.

379
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,700
His Majesty has already left
after he bade his farewell...

380
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:39,355
to the Emperor of Northern Realm.

381
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:43,815
What is it?

382
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,776
Won't the Emperor of Northern Realm
be suspicious for my brother...

383
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:48,914
to leave before putting me on
the bridal sedan chair himself?

384
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:50,862
I have no rights...

385
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:53,025
to question His Majesty.

386
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:55,882
He left before he got the book.

387
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:58,453
But he left you behind to retrieve it.

388
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:00,841
Looks like you have done well
for the past half year.

389
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:04,231
You had put in so much effort
to trick and spy on me.

390
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:06,963
You have proven your loyalty to him.

391
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,900
You are worthy to be
entrusted with this task.

392
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:12,376
Please bring me to the book,
Your Highness.

393
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,143
Bring me to Long Yue and the others.

394
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,110
You won't get to see the book
until I get to see them.

395
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:19,347
Let's go then, Your Highness.

396
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:28,639
Next, let's go to that shop.

397
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:36,206
Welcome to my humble shop.
Have a look.

398
00:33:36,335 --> 00:33:39,257
Three days ago, you have imported
in four bales of silk from Liang.

399
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:42,070
Today, I've brought my housekeeper
along to get the goods.

400
00:33:42,744 --> 00:33:44,024
Please follow me.

401
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,444
-My lady.
-Are you alright?

402
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:27,909
Thank goodness
you are alright, Your Highness.

403
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,312
Long Yue.

404
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,315
Xiao Sha.

405
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:36,027
You traitor.

406
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,616
How can you betray the princess?

407
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:43,296
Long Yue, what happened to you?

408
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,490
Long Yue, what happened to you?

409
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:51,322
I'm fine.

410
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:54,391
They have just given me
some sedatives...

411
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,399
so that I can't fight against them.

412
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:02,280
Do you have to treat...

413
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:04,360
your own companion like this?

414
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,720
I've gotten you all into troubles.

415
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,474
That's not true.

416
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:15,562
I just got to know that
you are the princess recently.

417
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:17,477
But I knew it in my heart that...

418
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:21,314
you had sacrificed a lot
in order to save our lives.

419
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:24,995
Your Highness,
now that you've seen them,

420
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,559
can you bring me to
The Book of Mountains and Rivers now?

421
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,555
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?
Don't do it, Your Highness.

422
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:34,818
The book is the only thing that
can guarantee your freedom.

423
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,426
How can you give it
to them just like that?

424
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,980
Don't worry.

425
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,431
I'll get you out for sure.

426
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:44,699
No.

427
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:56,377
I can bring you to the book.

428
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,146
But no harm can come to them.

429
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,893
I understand.

430
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:02,489
After you, Your Highness.

431
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:07,207
Be careful, my lady..

432
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:08,777
Be careful, Your Highness.

433
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:11,084
-My lady.
-Your Highness.

434
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,452
Your Highness.

435
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:32,376
-Have you seen her before?
-No.

436
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,790
-Have you seen her before?
-No.

437
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,486
-Have you seen her before?
-No.

438
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,351
Have you seen this lady before?

439
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:42,177
-This height and very pretty.
-Never.

440
00:36:42,354 --> 00:36:44,970
I think you know the consequences
if they manage to find you.

441
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:49,472
-Have you seen this lady before?
-No.

442
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,912
I'll send someone to lure them away.

443
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,877
And then we'll use another path.

444
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:57,706
So, you still have someone
spying on me.

445
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,912
Stop that carriage.

446
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,323
Yes, Your Highness!

447
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,299
-Move aside.
-Move aside, please.

448
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:24,641
-Move aside.
-Move aside, please.

449
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:26,365
We can go now.

450
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,082
Are you looking for me?

451
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:35,432
Man Yao. We are looking for you.
Go back with me now.

452
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:37,209
Let's go.

453
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:50,912
It's you.

454
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,140
I remember.

455
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:56,638
You are the bodyguard of
the Princess of Western Qi, right?

456
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,700
Why are you meddling into
other's business here?

457
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,323
Did you get the wrong person?

458
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,359
Where is Man Yao?

459
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:06,993
Man Yao!

460
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,588
It's all your fault.
Why did you fight me suddenly?

461
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,183
Your Highness, I was
chasing down a servant.

462
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,881
I thought that he had
ran into your troops.

463
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,500
I was too anxious, so...

464
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:22,084
You mean that servant who escaped
in that carriage just now, right?

465
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,376
I saw it,
but I didn't manage to stop it.

466
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,112
But you are really good in fighting.

467
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,098
No discord, no concord.
I'll learn from you again another day.

468
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,376
It's just a misunderstanding.
Please forgive me.

469
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:32,771
Sir.

470
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,438
-Have you seen this lady before?
-No, goodbye.

471
00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:43,639
-Continue to search.
-Yes, Your Highness.

472
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,048
No need to chase after her.

473
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,220
This is a matter of Western Qi.

474
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,226
We won't need your service here.

475
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,202
This is not something that you can
decide on your own, Sir Xiao.

476
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:05,522
Alright.

477
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:07,516
I'll follow the order.

478
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,340
-Your Highness.
-My lady.

479
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,142
We can't stay here for long.
We have to leave this place now.

480
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:53,503
Let's go.

481
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,105
Have you seen this lady before?

482
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:03,369
-Have you seen this her before?
-Take a look, have you seen her?

483
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:04,847
-No, I haven't.
-No.

484
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,347
What about you?

485
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,271
-Have you seen her? Be truthful.
-No.

486
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:11,318
We have to get out from the city
before the door closes for tonight.

487
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,197
-I'll carry you.
-No.

488
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,008
Your Highness, you should leave first.

489
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:21,962
Don't worry. We have to
get out from the city first.

490
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,088
Come.

491
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,374
Are you alright? Get up.

492
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,009
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

493
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:45,717
Your Highness, I can't run anymore.

494
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,773
-You should go ahead first.
-Your Highness.

495
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,340
Looks like nobody is on our trail.

496
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,141
I can also feel that
the sedative is wearing off.

497
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,916
-How about you put me down first?
-No.

498
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,534
I'll put you down when
you are recovered completely.

499
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,980
That's right. Let's keep
going for a little bit more.

500
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,040
Let's go.

501
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,576
-You saw Man Yao in the city?
-That's right.

502
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,860
I saw her on the street. But I lost
my eye on her and she was gone.

503
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,287
Your Highness, we have news.

504
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:18,508
Someone saw Miss Man Yao at
the west entrance of the city.

505
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:20,541
She must have left the city.
