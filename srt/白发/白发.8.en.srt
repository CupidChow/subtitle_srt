00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,180
Episode 8

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,940
Sir, Li Zhi Yuan's manor
has been emptied.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,820
These are all the people
left in there.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,900
Where is Li Zhi Yuan?

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,460
Please, show some mercy,
we don't know anything!

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,500
Bring them in for interrogation.

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,060
Your Highness, Minister Wu
found some clues.

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,460
When Minister Qin was ambushed,

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,260
all of his secretariat
students were killed.

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,260
Yet, Li Zhi Yuan gained the trust and
recognition of Yu Shi Hai.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,740
He took a position
in the Minister of Personnel.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
We can see he is a coward.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,140
He won't end his own life.

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,180
-You may go now.
-Yes.

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,780
Your Highness.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,100
There are so many luggage here.
Are we moving out?

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,500
Since you will be staying,

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,780
I shall make some
adjustment to the manor.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,980
I don't deserve this.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,900
What do you need of me?

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,100
Your Highness.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,180
Your Highness, a letter came in
from a guest outside.

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,620
This is rare.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,380
-Let him in.
-Yes.

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,740
I am here to tell Your Highness
I am leaving.

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,540
You still insist on leaving?

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,180
At your service, Your Highness.

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,940
Sir, why are you here?

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,060
You know him?

31
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,740
Yes.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,980
It's you.
Of course I remember you.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,340
That night, I was passing
through Vernicia Alley.

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,220
I didn't see her coming toward me.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,940
I almost bumped into her.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,740
<i>Vernicia Alley?</i>

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,420
<i>But we met at
Front Yard Street that night.</i>

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,740
Is that what happened?

39
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,900
Indeed.

40
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,820
The night is full of danger.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,700
Why would you be in the alley?

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,340
Soon after you saved me
from the prison,

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,820
I felt frustrated from the humiliation
I suffered in there.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,340
I couldn't fall asleep
and took a stroll on the street.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
Is this some sort of interrogation?

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,180
I was just being curious.

47
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,420
General Fu just returned
from a victorious battle.

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,020
But you seem to know each other well.

49
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,660
General Fu?

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,860
Your Highness.

51
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,420
I have only met this lady here
for mere moments.

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,500
I didn't even get a chance
to know her name.

53
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,660
You really don't know his name?

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,420
He pacified the skirmishes
at the south.

55
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,500
He is the famous Fu Chou.

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,900
General Fu.

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,940
Please, Your Highness.

58
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,500
Your Highness' praise
is too much for me.

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,940
Lady, here is something
you don't know.

60
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,940
The army I was leading
was surrounded.

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,300
If it wasn't for His Highness'
wise strategy,

62
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,780
I might have been a corpse by now.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,580
The credit of winning the battle
would be impossible.

64
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,860
Prince Li, I am grateful for the help.

65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,100
I shall remember
the kindness till my last breath.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,500
General Fu.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,420
You are being too humble.

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,620
I believe even without my help,

69
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
you and your warriors
could still win...

70
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,260
and secure a victory.

71
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,460
I should thank you for the advice
while we were at the Court that day.

72
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,060
His Majesty gave me the permission
to investigate the corruption.

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,980
I felt sorry for it.

74
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,660
I had no other choice that day.

75
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,300
I thought about it after I left.

76
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,580
I shouldn't have...

77
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,940
put you in the pressure of
solving the case in a week.

78
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,340
Which is why I searched the files.

79
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,020
I found some leads for you.

80
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,980
I hope this can be of help to you.

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,940
I know.

82
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,700
With your brilliant mind,

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,060
the case will be solved in seven days.

84
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,820
But as a token to repay
your kindness of saving me,

85
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,660
I have a lead on the case.

86
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,140
This is for you.

87
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,660
" Lin Village, Li Zhi Yuan "

88
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,140
Where did you get this piece
of information?

89
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,180
I have my ways.

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,300
I am not at liberty to say.

91
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,900
I hope Your Highness won't pry.

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,900
I didn't know who you were back then.

93
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,020
I apologize if I offended you.

94
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,220
It is fate that let us
meet each other.

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,620
There is no need for apology,
Miss Man Yao.

96
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,940
General Fu, I need a favour from you.

97
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,740
What may that be?

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,980
I am the mistress of
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

99
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,700
But I ran into some trouble lately.

100
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,180
His Highness invited me to stay
in this manor for time being.

101
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,140
His Highness is worried for
my safety and I can't leave.

102
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,820
Now that you are here,

103
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,660
can you be so kind as
to give me a ride?

104
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,540
His house is at the
north of the capital.

105
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,100
The teahouse is at the west.

106
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,940
How is that in his way?

107
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,460
I will drop by at the central
and be on my way.

108
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,380
I have long heard about...

109
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,340
how famous the tea
at Moon Embrace is.

110
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,660
How about this?

111
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,100
Do I have the honour to
have some tea at your premise?

112
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,860
That would be great.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,540
You have my thanks.

114
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,260
Your Highness, goodbye.

115
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,060
I shall be on my way now.

116
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,780
You are really leaving?

117
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,740
I have been here for days.
I should leave.

118
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,500
If you insist,

119
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,500
I shall respect that decision.

120
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,100
I have other work to see to.

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,980
You may continue
with your catching up.

122
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,540
Leng Yan, ready the horses.

123
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,820
Miss, this way.

124
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
You have my thanks for
helping me out just now.

125
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,660
You are most welcome.

126
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,300
But normally speaking,

127
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,180
I should be thanking you.

128
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,900
Since you already knew who I am,

129
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,180
you know well enough that...

130
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,180
I shouldn't have been
in the city that night.

131
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,220
The army returned victorious,
the people cheer for you.

132
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,820
You were back in the city
ahead of your schedule.

133
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,420
I know you have your own reasons.

134
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,020
You saved my life.

135
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,620
It's only decent of me
to keep that secret for you.

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,020
My lady, you have a sharp wit
and generous heart.

137
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,340
I am impressed.

138
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,340
General Fu, we have arrived
at the teahouse.

139
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,620
Thank you, General.
Goodbye.

140
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,100
Mistress.

141
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,180
You are finally back.
We are all worried for you.

142
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,260
You need not worry.
I am fine.

143
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,060
This is General Fu.

144
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,540
He is the one that saved me
after I left that night.

145
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,180
Thank you, General Fu.
How about a cup of tea inside?

146
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,660
I have work to be done.

147
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,620
I shall pay a visit some other day.

148
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,300
So long.

149
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,500
Your Highness, I have been
waiting for a long time.

150
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,260
What is your next plan?

151
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,740
Long Yue, I have a lead
on the Book of Mountain and River.

152
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,260
This is great.

153
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,660
Stay put in the teahouse.

154
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,740
Run a background check on
that General Fu.

155
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,700
Remember, be cautious.

156
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,660
-Keep me posted.
-Yes.

157
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,700
Xiao Sha, gather your best men.

158
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,300
We are going after Zong Zheng Wu You.

159
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,580
Yes.

160
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,100
An officer of the third rank.

161
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,740
Living in hiding without a name...

162
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,500
in this wild and a miserable life.

163
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,340
Sir Li, did you do something
against your conscience...

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,580
or did you take something
your shouldn't have?

165
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,500
Or did you offend someone with power?

166
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,700
I abandoned my rank
and live in this seclusion.

167
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,340
Why are you still coming after me?

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,740
Only a dead man can keep secrets.

169
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,900
Cover me.

170
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,020
Leng Yan!

171
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Be quick with it.

172
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
It's all because of a mistake I made.

173
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,100
I brought this down to myself.

174
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,660
I have no intention to kill you.

175
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,340
Answer my question and you will live.

176
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
What do you want to know?

177
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,940
Where is the Book of
Mountain and River?

178
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,380
I am sure you know what the
Book of Mountain and River is.

179
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,300
The book is lost.

180
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
I may be one the writers of the book,

181
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,860
but I have never seen
the completed version of it.

182
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,300
As for its whereabouts,
I have no clue at all.

183
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,340
Then you are no use to me!

184
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
Wait!

185
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,780
I remember now.

186
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,300
The book might inside the
secret chamber of Qin's manor.

187
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,380
I was told my teacher built a
secret chamber in his manor.

188
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,020
If His Majesty didn't find this book
when the manor is sealed,

189
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,460
the book must have been
hidden inside the chamber.

190
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,980
A chamber?

191
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,460
Turn around.

192
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,100
Who are you?

193
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,700
Your Highness!

194
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,860
Your Highness! Wake up!

195
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,420
You saved me once.

196
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,140
Now I am saving yours.

197
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,140
We are even now.

198
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,500
Your Highness!

199
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,540
Your Highness!

200
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,180
Master, we need to go!

201
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,540
-Run!
-Your Highness!

202
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,220
Your Highness!

203
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,180
Help!

204
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,900
-Princess!
-Princess!

205
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,260
-Princess!
-Princess!

206
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,420
Your Highness, you are finally back.

207
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,700
Are you all right?

208
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,100
I am so worried.

209
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,700
I am fine.
Fate is in my favour.

210
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,060
There is no need to be worried.

211
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,180
-Princess, let me get you some tea.
-I'll get hot water for your bath.

212
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,100
<i>Knowing that you are safe and sound,</i>

213
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,060
<i>my worries are relieved.</i>

214
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,260
<i>I found a lead on the mystical book.</i>

215
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
<i>I will get it soon.</i>

216
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,780
<i>As for Zong Zheng Wu You,</i>

217
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,660
<i>I noticed...</i>

218
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,460
<i>he is not the same
as the rumours said.</i>

219
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,260
<i>He may be arrogant,
but he is righteous.</i>

220
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,940
<i>He may be cold,</i>

221
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,660
<i>but he is kind in a way.</i>

222
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,020
<i>You need to bear this in mind.</i>

223
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,300
<i>If choice needs to be made one day,</i>

224
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,300
<i>we must not make him our enemy.</i>

225
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,860
<i>Take care, Brother.</i>

226
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,060
<i>From: Your sister Rong Le.</i>

227
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,460
Xiao Sha.

228
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,340
Princess.

229
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,140
I got some lead on the book
from Li Zhi Yuan.

230
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,780
Send this to Long Yue.

231
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,180
Order her to send this letter
to my brother in Western Qi.

232
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,340
Yes.

233
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,940
Your Highness.

234
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,420
Taking the Book of Mountain and River
means a fight with Prince Li.

235
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,340
We must not let our guard down.

236
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,980
Humans are unpredictable..

237
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,060
You should not put
so much trust in him.

238
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,980
Your Highness.

239
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,860
The doctor said it was a poison arrow.

240
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,820
You need to rest for a couple of days.

241
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,540
What about Li Zhi Yuan?

242
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,420
He is dead.

243
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,380
I brought his body back.

244
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,900
We searched every corner
of his hideout.

245
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,260
We found nothing.

246
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,340
I didn't see this coming.

247
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,180
I never thought Yu Wen Jie
had a trick up in his sleeves.

248
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,860
Maybe this is not
the doing of Yu family.

249
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,060
Indeed, I found other traces.

250
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,980
Someone sucked the poison
out in time for you.

251
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,260
Otherwise it could be much worse.

252
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,420
Have you seen that person?

253
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,420
You were alone when I arrived.

254
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,580
Those people might be
after something else.

255
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,500
They might be after the book.

256
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,460
Your Highness,
I carried out the mission.

257
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,820
Li Zhi Yuan is dead.

258
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,020
There is no one left to threaten you.

259
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,860
It's all thanks to
Sir Yu's keen insight.

260
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,100
He used the assassins from
Creed of Vengeance for pincer attack.

261
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,020
Otherwise the outcome could
have been different for us.

262
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,180
I was merely under your protection.
I dare not take the credit.

263
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,660
But the Creed really is reliable.

264
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,140
They could come in handy.

265
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,620
We need to use them for our bidding.

266
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,100
What a shame.

267
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,260
We still failed...

268
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,460
to get rid of that Zong Zheng Wu You.

269
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,740
Zong Zheng Wu You?

270
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,700
You actually admire him so much?

271
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,500
Sire, reports from Captain Xiao.

272
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,340
Yes.

273
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,300
Princess Rong Le was
framed and jailed.

274
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,820
Prince Li got her out.

275
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,420
She was then brought to
live in Prince Li's manor.

276
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,820
Rumour says the two of them
are very close.

277
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,060
Enough.

278
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,860
What about the matter
I ordered you to investigate?

279
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,860
We couldn't find the Physician.

280
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,780
But we did find out that...

281
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,500
a secret apprentice
of his still lives.

282
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,860
Empress Dowager,
His Majesty is resting.

283
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,140
He must not be bothered.

284
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,300
How bold of him.

285
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,140
Empress Dowager!

286
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,140
Mother.

287
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,100
Why did you send this servant
to stop me from entering?

288
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,180
If he is too much for you to handle,

289
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,540
I will gladly teach him
a lesson or two for you.

290
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,500
Please, don't be mad at him.

291
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,580
It's me, I have a relapse lately.
I need to rest.

292
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,420
I told Little Xun to
stay guard outside.

293
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,740
He as just following my order.

294
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,300
And you won't let me see you?

295
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,580
You are trying to go against me
at every corner nowadays.

296
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,180
All for the life of a mere servant.

297
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,860
Servant or not,

298
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,700
we are all equal in face of death.

299
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,340
No matter how noble you are,

300
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,620
if it's our fate,

301
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,540
none of us can escape from death.

302
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,980
No one can stop it.

303
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,460
-Let him go.
-Yes.

304
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,980
Thanks, Your Majesty.

305
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,500
All those letters you got from
the Northern Realm,

306
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,140
I have read each...

307
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,820
and every one of them.

308
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,580
Mother, why must you force my hand?

309
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,780
Your Majesty, I hope you remember
what's most important.

310
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,100
It's the order I gave you.

311
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,740
We are running out of time.

312
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,260
You should see to it yourself.

313
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Ling Yue.

314
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,980
What's wrong?

315
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,300
You look absent-minded
ever since I got back.

316
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,260
-Xiao Sha said...
-It's nothing.

317
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,260
You were gone for days.

318
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,740
I couldn't sleep well.

319
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,940
I am back now.
You can finally have some sleep.

320
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,140
Of course. You are back and
I can finally sleep better.

321
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,220
Your Highness, while you are
at Prince Li's manor,

322
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,860
did he mistreat you?

323
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,140
Princess?

324
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,700
Princess?

325
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,940
Princess, you are blushing.

326
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,180
No, I am not.

327
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,380
That jerk is so arrogant.

328
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,980
He is cunning and paranoid.

329
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,980
I can't seem to understand him at all.

330
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
He said he has no interest in women.

331
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,020
But he carried me and hugged me.

332
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,460
Prince Li may be impressive,
but he is no match for you.

333
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,740
Isn't that right?

334
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,020
Where is Lian Xin?

335
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,860
I don't know.

336
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,940
Maybe she is in the kitchen
preparing your medicine.

337
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,740
<i>It's not time to take
the medicine yet.</i>

338
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,220
<i>What is she preparing?</i>

339
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,780
Brother Xiao?

340
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,500
Your Highness, I intercepted this.

341
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,180
I interrogated the man
Lian Xin was in contact with.

342
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,700
Lian Xin.

343
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,540
I see you as my dearest friend.

344
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,060
Be honest with me and
tell me what's inside.

345
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,460
I will forgive you.

346
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,020
It's...

347
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,340
That is my love letter for him.

348
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,660
It's too indecent for
Your Highness' eyes.

349
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,180
Lian Xin, let Her Highness
have a look.

350
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,140
You can prove to us
you are not a spy.

351
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,220
Her Highness is a reasonable person.
She will forgive you.

352
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,740
Your Highness, having affair with
outsider means death sentence.

353
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,580
I don't want to die.

354
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,700
Your Highness.

355
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,020
How is this happening?

356
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,620
How is this happening?

357
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,580
Your Highness, I didn't do it!

358
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,060
I didn't do it!

359
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,300
Ling Yue, what do I do now?
Help me!

360
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,980
Lian Xin.

361
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,740
How could you?

362
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,020
You are spying for someone?

363
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,900
I see you as my own sister.
I am so disappointed in you!

364
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,660
Your Highness, I didn't do it!

365
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,700
I am not spying for anyone!

366
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Please believe me!
I am not sending anything!

367
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,220
Your Highness!

368
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,100
Your Highness, this is all my fault.

369
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,180
I shouldn't have helped her
avoid the guards...

370
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,020
so she could meet with her lover.

371
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,780
Her Highness found out
the lock has been tempered with.

372
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,060
She swapped out the letter
with a fake.

373
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,700
Otherwise, you had
taken those secrets.

374
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,780
I didn't do it!
I know nothing about the lock!

375
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,420
Please, spare me!
I deserve justice!

376
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,300
What is this then?

377
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,180
Your Highness.

378
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,540
He is a doctor.

379
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,300
He said that I knew no skill.

380
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,820
-I just wanted to learn.
-Nonsense!

381
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,860
Your Highness.

382
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,580
I questioned the man she was meeting.

383
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,620
He claimed to be a merchant.
He is no doctor.

384
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,260
As I told you, Princess Zhao Yun
passed out in here.

385
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,420
Her acupuncture points were blocked.

386
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,380
I didn't do it!
Your Highness, I didn't do it!

387
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,700
Lian Xin.

388
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,260
Come over here.

389
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,940
Place your hand in the water.

390
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
How is this happening?
Your Highness!

391
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,540
I didn't do it!

392
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,900
I never touched this chest!
I never touched it! Your Highness!

393
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,340
Did I say it will turn your hand blue?

394
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,580
No, but I am...

395
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,740
Your Highness, I swear
I am loyal to you!

396
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,460
I swear, I was just meeting my lover!

397
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,900
I am not spying for anyone!

398
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,020
Please, believe me!
Your Highness!

399
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,340
Ling Yue, explain to Her Highness.

400
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,340
You know all about me.

401
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,620
By the law of Qi,
spying for the enemy...

402
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,100
means death.

403
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,780
Your Highness, I don't want to die!

404
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,420
Your Highness must be not be swayed.

405
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,180
Please, show mercy.

406
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,980
Lian Xin was just blinded
by love for that man.

407
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,580
Seeing how she has always been
serving you so loyally,

408
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,060
please, spare her life.

409
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,420
I beg of you!

410
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,260
Her Highness, I don't want to die!

411
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,340
Lian Xin, tell me.

412
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,180
Do you love that man?

413
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,700
Yes, I will do anything for him.

414
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,060
Very well.

415
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,060
In that case,

416
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,020
I shall not make it hard for you.

417
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,580
You are on your own now.

418
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,820
I will tell the officers
to terminate your deed.

419
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,540
Leave. Go to the man you love.

420
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,620
Xiao Sha.

421
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,100
Send them out of the Northern Realm.

422
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,940
Your Highness!

423
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,860
Your Highness!

424
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,420
Your Highness!

425
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,660
Your Highness!

426
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,140
Ling Yue.

427
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,700
Lian Xin.

428
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,140
I understand. You know
the Princess' position in this palace.

429
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,300
She has her own reason
to be more cautious.

430
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,460
Take this as a blessing in disguise.

431
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,700
You can marry a good man.

432
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,700
It's better than a life of
serving others.

433
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,300
I understand.

434
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,740
Farewell, Your Highness.

435
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,420
I examined the body.

436
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,220
There is no clue to be found.

437
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,820
This is a receipt from the pawn shop.

438
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,060
If this is any ordinary receipt,

439
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,500
Li Zhi Yuan wouldn't
have hidden it so well.

440
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,620
Every pawn shop has its own logo.

441
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,180
Find out where this receipt came from.

442
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,620
Yes.

443
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,740
-Take this away.
-Yes.

444
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
Your Highness.

445
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,140
Minister of Personnel
sent an invitation.

446
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,060
Three days from now
is his 50th birthday.

447
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,300
He invites you to his feast.

448
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,980
-You may go now.
-Yes.

449
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,380
Three days from now?

450
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,100
It seems like getting rid
of Li Zhi Yuan...

451
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,580
makes them think I can't
solve the case.

452
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,460
They are sending a warning.

453
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,940
Your Highness, this came
from the Emperor.

454
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,660
I checked General Fu's background.

455
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,940
He spends most of his time
leading the troops.

456
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,780
He got promoted for his feats.

457
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,900
He never sided with any officials.

458
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,540
He is a generous and kind person.

459
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,340
He has a quite a good reputation
and respected by many.

460
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,460
For the time being,

461
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,340
there is nothing unusual about him.

462
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,140
A man that wins everyone's heart?

463
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
A man without flaw?

464
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,380
That is even more terrifying.

465
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,980
You are right.
I will investigate further.

466
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,180
I learned about the book.

467
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,060
It might be inside the old Qin manor.

468
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,820
I remember you said that after
the Qin family was executed,

469
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,900
the manor was granted to
Minister Yu by the Imperial Court.

470
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,060
Yes.

471
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,140
The manor went through renovation
into the Fort Yu we know.

472
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,460
However,

473
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,780
it went through renovation and
the Yu family lived there for so long.

474
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,740
Did no one realize there was
a secret chamber?

475
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,180
Qin Yong is a genius,

476
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,580
the chamber he designed
won't be found so easily.

477
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,140
But Fort Yu is heavily guarded.

478
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,820
The most pressing matter is
to find a way to sneak in.

479
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,860
Who is it?

480
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
It's me, Chen Yu.

481
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,540
Come in.

482
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,220
Mistress.

483
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,020
A man from Ministry of Personnel
sent an invitation.

484
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,460
Minister Yu's 50th
birthday is closing in.

485
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,260
He invites me to perform at his feast.

486
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,100
But he just framed us
and got us into jail.

487
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,740
We made him our enemy.

488
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,580
Chen Yu, not everyone can enter
Minister Yu's fort.

489
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,700
We should thank him for this offer.

490
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,340
Whatever he is planning,

491
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,460
he may have his schemes,

492
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,140
but I have my wits.

493
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,980
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

494
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,020
-Thank you.
-May you live long and well!

495
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,460
Welcome!

496
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,580
-Congratulations, Sir Yu.
-Thank you.

497
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,660
Thank you for coming.

498
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,580
-Thank you.
-The Royal Decree arrives!

499
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,380
Rewards from His Majesty.

500
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,860
Minister Yu achieved great deeds,

501
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,820
contributed much for the nation.
A thousand taels of gold...

502
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,660
and horse cart with scarlet paint.

503
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,260
Period.

504
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,700
-We are grateful, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

505
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,300
This way, sir.

506
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,540
This way, sir.

507
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,780
Rewards from the Crown Prince.

508
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,140
Rewards from the Crown Prince.

509
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,500
A pair of jade Kirins.

510
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,220
Five hundred taels of gold.

511
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,980
His Highness wishes Sir Yu
a long and prosperous life.

512
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,860
We are grateful for Your Highness.

513
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,260
This way, sir.

514
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,860
Rewards from Prince Li.

515
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,300
A precious sword from Prince Li.

516
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,700
A collection of valuable scrolls.

517
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,780
May Sir Yu live a long life.

518
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,300
Well and healthy.

519
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,100
We are grateful, Prince Li.

520
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,940
-This way, please.
-Please.

521
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,900
-This way, please.
-Please.

522
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,580
Make yourselves at home.

523
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,980
Kinship for brothers?

524
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,500
Li Zhi Yuan just died.

525
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,220
Prince Li has no choice
but to bow down to us.

526
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,540
What's wrong?

527
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,140
Miss, I am having a stomachache.

528
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,300
Can you show me to the washroom?

529
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,820
Well...

530
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,820
Please, take me there.

531
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,820
I don't want the show to be delayed.

532
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,980
Come with me.

533
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,500
Keep your eyes open.

534
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,940
Where did the lady go?

535
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,220
The other guests must have
taken her away.

536
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,700
We are in Minister Yu's house.

537
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,220
No one would dare to sneak in.

538
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,500
You are right.

539
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,380
Stay here and wait for that lady.

540
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,180
The feast will start soon.

541
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,980
The show must not be delayed.

542
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,260
Yes.

543
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,620
The feast will be starting soon.

544
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,140
Where could she be?

545
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,100
If this isn't Miss Man Yao.

546
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,060
Why did you lock yourself up?

547
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,580
I wonder if Miss Man Yao...

548
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,620
is searching for something
in this house?

549
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
I am looking for a way out.

550
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,100
We have known each other
for some time now.

551
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,660
Why are you avoiding me?

552
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
I found out about
the secret in this place.

553
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,020
Of course I would avoid you.

554
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,060
You hid a vault inside your house.

555
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,420
You plundered so much wealth.

556
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,660
Is the Yu family planning a mutiny?

557
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,860
You...

558
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,980
Miss Man Yao, you have a sharp wit.

559
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,100
I have seen that myself.

560
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,740
If you got out eventually,

561
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,220
you can tell anyone about this secret.

562
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,300
But the contraption is sophisticated.

563
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,140
It won't be easy to escape.

564
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,300
Whatever Prince Li is capable of,

565
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,820
he has no choice
but to see you die in here.

566
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,260
Master, Prince Li and
the Crown Prince are here.

567
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,740
The feast will start soon.

568
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,300
Rest well in behind those bars.

569
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,540
I will catch up with you later.

570
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,340
-Keep an eye on her.
-Yes.

571
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,460
May Sir Yu...

572
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,060
live long and prosper.

573
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,300
I heard Lady Chen Yu's skills
with lute is the best in capital.

574
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,500
But sadly, she offended Wu You.

575
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,780
The dance with her music
can no longer be seen.

576
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,060
What a shame.

577
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,940
A graceful melody
with an elegant dance.

578
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,820
Together, they are breathtaking.

579
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,540
Separated, they are still brilliant.

580
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,500
General Fu is a wise man,
I admire your wisdom.

581
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,260
But I think...

582
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,700
if two matters can be combined,
it benefits all.

583
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,340
Otherwise, it will be disruption.

584
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,060
Indeed.

585
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,580
Today is my birthday celebration.

586
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,700
May I ask the gentlemen to so kind...

587
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,380
and to let me ease the tension
in the air?

588
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,420
Very well.

589
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,300
General Fu is a man of war.

590
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,420
Military matters come first for him.

591
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,420
But something needs to be let go.

592
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,060
It will be better for everyone.

593
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,180
I want to how is it better for anyone.

594
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,580
Is it better for corruption?

595
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,940
To get rid of rivals?

596
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,460
Or to plunder the people?
