Episode 39

3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,740
Recently, you've worked so hard
until you forgot to eat and sleep.

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,780
Why did you suddenly have
the mood to fly kite with me?

5
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,460
I saw that during spring,

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,500
guys will always ask
their lovers out...

7
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,100
to fly kite together.

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,380
So...

9
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
Princess Rong Le.

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,420
You are flying kite here as well?
Greetings...

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,180
Today, Man Yao and I...

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,420
are just here to have fun
as normal husband and wife.

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,740
No need to be courteous.

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,260
Since you are the one who said it,

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,660
how about we have a
kite flying competition?

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,340
But there will be
punishment if you lose.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,420
Let's do it then.

18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,500
Let's.

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,580
Be careful, Wu You.

20
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,180
Xiao Sha. Make it fly now.

21
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,940
Didn't you say that you are
unbeatable in flying kite?

22
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,020
-Why did you lose?
-I'm nervous...

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
-with you standing behind me.
-Sir Xiao.

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,100
Are you saying that
you lost because of me?

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,740
No. Of course not.

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,380
I lost because I'm not
as skilful as he is.

27
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,100
Wu You, why did you release the kite?

28
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,340
There's a saying that
when a kite flies away,

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,940
it'll bring along all the
sufferings and disaster with it.

30
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,180
I prayed to the heaven
so that you, me...

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,420
and all the people beside us...

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,140
will live in peace, happiness,
and without illness and calamity.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,460
Ling Yue.

34
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,380
Just now, you said that
the losing party has to be punished.

35
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,180
What is the punishment?

36
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,460
The punishment is...

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,900
-Brother Li.
-Hello, Brother Li.

38
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,780
Hello, Sister Rong Le.

39
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,660
This is the punishment you meant?
Taking care of kids?

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,500
That's right.

41
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,100
Princess, don't you know that...

42
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,740
because Xiao Sha is surrounded
by these kids every day,

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,540
I don't even have a chance
to date with him.

44
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,860
Alright. Today,
I'll be taking care of these kids.

45
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,100
And then, you can have a date with
Xiao Sha as long as you want.

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
-Kids.
-Brother Li!

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,260
Sister Rong Le.

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,860
-Be careful.
-Brother Li.

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,860
Your Highness, Lady Rong Le.

50
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,420
It's my fault for not
disciplining them well enough.

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,540
Kids, come here.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,100
-I'll give you some sweets.
-Yes!

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,500
Come here.

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,140
Did you finish your work on time?

55
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,180
-Yes.
-Here, take it.

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,940
After the earthquake in Zhuo,

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,820
the children who came here
after they lost their parents...

58
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,420
wouldn't talk at all at first.

59
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,660
Now, after they are being...

60
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,940
taken care by a taciturn
like him for half a year,

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,420
they've become so lively.

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,820
-Come.
-That's right.

63
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,260
For the past half year,
he only cared about those children.

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,340
-He didn't think about me at all.
-Don't fight. There's enough for all.

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,100
Come.

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,220
Sister Ling Yue.

67
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Brother Xiao has asked me
to give this flower bundle to you.

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,140
Thank you. Such a good girl.

69
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,940
Go to him now.

70
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,820
Come here, children.

71
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,140
-Come to me.
-Alright.

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,180
-Come, come to us.
-Sister Rong Le.

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,940
Go now.

74
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
Leave the kids to me and Wu You.

75
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,980
Go now.

76
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,060
-We want to play a game.
-Alright.

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,420
-What do you want to play?
-Eagle catches the chickens.

78
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,660
Xiao Sha.

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,060
Look.

80
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,300
Although His Highness is busy with
the government affairs every day,

81
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,380
he'll eat dinner with
the princess every night.

82
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,740
They are the real couple that are
in love with each other.

83
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,420
We've been together for
more than one year, but you...

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,060
I understand now.
I promise that...

85
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
from now on, as long as
I'm in Prince Li's Manor,

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,140
I'll make sure to eat dinner
with you every day.

87
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,740
Is food the only thing in your mind?
Dummy.

88
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Ling Yue.

89
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,940
Then are you willing to...

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,700
marry this dummy?

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm coming!

92
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,420
-This side!
-Come and catch me!

93
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,140
Don't move!

94
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,740
I caught you!

95
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,220
Come and catch me!

96
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,980
We won!

97
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,380
We won!

98
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,100
Come!

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Don't look.

100
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500
Your Highness, Princess.

101
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,900
How is it? It's not hard to
take care of kids, right?

102
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,340
For me, I'm fine.

103
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,060
But I think Wu You...

104
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,060
is not doing that well.

105
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,660
Xiao Sha, it's time they
go back to class, right?

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,420
Don't worry.
I'll bring them away now.

107
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,540
Children, let's go.

108
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,740
-Let's go back to study.
-Let's go! Goodbye.

109
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,780
-Goodbye.
-Brother Li, goodbye.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,340
-Goodbye, Sister Rong Le.
-Goodbye.

111
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,260
-Listen to Brother Xiao Sha, alright?
-Be good.

112
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,380
Man Yao.

113
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,700
You like children so much.

114
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,140
How about we make
some children of our own?

115
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,620
Who wants to have children with you?

116
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,540
I want to have children with you.

117
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,100
Man Yao.

118
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,260
For the past one year, are you happy?

119
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,780
The past one year is the
happiest moment in my life.

120
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,820
Because I can be with you.

121
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,500
Marry me then.

122
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,780
Be my only wife.

123
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,500
We'll raise our own children...

124
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,180
and build our own family.

125
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,780
We won't give up on
each other forever...

126
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,100
and we'll live until
we are old and Gray.

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,540
Wu You.

128
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,260
I won't let you wait for too long.

129
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,180
One day,

130
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,380
we'll be free from this
southern and northern area...

131
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,300
and we'll be free from
this national enmity.

132
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,980
And just like today,
we'll rewrite the painful past...

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,860
with beautiful memories.

134
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,660
Are you willing to wait for me?

135
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,300
-He's back.
-Prince Chen is back.

136
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,140
Prince Chen.

137
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,020
Prince Chen.

138
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,700
One year ago, General Fu used
the Phoenix Seal of Empress Fu.

139
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,180
Wei feared General Fu's
fierce reputation...

140
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,660
until they don't dare attack us when
Northern Realm was in a civil strife.

141
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,700
What a great man he is.

142
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,900
This hero is indeed the
descendants of royalty,

143
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,700
a true son of Heaven.

144
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,100
-Good!
-Your Highness, this storyteller...

145
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,540
As for Empress Fu,
everybody knows that...

146
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,860
she had passed away in the blaze
that burnt down Senyan Palace.

147
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,660
But we never thought that
she's still alive.

148
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,820
Turns out that she was saved
by a handmaiden back then.

149
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,980
But unfortunately, her outstanding
beauty was lost on that very day.

150
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,180
She was so shocked
until she lost her mind.

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,020
That's really too bad.

152
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,300
I heard that back then,
she was very famous for her beauty.

153
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,660
-Yes.
-Empress Fu...

154
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,980
is the princess of Chen.

155
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,940
She was elegant and
with over-the-top beauty.

156
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,660
Back then, in order to marry her,
the late emperor...

157
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,380
had put in so much
effort to court her.

158
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,740
Unfortunately,
her beauty is short-lived.

159
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,180
Now, although she has lost her mind,

160
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,060
luckily, Prince Regent
is a very filial son.

161
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,540
He searched everywhere for famous
physician to treat his mother.

162
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,300
I think it won't be long...

163
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,220
for her to regain her sanity.

164
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,940
My fellow storyteller,

165
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,940
why did you keep on telling stories
about Northern Realm?

166
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,340
Talk about the southern fringe too.

167
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,460
That's right. Although Prince Regent
from Northern Realm is great,

168
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,580
our Prince Li in this southern fringe
is not too bad too.

169
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,420
-Everybody, am I right?
-That's right.

170
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,940
Speaking of southern fringe,

171
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,500
Prince Li who was once the most
rightful heir to the throne...

172
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,740
had given it up because of
a woman back then.

173
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,780
Now, he's hiding in southern fringe...

174
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,340
and still using the same title given
by the late emperor of Northern Realm.

175
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,340
And he still bears the
infamy of being a traitor.

176
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,340
Traitor or not, I just know that...

177
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,900
after Prince Li came here and
carry out People-Based Transformation,

178
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,700
we are no longer exploited
by the scholars. Am I right?

179
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,740
You are wrong, Sir.

180
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,540
Although Prince Li's transformation
has shown result,

181
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,300
the scholars are deeply rooted here.

182
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm afraid that this
transformation won't last long.

183
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,460
We just settled the civil strife but
Northern Realm is eyeing us like prey.

184
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,340
And our borders are frequently
disturbed. If there's a war,

185
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,340
I'm afraid that we'll lose.

186
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,180
-And we are the one who will suffer.
-Sir.

187
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,300
That's right.

188
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,500
Prince Chen. It's Prince Chen.

189
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,100
-Prince Chen is back.
-Prince Chen is back.

190
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,460
-Let's go!
-Prince Chen!

191
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,020
-Look.
-It's really Prince Chen.

192
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,140
I heard that the Luo Army of General
Luo Zhi has won the war in our border.

193
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,420
I think he'll be back soon.

194
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,140
-That's great!
-That's right!

195
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,500
Finally, they are back!

196
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,660
The news of victory about
Luo Army has spread.

197
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,260
Even the employ of Chen...

198
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,860
has come to Qingzhou
in haste to congratulate us.

199
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,660
But, where did Prince Li go?

200
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,980
Why isn't he here personally
to welcome the employ?

201
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,860
Prince Li has other things
to do today.

202
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,700
I'm going to take care of the
government affairs in his stead.

203
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,140
Everybody has seen the
letter of credence just now.

204
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,420
The employ has requested a meet-up
of an emperor to an emperor.

205
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,420
They had invited Prince Li
to visit Chen for an alliance.

206
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,620
It is indeed inappropriate.

207
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,780
What's so inappropriate for
an emperor to meet another emperor?

208
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,860
Now, the people
are talking about this.

209
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,660
The bad sort even spreads rumours,
saying that...

210
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,980
Prince Li doesn't call
himself an emperor...

211
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,780
because he is a traitor
and is guilty for it.

212
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,540
And they say that he is no match
to Zongzheng Wu Chou.

213
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,900
But in truth, Prince Li is the
real bloodline of the late emperor.

214
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,900
As soon as he ascends the throne
to become emperor,

215
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,740
the people will turn back to him.

216
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,180
That's right.

217
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,500
Sir Cai, Prince Li has made a vow to
use the title given by late emperor.

218
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,260
It shows his loyalty and filial piety
towards the late emperor.

219
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,340
He doesn't wish for the
north and south to be in war.

220
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,100
He doesn't want to cause harm
to Northern Realm.

221
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,940
Besides, Prince Li has repeatedly...

222
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,140
made his standing clear towards Chen.

223
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,780
He wants to unite...

224
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,940
the whole Northern Realm first...

225
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,060
and bring peace to it before
deciding on other matters.

226
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,420
But this time, Chen is even more
desperate to invite Prince Li...

227
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,740
for an alliance compared
to previous invitations.

228
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,740
They even offered to
lend us their army.

229
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,500
With Chen's support,

230
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,580
it'll further strengthen our army
to take down Northern Realm.

231
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,460
I think His Highness
might agree to it.

232
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,620
Although meeting them
as emperor is an overstep,

233
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,540
it's not that His Highness
is disqualified to be an emperor.

234
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,420
Sir Sun, what do you think?

235
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,140
I support Prince Li's decision.

236
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,940
But Prince Li is not here now.

237
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,860
But is this idea of
not being the emperor...

238
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,820
Prince Fan Yang's idea...

239
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,780
or Prince Li's idea?

240
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,700
How are we going to be sure of that?

241
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,140
Rude!

242
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,860
Uncle.

243
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Sir Cai.

244
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,140
When my father was in peril,
my uncle had came...

245
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,700
to stabilise the situation here
despite his serious wounds.

246
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,900
He's the reason for the peace
you have today.

247
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,340
But all of you just want
to be the founders of a country.

248
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,940
You just want to be awarded.

249
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,860
Have you no regards about my uncle
and my brother's national enmity?

250
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,020
Prince Chen, this...

251
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,580
Why didn't you inform us
if you are back?

252
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,740
Wu You won't betray
the country like Fu Chou.

253
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,420
He won't be disloyal, unfilial,
cruel and unjust.

254
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,940
As long as Northern Realm
is not in order,

255
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,460
Wu You won't call himself as emperor.

256
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,020
My fellow ministers,

257
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,020
if any of you dare advise Wu You
to forget about revenge...

258
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,420
and call himself as emperor,

259
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,900
please join me in the front line.

260
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,620
Let's bathe in blood while
bodies pile high, how about that?

261
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,460
Prince Li has already given his order.

262
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,220
If the employ of Chen
requests to meet him,

263
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,260
tell him that His Highness
is not in Qingzhou.

264
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,820
So, Sir Cao will go to Chen instead...

265
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,300
to discuss about the opening of
our border to encourage more trading.

266
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,340
As for the alliance
between two countries,

267
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,980
we'll discuss it next time.

268
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,860
Yes, Prince Fan Yang.
I will fulfil my mission.

269
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,980
So, Wu You has a plan in mind already.

270
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,700
For this war fought by Luo Army,

271
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,380
before we achieve victory,
Wu You had already written to me...

272
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,220
for me to hold a feast
for the soldiers.

273
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Sir Cai.

274
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,900
I came back earlier to Qingzhou
this time to tell you that...

275
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,060
before General Luo Zhi
comes back to the court,

276
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,100
please transfer the special fund to
comfort and compensate the soldiers.

277
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,420
This is not to be delayed.

278
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,140
We have a lot on our plates now.

279
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,740
I can't get my hands on so much money
in such a short time.

280
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,020
Under Wu You's order,
I've checked the military account.

281
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,820
Since the implementation
of the transformation,

282
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,660
the military fund is
separated from others.

283
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,980
If there's a shortage,

284
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,700
I'm afraid that there must be
corruption or dereliction of duty.

285
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,540
You know General Luo Zhi's
temperament.

286
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,740
If any of Luo Army's money is lost,

287
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm afraid that Cai family's property
will be used...

288
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,580
-for military expenditure.
-Your Highness.

289
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,820
You are just making things
difficult for me.

290
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,100
Your Highness.

291
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,100
In order to thank the soldiers in the
front line who had fought...

292
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,500
fought bravely to protect us,

293
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,460
I am willing to donate
100 taels of gold...

294
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
to reward the soldiers.

295
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,820
You are indeed the most
understanding man, teacher.

296
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Based on what I know, ever since the
implementation of the transformation,

297
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Sun family has most of
their lands confiscated.

298
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,460
But you've never once stopped the
implementation of the transformation.

299
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,660
It is the right thing to do.

300
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,220
Then, Sir Cai,

301
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,060
what do you think?

302
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
I...

303
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,300
Before the Luo Army comes back,

304
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,700
I'll get the reward to their hands.

305
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,540
That's great then.

306
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,820
Man Yao, Luo Zhi's celebratory feast
will be in two days' time.

307
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,780
Attend it together with me.

308
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,540
Wu You.

309
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,740
I know that you don't mind
the way I look.

310
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,220
And I didn't hide in the manor...

311
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,900
because of my looks.

312
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,580
Just that...

313
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm in an awkward position now.

314
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,180
If I just show myself like that
in front of the officials,

315
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,220
not only I'll be censured,

316
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,980
you'll be dragged into it as well.

317
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,340
This transformation is
not easy to start with.

318
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,700
I don't want to
cause further trouble...

319
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,180
because of this measly thing.

320
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,500
Man Yao.

321
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,500
I don't care about the things
that you've mentioned.

322
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,900
I don't care about others' censure.

323
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,820
I just know that...

324
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,580
since you can face
an army together with me,

325
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,980
you shouldn't hide behind me.

326
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,860
Because of the things in the past,

327
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,340
you are not willing to
accept the title as my wife.

328
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,380
I can kind of understand that.

329
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,060
But if you can't even stand by
my side with your head held high,

330
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,460
how am I going to feel at ease?

331
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,300
Alright, I promise you.

332
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,020
I'll attend the feast with you.

333
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
For the past one year,
half of the credits for the result...

334
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,220
of the transformation
should go to you.

335
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,340
Since we can go through
hardship together,

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,820
we should enjoy this honour
together as well.

337
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,060
Besides that, there's another things
that I need your help with.

338
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,140
Is it about Luo Zhi?

339
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,100
I can never hide my thoughts from you.

340
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,620
For the past one year, after the
implementation of the transformation,

341
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,460
we've weaken the scholars.

342
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,820
At the same time, General Luo Zhi
has achieved multiple battle merits.

343
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,300
And now,

344
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,580
he and his soldiers from poor
background have increased in power.

345
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,140
Luo Zhi has always been arrogant.

346
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,140
If we leave him alone like that,

347
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,740
he might become rampant
and hard to be controlled.

348
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,060
Yes. That's why I purposely
arranged for Wu Yu to be in his troop.

349
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,860
Wu Yu and I think that although
Luo Zhi is crude and aggressive,

350
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,660
he can manage the
military troops very well.

351
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,820
He's a very rare and talented general.

352
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,820
This kind of hot-blooded man
won't bow to power...

353
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,700
and he cares not about money or woman.

354
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,780
He will only serve us with loyalty...

355
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,540
after he has fully accepted us.

356
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,260
Don't worry. I have a plan.

357
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,380
I'll make Luo Zhi submit to you.

358
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,860
What plan is that?

359
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,220
Prince Chen.

360
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,260
-Prince Chen!
-Wu You, Man Yao.

361
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,340
I heard that you went out
to play today.

362
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,820
No wonder there's
no one to welcome me.

363
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,180
Your Highness, Princess.

364
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,620
I've tried to stop him but I failed.

365
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,740
I'm not an outsider.
No need to announce my arrival.

366
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,020
Prince Chen, you don't know.

367
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,380
After you went to the military camp
for a year, we have new rules here.

368
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,780
When His Highness is
having dinner with Princess,

369
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,820
nobody can disturb them.

370
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,180
Dinner is ready.
Please enjoy your dinner.

371
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,300
Get another set of cutlery
for Prince Chen.

372
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,700
Yes, Princess.

373
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,380
Wu You, Man Yao,
this is what you eat every day?

374
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,940
They are worse than the food
in the military camp.

375
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,100
I thought that the food will be better
after I come back to the manor.

376
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,420
Man Yao did this for the sake of
the soldiers battling at the border.

377
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,180
She has ordered us to dispense all
unnecessary expenditure in the manor.

378
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,380
These food are cooked by
Man Yao herself.

379
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,380
We've been eating
like this for a year.

380
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,060
I knew that she's the one who cooked
the food just by looking at it.

381
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,540
But,

382
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,020
why do I think that Wu You
doesn't really enjoy it that much?

383
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,140
Looks like your fighting skills have
improved after a year in the army.

384
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,700
Of course. I trained myself every day
while I was in the military camp.

385
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,940
How about we find a day
to have a friendly match?

386
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,220
Compete with Man Yao first.

387
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,140
Man Yao has been
training hard for the past year.

388
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,980
She's good in riding
and shooting as well.

389
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,860
You can come and challenge me
if you can defeat her.

390
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,780
I don't dare to do that.

391
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,620
If I accidentally hurt her,

392
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,060
you are going to kill me.

393
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,700
Princess.

394
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,540
Ke has specially
cooked this tonic for you.

395
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,460
Tonic cooked by Ke?
I have to taste that.

396
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,460
" Medical Prescription "

397
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,140
Are you going to give this book to Ke?

398
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,300
Let's eat. Let me taste
your cooking skills, Man Yao.

399
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,860
Uncle, I found it,

400
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,820
-You found it?
-This is the Blood Raven Roots.

401
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,260
What Blood Raven Roots?
I can find it for you too.

402
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,500
You won't be able to find it.

403
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,700
This kind of root grows in the
most dangerous and weirdest place.

404
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,940
Only a person with skills
like uncle can find it.

405
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,020
Besides, this Blood Raven Roots
is related to Princess Rong Le's life.

406
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,500
Are you saying that this will
affect Man Yao's life?

407
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,980
But the messages that I received for
the past year said that she's healthy.

408
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,060
I thought that she was fully cured.

409
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,940
Besides, when I saw her just now,
she looks quite well.

410
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,500
Princess Rong Le looks like
a normal person now...

411
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,220
because I think she took the cure
at one point in the past year.

412
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,460
Although her pulse reading is stable,
there are some hidden issues.

413
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,380
Maybe the poison is not
completely neutralised yet.

414
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,860
Are you saying that Blood Raven Roots
can neutralise the poison completely?

415
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,740
I've read all the medical books but
I still can't determine the poison...

416
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,420
contacted by princess in Western Qi.

417
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,580
But I found a this magical Blood
Raven Roots in this medical book.

418
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,860
It can neutralise the poison
in the body and blacken the hair.

419
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,340
What are you waiting for?
Let's tell Wu You at once.

420
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,820
Wait.

421
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,380
We can tell him after we found
the Blood Raven Roots.

422
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,980
Isn't it good to let him think that
Princess Rong Le is fine and well now?

423
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,820
If we can't find it,

424
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,260
it'll be such a disappointment.

425
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,020
You've become more matured
after one year.

426
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,100
Yes, you are right.

427
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,860
Wu You and Man Yao have indeed
gone through so much hardship...

428
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,580
for them to be together happily
just like today.

429
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,940
Uncle, let's look for the location
of the Blood Raven Roots.

430
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,180
Alright.

431
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,300
Uncle, let's go.

432
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,740
Alright.

433
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,260
Wait.

434
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm too bored in the manor.

435
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,820
I'm on my way to go out too.

436
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,740
Where are you going to find
the Blood Raven Roots?

437
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Here.

438
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,100
Youji Mountain?

439
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,220
I never heard of this place.

440
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,180
Is your source correct?

441
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,780
Last night, I had to tell so many lies
to Wu You in order to join you today.

442
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,260
If we come back empty-handed,
it'll be such a waste.

443
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,500
Why do you keep on
staring at Agent Wu?

444
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,980
Uncle, why are you always frowning?

445
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,060
If you are so strict all the time,

446
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,420
it'll be harmful to your spleen
and stomach for worrying too much.

447
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,940
Most importantly...

448
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,460
What?

449
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,620
When your spleen and stomach
are unwell, you'll have wrinkles.

450
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,540
You'll look old if you have wrinkles.

451
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,140
It shouldn't be like that.

452
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,460
People who practised martial arts
are very energetic.

453
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,540
Usually, we will look
younger than others.

454
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,740
-Impossible that I'll look old.
-Of course you look old.

455
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,140
Too bad I don't have a mirror.

456
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Or else, I can show you how old
you look when you are frowning.

457
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,620
How about you look into my eyes.
You'll be able to see your reflection.

458
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,180
My eyes are bigger.

459
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,860
Do you want to look into my eyes?

460
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,780
Ke, how old do you think I look now?

461
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,900
Forty.

462
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,860
I look that old?

463
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,700
See. It's much better
if you are not frowning.

464
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,020
It's late and Youji Mountain
is quite far.

465
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,540
What are you doing?

466
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,900
It's late already.

467
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,460
Let's depart now. Let's go.

468
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
" Sun's Manor "

469
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,580
Miss Sun, the songs
that you play now...

470
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,340
are way better than those depressing
songs that you used to play.

471
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,700
You just think that it sounds nice.

472
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,580
But you don't understand it.

473
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,580
If you understand it,

474
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,740
you won't look so gleeful now.

475
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,980
Sometimes, I am quite envious of you.

476
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,940
Ignorant is bliss after all.

477
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,740
Miss Sun, you are so smart but
you are envious of dummies like us?

478
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,620
So unappreciative of you.

479
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,820
Ling Yue, why are you here?

480
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,420
I thought that you won't come
to visit me since Sir Xiao is back.

481
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,900
Are you saying that you don't
welcome me? I'll leave then.

482
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,260
Ling Yue.

483
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,500
For the past year, you had always
visited me and kept me company.

484
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,740
Now, we are like sisters who had
gone through hardship together.

485
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,580
Usually, I've always
treated you as my equal.

486
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,380
I've never wanted you
to call me a Miss.

487
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,580
How could you just leave
like that because of a joke?

488
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,340
I'm just joking with you.

489
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,980
This is a new tea given by
Princess Rong Le.

490
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,180
-Chun Ni.
-Yes, Miss Sun.

491
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,660
Steep it with the tea that
Rong Le gave me last month.

492
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Yes, Miss Sun.

493
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,340
Help me thank Rong Le.

494
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,180
Help me thank Lady Rong Le for
thinking about me for the past year.

495
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,340
She will send me the new tea
at the beginning of every season.

496
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,780
Not only her,

497
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,140
even Prince Li has always
mentioned about you.

498
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,860
-Is that so?
-Yes.

499
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,780
Prince Li always talked about the
past incidents with you in Qingzhou.

500
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,540
No matter what,

501
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,340
it's all in the past.

502
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,100
Ling Yue.

503
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,060
Please express my thanks to
His Highness and Lady Rong Le.

504
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,540
It's sweet after sweat for
His Highness and Lady Rong Le now.

505
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,380
Finally, they've become
husband and wife.

506
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,140
Such envy they've caused.

507
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,580
Ya Li.

508
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,300
How about you come to
Prince Li's Manor with me?

509
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,300
Say your thanks to His Highness
and Princess Rong Le yourself.

510
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,700
They will be ecstatic if they see you.

511
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,460
I'll pass.

512
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,260
I've never gone out of
this manor for a year.

513
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,340
I don't wish to meet others as well.

514
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,420
Ya Li.

515
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,140
Truthfully, if you go out
and walk around,

516
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,420
you'll realise that others' have
already forgotten about the past.

517
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,060
They won't cast weird glances
at you anymore.

518
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,980
Moreover, if you spend time with
your zither in the manor every day,

519
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,820
how are you going to find
someone that understands you?

520
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,260
His Highness and Princess Rong Le
know a little about music...

521
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,620
but they are too busy
with work recently.

522
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,380
They haven't been
playing together for so long.

523
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,300
Miss Sun, the tea is here.

524
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,140
So fragrant.

525
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,620
It's a newly steeped tea.

526
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,900
Miss Sun.

527
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,420
Princess Rong Le.
Look who's here.

528
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,140
Ya Li?

529
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,140
Long time no see.

530
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,260
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

531
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
Quick, get up.
No need to be so courteous.

532
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
Lady Rong Le.

533
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,180
This is a calming incense that I made.

534
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,460
A small gift for you.
Please accept it.

535
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,980
Thank you, Ya Li.

536
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,860
After so long,
you are still so courteous.

537
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,420
I have to thank you
for your calming incense then.

538
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,940
You've taken care of my worries.

539
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,060
You are having trouble
sleeping lately?

540
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,740
It's not me. It's Wu You.

541
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,860
He's too busy with work recently.

542
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,820
He is always coming back very late
and he can't fall asleep.

543
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,540
If this calming incense can
help His Highness to rest,

544
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,580
I can make more of them for you,
Lady Rong Le.

545
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,340
You have my thanks.

546
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,500
Ya Li, this way please.

547
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,900
How have you been for the past year?

548
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,980
I've asked Ling Yue to invite you
to my manor for quite a few times.

549
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,340
But I heard that...

550
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,180
you are not feeling well and
wouldn't come out from your manor.

551
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,780
Thank you for asking after me.

552
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,260
I'm feeling fine now.

553
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,060
Have a seat.
Let's sit and chat.

554
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,460
Lady Rong Le, you are playing chess?

555
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,460
I was in a middle of a game
with His Highness.

556
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,620
We were interrupted half way through.

557
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,220
That's why it turns out like this.

558
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,020
If you are willing,
how about we finish it?

559
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Sure.

560
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,020
His Highness is both your lover
and your best friend.

561
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,980
How envious.

562
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,940
Unlike me, I'm all alone.

563
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,620
I have no one.

564
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,860
And it's been a long time
since I last play chess.

565
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,500
An unexpected way out.

566
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,820
Such a good move.

567
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,020
Although you've given up on
a lot of your chess pieces,

568
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,500
you've found another way out.

569
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,460
Lost will be balanced out by gain.

570
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
If you give up on the past,

571
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,460
you'll see a bright future
ahead of you.

572
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,100
Ya Li.

573
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,860
You've been locking yourself up
in the manor for the past year.

574
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
You must be brushing up
your chess skills, right?

575
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,620
It's true that I haven't been
playing chess for a year.

576
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,260
I'm out of practise now.

577
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,460
Although I've found a way out,

578
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,700
I've lost a huge amount of
my chess pieces.

579
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,020
With the declining amount
of the white chess piece,

580
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,380
the ending is set.

581
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,460
No matter how I try,

582
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,580
I'll still lose this round.

583
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,660
Since you no longer play chess,
do you still play your zither?

584
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,540
I don't play it anymore.

585
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,980
After all,

586
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
I can't play it as well as you anyway.

587
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
Lady Rong Le.

588
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,820
I remembered that I made
a promise with my father.

589
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,460
I have to go back.

590
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,100
Father.

591
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,020
You went to Prince Li's Manor.

592
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
Yes.

593
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,940
Looks like you've finally understood.

594
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,900
In the past year,
I had advised you so many times...

595
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,420
to visit Princess Rong Le and use that
chance to get closer to Prince Li.

596
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,300
Father.

597
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,500
I went there today to visit
Rong Le and play chess.

598
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,100
I didn't see His Highness at all.

599
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,340
Looks like you are still
oblivious about my efforts.

600
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,500
His Highness and Rong Le
are a devoted couple.

601
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,500
There is no chance for me
to go between them.

602
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,580
As long as you are willing to do it,

603
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,700
you will succeed.

604
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,620
Luo Zhi will be back tomorrow.

605
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,060
Prince Li has prepared
a feast for him.

606
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,980
Bring your zither along and attend
the feast with me tomorrow.

607
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,780
You need to let His Highness
know that you still exist.

608
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,580
Father, I don't wish to go
to a place with many people...

609
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,380
and to be the talk of the town.

610
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,060
I don't care if you are willing
or not. You have to go.

611
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,180
His Highness has no like for a feast.

612
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,020
If it isn't because
Luo Zhi loves wine,

613
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,020
you won't even have that chance!

614
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,740
We are not what we used to be.

615
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,780
Luo Zhi and his soldiers from the poor
are more and more in favour.

616
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,820
I've even put down my dignity.

617
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,940
Why would I care about your interest?

618
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,900
Yes, father.

619
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,340
I'll do as you say.

620
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,860
Congratulations, General Luo.

621
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,620
Congratulations on your victory,
General Luo.

622
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,220
Thank you.

623
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,740
This way, please.

624
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,300
-I'm sorry, Miss Sun.
-It's alright.

625
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,220
The lady with the zither.

626
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,580
I'm bored.

627
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,780
Can you play me a song...

628
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,900
to appease my boredom?

629
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,980
General Luo.

630
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,740
She is my daughter, Ya Li.

631
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,740
She's here to play zither
with Lady Rong Le today.

632
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,540
Since she is Sir Sun's daughter,

633
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
I'm sure that she can play very well.

634
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,940
His Highness is late anyway.

635
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,420
It's boring for us to just sit here.

636
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,260
And it's no fun for me to drink alone.

637
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,020
Are you willing...

638
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,580
to play a song for me?

639
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,420
Ya Li.

640
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,860
Play a song for General Luo.

641
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,660
Yes, father.

642
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,580
Congratulations on your victory,
General Luo.

643
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,700
General Luo.

644
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,380
His Highness is not here yet.

645
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,340
So what if I drink a few cups of wine?

646
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,180
His Highness is late.

647
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,500
Is he going to blame me
for drinking some wine?

648
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,700
You've achieved high merits.

649
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,700
And this feast is set up for you.

650
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,300
I'm sure His Highness won't blame you
for drinking a few cups of wine first.

651
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,900
But none of us here...

652
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,060
are doing the same thing as you.

653
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,340
What has caused
His Highness to be late?

654
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,860
He's late for almost one hour.
Why isn't he here yet?

655
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,740
General Luo.

656
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,380
Recently, the country is very peaceful
and there is no important work.

657
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,020
I'm afraid that...

658
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,340
His Highness is late
because of someone.

659
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,060
Who is the person that can stall him?

660
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,980
In this southern fringe,

661
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,180
the only one who can stall him...

662
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,100
is his wife.

663
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,300
You've been fighting in war outside,
so you don't know about this.

664
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,620
Now, in His Highness's heart,

665
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,460
I'm afraid that there's
nothing in this world...

666
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,460
that is more important than
his consort.

667
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,500
She's the future consort.

668
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,580
Future consort?

669
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,420
She is still not married
to His Highness?

670
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,620
His Highness has just brought
her back to his manor.

671
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,300
She doesn't have the title
as consort yet.

672
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,660
But Prince Li dotes on her a lot.

673
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,340
He always travels around
the world with her.

674
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,020
It has affected his work adversely.

675
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,500
Besides, His Highness listens to her.

676
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,100
Sometimes, he even discusses...

677
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,020
the government affairs
with her first...

678
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
and then, makes the decision.

679
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,540
What does a woman know?

680
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,660
Even I know about the
femme fatale theory.

681
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,660
His Highness is way smarter than I am.

682
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,740
How can he be seduced by her?

683
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,420
My fellow officials, Prince Li
can't attend this feast because...

684
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,620
Lady Rong Le is not well.

685
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,820
Please let the feast commence at once.

686
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,660
Let's celebrate General Luo's victory.

687
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,100
Sir Sun.

688
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,540
She is still fine yesterday.

689
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,620
How can she be ill today
all of the sudden?

690
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,940
Could it be that she doesn't wish
to meet General Luo?

691
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,100
It's understandable, I heard that
the mistress in Prince Li's Manor...

692
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,740
is a very talented,
gentle and virtuous lady.

693
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,140
Usually, she won't be seen with
unrefined person like you, General.

694
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,060
Although I'm from the poor,

695
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,020
I had bled and were
covered in wounds...

696
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,340
to help His Highness
secure this country.

697
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,340
Luo Army had rendered great services.

698
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,100
Even His Highness has
to show respect to me.

699
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,580
Now,

700
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,740
he is absent from this feast
because of a bewitching woman?

701
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,340
This is so absurd!

702
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,700
Who are you calling
a bewitching woman?

703
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,100
Who are you?

704
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,100
How dare you talk back
to your superior?

705
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,180
I am the captain of
Lady Rong Le's bodyguard.

706
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,380
I belong to her alone.

707
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,220
Talking back to my superior?

708
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,060
You are not my superior.
