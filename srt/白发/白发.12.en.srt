Episode 12

3
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:48,129
<i>Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,</i>

4
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,500
<i>shining bright and bring us light.</i>

5
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,220
<i>The Zhou kingdom has its age,</i>

6
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,879
<i>but the fate of nation
is yet to be known.</i>

7
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:13,888
Princess, what happened?
Are you all right?

8
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,094
I am fine.

9
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,903
Princess.

10
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,850
What are you searching for?

11
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:30,681
The poetry collection.

12
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:03,137
" The Book of Mountains and Rives "

13
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,197
Who is there?

14
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,465
After them!

15
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,305
Go on, I'll cover your escape.

16
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:19,915
Go on! Leave!

17
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,519
-Stop right there!
-After them!

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,358
Look, the lights are beautiful.

19
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,356
Man Yao.

20
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,460
Dear, let's go.

21
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,260
Sure.

22
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,780
What are you staring at?

23
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,510
-You are here.
-Sorry for the long wait.

24
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,346
I was thinking if you
come here tonight,

25
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,876
it means you agreed.

26
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,025
I'll wait as long as it takes.

27
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,980
Your Highness.

28
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,060
While you are here,
there is no need for formality.

29
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,426
Wu You.

30
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,180
Come with me.

31
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,531
-We can hang it here.
-Okay.

32
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,460
The scenery of the city
looks even more mesmerizing...

33
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,437
with all the lights and colours.

34
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,377
With different moods, the scenery...

35
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,091
will being a different vibe too.

36
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,137
You are right.

37
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:42,374
Lights and laughters are everywhere.

38
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:45,325
This is a wonderful time.

39
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,532
Why don't we write down
our wishes too?

40
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,879
Never mind.

41
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,557
I once thought making wish
is an act of foolishness.

42
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,141
I thought if I wish to have something,

43
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,300
I must work hard to get results.

44
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,418
But you are here right next to me,

45
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:24,457
I am worried for what
will become of us.

46
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:25,898
I feel like I am in a fantasy.

47
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,705
Maybe the will of heaven is the
only thing I can rely on now.

48
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:34,762
What if...

49
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,426
I let you down in the end?

50
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,048
I know you won't.

51
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,530
Come.

52
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,497
What did you write?

53
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:25,622
I am not telling you.

54
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:29,262
Fine, but I can tell you what I wrote.

55
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,573
What did you write?

56
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:33,646
A house full of children.

57
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:35,204
Nonsense.
Let me see it.

58
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:36,607
I am serious.

59
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,441
Man Yao!

60
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,580
I am glad you came out all right.

61
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,435
But I am surprised...

62
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,353
you are good at swimming.

63
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,785
I never told you I can't swim.

64
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:53,603
It was just your wild guess.

65
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,500
When are you going
to stop surprising me?

66
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:02,470
I got this.

67
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,729
We can barely see anything on it.

68
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,900
You actually kept it.

69
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,198
Of course.

70
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,999
Our most wonderful
memories are in there.

71
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,092
I hope it will remind you of me,

72
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,924
just as...

73
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,180
how this token...

74
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,125
reminds me of you.

75
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,012
Wu You.

76
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,830
I will cherish it.

77
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,161
Okay.

78
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,780
Okay, change into some dry clothes.

79
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,500
The breeze is strong at night.
You are drenched in water.

80
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,300
Don't catch a cold.

81
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,742
You should go home.

82
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:29,470
Very well.

83
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,454
I'll see you off.

84
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,466
I will be here tomorrow.

85
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,669
Goodbye.

86
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,611
Wu You.

87
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:54,414
Farewell.

88
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,820
Mistress.

89
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,380
Chen Yu, Wei.

90
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,281
I am here to bid you farewell.

91
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,816
There is another family business
that needs my attention.

92
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,180
I need to leave.

93
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,004
This is my parting gifts for you.

94
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,830
My lady,

95
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,340
please don't leave me behind.

96
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,153
I took a vow to follow you
for the rest of my life.

97
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,780
You can still stay in this teahouse.

98
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,809
Should you ever want to leave,

99
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,657
Long Yue will make the
arrangement for you.

100
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:48,970
Come on, get up.

101
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,411
This is the end of everything?

102
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,080
Do you really plan to...

103
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:19,395
hand over the book to His Majesty
and return to Western Qi?

104
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,620
Maybe you should think about yourself
and for Prince Li as well.

105
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,460
My sacrifice for Qi
is part of my duty.

106
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:40,056
But Your Highness shouldn't
sacrifice your happiness.

107
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,784
Both of us are doing this
for our nation.

108
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,933
People are suffering.

109
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,248
A little sorrow and tears
are nothing compared to that.

110
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,729
But do you really want
to leave Prince Li?

111
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,580
I can tell.

112
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,545
Prince Li is deeply in love with you.

113
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,416
You do care about Prince Li.

114
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,958
Since His Majesty can
get his hands on the book,

115
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,324
Your Highness' mission here is done.

116
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,409
Both you and Prince Li can
stay here and live happily ever after.

117
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:12,924
No.

118
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,032
I can no longer face him.

119
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,886
I have no other choice.

120
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,993
My brother and people
of Western Qi need the book.

121
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,098
This is the reason why I came here.

122
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:28,237
Maybe the two of us...

123
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,827
are destined to be separated.

124
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,182
Sometimes, I wish...

125
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,265
I am not the princess of Western Qi.

126
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,496
Officers, why do you come to
our teahouse at this late hour?

127
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:54,795
Which of your is Miss Man Yao?

128
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,340
-I am.
-Take her away.

129
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,231
Brother, what took you so long?

130
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,700
The guards said someone
sneaked into the house.

131
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,538
They even fought Leng Yan.

132
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,340
But they got away.

133
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:11,714
Bring Master Xin here.

134
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,034
Let's see if we can find
the secret entrance.

135
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,746
That old man?

136
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,281
Brother, let's forget about him.

137
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,440
Wu Yu.

138
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,100
Prince Li, a letter came
from Moon Embrace.

139
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,168
Miss Man Yao has been arrested
by Royal Guards.

140
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,296
Your Majesty, Miss Man Yao is here.

141
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,060
You are the owner of
Moon Embrace Teahouse?

142
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:44,330
Man Yao?

143
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,060
Your Majesty.

144
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,540
I am Man Yao.

145
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,940
Tell me.

146
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,105
What is your relation with Prince Li?

147
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,811
I have no relation with Prince Li.

148
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,312
-There is nothing between us.
-Father!

149
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

150
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,370
No relation at all?

151
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,740
If that is true, why would
Prince Li arrive here so soon?

152
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,597
Do you think I know nothing at all?

153
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:22,243
Wu You, you are impatient as always.

154
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,746
If you really care about this lady,

155
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,581
you shouldn't have come so quickly.

156
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,900
Let me see just how much
she means to you.

157
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Father, not everyone is
as cold-hearted as you.

158
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,818
How could one be so calculating
when it comes to love?

159
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,334
If there is no other matters,

160
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,614
I shall be on my way now.

161
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,858
Do you really think you can save her?

162
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:52,042
Father.

163
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,140
Did you really use her as
an excuse to summon me...

164
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:57,640
just to show me...

165
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,339
how you are going
take a helpless girl's life?

166
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,606
A son that knows me all too well.

167
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,958
You may take her with you today.

168
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,540
If you want her to live, it's simple.

169
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,869
Complete your wedding with
Princess Rong Le.

170
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,163
With that said, I will let her
become your second wife.

171
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,940
I don't need a second wife.

172
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
She is the only woman I'll ever marry.

173
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,389
I will marry no one other than her.

174
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,591
Besides, both Your Majesty
and I had a deal.

175
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,621
If I am able to find the Book of
Mountains and Rivers in six months,

176
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,900
Your Majesty will allow me
to decide for my own marriage...

177
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,613
and reinitiate the reformation.

178
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:38,801
The deadline is yet to come.

179
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,580
Is Your Majesty trying
to back out on our agreement?

180
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,237
Fine.

181
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,149
I will follow our agreement.

182
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,804
But before you find the book,

183
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,860
I am keeping this girl as hostage.

184
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,435
If you completed your end of the deal,

185
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,343
then everything shall go well.

186
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,446
Should you fail to do so,

187
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,767
I'll make sure to take her life.

188
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,647
What if I insist on
taking her with me?

189
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,435
I'll see you try.

190
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,449
-Wu You.
-Fear not.

191
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,312
I am taking you with me.

192
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,418
You have one more chance.

193
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,735
Marry the Princess of Western Qi...

194
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:37,759
or she will be dead.

195
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,940
After all these years,

196
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:48,394
I thought you know me well enough.

197
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,950
For my entire life,

198
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,660
I hate to be threatened.

199
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:57,158
I address you as my father...

200
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,624
because I still see you as such.

201
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,861
But if you choose to force my hand,

202
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,831
there will only be two outcomes.

203
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:09,357
One, she is leaving with me.

204
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,183
Two,

205
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,900
both she and I will die here.

206
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,900
You insolent child!

207
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:20,321
Is it worth it to lose your life
over a mere peasant girl?

208
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,032
That is up to me to decide.

209
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,237
You...

210
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,620
Your Majesty.

211
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,496
Your Majesty, Princess Rong Le
and the other officers...

212
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,118
have arrived at the main hall.

213
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,609
<i>Princess Rong Le?</i>

214
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:38,529
<i>Did my brother...</i>

215
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:39,985
Just in time.

216
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,540
I shall stand out today...

217
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,380
and settle it once and for all
with this Princess Rong Le.

218
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:47,570
Father, I want you to witness it.

219
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,582
Wu Yu, what is going on here?

220
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,663
I have no idea either.

221
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,739
Father summoned me here.

222
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,817
His Majesty and Emperor of Qi arrive!

223
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,338
At ease, my officers.

224
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:42,996
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,274
Take your seats.

226
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,415
Princess Rong Le arrives.

227
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,820
<i>Ling Yue?</i>

228
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,098
<i>No, she is not Ling Yue.</i>

229
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,140
<i>What is going on here?</i>

230
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,537
Greetings, My Lords.

231
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:48,962
<i>Not only is her figure same as mine,</i>

232
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,939
<i>even her voice is the same.</i>

233
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,507
At ease.

234
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,013
Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,700
Princess, have a seat.

236
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:04,612
Why did you turn the Princess down?

237
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,631
Is it because the rumours...

238
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,331
say she is ugly?

239
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,771
Man Yao, I made you a promise.

240
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,044
I will only ever marry you.

241
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,690
I only know today...

242
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,084
that you have an agreement
with His Majesty.

243
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,020
What if the time is up...

244
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,183
and you still can't find the book?

245
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,570
Do you need to follow
the order to marry her...

246
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,060
and give up on
reinitiating the reform?

247
00:22:32,294 --> 00:22:35,374
I assure you, I will find the book.

248
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,594
I will marry you.

249
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,500
What if you can't find it?

250
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,019
Even if I fail,

251
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,681
I will do anything to
make sure you are safe.

252
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,301
I will shield you from danger
for the rest of my life.

253
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:49,828
I give you my word.

254
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,253
Later,

255
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,248
with everyone here as witness,

256
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,196
I will reject the Princess.

257
00:22:58,485 --> 00:22:59,687
Clam down.

258
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,277
Princess Rong Le.

259
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:12,670
Before this, I gave you six months
to make your decision.

260
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,260
But Emperor of Qi hopes
that before he leaves,

261
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,063
the matter with your
marriage can be settled.

262
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,583
Which is why I summoned
all of you here.

263
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,913
Princess, you may use
this opportunity...

264
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,300
to pick your husband...

265
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,621
as both your brother and I
wish to see you happy.

266
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,140
May our alliance last
for generations to come.

267
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,117
Indeed.

268
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,900
I do wish to see my sister...

269
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,974
marry the love of her life.

270
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,231
Whoever that man may be,

271
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,412
as long as he is the one she loves,

272
00:23:44,705 --> 00:23:46,105
she will have my permission.

273
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,760
I give her my word.

274
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,255
Your Majesty is thoughtful.

275
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,183
I am grateful for the kind offer.

276
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,941
Princess Rong Le is
a reasonable person.

277
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,016
A role model for all ladies.

278
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:03,612
Princess, you may start
the selection now.

279
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,050
Listen closely.

280
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,138
Even if you marry me,
I am still going to the public house.

281
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,676
I will never obey you.

282
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,671
I thank you for the tea.

283
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,572
I am surprised as I am grateful.

284
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,870
General Fu is a hero of our land,

285
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,460
a man with great devotion
and contributions.

286
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,988
You and the Princess could
make the perfect couple.

287
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:12,314
Emperor of Qi, what do you think?

288
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,252
I shall respect the
decision of my sister.

289
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,691
Thank you, Your Majesty.

290
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:30,530
General Fu, heed my order.

291
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,329
Yes, Your Majesty.

292
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,538
General Fu Chou of
the Northern Realm...

293
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,746
and Princess Rong Le of Qi...

294
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:43,917
will complete their wedding
three days from now.

295
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,940
Order received, Your Majesty.

296
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,020
Hold on, General Fu.

297
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,501
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, General Fu.

298
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,874
We'll be sure to attend your wedding.

299
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,955
-Thank you, everyone.
-Congratulation.

300
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,105
Please.

301
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,830
I wonder where
Miss Man Yao is right now.

302
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,660
I was a little preoccupied just now.

303
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,505
I didn't get a chance to
greet her in person.

304
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,541
Do you wish to get her blessing?

305
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,207
She needs to return
to the Moon Embrace.

306
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,940
I have Wu Yu send her back.

307
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,740
General Fu, you have a fiancée.

308
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,003
I advise you to keep your distance
with Miss Man Yao.

309
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,330
Indeed, Prince Li.

310
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,829
Does Your Highness not plan
to give me your blessing?

311
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,647
Then I shall congratulate you.

312
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,316
You got what you want.

313
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,159
Thank you, Prince Li.

314
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,896
Prince Li.

315
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:55,928
His Majesty asked for Your Highness.

316
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,546
Now that the engagement with Qi...

317
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,459
-has come to an end.
-As for my love with Man Yao,

318
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,165
say no more.

319
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,954
From tomorrow on,

320
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,145
I will attend the
Imperial Court every day.

321
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,977
Wu You.

322
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:25,699
You finally came to your senses.

323
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,220
I knew it.

324
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,594
I knew you would
understand my effort.

325
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,659
Your ambition is for the country.

326
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,050
Mere love is simply insignificant.

327
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,740
I am going back to Imperial Court
because of Man Yao.

328
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,214
If you insist on
making it hard for her,

329
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,291
perhaps where my ambition lies...

330
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,250
is something you will
never understand.

331
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,980
Wu You.

332
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,540
I have never doubted your talent.

333
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:55,579
If you want to reinitiate
the reformation,

334
00:28:55,765 --> 00:28:58,125
as long as it doesn't interrupt
the campaign against Wei,

335
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,248
I give you the permission
to execute your plan.

336
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,626
You really mean it?

337
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:05,508
I am a man of my word.
You have my word.

338
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,960
Good.

339
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,830
I hope Your Majesty...

340
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,242
will never interfere with
my personal life again.

341
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:14,119
You shall witness the change
I bring with the reformation...

342
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,706
and reliaze a land of benevolence.

343
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:18,047
For the sake of Northern
Real's greatness,

344
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:21,045
I will give it my all to find
the Book of Mountains and Rivers.

345
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,290
We finally got this troublesome
engagement over with.

346
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,020
My nightmare has come to an end.

347
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,811
If it wasn't for my brother,

348
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,310
I would rather just charge
right to the House of Fragrance.

349
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:41,922
Then Your Highness may go now.

350
00:29:43,794 --> 00:29:46,468
Stop pretending.
I bet you are happy too.

351
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,884
By the way, I should
be congratulating you.

352
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,988
Your Highness, we are here.

353
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,584
Miss Man Yao, see you again.

354
00:29:59,627 --> 00:30:00,987
-Move out.
-Yes.

355
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,545
If Your Majesty hadn't planned
all of these,

356
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,281
there is no way I could become
the General of Defence...

357
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,840
of Northern Realm
in just a few years.

358
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,842
According to our agreement,
I will repay Your Majesty's help.

359
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:28,005
I held up to my end of the dead.

360
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,380
Rong Le will get married
just as we planned.

361
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:32,309
As for our next move,

362
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,138
it's all up to you.

363
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,660
<i>So, my brother had
this planned all along?</i>

364
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,748
<i>He let General Fu marry an imposter...</i>

365
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:41,834
<i>so I can return to my home
in Western Qi.</i>

366
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,873
I believe with your talent,

367
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:47,282
taking control of Northern Realm
is almost certain.

368
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,136
Whether it's about Miss Man Yao...

369
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:50,834
or the other plan,

370
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:52,618
Your Majesty can always count on me.

371
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,010
I hope that after I married
Miss Man Yao,

372
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,060
Your Majesty can continue
to support me.

373
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,139
I assure you, General Fu,
you have nothing to worry.

374
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,144
But someone could be listening to us.

375
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:05,886
In that case...

376
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,862
General Fu.

377
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,268
You knew who I am all this time?

378
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,337
Princess Rong Le.

379
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:21,703
Rong Le.

380
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,537
Mind your manner.

381
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,247
Xiao Sha, send General Fu
back to his manor.

382
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,660
Yes.

383
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:31,905
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

384
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:34,852
This way, please.

385
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:43,995
Brother.

386
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,496
I can't believe what I just heard.

387
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:48,557
Tell me the truth.

388
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:50,621
You want me to marry Fu Chou...

389
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,209
so you could overthrow
the Northern Realm's throne?

390
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,653
You even got a double ready.

391
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,169
If that double of mine
marries Fu Chou,

392
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,935
you can take me home with you?

393
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:00,339
Rong Le.

394
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,217
Enough of this tantrum.

395
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,700
I have made it clear
in the main hall today.

396
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,915
Princess Rong Le of Western Qi...

397
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:12,238
will be marrying General Fu Chou
of Northern Realm.

398
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,234
The wedding is three days from now.

399
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:16,149
How is this not real to you?

400
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,620
You even got an imposter
to pick a husband for me.

401
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,431
What else are you capable of?

402
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,460
Brother, I don't understand.

403
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:26,049
If your motive is to have me
married to Fu Chou,

404
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,240
why did you send me here
to look for the book?

405
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,580
How many of your vile plans
are waiting for me?

406
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,172
How dare you bring up the book!

407
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:36,806
Do you think I know none
of your secrets?

408
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,127
You might as well come clean to me.

409
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,918
You keep messing around
with Zongzheng Wu You,

410
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:43,634
what exactly do you want?

411
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,495
It's you.

412
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:57,688
Answer me.

413
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:01,525
Rong Le.

414
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,141
Have you ever thought
about your own mission?

415
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,972
Have you ever thought about...

416
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,651
the risk of compromising
your identity...

417
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:13,114
if you continue this relationship
with Prince Li?

418
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,081
When that happens,

419
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:16,903
not only will you lose the book,

420
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,180
you might also expose all the
Kite agents in Northern Realm.

421
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,701
Zongzheng Wu You is starting
to suspect you.

422
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,429
If he finds out you are
the real Princess Rong Le,

423
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,487
it won't end well for us.

424
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:35,681
I am doing this for you.

425
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,790
I have to make a change of plan.

426
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,941
But what I heard just now...

427
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:44,290
is that your plan has been
going on for years.

428
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,848
These are just part of your plan.

429
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,392
Today, the Princess chose her husband.

430
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,421
But I wasn't even told of your plan.

431
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:56,701
A double?

432
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,681
Why don't I know I have a double?

433
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,076
Her voice and figure are almost
the same as mine.

434
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,414
She was hand-picked for this task.
You took your time preparing this.

435
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:12,060
You waited years for this.

436
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:14,473
And you claim to be
doing this for me?

437
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:17,032
If you had followed my orders...

438
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,580
and didn't fall in love
with Zongzheng Wu You,

439
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,675
none of these would have happened.

440
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,189
Rong Le.

441
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:38,596
As long as you hand over the book,

442
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:40,406
I promise you,

443
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:43,228
a year after you marry General Fu,

444
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,300
I will bring you home to Western Qi.

445
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:46,907
A year?

446
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,194
Who knows what kind of wicked plan
you have for me after that?

447
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:53,896
What you say to me now...

448
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:57,202
are so confusing that I can't tell...

449
00:34:58,086 --> 00:34:59,473
which of them are lies.

450
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,600
Have you ever asked how I felt?

451
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:05,840
Have you ever asked me if
I am willing to be your pawn?

452
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,042
I will never believe
a word from you again.

453
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,180
Princess!

454
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:26,818
-Princess!
-Xiao Sha, stop!

455
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,937
Princess.

456
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,780
Ling Yue?

457
00:35:35,794 --> 00:35:37,154
Yes, Your Majesty.

458
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,689
What did you hear just now?

459
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:41,955
Nothing, I didn't hear anything.

460
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,282
I just saw the Princess run off.

461
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,462
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

462
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,020
Your Majesty, I'll bring her back.

463
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,933
-We can let her...
-Don't bother.

464
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,627
She will be back.

465
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,980
<i>Because you are the person
that cares for me the most.</i>

466
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,140
<i>You are the person
I trust the most.</i>

467
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:14,535
<i>Good sister.</i>

468
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,808
<i>I shall not disappoint
your trust in me.</i>

469
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,740
<i>Princess Rong Le of Qi...</i>

470
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:24,047
<i>will be marrying General Fu Chou
of Northern Realm.</i>

471
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:27,669
<i>If you hand over the book,</i>

472
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,918
<i>I will bring you home with me.</i>

473
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,740
<i>Lies.</i>

474
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:35,811
<i>These are all lies.</i>

475
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,431
Halt.

476
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:06,161
Captain Xiao came to the teahouse
and looked for you.

477
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,453
He was in a hurry.

478
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,460
It's like this is about
something urgent.

479
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,521
I don't know what happened...

480
00:37:22,093 --> 00:37:23,552
between you and your brother.

481
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,461
But, we should go back for now.

482
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,900
Standing here won't do us any help.

483
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,815
Your Highness, have some tea.

484
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:45,386
Long Yue.

485
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:48,063
Did you know...

486
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,372
he wants me to marry Fu Chou?

487
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,940
I only knew about this
a few moments ago.

488
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:57,103
If I had known this, I would have
let you be ready for it.

489
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,411
I believe you.

490
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:05,184
But I can't believe...

491
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:08,012
the brother that loves me the most...

492
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
is actually...

493
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:10,693
Your Highness.

494
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,993
I have known you for some time.

495
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:16,283
I know well enough
about your personality.

496
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,421
I thank you for saving me.
In my heart,

497
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:21,760
you are like a sister to me.

498
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,340
You can tell kindness from hatred.

499
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,683
You repay all those who helped you.

500
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,639
Same goes for His Majesty.

501
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,384
He is the first I trust...

502
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,580
after I woke up and lost my memories.

503
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:44,836
I never thought he would abandon me,
deceive me and set me up.

504
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,329
I am still struggling.

505
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,199
Should I hate him...

506
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,986
or should I trust him?

507
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,412
Princess.

508
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,540
Perhaps your brother has
his own reason to do so.
