00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,300
" Princess Silver "

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,820
Episode 42

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,220
Mother.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,540
Making them submit by force...

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,020
is of the worst plan.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,460
Although I can't say that
I'll be a sage,

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,300
I don't want to be a tyrant as well.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,500
Don't worry, mother.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,100
I've already make a vow.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,620
I'll make the people in Northern Realm
accept me wholeheartedly.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,620
One day soon,
I'll make all the officials...

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,740
pledge their allegiance to me
and swear their loyalty to me.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,260
Mother.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,300
After the issue with Ministry of Rites
dies down, I'll choose a good day...

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,660
for your coronation.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,500
In my heart,

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,580
you are as important as the nation.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,620
What is it?

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,260
Nothing.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,980
I'm just haven't slept very well.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,620
Recently,

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,300
I've been thinking
a lot about the past.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,820
I think...

24
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,060
I'll be better...

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,060
if I take a walk outside.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,340
Alright.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Chou.

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,020
It'll be the crown prince
death anniversary in a few days' time.

29
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,740
I want to go to the temple to pay
my respect and pray for good fortune.

30
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,900
I want to commemorate
the crown prince.

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,420
Chou.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,260
Sir Yang and the others have left.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,140
I think some of the officials in the
court is still dissatisfied with us.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,700
I want to commemorate
the crown prince...

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,820
as a way to win their support.

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,220
Besides, I can pray for
your good fortune as well.

37
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,900
Lately, for the past few days,

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,860
I've been dreaming about
crown prince who is covered in blood.

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,060
And I dreamt about that evil man,
Zongzheng Yun He.

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,500
Don't be afraid.

41
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,540
Don't be afraid, mother.
I'll go and take a look.

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,900
Alright.

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,780
You, stop right there.

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,300
Greetings, Young Master.
Please spare my life.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,220
What are you...

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,300
doing here?

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,540
Please spare my life.
I'm just following our master's order.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,140
Lin Shen?

49
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,580
-Where is he now?
-I don't know.

50
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,820
Half a year ago, he had
ordered me to stay here.

51
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,740
And after that, he never came back.

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,420
Please spare me. I'm just
following order to torture him.

53
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,340
I'm just following order.

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,220
Guards.

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,060
Please spare my life!

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,980
I'm just following order,
Your Highness.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,980
-Bring him away.
-Yes, Your Highness.

58
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,060
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,980
I'm just following orders,
Your Highness!

60
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,620
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
I remember that when I first saw you,

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,260
I felt that...

63
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,060
you are quite similar to
the younger me.

64
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,860
So, I've decided to...

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,500
break off this marriage.

66
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,260
End of discussion.

67
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,500
General Fu, you just need to write the
divorce letter as soon as possible.

68
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,300
In order to have the upper hand,

69
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,900
I've decided to attack them first.

70
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,820
And this time,
I'll lead the troops myself.

71
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,940
Get yourself prepared at once.

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,620
You'll come along with me
for the war in three days' time.

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,260
General, the mutiny is successful.

74
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,180
His Majesty is gone.

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,540
Father.

76
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,940
You are still alive.

77
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,260
Don't touch me.

78
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,100
Zongzheng Yun He.

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,180
Why are you here?

80
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,500
It's him.

81
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,780
It's him!

82
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,220
-Zongzheng Yun He!
-Mother!

83
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,620
-Don't arrest me!
-Don't be afraid, mother!

84
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,580
Don't be afraid, mother.

85
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,380
-No!
-Don't be afraid.

86
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,060
He won't be able to hurt you
with his condition right now.

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,100
He's going to play me for my feelings.

88
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
He's going to destroy
my father's country.

89
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,140
Because of Lady Yun, that wench,

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,220
he's going to give me to emperor
of Western Qi to be humiliated!

91
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,820
Emperor of Western Qi?

92
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,780
What do you mean by
emperor of Western Qi?

93
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,900
Your Highness.

94
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,340
Lady Fu suffers from acute anxiety.

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,460
She fainted because
she was too anxious.

96
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,180
It's not because of
a relapse in her hysteria.

97
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,780
But her body is very weak now.

98
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,660
Her previous illness might have
taken a toll on her health.

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,860
She needs to rest well and
nurse back her health.

100
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Senyan Palace is too damp and cold.

101
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,380
It's best if she stop
staying in this place.

102
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,100
Alright, I get it.
You may leave now.

103
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,300
Yes, Your Highness.

104
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,500
This way please.

105
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,820
Mother.

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,140
Chou.

107
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,900
Come.

108
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,660
No need to be too worried.

109
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,340
I'm fine.

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,260
It's just that...

111
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,740
It's just that when I saw him,

112
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,900
I couldn't control myself.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,780
I had lost my composure.

114
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,260
Zongzheng Yun He.

115
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,140
Where is he now?

116
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,860
In order to prevent news
from spreading,

117
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,460
he is still under lock and key
in the Eastern Palace.

118
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,620
Mother, no need to overtax yourself...

119
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,020
for a person like that.

120
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,140
Whenever I see him,

121
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,100
I'll be reminded of...

122
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,780
the humiliation that
I had suffered in the past.

123
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,220
I'll think about his evil doings.

124
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,980
And I'll think about
Creed of Vengeance.

125
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,980
Creed of Vengeance had
tortured me for 10 whole years.

126
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,700
That's why I went insane.

127
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm traumatised.

128
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Chou.

129
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,020
How did you get rid of
Creed of Vengeance?

130
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,500
I've already given my order...

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,700
to wipe out all members of the
Creed of Vengeance within the country.

132
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,700
What about Lin Shen?

133
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,820
Among all the members of the creed,
only Lin Shen and Hen...

134
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,060
Only Lin Shen is unaccounted for.

135
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,740
But don't worry.

136
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,220
I'll arrest him...

137
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,940
and bring him to you so that
you can mete out the punishment.

138
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,780
Mother.

139
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,700
Senyan Palace is too cold and damp.

140
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
How about you listen to me...

141
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,220
and move to the boiler room
to nurse back your health?

142
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,580
I insist on staying
in Senyan Palace...

143
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,340
as a reminder to myself
all the time...

144
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,140
so that I won't forget about
my past sufferings.

145
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,300
And it's to remind you...

146
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,420
so that you won't forget
about our vengeance.

147
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,380
I'll never forget about it.

148
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,060
Since you've never forgotten about it,

149
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,540
why haven't you launch
an attack on southern fringe...

150
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,220
to kill Zongzheng Wu You?

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,420
Don't ever forget. As long as...

152
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,260
the son of that wench is still
running rampant in this world,

153
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,740
it means that our revenge
is not over yet.

154
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,500
Chou.

155
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,220
I know.

156
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,460
You've done a lot of things.

157
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,460
It's just that...

158
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,220
one of them has gotten away scot-free.

159
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,220
Whenever I think about him,

160
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,900
I just can't take it.

161
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,540
-I will...
-Mother.

162
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,820
have no appetite...

163
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,980
and I can't sleep at night.

164
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,740
Don't worry, mother.
Zongzheng Wu You won't be able...

165
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,420
to live freely in southern fringe
for much longer. I'm just waiting.

166
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,060
I can't afford...

167
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,420
to wait anymore.

168
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,340
Mother.

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,740
How long will I...

170
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,300
be able to wait?

171
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,500
I had lived...

172
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,180
in darkness for so
many years and days...

173
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,980
until I'm plagued by illness.

174
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,220
Chou.

175
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
Tell me.

176
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,620
How much longer can I wait?

177
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,940
The royal physician
will help you recover.

178
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,540
You'll be able to live a long life.

179
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,740
Chou.

180
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,260
I heard that one year ago,

181
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,220
you worked with drive and sweep
and were very decisive.

182
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,900
But why are you like this now?

183
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,700
You are indecisive and
you are being so overcautious.

184
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,900
If you are like this,
how are you going to do great things?

185
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,700
How are you going to be
the master of the world?

186
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,460
Is there...

187
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,220
anything in southern fringe...

188
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,940
that is stopping you from going there?

189
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,820
There's nothing.

190
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,140
There's nothing worthwhile
for me there.

191
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,740
I have nothing anyway.

192
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,860
Mother, I'm the master...

193
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,460
of Northern Realm now.

194
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,660
No matter what I do,

195
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,540
I have to think of
the overall situation.

196
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,660
By the way, mother.

197
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,980
When we were in the Eastern Palace,

198
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,140
you mentioned about
emperor of Western Qi.

199
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,460
What is it?

200
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,300
My head is going to burst.

201
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,700
Here, slowly. This way.

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,060
It's alright. I'll be fine
after lying down for a bit.

203
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Mother,

204
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,900
rest well then.
I shall take my leave now.

205
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,060
" School of Wisdom "

206
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

207
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,300
Teacher.

208
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,580
What is your reason...

209
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,580
for summoning me to come here?

210
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,100
Please have a seat.

211
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,980
There's a difference between
royalty and his subjects.

212
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,900
Even if we are in a school,

213
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,140
I can't possible sit above you.

214
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,660
A teacher for a day is
a father for a lifetime.

215
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,340
No need to be so modest.

216
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,940
Alright then.

217
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,100
Natural endowment is called character.

218
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,300
Following your character
is called principle.

219
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,060
Nurturing yourself according
to principle is called teachings.

220
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,700
You can't go against your principle.

221
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,220
If you do, then it's not principle.

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,020
You summoned me here today just to...

223
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,900
recite the rudimentary passage
you had learnt when you were young?

224
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,780
Teacher.

225
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,940
You had taught me...

226
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,900
this rudimentary passage
personally back then.

227
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,180
Yes.

228
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,060
Back then, I didn't know that...

229
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,980
you had already learnt about the
Four Books and Five Classics.

230
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,460
That ended up with me testing you
with such simple thing.

231
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,260
Not only you are
smarter than the others,

232
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,100
you are very humble and polite.

233
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,740
You even told me that
the art of studying is that...

234
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,460
you'll always learn something new.

235
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,460
You told me that it's interesting
to revise on old books.

236
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,540
Back then, after my mother
and my teacher passed away,

237
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,500
I had become naughty,
unruly, arrogant,

238
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,300
stubborn and eccentric.

239
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,980
Everybody in the court treated me
like a troublesome kid.

240
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,580
All of them stayed away from me.

241
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,620
But you were to only one who had...

242
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,380
offered to be my teacher.

243
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,420
You taught me and you
brought me up to become a man.

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,820
Back then, I was very rude to others.

245
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,260
But to you,

246
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,060
I was truly grateful to you
and I respected you.

247
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm overwhelmed with
your compliments.

248
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,260
I knew that being naughty and unruly
is not in your nature.

249
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,060
I knew that you are
gifted and brilliant.

250
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,420
You just needed to be polished
and you'll be a great man.

251
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,860
-What's your definition of great man?
-A great man...

252
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,580
is of course the chosen one
who can bear the important duties.

253
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,180
A master of the world
who can save the people.

254
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,300
You could already tell that...

255
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,660
I'll be able to become the master
of the world one day?

256
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,140
Of course.

257
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,260
Although there was a minor setback
because of Fu Chou,

258
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,860
given time,

259
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,780
you'll be able to rule the world.

260
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,340
I would like to ask you.

261
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,900
Were you hoping to teach me how
to become the master of the world...

262
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,300
or you chose to teach me...

263
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,780
because I can be
the master of the world?

264
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,940
I don't understand what you mean.

265
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Are you going to make me
walk the path that you've chosen...

266
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,820
or no matter what path I chose,

267
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,860
you'll still help and follow me along
with all your might?

268
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,380
Let's put it like this.

269
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,340
If our political views are at odds,

270
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,980
are you going to
choose another person...

271
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,020
and throw away this student?

272
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,620
Just as you had said just now.

273
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,460
A teacher for a day is
a father for a lifetime.

274
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,340
I won't desert you.

275
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,820
But I'm afraid that your wings
have hardened.

276
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,820
And sooner or later,
you'll abandon me.

277
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,620
You can't go against your principle.

278
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,300
If you do, then it's not principle.

279
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,340
I'm still willing to address you
as my teacher today...

280
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,420
because I'm grateful to you
for setting me on the right path.

281
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,460
But if you insist on
running counter to me,

282
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,140
you'll be deserting your principle,
the Sun family and Northern Realm.

283
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,780
Your Highness.

284
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,100
I was just joking with you just now.

285
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,260
Recently, Ya Li has told me that...

286
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,860
you were too busy with work...

287
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,580
until you are so tense.

288
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
I do hope that it is just a joke.

289
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,060
I remember that when you
taught me back then,

290
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,180
you always joked that...

291
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,220
if I didn't study well,

292
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,380
you'll retire and go back
to your hometown...

293
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,740
to live a simple life as a farmer.

294
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,180
There's a residence
with a field in Yi.

295
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,220
The lands are lush and it's surrounded
by mountains and water.

296
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,860
It's a very good place to
live in seclusion after retirement.

297
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,660
If you are still...

298
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,940
interested in that,

299
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,140
you can always go there
to live a life that like.

300
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,180
Now, it's still...

301
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,660
not too late to do that.

302
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,820
Although I'm already getting old,

303
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,700
I still have great aspiration.

304
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,700
Living in seclusion...

305
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,500
is the work of a coward.

306
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,780
In this life,

307
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,620
I rather die in the court...

308
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,900
than living a life of
degradation in the wild.

309
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,420
Your Highness.

310
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,540
No need to be so serious
about my joking remarks back then.

311
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,420
So, after all these years,

312
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,420
I have never once understood you.

313
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,140
And you have never once understood me.

314
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,620
After paying my respect today, we will
no longer be teacher and student.

315
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,900
From now on, there will be only
a royalty and his subject.

316
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,780
Let me remind you once again.

317
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,820
If you take one more step forward,

318
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,340
there will be no coming back for you.

319
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,980
" Retreat "

320
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,740
Usually, when you play chess
with Princess Rong Le,

321
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,540
who is the more frequent winner?

322
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,500
Of course it's her.

323
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,780
You are so hesitant.
Of course you'll lose to her.

324
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,340
Ya Li.

325
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,420
The arrow is already being notched.

326
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,180
If you are not ruthless
and firm enough,

327
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,980
how can you win her?

328
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,780
If you are always so hesitant,

329
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,900
you'll suffer a crushing defeat.

330
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,100
And you won't be able
to turn the table.

331
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,420
You have indeed outmatched me.

332
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,860
I've lost.

333
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,140
But I won't lose again and again.

334
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,140
I've lost once.

335
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,620
I won't lose again.

336
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,260
Life is just like chess.
We achieve victory by taking risk.

337
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,980
If you want to win,

338
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,140
fight with all you've got.

339
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,180
Those who achieve great things
will always press on steadily.

340
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,540
They won't leave a leeway
to their opponents.

341
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,980
Although it's risky,

342
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,300
you'll be able to give a fatal blow.

343
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,820
Please guide me, father.

344
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,500
I heard that you've been giving
the calming incense to His Highness.

345
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,660
So many rumours are flying around.

346
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,020
But His Highness is still so at ease.

347
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,740
Isn't it...

348
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,020
the effect of the calming incense?

349
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,540
If you act first,

350
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,020
it's possible that...

351
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,260
you'll be able to
turn the table around.

352
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,380
Please have some rest.

353
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,740
We've been back from
Youji Mountain for so many days.

354
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,020
And you've been working
without sleeping or eating.

355
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,860
Blood Raven Roots is a magical herb.

356
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,780
It won't be so easy to find
something to replace it.

357
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,860
But as long as I can't find
the Blood Raven Roots,

358
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,220
I won't have the guts
to face Princess Rong Le.

359
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,700
And you've promised me...

360
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,380
not to tell Wu You about
the Blood Raven Roots.

361
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,140
I know.

362
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,020
Luckily I didn't tell him before.

363
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,860
But Wu You is so smart.

364
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,500
He will find out eventually.

365
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,060
I remembered.

366
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,420
When we first reached Qingzhou,
he had asked me for a rare herb.

367
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,180
Rare herb?

368
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,860
-What...
-Ke!

369
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,020
Ke!

370
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,700
-What happened?
-Please take a look at her.

371
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,420
When Miss Sun came to the manor
to pay a visit to Princess Rong Le,

372
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,780
we don't know why,
but she fainted suddenly.

373
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,020
Have a seat.

374
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,060
-This...
-What happened?

375
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,900
It's not a serious illness.

376
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,500
She just thinks too much
and it disturbs her vital energy.

377
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,940
But normally,

378
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,820
she won't faint because of it.

379
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,300
Sorry to trouble you, Miss Xiao Ke.

380
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,940
I don't think that it's
a big deal as well.

381
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,380
But Lady Rong Le insisted
to let you have a look at me...

382
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,900
in order to assure her.

383
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,940
Sorry to trouble you.

384
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,660
I think that it's not appropriate
for me to stay in the manor.

385
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,140
I'll go back now.

386
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,860
-Lie down.
-Help her to lie down.

387
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,980
Miss Sun is too weak.

388
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,980
And it's late already.

389
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,940
I don't feel at ease for her
to go back now.

390
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,860
Princess Rong Le will feel
apologetic as well.

391
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,020
I still have some work
to do in the manor.

392
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,620
Can you please take care of Miss Sun?

393
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,100
I'll do as the princess says.

394
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,780
A man shouldn't be in here with
two women. You have to leave now.

395
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,740
-Go.
-I'm just trying to help.

396
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,780
Don't push me.

397
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,620
" Lingyun Pavilion "

398
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,660
Your Highness,
it's time for the morning court.

399
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,420
Please wake up and change your attire.

400
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,460
Your Highness.

401
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,540
Yesterday night...

402
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,820
Did you see that?

403
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,380
Why is Miss Sun here?
And she's not properly dressed.

404
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,820
Miss.

405
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,220
Why aren't you dressing properly
in the reading room?

406
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,220
Are you trying to practise
some martial arts?

407
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,660
Princess, what's wrong?

408
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,860
It has been such a long time.

409
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,340
But I still can't get used
to the way I look...

410
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,180
when I look at myself.

411
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,380
Princess.

412
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,820
It's just some silver hair.

413
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
You are still the most
beautiful lady in this manor...

414
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,220
No, you are the prettiest lady
in Qingzhou.

415
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,260
Even Miss Sun is not your match.

416
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,660
If you don't like to see yourself
in the mirror, let's not use it then.

417
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,660
You are talking sweet to me again.

418
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,300
I am not upset because of Ya Li.

419
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,260
Moreover, in this world,

420
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,740
there's nothing that can preserve
one's beauty and youth forever.

421
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,900
Ke has such outstanding master.

422
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,340
But even she can't do it.

423
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,980
I just never thought that...

424
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,620
there will be a day...

425
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,620
where my looks...

426
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,940
will become a weapon
used by others to hurt Wu You.

427
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,740
Provincial governor of Qingzhou,
Sir Sun Ji Zhou is here...

428
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,420
to see you with her daughter, Ya Li.

429
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,900
So early.

430
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,780
Please tell Sir Sun that...

431
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,500
I won't be able to meet him now
because I'm not properly dressed yet.

432
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,860
Ask him to wait for me at the garden.
I'll meet him in a while.

433
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,300
-Yes, Princess.
-Princess.

434
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,900
It's better if you don't meet him.

435
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,460
Why?

436
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,900
Please stop, Sir Sun.

437
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,380
Princess.

438
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Princess...

439
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,220
Sir Sun.

440
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,620
You may leave now.

441
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,300
I'm sorry for not being
properly dressed.

442
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,420
Lady Rong Le,
it's me who should be sorry.

443
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,820
Kneel.

444
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,780
What do you mean by this, Sir Sun?

445
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,020
Lady Rong Le.

446
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,820
His Highness had favoured
Ya Li last night.

447
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,740
We didn't get to
inform you beforehand.

448
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,820
So, we are here to apologise.

449
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,060
You knew about this too?

450
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,060
Princess, Ke told me about it.

451
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,740
This morning, when the maidservants...

452
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,820
went to get His Highness
to attend the morning court,

453
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,220
They saw Miss Sun lying on top
of His Highness's bed.

454
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,820
I saw that you didn't
sleep well last night.

455
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,260
I didn't dare to disturb you. So I...

456
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,740
So, all the people in the manor
knew about it...

457
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,260
except me who's still in the dark.

458
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,420
Who had asked you to keep it from me?

459
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,980
Of course it's His Highness's order.

460
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,180
I know that you and His Highness
love each other very much.

461
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,060
But what is done cannot be undone.

462
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,980
Ya Li has lived a rough life
full of ups and downs.

463
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,180
Fortunately, His Highness favours her.

464
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,380
I hope that you can be magnanimous...

465
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,140
and accept Ya Li into the manor...

466
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
to serve His Highness
together with you.

467
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,660
And both of you can provide heirs for
His Highness to continue his legacy.

468
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,820
Ya Li.

469
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,660
What happened?

470
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,860
I want you to tell me.

471
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,340
What has been done
cannot be undone now.

472
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,180
His Highness and Ya Li have
known each other for very long.

473
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,860
They had done something wrong
in the moment of passion.

474
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,540
It's Ya Li's fault for not
coming clean to you on time.

475
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,980
But this is about
my daughter's reputation.

476
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,100
I have no choice but to humble myself
to ask for your help.

477
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,540
Please give them your blessing.

478
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,700
I don't agree.

479
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,500
I don't agree to let her in
to this manor...

480
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,420
and serve the same husband with me.

481
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,060
You don't believe it?

482
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,540
I only believe in Wu You.

483
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,300
I've put down my pride to beg you.

484
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,260
But you are not willing to
show me any respect at all?

485
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,580
Don't you think you are too
arrogant and selfish?

486
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,420
Since the beginning of time,
all emperors have a harem.

487
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,300
None of them are loyal to only one.

488
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,580
Sir Sun, since you address me
as Lady Rong Le,

489
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,420
you should know that...

490
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,420
in this manor,

491
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,060
besides His Highness,

492
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
nobody can make the decision for me.

493
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,260
Even if it's His Highness,

494
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,380
before I know about the truth,

495
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,100
I will believe that his heart
has never wavered.

496
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,260
And I will never betray the promise
that I had made with him.

497
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,740
I'm very pleased...

498
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,420
with your statement.

499
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,300
I think you've gotten...

500
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,460
some things wrong, Sir Sun.

501
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,020
Am I right?

502
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,660
Since you are so confident about it,

503
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,700
I won't disturb both of you
any longer.

504
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,580
But I want to remind you.

505
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,260
Your marriage is not something
you can decide by yourself.

506
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,740
It will affect the situation
in this southern fringe.

507
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,540
If you shake the foundation of
this nation for the same woman again,

508
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,900
I won't be able to control
whether or not...

509
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,140
the people of Northern Realm
will continue to believe in you.

510
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,020
Thank you for your reminder.

511
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,340
Let's go.

512
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,060
Ling Yue, you may leave first.

513
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
Yes, Your Highness.

514
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,700
Why did you come here suddenly?

515
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,940
Are you feeling guilty?

516
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,780
Are you afraid that I won't trust you?

517
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,420
When I heard about
what you said just now,

518
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,580
I knew that our hearts beat as one.

519
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,660
There's nothing that can shake us.

520
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,820
Looks like Sir Sun...

521
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,780
has cut off all means of retreat...

522
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,060
-to fight until his last breath.
-Man Yao.

523
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,220
No need to trouble yourself
with it anymore.

524
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,980
Just leave everything to me.

525
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,540
This is...

526
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,180
Do you still remember the time
we act like others...

527
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,100
to write down our wishes...

528
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,580
when we attended the
Lantern Festival in Zhongshan?

529
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,460
We hung our wishes
on the interlocked trees.

530
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,780
I remember.

531
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,940
Back then, you lied to me about
you wishing to have many children.

532
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,660
Then, that paper had disintegrated
because it fell into the water.

533
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,740
I don't even know
what you wrote on it.

534
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,460
Come. Open it up
and read for yourself.

535
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,660
This is what I wished for back then.

536
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,300
And my wishes have come true.

537
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,780
I wish for no other except one.

538
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,020
I wish to grow old with her
and never be apart.

539
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,420
Do you know what I wrote back then?

540
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,620
I've made a lot of wrong turns,

541
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,380
but I wish to gaze
at him for eternity.

542
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,060
<i>I have gone through life...</i>

543
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,300
<i>in one day's time.</i>

544
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,860
<i>And you are still the only one
I'm waiting for.</i>

545
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,100
<i>Although there are a lot to take in,</i>

546
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,180
<i>I don't want to live in regret.</i>

547
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:04,100
<i>Because of this love,
I have found my happiness again.</i>

548
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,300
" Man Yin Chamber "

549
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,060
<i>Man Yao.</i>

550
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,940
<i>You've suffered so much because of me.</i>

551
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,620
<i>And now,</i>

552
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,380
<i>you are criticised
for your silver hair.</i>

553
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,660
<i>When we came to Qingzhou,
I told you that...</i>

554
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,500
<i>from now on,</i>

555
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,340
<i>you just need to rely on me alone.</i>

556
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,860
<i>I will not...</i>

557
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,820
<i>let anyone hurt you anymore.</i>

558
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,180
<i>Although there are a lot to take in,</i>

559
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,140
<i>I don't want to live in regret.</i>

560
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:53,380
<i>Because of this love,
I have found my happiness again.</i>

561
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,300
<i>No matter what,</i>

562
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,500
<i>we won't be apart.</i>

563
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,980
Who are you? Who sent you?

564
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,780
We are just normal robbers.

565
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,580
We just robbed you
when you were on your way home.

566
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,220
And then, we'll burn you to death.

567
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,180
Even if they investigate about it,
this is all they will get.

568
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,740
If you are normal robbers,

569
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,620
you'll just kill me.

570
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,140
Why did you put in
so much effort to torture me...

571
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,940
-before killing me off?
-No wonder he was an official.

572
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,420
So smart.

573
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,940
Sir Yang, we got orders
from the top...

574
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,820
to burn you to death.

575
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,620
We are just following orders.

576
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,540
You have suffered enough.

577
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,300
You may die in peace now.

578
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,940
Fire?

579
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,260
So, it's her.

580
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,100
Fu Yuan!

581
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,900
The evil wench!

582
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,140
She'll bring ruins to the
country and the people!

583
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,940
The country is going to fall soon!

584
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,780
The country is going to fall soon!

585
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,660
What is it?

586
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,460
You have a nightmare again?

587
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,300
Did you...

588
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,620
dream about me again?

589
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,740
The raging flames in Senyan Palace.

590
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,220
My bloodcurdling scream in the fire.

591
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,060
I'll dream about it...

592
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,380
every night.

593
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,300
Every night,

594
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,020
I'll have to experience the
same pain again and again.

595
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,140
It's all because of you!

596
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,140
But don't worry.

597
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,460
My plan...

598
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,540
is going on very smoothly.

599
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,660
For the past year,

600
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,900
I had acted like a crazy woman.

601
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,100
I've made Chou feels
very guilty towards me.

602
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,700
Because of what I said, for me, he had
exterminated the Creed of Vengeance.

603
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,420
He had freed me from Lin Shen's
control and nagging.

604
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,700
I have kept you alive...

605
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,340
because I want to let you watch...

606
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,780
while two brothers fight to death
with each other.

607
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,260
Don't forget.

608
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,340
Back then,

609
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,740
you had forced the poison
into me just like this.

610
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,860
And you let the scoundrel,
that emperor of Western Qi...

611
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,940
When you ruined my life forever,

612
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,940
you should have known that
you'll be getting what you deserve.

613
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,020
Your Highness.

614
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,540
Come in.

615
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,740
Greetings, Your Highness.

616
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,420
By the way,

617
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm going to leave Zhongshan...

618
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,740
to do something...

619
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,140
that I should have done
a long time ago.

620
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,700
Your Highness.

621
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,500
How can you risk yourself
by leaving Zhongshan?

622
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,740
How about you let me do it for you...

623
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,780
or let me escort you...

624
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,140
-so that I can protect you?
-Chang Jian!

625
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,980
Your Highness.

626
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,260
Are you trying to control me as well?

627
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,820
I wouldn't dare.

628
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,180
Place a substitute of me...

629
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,140
in my bed chamber.

630
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,540
Tell others that I can't attend court
because I am ill.

631
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
As for other important tasks
in the court,

632
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,700
you'll take care of it in my stead.

633
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,980
Remember.

634
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,380
The important thing now
is to gain the officials' trust.

635
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,860
Yes.

636
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,100
As for my mother,

637
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,780
don't tell her first.

638
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,980
I'll come back in half a month's time.

639
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,180
-Yes, Your Highness.
-You may leave now.
