Episode 17

3
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,653
All I ever do...

4
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:41,785
was to look at you from distance.

5
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,532
Every month, I will sew one
of these fragrance pouches.

6
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:49,814
I could only hide my thoughts
inside these needle works.

7
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,020
-Miss Sun.
-Please, hear me out.

8
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,370
I am afraid if I don't speak now,

9
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,682
I could never muster
the courage again.

10
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:01,911
As long as you are
willing to accept me,

11
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,606
I won't go to the south.

12
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:07,229
From now on,

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,160
wherever you go, I shall follow.

14
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,967
I appreciate your caring, but...

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,202
I am an married man.

16
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,088
I can't promise you anything.

17
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,825
My father wants to trade me
for the glory of our family.

18
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:28,065
But I don't care about that.

19
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,912
I can be your second wife,

20
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:33,588
your servant,

21
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,837
as long as I can be with you,

22
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,832
I am willing to do anything.

23
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,278
Miss Sun, you have a
bright future ahead of you.

24
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,955
What you are asking now...

25
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,880
is meaningless.

26
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,194
General Fu!

27
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,511
Miss Sun.

28
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,341
Your kindness...

29
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,677
is more than I deserve.

30
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,299
I will forget about
what happened today.

31
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,542
I hope you do the same.

32
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,033
General Fu, please stay!

33
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:11,519
Please, don't go.

34
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,380
Goodbye.

35
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,498
We bid Your Majesty farewell.

36
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,235
At ease.

37
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:54,611
Take your seats.

38
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,688
Father, your chair is terrible.

39
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,260
There is not even a cushion on it.

40
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,269
We are in the Royal Study,
this is simply unsightly.

41
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,889
Brother is still having wounds
from all the beatings.

42
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:25,376
-Bring me the golden silk cushion.
-Yes.

43
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:26,852
Never mind.

44
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,902
Wu You.

45
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,529
No matter how much you hate me,

46
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,776
you must still take care of yourself.

47
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,005
Thank you for the concern.

48
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,291
My wounds are almost healed.

49
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,309
But speaking of Your Majesty,
there are much works to do.

50
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:42,756
You being well...

51
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,964
is what's best for our country.

52
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:49,680
Your Highness.

53
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,777
You...

54
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,193
should get everything
settled in the south.

55
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,212
After it's done, come back here
and help me out.

56
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:10,300
Otherwise I have to spend
the nights in this study.

57
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,106
Father, if you said you spent all
your time in the harem,

58
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,420
Wu You would never
come back to help you.

59
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,487
Nonsense.

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,722
Father, you are the
ruler of this country.

61
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,388
You can't be so temperamental.

62
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,056
Even if you toss this scroll at me,
you still need to sign it.

63
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,076
Wu You.

64
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,567
I understand, because of
Fu Yuan's wrong doings,

65
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,507
you hated me for years.

66
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,977
I will not justify my actions.

67
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,798
I let your mother down.

68
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,762
Back in the days,

69
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:57,075
I focused on
strengthening this nation,

70
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,130
I had a great vision.

71
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,460
I thought that giving up on love
for a moment...

72
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,907
will allow me a chance
to make up for it later on.

73
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,231
But in the end,

74
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,346
Right, Wu You also said that
you are no longer a young man.

75
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,060
But you still put in so much
efforts to save our necks.

76
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,298
Now that we are leaving you,

77
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,828
we feel sorry for not being able
to repay you as your sons.

78
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,265
Father, take care of yourself
and live well.

79
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:26,546
Enough of your nonsense.

80
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,652
That is not what
your brother would say.

81
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,819
Speaking of you,

82
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,319
stop making me any more troubles.

83
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,860
Learn to grow up.

84
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,589
That is how I can live long and well.

85
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,699
I am sorry for interrupting,

86
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,220
but His Majesty did all he could
because of Prince Li's case.

87
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,863
His Majesty ordered
the Supreme Court...

88
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,555
to catch the real culprit
that caused the commotion...

89
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:51,180
so you may be proved innocent.

90
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,140
You knew I was wronged all along?

91
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,298
Why did you choose
to send us to the south then?

92
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,020
It's good if you spend
some time to clear the mind.

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,820
I...

94
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,958
sacrificed my love.

95
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,709
I spent my whole life for war...

96
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,403
to build the nation
that we have today.

97
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:20,903
I do hold some guilt for you,

98
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:22,747
but I have no regret.

99
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:26,162
I am willing to leave the people...

100
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:29,522
in the capable hands
of someone capable.

101
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:33,075
Only then can I...

102
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,471
face your mother in the afterlife.

103
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:41,798
-General Fu.
-Please inform His Majesty that...

104
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,501
I am here with my wife to thank him
for granting this marriage.

105
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,011
A moment, please.

106
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,107
See? It's that shameless woman.

107
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,513
Prince Li gave up on her,

108
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,555
she disguised herself
to crawl into his bed!

109
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,100
What a shameless woman.
And now she is marrying General Fu.

110
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:01,214
You are right.
If it wasn't for her,

111
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,617
Prince Li wouldn't have been
exiled to Qingzhou.

112
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:06,602
Just ignore what the people say.

113
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,144
You only need to listen to me.

114
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,020
Congratulation on your wedding.

115
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:30,423
Husband and wife,
such an envious sight.

116
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,399
Thank you, Your Highness.

117
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,401
I heard you are leaving.

118
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,102
I wish both of you a safe journey.

119
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,817
Greetings, Prince Chen.

120
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:46,709
Greetings, Prince Li.

121
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,123
Wu Yu, let's go.

122
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,973
Sir Sun, Miss Ya Li.

123
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,638
We are leaving for Qingzhou.

124
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,143
Let's say your goodbye
to General Fu and his wife.

125
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,140
Congratulations on your wedding.

126
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,215
Congratulations to you too, Sir Sun.

127
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,780
Once we arrived in Qingzhou,

128
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,811
it will be time to set everything
in place for Wu You's wedding.

129
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:13,811
Prince Chen, this is not a joke.

130
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,811
Congratulation to Prince Li.

131
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,265
And for you too, Miss Sun.

132
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,223
General, His Majesty
is a little unwell.

133
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,346
You and your wife may leave now.

134
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,170
There is no need to express
your gratitude again.

135
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,569
Thank you, Sir.

136
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,282
Let's go.

137
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,849
Look, isn't this the sedan
of General Fu?

138
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:57,225
I heard the General married
a shameless woman.

139
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,725
Right! Why would he
marry such a lady?

140
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,314
Shameless!

141
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,556
Stop spreading rumours
or you will be arrested.

142
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,116
Stop it, stand aside!

143
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,900
-Evil woman! Eat this!
-Stop throwing rocks!

144
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,700
Do not be bothered by these people.

145
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:14,542
Since you married me...

146
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:17,644
They are just kids.

147
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,119
I don't mind them at all.

148
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,420
Why didn't you go to
the Tranquil Garden?

149
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,138
I have other matters to see to.

150
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,342
I have some questions for you.

151
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,658
What questions do you have for me?

152
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,580
I will tell you everything I could
if I have the answers.

153
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,629
Why did you make him leave?

154
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,500
Something as risky as causing
a mess in the city...

155
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,127
is not what he would do.

156
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:23,962
Was that your doing?

157
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,980
His Majesty refused to meet us.

158
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,866
Perhaps he already knew.

159
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:33,862
You are accusing me
without any proof?

160
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,395
Sometimes I feel like...

161
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,602
you share quite a lot
of similarities with our Emperor.

162
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,054
No matter what crime
Prince Li commits,

163
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,580
how many people he hurts,

164
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,503
all you ever care about is him.

165
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,322
You never...

166
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,484
had any trust in me.

167
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,440
Rong Le.

168
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,332
You need to understand that
I am your husband.

169
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,509
If it wasn't your doing,

170
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,901
why did you keep it a secret from me?

171
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:05,727
Why wouldn't I keep it from you?

172
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,978
An outsider's life and death...

173
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,561
have nothing to do with any of us.

174
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:16,319
Do you honestly think
I will tell you the truth...

175
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,165
and watch as my own wife...

176
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,940
get worried because
of a mere outsider...

177
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:23,825
and feel guilty for it?

178
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,719
His life has nothing to do with me.

179
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:29,849
However,

180
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,815
whatever way you choose
to question me,

181
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:34,265
I'll take it as...

182
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:38,001
a start for building trust
between the two of us.

183
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,540
From now on,

184
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,316
if there is any secret
you wish to know,

185
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,014
you can come to me.

186
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,205
I will tell you all you want.
Don't draw your own conclusions.

187
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,338
Of course,

188
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,547
I do wish for a day...

189
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,637
when you can put your trust in me.

190
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:55,423
I don't need to.

191
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,139
Rong Le, sooner or later,

192
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,385
you will realise that...

193
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,772
I am the one that truly cares for you.

194
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:19,430
Ya Li,

195
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,126
now that you are leaving for Qingzhou,

196
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,026
I don't even have
a friend I can talk to.

197
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,111
Ya Li.

198
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,127
Ya Li?

199
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,300
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

200
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,180
When I realise I am leaving you,

201
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,056
I feel sad and thus
a little absent-minded.

202
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,380
I hope Your Majesty is not
offended by my behaviour.

203
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:44,971
Ya Li, you have both
beauty and intelligent.

204
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,553
It would be great if you
were my daughter.

205
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,261
What a shame.

206
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:52,969
If Your Majesty wants me to stay,
then I won't leave for Qingzhou.

207
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:56,426
I shall join you and carry out
my duty as your daughter.

208
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,555
Ya Li.

209
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,008
Your Majesty.

210
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,020
Ya Li.

211
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,820
This is more than I can
decide for myself.

212
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,690
You are your father's only daughter.

213
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,740
If I were to keep you in here,

214
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:10,972
how do I explain to him?

215
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,515
We have no other relatives
in Qingzhou.

216
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,681
My father has his servants.

217
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,394
Your Majesty, please let me stay.

218
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:19,680
Ya Li.

219
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,293
When did you learn to be so stubborn?

220
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:26,090
His Majesty sent you
and your father to aid Prince Li.

221
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:28,727
Wu You may have lost his status,

222
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,929
but we can see from
His Majesty's decision...

223
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,620
that he plans to let Wu You
return later on.

224
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:38,244
Ya Li, when your mother passed away,

225
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,102
she mentioned so many times
about finding you a good husband.

226
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,340
Your Majesty, I don't
want to get married.

227
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,138
I just want to be with you.

228
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,460
Nonsense.

229
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,298
I put so much effort into
guiding you and care for you,

230
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,340
do you think I did so
to make you my servant?

231
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,072
Your Majesty.

232
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:58,231
I have no child to care for me.

233
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:02,574
The Crown Prince is unreliable.

234
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,718
Wu You is far more
benevolent than he is.

235
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,780
Seeing that you and Wu You
are childhood friends,

236
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,471
if you do become his consort one day,

237
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,866
or even become the Empress like me,

238
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:15,158
I can rely on you.

239
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,143
After His Majesty passed on,

240
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,054
I would still have you
to look after me.

241
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,345
If you still remember
my kindness to you,

242
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,420
please do what is right.

243
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,060
The world is like a game of chess.

244
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:41,950
Everything changes so easily.

245
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,072
Love and hatred,

246
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:47,781
complicated and convoluted.

247
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,111
I thought I am the master
of this game.

248
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,909
But I must ask myself...

249
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,983
if I had become...

250
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:03,091
a mere pawn in the hand of destiny.

251
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:15,882
Brother Wu You.

252
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,861
Stop thinking about that vile woman.

253
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,330
She lied to you with cruelty.

254
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,445
I thought I got myself a good sister.

255
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,520
But she fooled me too.

256
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,500
Enough.

257
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:32,725
Brother Wu You.

258
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:36,579
After you arrive in Qingzhou,
remember to look after yourself.

259
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,336
As for that fool Wu Yu,

260
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,638
stop him from going
to the public house again.

261
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,737
Take care of yourself too.

262
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,058
If anyone picks on you,
let me know in the letter.

263
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:52,166
-Leng Yan.
-Yes.

264
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,179
Seal this place.

265
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,890
Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:03,630
You may all leave now.

267
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:45,323
Zhao Yun, I need to
tell you something.

268
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:49,054
If you were here, why didn't you
come in to cheer Brother Wu You up?

269
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:50,634
I...

270
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:52,093
I am leaving too.

271
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,919
Why aren't you cheering me up?

272
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,144
Don't go away! Don't go!

273
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,355
Don't go!
I have something to tell you.

274
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,460
I really need to tell you something.

275
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,062
Actually,

276
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,995
I am a little upset
for leaving you here.

277
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,101
When I thought about leaving you,

278
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,513
it pains my heart.

279
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,692
What's wrong with you?
Are you sick?

280
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,838
Don't interrupt me.

281
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:20,649
We grew up together as kids.

282
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,860
You know me well enough.

283
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,047
Since I was a kid, there are
tonnes of girls that...

284
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,586
had a crush on me.

285
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,940
But this is the first time
I am talking so seriously to a girl.

286
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,620
What are you trying to say?

287
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,731
Well...

288
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:39,963
Do you have a crush on me?

289
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,340
I knew it all along.

290
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,100
But I never had
the courage to tell you.

291
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:46,587
I like you too.

292
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,957
I once thought I have a long time
to enjoy this life.

293
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,944
I thought there are still
plenty of time..

294
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,866
to wait for you to grow up.

295
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,052
But I never expect
to leave you so soon.

296
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:01,197
Who knows when I am coming back here?

297
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,019
Curse you fool!
You stinking Wu Yu!

298
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,060
You always pretend like
you don't care about me!

299
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,799
You followed me like a fly...

300
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,555
and talked about marrying my brother!

301
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,686
It hurts! Stop it!

302
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,721
After all that speech,
if you are not touched at all,

303
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,620
at least give me an answer.

304
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:22,492
I...

305
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,907
Did I misunderstand her?

306
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,830
She doesn't have a crush on me?

307
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:29,592
No way!

308
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:31,906
No.

309
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:34,012
With my charm as Prince Chen,

310
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:36,546
if she doesn't like me,
I will make that happen.

311
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,563
Are you still mad at me?

312
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,481
-Take this.
-What...

313
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:45,840
What is this?

314
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,293
It's you.

315
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,138
Me?

316
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:51,488
Princess Rong Le and I
made this together.

317
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,861
It's a little ugly.

318
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,661
Keep it if you like it.
If you don't like it,

319
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,438
give it to me.

320
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,700
I like it! I like it a lot.

321
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:07,732
You accepted my present.
You have to listen to me now.

322
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,586
Focus on helping Brother Wu You
while you are in Qingzhou.

323
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,025
I want a letter from you every day.

324
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,500
Stay at least three feet
away from other women.

325
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,504
But this is too much for me.

326
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,563
Can I take back what
I said just now?

327
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,933
Not a chance.

328
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,774
If you won't listen,
I am not waiting for you.

329
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:26,189
There are many handsome boys
in this city after all.

330
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,894
Fine, I'll listen to you.

331
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,885
Promise me.

332
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,940
Moon Embrace is reopening.

333
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,093
We can have tea again.

334
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,980
We can finally have some decent tea.

335
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:59,371
What tea do they have this time?

336
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:13,932
Let's go inside.

337
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:20,700
Princess.

338
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,440
You are here.

339
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:25,088
Stop calling me Princess.

340
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,006
Just address me like you used to.

341
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,680
Chen Yu.

342
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,938
Are you reopening the teahouse?

343
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:33,514
Yes, Mistress.

344
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:35,969
This teahouse is like a house for us.

345
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,660
None of us could bear to leave it.

346
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:40,484
Rong Le.

347
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,935
I know you love the art of tea-making.

348
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,840
I order my men to lift
the seal off this teahouse.

349
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:52,779
From now on, you are still
the mistress of this premise.

350
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:57,094
I am not the same as
those ordinary men.

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,833
I won't keep you inside the manor.

352
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,891
If there is anything
you wish to do or love,

353
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,389
you may do as you please.

354
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:06,956
I will give you my support.

355
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:11,751
Very well, I must be on my way now.

356
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,355
Mistress.

357
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:28,442
Pick up the spirit. If you will,
we can run this teahouse together.

358
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,257
Let's do this for Long Yue.

359
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,505
If you choose otherwise,
you may leave.

360
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,130
The rest of us will
take care of this place.

361
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,004
You are always welcomed here.

362
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,286
Chen Yu,

363
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,090
are you really willing to give up
on travelling and learning...

364
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,410
the art of lute just for
our teahouse and for me?

365
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:53,234
Mistress, do not see this
as I give up on my dreams.

366
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,940
Take it as I can't let
this mortal coil go.

367
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,530
For us,

368
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,552
this teahouse is the
beginning and the end.

369
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,004
If I want to improve
my skills on music,

370
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,828
this is the right place to be.

371
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,412
Good.

372
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,494
Everyone in this world has a
different view for love.

373
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
Some will give it their all.

374
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:37,903
Some will use it for their gain.

375
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,517
Whether you wish to be repaid...

376
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:44,297
you must follow your heart.

377
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:00,960
How dare you come here!

378
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,538
Long Yue is dead because of you.

379
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,890
You left her with no choice but death!

380
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,173
Your crocodile's tears...

381
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,489
will only bother the deceased.

382
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,770
Your Highness has her own reasons.

383
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:16,572
I have mine as well.

384
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:19,407
I have nothing but sorry for you.

385
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,614
It doesn't matter how you see me.

386
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:25,452
I will carry out my duty.

387
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,017
My duty...

388
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,097
-is to protect you.
-You are a hypocrite.

389
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,097
Your false concerns
are not needed here.

390
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:46,612
I am protecting the Princess.

391
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,441
Her safety comes first.

392
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,539
I bet this is another of
the Emperor's order.

393
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:06,290
You know I won't hurt you,
why must you do this?

394
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,612
Let go of me!

395
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,967
Back off, I don't need your help.

396
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:24,906
You lying ingrate!

397
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,742
How dare you come back here.

398
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,218
Are you going to spy on her and
sell her out to the Emperor?

399
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
I tried to kill you just now.

400
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,044
Go ahead and tell His Majesty.

401
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,615
Let him have me killed.

402
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:41,074
And Long Yue,

403
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:44,382
she was so loyal to the Princess.

404
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:47,746
Listen closely.

405
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,216
Her blood is on your hands.

406
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:53,004
I hate myself for not
knowing any martial art.

407
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,463
Otherwise I will kill you...

408
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,081
so you won't hurt another soul again!

409
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,255
As for you,

410
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,349
you must obey Captain Xiao.

411
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,693
If not, you won't even know
how you get killed.

412
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,320
Whether you believe me or not,

413
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:16,746
I am the only one who
can keep her safe now.

414
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,627
I promised you I will bring you
back to Western Qi.

415
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,130
You have my words.

416
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,221
Why would the Princess believe you?

417
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:27,927
If you still have some
conscience left in you,

418
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:29,440
please leave.

419
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:31,181
The further, the better!

420
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:32,634
Ling Yue.

421
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,590
Stop arguing with someone
that means nothing.

422
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,299
I am not feeling well.
Bring me the water.

423
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,206
Come, let's get some water.

424
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,783
Farewell, Prince Li and Prince Chen.

425
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:54,128
-Sir Sun.
-Thank you, Sir Yang.

426
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,170
We are exiled as our punishment.

427
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:59,046
I heard you did well in
making sure we get it.

428
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:01,338
All the other officers
are afraid of us.

429
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:03,112
But you came to see us off alone.

430
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,501
Why? Do you feel bad for us?

431
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,268
That is not true, Your Highness.

432
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,547
I made the proposal
because of duty,

433
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,668
but coming here is a personal matter.

434
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,046
I know what is right or wrong.

435
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,025
This old scholar is
actually quite interesting.

436
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,386
I remember this is the place...

437
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,680
where my brother refused
to welcome the Princess.

438
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,059
You were so worried for the etiquette.

439
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,797
Sir Yang, the wind here is strong.
You should go home.

440
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,855
You may go now.
Go on.

441
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,799
Your Highness.

442
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,077
Sir Yang is a loyal officer
of the Imperial Court.

443
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,472
It's an honour to leave
the national affair in his hands.

444
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,141
You have my word, Your Highness.

445
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,638
Your Highness, have a safe journey.

446
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,999
Father, will we ever come back here?

447
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,140
If His Highness is back,

448
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,834
we will return with all the glory.

449
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,060
Miss Sun, we need to go now.

450
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,187
Ling Yue.

451
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:37,435
General Fu.

452
00:28:37,636 --> 00:28:38,872
How may I help you?

453
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:43,592
What is this?

454
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,551
Dried longan soup for Her Highness.

455
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,375
-Send it to her.
-Yes.

456
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,915
Ling Yue, you spent a lot
of time with the Princess.

457
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,841
Do you know if she has any hobby?

458
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,013
Hobby?

459
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:05,368
Nothing in particular.

460
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,339
Please, try to recall.

461
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:13,693
I simply wish to know my wife better.

462
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:16,690
I can cheer her up a little.
What do you think?

463
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,542
The Princess usually likes...

464
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,770
brewing and drinking tea.

465
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,920
She also likes playing chess
and calligraphy.

466
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,719
Right, she loves to listen
to Miss Chen Yu's music.

467
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:32,039
The Princess smiles whenever
she listens to her music.

468
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,698
Good. Thank you, Miss Ling Yue.

469
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:40,461
If you recall anything else,

470
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,486
be sure to tell me anytime.

471
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,800
Yes.

472
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,698
Thank you. Very well,
get back to your work.

473
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,897
General Fu actually cares a lot
for the Princess.

474
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,588
The song you play...

475
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,268
is not as full of sorrow
as when we first met.

476
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,960
While it is tranquil,

477
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,980
it has a sense of uniqueness in it.

478
00:31:38,302 --> 00:31:40,548
Perhaps your thoughts
are different now.

479
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:48,883
That is because...

480
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,909
you are here with me.

481
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:56,352
Right.

482
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:59,760
I learn this song specially for you.

483
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:01,907
If you like it,

484
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,144
I can play it for you every day.

485
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:05,923
Your kindness is much appreciated.

486
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,650
Judging by your tone,

487
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,445
are you not feeling well?

488
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,533
I am fine.
I took my medicine.

489
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,116
I must get some rest now.

490
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,039
<i>Rong Le.</i>

491
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:28,489
<i>I will find a way to cheer you up.</i>

492
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,095
Lady Rong Le.

493
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:34,671
Who sent this?

494
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:37,109
Lady Xiang, this is from General Fu.

495
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,752
Open it up.

496
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,021
-You can leave now.
-Yes.

497
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:14,975
What is this all about?

498
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:21,294
Your Highness.

499
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,020
His Highness has great
affection for me.

500
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,540
It's my birthday tomorrow.

501
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,173
His Highness invited many
gentlemen and ladies...

502
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,970
of noble families to
the Eastern Palace.

503
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,848
I never thought they would
send so many presents.

504
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,219
I have no idea where to
keep all of these.

505
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:38,718
He is holding a feast for you
in the Eastern Palace?

506
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:40,310
Indeed.

507
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,370
You are not told about this?

508
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:46,296
I was too busy
preparing for the feast.

509
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,928
I forgot to inform you.

510
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,902
I hope you are not offended.

511
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,774
I am a mere commoner.

512
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,184
I was hoping you can be
the host for the feast.

513
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,160
Why am I even needed in this place?

514
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,121
Even a mere courtesan is
getting more attention than me.

515
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,960
Your Highness, don't cross the line.

516
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,579
What do you want?

517
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:18,271
Let go of me! Let go!

518
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:21,249
Guards! Take this insolent
woman out of here!

519
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,832
Guards!

520
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:25,715
Let go of me.

521
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:29,662
You...

522
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,480
-Xiang.
-Your Highness.

523
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:34,678
How could you break
the present from General Fu?

524
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,678
What? You!

525
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,839
Get out!

526
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,753
How could you hold a feast
for a mere courtesan in the palace?

527
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,296
If His Majesty knows about this...

528
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,711
His Majesty?

529
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,463
Don't you dare bring up his name.

530
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,066
Zongzheng Wu You is exiled
and stripped of all ranks.

531
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,500
My father asked for me to assist him.

532
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,860
The throne will be
mine sooner or later.

533
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,703
Nothing can stand in my way.

534
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,450
While you are enjoying your success,

535
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:05,017
the others have their eyes on
the Eastern Palace.

536
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,291
Your Highness cannot be too arrogant.

537
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:09,394
My lady,

538
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:11,770
maybe you should think about yourself.

539
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,180
Your father lost his authority.

540
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,259
He has no power.

541
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,126
If you dare lecture me with that tone,

542
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,819
I will make sure to get rid of you.

543
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:26,562
Xiang is always so generous.

544
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:28,984
She can replace you sooner or later.

545
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,568
Stop standing there.

546
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:37,320
Get out of here.
I don't want to see you.

547
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:38,962
Scram.

548
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,513
Xiang, are you hurt?

549
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,372
Just ignore her.

550
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:53,499
Tomorrow, you will become
the lady of the house.

551
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,236
You will see to those guests for me.

552
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:59,649
Thank you for defending me.

553
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,829
-Miss Ling Yue.
-Why are you here?

554
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,854
This is the medicine for Princess.
It just arrived.

555
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,174
Make sure to prepare this
for Her Highness on time.

556
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:29,886
I know both of you hate me.

557
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,482
I have no mean to explain everything.

558
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,460
You can hate me all you want.

559
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,662
But please don't hurt yourself
because of this.

560
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:02,531
Mother!

561
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:07,672
Princess.

562
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,637
Princess, you are finally awake.

563
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,392
I was so worried for
the past few days.

564
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:22,688
Your Highness, it's time
for your medicine.

565
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:30,003
I am all right.
I don't need this medicine.

566
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:33,187
Princess, you were too busy recently,

567
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:36,297
you passed out because
you didn't take the medicine.

568
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:39,771
If His Majesty hadn't sent
this here to remind me,

569
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,519
you would still be in a coma.

570
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,671
He sent this?

571
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,839
Yes, just the same as before.

572
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:48,242
His Majesty orders his men
to send this here every month...

573
00:37:48,404 --> 00:37:50,564
to make sure you are well.

574
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,540
I don't know why he forced you
to marry General Fu,

575
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,656
but His Majesty has
always cared for you.

576
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,474
How is this medicine sent here?

577
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:02,193
Captain Xiao gave this to me.

578
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:05,477
He said he got it
from His Majesty's men.

579
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,304
Is this the original prescription?

580
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,820
I didn't check,

581
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,851
I simply boiled it as ordered.

582
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:15,948
Is there any of the herbs left?

583
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,862
We used up all of it this month.

584
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,076
There are still some
leavings in the pot.

585
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:22,109
Bring them to me.

586
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:23,309
One more thing.

587
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,460
Get rid of this.
I am not drinking it.

588
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,029
But Your Highness, you are ill.

589
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,300
I don't even know why I am ill,
how can I take this medicine?

590
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:31,687
Your Highness,

591
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,818
you mean something is off
with this medicine?

592
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,530
I may not a skilled healer,

593
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,458
but at least I know that...

594
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,500
almost all headaches are spontaneous.

595
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,387
I haven't heard of a remedy
that must be taken every month.

596
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
I am not sure...

597
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:48,427
if I take this medicine
for the headache...

598
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:50,509
or is the medicine
the cause of it.

599
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,400
Your Highness, you mean
this is not a remedy?

600
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:55,689
It's some sort of poison
that gives you headache?

601
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,591
I started to have flashes of memories
after I stop taking the medicine.

602
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:02,443
If I stop taking it for good,

603
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:05,591
maybe my amnesia and
headache will be cured.

604
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,445
Sure, I will collect the leavings
right away and have a closer look.

605
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,547
Also, keep this a secret
from Xiao Sha.

606
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,440
The next time you get the medicine,
don't boil it. Bring it to me.

607
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,200
How may I help you, General Fu?

608
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:30,217
These are...

609
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:32,912
the tea leaves I got
from the merchant.

610
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:34,499
I can see you are getting well.

611
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:37,278
So, I am letting this master of tea
to review these tea.

612
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,917
If there is something you like,
the teahouse can get a supply of it.

613
00:39:41,427 --> 00:39:42,947
Much appreciated.

614
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,558
Give them a try.

615
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,455
I can tell you really love this job.

616
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,013
I am glad you do.

617
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,300
This really isn't
all that hard for me.

618
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,852
You have my thanks.

619
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:03,929
General Fu.

620
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:09,887
What do you need?

621
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:17,172
Lady Rong Le is not
an outsider. Speak.

622
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,437
An invitation from His Highness.
It's his new wife, Lady Xiang.

623
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:23,187
General and Lady Rong Le
are invited to his feast.

624
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,015
<i>Lady Xiang?</i>

625
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:33,342
I am Hen Xiang,
from the House of Fragrance.

626
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:37,368
Don't you know Lady Rong Le
just got well?

627
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,780
Tell them she is still ill.

628
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,260
We'll pay a visit some other time.

629
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,967
-Yes.
-Wait.

630
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:45,218
I can go.

631
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,866
It's the birthday of His Highness'
favourite consort,

632
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,526
and we are both invited.

633
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:53,559
We shouldn't turn down
this invitation.

634
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,627
I don't want this to bring you
any trouble.

635
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,212
Are you willing to meet
the guests with me?

636
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,723
I don't want to be cooped up
in here all day.

637
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:07,852
Besides, I will carry out
the promise I made.

638
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:09,951
There is nothing to be worried.

639
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,001
I will make sure to do the same.

640
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:19,117
I want to go out today.

641
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:21,690
Send these tea leaves to Moon Embrace.

642
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:25,074
I don't think it's convenient
to leave on your own.

643
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,547
What is that supposed to mean?

644
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,820
Don't take this wrongly.

645
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,338
What I meant was...

646
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:33,114
it's not convenient for a patient
to go out on her own.

647
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,049
How about this?

648
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,980
Let Xiao Sha go with you.

649
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:40,421
Okay.

650
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:41,815
Stay safe.

651
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,161
Understood.

652
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:06,689
Mistress.

653
00:42:07,052 --> 00:42:08,130
Chen Yu.

654
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,460
I have a task that concerns
my very life for you.

655
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,904
Are you willing to help me out?

656
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:14,346
I once sworn...

657
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,900
to do anything I can
to repay your kindness.

658
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,340
I don't need you to repay me.

659
00:42:19,906 --> 00:42:21,702
But after thinking
about it back and forth,

660
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,620
I feel like you are the only one
I can trust...

661
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,278
and the best for this mission.

662
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:27,883
I have Xiao Sha distracted.

663
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,427
Only the two of us know about this.

664
00:42:30,752 --> 00:42:32,176
Whatever you need, Mistress.

665
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,511
Do you know any trustworthy doctors?

666
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,302
It's better if they are
also great herbalists.

667
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,013
I need you to find out
if there is anything wrong...

668
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,688
with these herbs leavings.
