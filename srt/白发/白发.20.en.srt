Episode 20

3
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,275
Long live the emperor!

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,616
Please rise.

5
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,921
Thank you, Your Majesty!

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,500
General Fu.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,977
I have something to ask you.

8
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:31,872
Go ahead, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,140
I've received the letter
of credence from Western Qi.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,918
They had given me another excuse to
not join us in the war against Wei.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,464
This alliance is nothing but a shell.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,413
I'm really worried about it.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,860
You are married with the princess
of Western Qi for half a year already.

14
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,776
Have you heard anything about it?

15
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,441
Your Majesty.

16
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:50,806
My wife is just a woman.

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,150
She wouldn't know anything
about the national affairs.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,945
And I'm an official of Northern Realm.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,098
It's impossible that I'll have a
private contact with Western Qi.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,922
I think that the Western Qi
is going back on their words...

21
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:04,951
because they know that we are
impatient to go into war against Wei.

22
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:06,783
And our nation is in a civil strife.

23
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:10,421
So, they are acting haughty
just to gain an upper hand on us.

24
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:14,138
I think you have underestimated
Western Qi.

25
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,478
Just like last time...

26
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,100
when you had underestimated
the condition in southern fringe.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,278
Please punish me for my incompetence.

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,934
No need to take this to heart.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,935
But, regardless of Western Qi's plan,

30
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:33,156
we won't delay our declaration
of war against Wei.

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,060
I have been planning this for
quite a while with the crown prince.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,180
I can prepare a draft
on the strategies...

33
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:39,576
for Your Majesty to go through.

34
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:40,976
No need.

35
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,286
My seventh son, Zongzheng Wu You...

36
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,506
has contributed in putting down
the rebellion in southern fringe.

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,739
I've decided to reconfer the title
as Prince Li upon him.

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,800
I'll summon him to come back
to the capital...

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,100
to discuss about the
war strategies against Wei.

40
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,321
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,483
Lord Wu You is adored by all
in the southern fringe.

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,982
Everybody knows about his statecraft
and military achievements.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,750
I think that he's a born commander.

44
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,308
If he lead this war against Wei,

45
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,230
I'm sure that Northern Realm
can come out as the victor.

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,860
Xuan Ming. Go to Qingzhou
to announce my decree.

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,026
Don't tell him about the war
against Wei yet.

48
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:21,257
Just say that I'm going to reconfer
the title as Prince Li upon him.

49
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:23,788
So, I'm summoning him to
come back to receive his title.

50
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,740
What?

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,696
Zongzheng Wu You is
going to come back?

53
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,062
I've already advised you
to tone it down.

54
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,542
But you never listen to me.

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,352
Whenever you did something,
you'll remind His Majesty about him.

56
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:46,441
If Wu You comes back to the capital,
your place will be threatened.

57
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:48,891
No.

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,275
Your Highness. Looks like it's best
if I leave the palace now.

59
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:57,230
Please send me away from the palace.

60
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,084
Send you away from the palace?

61
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:02,078
In this life, I will never
send you away from the palace.

62
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,482
Zongzheng Wu You is
coming back to the capital.

63
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,220
General Fu.

64
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,163
Looks like there's no way...

65
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,726
for me to turn back now.

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,515
It's either him or me.

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,830
Please don't act recklessly.

68
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,344
If something happens
to Zongzheng Wu You,

69
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,402
they'll first implicate you to it and
you'll be the primary suspect.

70
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,660
It'll just be a suspicion.

71
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,250
Without proof,
nobody will dare accuse me.

72
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,167
-I strongly suggest you...
-General Fu.

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,140
You may leave now.

74
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,744
No need to worry about this.

75
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,192
Xiang, pour me some wine.

76
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,783
I'll take my leave now.

77
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,380
Please calm down.

78
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,695
General Fu is being too cautious.

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,791
Actually, it's quite an easy feat
to murder someone in Qingzhou.

80
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,260
As the crown prince,

81
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:20,279
you should be decisive.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,740
That is what I like about you.

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,779
You are straightforward.

84
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,940
And you never doubt yourself.

85
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,900
Xiang.

86
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,133
You are really an
understanding person.

87
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,015
How could I bear it to send you
away from the palace?

88
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:47,345
Zongzheng Wu You.

89
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,740
General Fu?

90
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:13,758
I'm here today...

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,460
because...

92
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,218
I want to talk to you.

93
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,660
I'm feeling...

94
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,420
doubly depressed today.

95
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,916
So, I would like to spend
some time with you.

96
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,988
Are you willing to accompany me?

97
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,532
I don't drink.

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,766
It's been so long since
I last drink like this.

99
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,380
This wine...

100
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,060
is so sweet.

101
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,780
Tell me.

102
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,434
What is the purpose of us
living in this world?

103
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,247
As the general of Northern Realm,

104
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,349
I've risked my life again and again...

105
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,147
in the battlefield for my country.

106
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:28,105
But in the end, not only
I was scolded by His Majesty,

107
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,767
I was even scolded
by that crown prince.

108
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,905
General Fu, are you alright?

109
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,316
Don't call me general.

110
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,616
I don't care about that title!

111
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,500
Lady Rong Le.

112
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,900
As long as...

113
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,696
you stay by my side,

114
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,651
I'll be willing to do anything.

115
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,060
Xiao Sha.

116
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,702
Princess Rong Le, I'll bring
the general out immediately.

117
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,940
Rong Le.

118
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,291
Rong Le.

119
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,727
Why are all of you
so lenient towards him?

120
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:21,074
No matter what he did wrong,

121
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,836
all of you will forgive him
in the end.

122
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,956
But why are you all
so strict towards me?

123
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,882
General Fu.
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,769
Yes.

125
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,028
He's all high and mighty.

126
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,783
He can do as he pleases.

127
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,922
But I can only endure
everything in silence.

128
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,018
General Fu is drunk.

129
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:52,602
You may stand guard outside.

130
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,473
-Princess Rong Le.
-I'll be fine.

131
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:57,050
Call me if you need help.

132
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,413
<i>I can't help but to ask after you.</i>

133
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:14,233
Rong Le.

134
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,375
Am I that bad compared to him?

135
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,798
The things that he can do,

136
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,342
I can do them too.

137
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:28,811
<i>Finally, I've learnt how to trust.</i>

138
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,601
<i>But I've underestimated love and hate.</i>

139
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,888
<i>We have thrown away
the fate that we got by chance.</i>

140
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,094
<i>I have to admit to my mistakes.</i>

141
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:45,308
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

142
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
Mother.

143
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,001
Don't die, mother.

144
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,740
Don't hit me.

145
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,620
Don't hit me.

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,810
Don't hit me.

147
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,758
Don't hit me.

148
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,127
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

149
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,260
<i>We are not holding hands...</i>

150
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,552
<i>but you are holding my heart.</i>

151
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,057
<i>Although this might not be forever,</i>

152
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
<i>I've locked you in my heart...</i>

153
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,488
<i>and I've locked you in my dream.</i>

154
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:27,111
<i>It's my fault...</i>

155
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,377
<i>for falling in love with you.</i>

156
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,820
The Creed of Vengeance.
The crown prince must have sent them.

157
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,100
The things that I've asked you to do.
Are they done?

158
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:39,331
Don't worry.
Everything is on track.

159
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,580
It's time.

160
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,340
I was...

161
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,900
drunk yesterday.

162
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,580
Did I do something rude to you?

163
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,828
Did I scare you away?

164
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,580
You were drunk yesterday.
And you had spent the night here.

165
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,390
Nothing else happened.

166
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,860
This is a hangover soup.

167
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,740
What is it, General Fu?

168
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,354
You cooked this yourself, right?

169
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,866
Yes.

170
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:33,295
Ling Yue is not here.

171
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:35,005
So, I have to cook it.

172
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,234
This hangover soup
is really extraordinary.

173
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,900
I'm wide awake...

174
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,020
after taking just a sip.

175
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,740
I remember that...

176
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:53,703
I joined...

177
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,620
the army when I was 12.

178
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,358
I have to be on guard every day
even when I sleep.

179
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:00,948
All these years,

180
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,907
yesterday night...

181
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,614
was the only night that
I had slept so soundlessly.

182
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,412
Wu You, on my way here,

183
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,620
I've noticed that the southern fringe
has begun to recover.

184
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,235
Everybody is living in peace.

185
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,102
You've made a huge contribution.

186
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,801
You are too kind.

187
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,764
Southern fringe has always
been a flourishing place.

188
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,015
But lately, many of the refugees
kept on rebelling...

189
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,464
even during the harvest season.

190
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,844
I think the reason behind it
is something very complicated.

191
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,474
So, my original idea is to
stay at the southern fringe.

192
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,820
But since you are here to summon me,

193
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,178
I'll have to go back to thank
His Majesty first and decide after.

194
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,580
Wu You, are you really going back?

195
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,780
Looks like Wu Yu is impatient
to go back already.

196
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,405
Looks like somebody is waiting for you
in the capital city.

197
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,009
That's not true, uncle.

198
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,807
I just miss all those
pretty ladies in the capital.

199
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,275
Do you know how complicated the
affairs are in the southern fringe?

200
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,654
I just want to visit and have fun in
those public houses again.

201
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,408
Greetings, Prince Fan Yang.

202
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

203
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,154
Miss Sun, long time no see.

204
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,126
You've became even prettier.

205
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:29,150
You are too kind.

206
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
Ya Li.

207
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:38,568
Come, sit beside me.

208
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,780
It's warmer here.

209
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,020
I haven't seen you for so long.

210
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,498
Wu You can even take care
of others now.

211
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,298
Ya Li, we will be going back
to the capital soon.

212
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:07,676
And I've kept my promise to you.

213
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,620
Get yourself ready to
depart for the capital.

214
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,220
That's great.

215
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,491
Ya Li's grandmother's 70th birthday
is approaching.

216
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:19,800
So, she has been asking her
to go to the capital.

217
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,641
If you can together with her,

218
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,091
I'll be rest assured.

219
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,620
But there are many things that needed
to be done in the southern fringe.

220
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,006
When you leave,
there'll be more tasks for us.

221
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:33,013
So, I won't be joining you
to go back to the capital.

222
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,998
I'll leave everything here
to you then, teacher.

223
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,810
Alright, Your Highness.

224
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,608
Leng Yan, you have to pass this letter
personally to Princess Zhao Yun.

225
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,226
I want her to be the first...

226
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,964
to know that I'm going to
marry her once I'm back.

227
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,540
For this trip, I just need you...

228
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,105
to go back with me, Leng Yan.

229
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,697
I'll leave Agent Wu here to tie up the
loose ends in the southern fringe.

230
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,806
Especially those wealthy
and influenced clans.

231
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:02,417
We need to investigate on them.

232
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,468
Yes, Your Highness.
I understand.

233
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,429
Wu You.

234
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,300
You investigate on other clans
but left Sun family untouched.

235
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,980
What are you thinking?

236
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,260
Although you are going to
marry Sister Ya Li,

237
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,104
you are being too kind
to your father-in-law.

238
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,704
What are you talking about?

239
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,241
Wu You. Before this, you said that you
don't want to go back to the capital.

240
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,010
Until now only I know that...

241
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,298
you've decided to go back because
you've promised Sister Ya Li to do so.

242
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,687
Wu You. Have you ever thought about...

243
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,579
what are you going to do
when you go back?

244
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,056
Nonsense.

245
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,260
Wu You.

246
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,753
Don't you have any other thoughts
about this trip to the capital?

247
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,244
For example, I want to go back
to meet Zhao Yun.

248
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,550
Do you have anyone
that you want to meet?

249
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,344
I want to go back because
the assassins that came at me...

250
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,537
that day were from the
Creed of Vengeance.

251
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,799
I need to go back
to investigate on it...

252
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,820
to make sure that
the crown prince stay put.

253
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,500
What? It's crown prince again?

254
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:04,375
" Eastern Suburb Inn "

255
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,313
Why didn't you tell me that
the crown prince...

256
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,310
has sent someone to
assassinate Wu You?

257
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,580
I didn't know about it beforehand.

258
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,644
Crown prince has never
mentioned it to me.

259
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,420
I don't care what your plan is.
But remember your place.

260
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,420
Make sure to follow my order.

261
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,336
Don't make your own decision.

262
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,118
I've never forgotten about my mission.

263
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,780
But I'm afraid that
you've forgotten about it.

264
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,078
I heard that you've
stayed the night...

265
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,502
in the princess's chamber
a few days ago.

266
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,583
Now that you've gotten your woman,

267
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm afraid that...

268
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,660
you've forgotten about your mission.

269
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,860
You're spying on me?

270
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,596
I grew up with you since young.

271
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,151
For your every flesh and blood...

272
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,239
and even for your scent,

273
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,500
I'll know it...

274
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,231
if there's any changes with them.

275
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,286
Hen Xiang, I'll repeat myself again.

276
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,535
The things that I do...

277
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,608
have nothing to do with you.

278
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,776
If you act on your own again,

279
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,725
I won't forgive you.

280
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,432
You should be very clear...

281
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,781
about the things that I can do.

282
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,090
There can only be one survivor
for every test.

283
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,980
Survival of the fittest.

284
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,940
You won.

285
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,561
I've known...

286
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,761
since I first saw you
when I was 10 that...

287
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,410
you'll be the strongest among us.

288
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:50,636
Your eyes are burning with fire.

289
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,005
You've made the same choice
as the one you made when you were 10.

290
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,664
Don't worry.

291
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,645
As long as I live,

292
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,740
I won't let you die.

293
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:54,329
<i>I'm willing to do...</i>

294
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,739
<i>anything for you.</i>

295
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,041
<i>But do you really
understand what I want?</i>

296
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,568
<i>We are so similar.</i>

297
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,039
<i>That's why I've made myself...</i>

298
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,060
<i>into your shadow.</i>

299
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,404
How could you...

300
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,020
fall in love with
somebody else so easily?

301
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,813
Mistress, ever since I found out
that Hen Xiang is from Western Qi,

302
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,910
I've used all my connections to find
out about her background to no avail.

303
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:31,767
People from House of Fragrance
told me that...

304
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:34,749
she suddenly appeared
half a year ago during that time.

305
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,049
She has offered herself
to become a dancer there.

306
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,723
After that, she became famous...

307
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,767
and she went to the
General's Manor to dance.

308
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,561
As for the rest,
you've already known about it.

309
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,100
Thank you for your hard work.

310
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,547
I don't think...

311
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,702
we need to continue
on this investigation.

312
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,140
I understand.

313
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,328
Actually, I've been to the manor for
a few times in the past half year.

314
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,980
You're living a good life.

315
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,793
They say that ignorant is bliss.

316
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,900
I think that sometimes,

317
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,100
it'll better for us to know nothing.

318
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,740
Maybe I've been living
too comfortably.

319
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:16,346
That's why I no longer wish
to find out the truth.

320
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:19,299
I'm not sure if this is
right or wrong.

321
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:22,196
And I'm afraid that
the faux happiness I have...

322
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,575
will turn out to be a dream only.

323
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,895
Mistress.

324
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,592
No matter what decision you make,
I'll support you.

325
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,883
But half a year ago,
in this very place,

326
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:34,486
you told me that...

327
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,694
you won't be willing to live
a life of falsehood and hoax.

328
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:41,089
And you won't hand yourself over
to others easily.

329
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:44,231
I wonder if you still feel this way?

330
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,220
I don't know.

331
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,454
Actually, I'm just a normal person.

332
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:51,721
When I'm having a headache,

333
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,454
I'll still take those medicine
that I had once doubted.

334
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,760
I took it just to reduce
my sufferings.

335
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,660
Take our fate into our own hands?

336
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,611
Easy to say...

337
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,100
but difficult to carry it out.

338
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:08,287
Mistress, don't give up easily.

339
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,520
If you really believe in General Fu,

340
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,461
try to accept him.

341
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,315
If you still want that book and
you want to choose an unknown path,

342
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:19,308
I'll go with you too.

343
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,780
Chen Yu.

344
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,509
Thank you.

345
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,818
Your Majesty.
I've done as you asked...

346
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:34,904
and have conveyed your
message to Lord Wu You...

347
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,695
regarding his title as Prince Li.

348
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,574
After he settles everything in
southern fringe, he'll reach here...

349
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:42,179
in approximately five days' time,
including his travel time.

350
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,314
Good.

351
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,698
I have something that
I need him to do for me.

352
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,947
Western Qi is a treacherous bunch.
They've gone back on their words.

353
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,191
But we can't delay the war
against Wei anymore.

354
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:56,753
So, I've decided to form
an alliance with Chen.

355
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:58,655
Chen has an impressive army.

356
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:01,520
If we have them, we won't be
needing Western Qi anymore.

357
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,185
We can go into war
with the help of Chen.

358
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,882
-How is that possible?
-We have never worked with Chen.

359
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,896
No need to be so anxious.

360
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,128
In order to make sure that
this alliance stands,

361
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,085
I've already sent a secret messenger
to Chen to discuss about it.

362
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,019
Although there's a
dissension among us,

363
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,815
the brother of Emperor of Chen,

364
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:24,148
Prince Zhen Bei who holds the
real power greatly supports this idea.

365
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,700
He's already on his way here.

366
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,307
Your Majesty, this is too sudden.

367
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,245
The Board of Rites knows
nothing about their conditions.

368
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,741
Please instruct us on how
to fulfil their conditions.

369
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,740
Western Qi and Chen are different.

370
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,635
Western Qi is weak. They offered
their country's princess...

371
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,220
and food supplies to us.

372
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,473
It's because they wish
to use our name...

373
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,220
as a deterrent for other countries.

374
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,500
Chen is poor
but they have a strong army.

375
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:52,597
Prince Zhen Bei will be here...

376
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,494
this time to choose a
princess of ours for himself.

377
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,944
And the dowry...

378
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,300
will include tools, appliances,
money and other valuables...

379
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,682
in exchange for their soldiers.

380
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,438
They'll join us in
the war against Wei.

381
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,436
Your Majesty, I think we should
discuss about it more.

382
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:14,461
I've already made up my mind.

383
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,820
We'll discuss about it again
when Prince Li is here.

384
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Emperor if Qi is too impatient.

385
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,340
Because of the failure
of this alliance,

386
00:25:29,836 --> 00:25:31,241
His Majesty...

387
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,940
has lost is trust in me.

388
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,213
That's why he's set on breaking off
the alliance with Western Qi.

389
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,121
You have acted rashly by coming here.

390
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,220
Are you trying to...

391
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,300
push me into the abyss?

392
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,152
General Fu. His Majesty has
asked me to tell you this.

393
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:47,713
He knows clearly about your plan.

394
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,880
If you still want your revenge...

395
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,350
and to own your real name and status,

396
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,020
you have to obey him.

397
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,740
If you are not willing
to help Western Qi,

398
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,169
we can't promise that...

399
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,808
we won't show the crimes
that you've committed...

400
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,773
to the Emperor of Northern Realm.

401
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,820
Are you threatening me?

402
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:10,404
I don't dare to. I'm just asking you
to reconsider carefully.

403
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:14,074
What does the Emperor of Qi want?

404
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,252
It's simple.

405
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:18,420
Before Ning Qian Yi,
Prince Zhen Bei of Chen reaches here,

406
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,620
kill him off.

407
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,264
Chen is already doubtful
about this alliance.

408
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,533
As soon as Prince Zhen Bei
who supports this alliance is dead,

409
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,343
Chen will be plunged
into a civil strife.

410
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,300
Ask him to wait for my news.

411
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,340
Master, Rong Qi is not to be trusted.

412
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,020
Do we really have to do that?

413
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,244
I won't be their string puppet.

414
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,300
We have to proceed with our plans
as soon as possible.

415
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,660
We just need an opportunity.

416
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:57,862
As soon as the war against Wei starts,
this nation will be in chaos.

417
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,536
And it'll be the best time
for you to take over this country.

418
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,402
So, not only you can't
murder Ning Qian Yi,

419
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,540
you have to make sure that
he reaches here safely.

420
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,220
We have to make this alliance
works for the war to start soon.

421
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:09,088
You've heard it just now.

422
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,140
The people of Western Qi...

423
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,140
are threatening me.

424
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,018
I believe that you can think of
a way to satisfy both parties.

425
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,180
You can protect Prince Zhen Bei...

426
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,540
and silence Western Qi
at the same time.

427
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:27,596
But you can't bear to do it.

428
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,862
Actually, you've already
known that it's my only choice.

429
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,686
That's why you are here to remind me.

430
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,900
Yes.

431
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,100
I've always known you best.

432
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,703
Is something troubling you?

433
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,420
It's nothing.

434
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:56,965
Don't think too much.

435
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,860
Why would I think too much?

436
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,495
By saying so,

437
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:03,261
you've already gave yourself away.

438
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,195
You are indeed troubled by something.

439
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,043
Can I stay here tonight?

440
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,048
Don't worry, I won't disturb you.

441
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,780
I can just sleep on the couch.

442
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,836
This manor was once...

443
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,394
a cold and frigid place.

444
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,902
I have neither family nor friends.

445
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,564
Every time during the festive season,

446
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,259
I'll only dream about...

447
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,119
mountain of swords sea of flames
and the gruesome battlefield.

448
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:51,419
Mistress, don't give up easily.

449
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,454
If you really believe in General Fu,

450
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,596
try to accept him.

451
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:02,301
Do as you please.

452
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,076
Are still awake because
I'm here and you're worried?

453
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,937
Since we can't sleep,

454
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,025
let's have a talk.

455
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,383
What do you want to know?

456
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:02,946
Just go ahead and ask me.

457
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,210
I want to know everything about you.

458
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,500
I know too little about you.

459
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,486
I think you know everything about me.

460
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,821
I'm sure that the Western Qi
has told you a lot about me.

461
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,552
Everything else about me
is quite normal.

462
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,116
Nothing interesting for you to know.

463
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,540
Look at you.

464
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,867
You are always like this.

465
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,622
Your words and your expression...

466
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,431
have put so much distance between us.

467
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,020
Rong Le.

468
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,380
What can I do...

469
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,086
to make you open your heart,

470
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:43,624
to lower your guards...

471
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,038
and to let me in?

472
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:51,282
Isn't it good between us right now?

473
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,021
-Why do you...
-When I'm with you, I'm not a general.

474
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,100
I am your husband.

475
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:00,288
I'm your husband...

476
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,710
who will help you and
protect you forever.

477
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,518
From now on,

478
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,100
can you address me as your husband...

479
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,020
or by my name?

480
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,060
I've known you for so long.

481
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,307
I've already gotten used
to this form of address.

482
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:20,033
It's hard for me to
change it suddenly.

483
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,809
You can cultivate a habit.

484
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,735
You'll get used to it after
you say it for a few times.

485
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,526
I've forgotten about...

486
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,666
when was the last time
someone used my name.

487
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,334
Why does it matter if someone
uses your name or not...

488
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:42,483
or how they address you?

489
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,420
Why is it you never see me...

490
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,516
even though I'm standing
right in front of you?

491
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,260
You remembered that...

492
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,638
we've known each other
for more than a year.

493
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,410
But why do I feel like...

494
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,460
in your eyes,

495
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm just another stranger?

496
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:11,807
General Fu.

497
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,560
So what if I can see you?

498
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:15,341
What can it prove?

499
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,180
I don't trust my eyes.

500
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:21,989
So, don't waste your effort,
General Fu.

501
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,779
If you can't see with your eyes,

502
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,421
then see with your heart.

503
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:32,332
Try to look at me with your heart.

504
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:37,000
Can you do that?

505
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,020
I'm sorry.

506
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,365
My heart sees nothing.

507
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:49,860
It's better if you
look inside yourself first.

508
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,575
Isn't it good between us right now?

509
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,788
We accompany each other...

510
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:02,982
and become each other's family.

511
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:06,521
If we want to keep
our secret to ourselves,

512
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,061
it's fine.

513
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,705
And if we wish to tell each other
our secrets one day,

514
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,500
we'll do it then.

515
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,140
So,

516
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,508
you are still not willing
to tell me today,

517
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:20,147
right?

518
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,620
General Fu.

519
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,869
I'm trying to tell you that...

520
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:27,778
although I've been hurt,

521
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,460
I hope that one day,

522
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,222
I can be true to the people
who are true to me.

523
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,220
Can you let go of me now?

524
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,100
Rest well.

525
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,260
If you're unhappy because of
what I said today,

526
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,060
how about you take a stroll...

527
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:22,635
at Qingliang Lake tomorrow?

528
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,340
Spring is almost upon us.

529
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,323
The scenery at that place
is fantastic.

530
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,460
Alright.

531
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,509
General Fu, you are looking for me?

532
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,820
General Fu.

533
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,780
Has Lady Rong Le gone out?

534
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,220
She's about to leave.
The carriage is ready.

535
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,820
Bring more men.

536
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,435
Nothing can go wrong.

537
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,380
Make sure that Lady Rong Le is safe.

538
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:50,953
Yes, General Fu.

539
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,368
Remember to go according to the plan.

540
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,780
-Yes, General Fu.
-You may leave now.

541
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,260
Come out.

542
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,900
You've finally decided.

543
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,576
You've put in so much effort on her
for the past half year.

544
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,511
If you don't use her well,

545
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,000
it'll be a waste for
such a good chess piece.

546
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:28,184
I thought that you've really
fallen in love with her.

547
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,740
It's not up to you to
question my thinking.

548
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,683
This is my last warning for you.

549
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,837
You are now a wife
of the crown prince.

550
00:36:42,356 --> 00:36:45,397
Your mission is to keep
an eye on the crown prince.

551
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,511
Not to spy on me.

552
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:49,789
Zongzheng Wu You is
coming back to Zhongshan soon.

553
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,404
Control your crown prince.

554
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,060
Don't let him act recklessly
and make some idiotic moves.

555
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,969
Ask him to just do his part well.

556
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,700
Should anything happens,

557
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,389
I'm sure that you know
the consequences.

558
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,999
And, with your current identity,

559
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,714
it's best for you to
stay away from my manor.

560
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,667
From now on,
don't come and find me...

561
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,460
unless I order you to do so.

562
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,380
I understand.

563
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Thank you for your reminder.

564
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,100
Go back.

565
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,380
Princess Rong Le, General Fu
is so considerate about you.

566
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:14,923
He knows that you are
bored in the manor.

567
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:18,427
So, he had you brought to such a quiet
and refreshing place. That's so good.

568
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,335
Such a tranquil place
is best for fishing.

569
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:25,130
Unfortunately,
I didn't bring any fishing tools.

570
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,571
Princess Rong Le,
I have the tools here.

571
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,060
Come over here.

572
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,580
Princess Zhao Yun?

573
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,660
Greetings, Princess Zhao Yun.

574
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:37,558
I have a complete set of tools here.

575
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,374
But I couldn't even get
a fish after two hours.

576
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,180
It's that fishmonger's fault.

577
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:45,435
He has roped in all the fish.

578
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,892
Fishmonger,
why are you pretending to sleep?

579
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,799
Do you really think that
you're above us all?

580
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,980
No need to get angry over some fish.

581
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,952
You need to be calm
if you want to fish.

582
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,985
You need to remain calm
in all situations.

583
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:23,432
You've scared off all the fish
with your temper.

584
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,513
I've been fishing here every day.

585
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,260
But I never have such a good yield.

586
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,980
Thank you for sending
all the fish to my way.

587
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,322
In order to repay you,

588
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,394
how about I give you all of my fish?

589
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,675
This is your catch.
It has nothing to do with me.

590
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,516
I can't take your fish just like that.

591
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,296
How about I buy them from you?

592
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,780
How about this?

593
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,527
We'll have a fishing competition.
Winner will get the fish.

594
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,034
Princess Rong Le,
we can't compete with him.

595
00:40:04,226 --> 00:40:06,559
He'll win for sure.

596
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,249
It'll be so embarrassing when we lose.

597
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:11,628
Don't worry.
I'll compete in your stead.

598
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:15,952
We'll do as you say then.
Let's begin the challenge.

599
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:22,737
Prince Zhen Bei of Chen has
already reached Zhongshan.

600
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,059
He's now at the Qingliang Lake
in the eastern suburb.

601
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,700
I've already sent someone
to protect him in secret.

602
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:29,868
I heard that the Emperor of Chen...

603
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:32,405
adores and thinks highly
of Prince Zhen Bei.

604
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,877
He has high hope for the prince
to become his successor.

605
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,259
The alliance between
us and Chen this time...

606
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,660
is very important.

607
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,982
If Western Qi knows about it,

608
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,902
they'll eye us like a prey...

609
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,867
and try to sabotage us.

610
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,139
If anything untoward happens to
Prince Zhen Bei in Northern Realm,

611
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:52,520
the consequences would be disastrous.

612
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,156
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

613
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,627
I understand.

614
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,180
I'll try my best to take care
of Prince Zhen Bei's safety.

615
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,957
You've not done well with
the southern fringe rebellion.

616
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:05,365
Prince Li has already
taken care of it for you.

617
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,940
I'll overlook that matter.

618
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,166
For this alliance between us and Chen,

619
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:14,637
if you do any mistakes again...

620
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,060
This time,

621
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,134
I won't let you down.
