00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,580
" Princess Silver "

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,100
Episode 46

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,420
Your Highness.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,740
Reports from Agent Wu.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,820
They found Fu Chou at the border.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,260
Your Highness,
Lady Yun's tomb collapsed.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,900
Her remain was stolen
and nowhere to be found.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,340
Fu Chou!

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,180
I will end you with my own hands!

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,220
Princess Rong Le.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,940
You are still on the fence
about the Blood Raven Root?

12
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,380
In order to save me,

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,020
he got the herb...

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,940
and burned his own hand.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,580
I don't want him to be
upset or disappointed.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,220
But I don't want to owe
Fu Chou any kindness.

17
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,820
I am confused about what I should do.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,620
I am no experts in this.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,660
All I know is your health comes first.

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,460
The Blood Raven Root can subdue
the poison in your body...

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,740
and even turn your hair dark again.

22
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,980
It can also revert the effect of
Ageing Frost on Prince Li.

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,180
You mean...

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,020
the Blood Raven Root can
heal the damage of Ageing Frost?

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,540
Yes, the herb can suppress all
kinds of poisoning effects.

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,260
That includes the Ageing Frost.

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,220
I will render the Blood Raven Root
into a remedy.

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,020
Both you and Prince Li can take
the medicine together.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,900
If the herb can revert
the effects of Ageing Frost,

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,700
-well...
-Princess Rong Le.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,220
Princess, Prince Li just left.

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,180
I heard the men from
Hidden Ones came here.

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't know what they talked about,

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,420
but Prince Li looked terrifying
when he left.

35
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,380
Your Highness, the Tong Pass
is just over this hill.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,500
Please, you must hold on.

37
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,100
From the moment you
stepped into the south,

38
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,300
you should have seen this coming.

39
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,180
Even if I must die by your hand,

40
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,740
I have no regret for coming here.

41
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,540
I am standing right here.
If you must,

42
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,260
come on and kill me.

43
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,380
Stop!

44
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,020
I always thought...

45
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,540
you were just being mad
when you said...

46
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,300
you won't accept the herb I sent.

47
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,580
But now that I see the two of you...

48
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,980
both have white hair
despite your young age,

49
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,700
I realised...

50
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,060
all the effort I put in...

51
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,780
was only for my own wishful fantasy.

52
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
And this is all thanks to you.

53
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,380
Stop pretending like you
are the victim here.

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,060
You are the future ruler
of Northern Realm.

55
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,020
You can't carry the sin
of killing your own brother.

56
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,900
Allow me...

57
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,620
to do it for you.

58
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,740
For my whole life,

59
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,100
I resorted to all kinds of
plottings for my revenge.

60
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,100
But this time,

61
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,020
I simply followed my heart
without any planning.

62
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,020
I don't care whatever reason
you have to come here.

63
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,620
I will not show any mercy
with my blade.

64
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,380
I will have no regret
for ending your life.

65
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,660
Today...

66
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,740
is the day I severe...

67
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,740
all the grudges we have.

68
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,020
My vengeance for him
is greater than all hatred.

69
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,620
Even if I will be loathed
by the people,

70
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,500
I must end him myself!

71
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,780
History is written by the victors.

72
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,020
Today, I fall by your hands.

73
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
Kill me if you must,

74
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,460
do what you want.

75
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,060
To seize the throne, you killed
my father, the Crown Prince...

76
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,860
and other officers.

77
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,700
For your own revenge,

78
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,260
you used Man Yao for your bidding
and her life as a bargaining chip.

79
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,140
To disrupt the order in the south,

80
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,540
you conspired with Sun Ji Zhou
to spread lies.

81
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
You caused the mutiny.

82
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,060
Your crimes are more than
what words could describe.

83
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,220
Now that you are in my hands,

84
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
you even tried to use your life...

85
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,020
to leave Man Yao with guilt.

86
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,420
Fu Chou,

87
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,700
I will never let you
get what you want.

88
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,300
Tell me.

89
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,420
What did you do to my mother's body?

90
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,100
Where is she now?

91
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,300
You are Sun Ji Zhou's student.

92
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,300
Me? Conspiring with him?

93
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,700
This is ridiculous.

94
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,020
As for your mother,

95
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,500
she is lying in her tomb.

96
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
If you remember your duty as her son,

97
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,980
you should sneak past
the enemy line...

98
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,700
and visit her yourself.

99
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,820
Do you even have such courage?

100
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,580
I just got the report.

101
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,820
The tomb collapsed
and my mother's remain is missing.

102
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,260
I do hate you.

103
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,140
I hate her as well.

104
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,980
But I will never use a deceased
just to hurt you.

105
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,860
Zongzheng Wu You!

106
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,260
If you dare hurt my son,

107
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,020
I will make you feel
the pain your whole life!

108
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,460
Please, save my son!

109
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,020
Let go of my son!

110
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,300
Your son?

111
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,860
Fu Yuan?

112
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,460
You are still alive?

113
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,420
Good.

114
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,660
You want to save your son?

115
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,180
Then hand over my mother's body...

116
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,540
all in one piece!

117
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,660
If not,

118
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,580
I will kill him!

119
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,980
Guards!

120
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,460
Prince Li, is this...

121
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,660
what you asked for?

122
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,180
Fu Yuan.

123
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,900
What did you do to my mother?

124
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,260
An idea came to my mind.

125
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,740
I wanted to visit my sister
at her tomb.

126
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,100
But she sobbed her frustration to me.

127
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,060
She got bored of that ice-cold tomb.

128
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,100
She wanted me to take her away.

129
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,500
I had no other choice
but to agree with her.

130
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,980
But I never thought...

131
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
you would spat at my kindness.

132
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,820
If you lay a finger on my son,
I will not show any mercy.

133
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,500
Don't you want your mother's remain?

134
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,660
I gave you the chance.

135
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,580
It was you who wasted it away.

136
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,260
You even destroyed my mother's remain.

137
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,420
All I have to do
is to kill you and your son.

138
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,660
I will apologise to my mother
once I am back in Zhongshan!

139
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,100
Wu You.

140
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,260
You knew the remain...

141
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,420
can only be preserved by keeping it
in the crystal coffin.

142
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,860
But you moved Lady Yun's remain...

143
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,860
from her tomb.

144
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,900
What exactly do you want?

145
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,860
Tell me, is her remain...

146
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,700
still intact and safe?

147
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,860
She has been dead for over a decade.

148
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,940
Of course the remain can't be
preserved outside the crystal coffin.

149
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,860
When you abandoned your nation
for a woman,

150
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,900
you should have seen this day coming.

151
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,860
This is the last chance you have.

152
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,580
I want my mother's remain...

153
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,980
returned in one piece!

154
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,660
Otherwise...

155
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,940
I will behead your son
right in front of you!

156
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,340
I dare you to do so!

157
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,380
If you dare,

158
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,580
let's see if it's easier
to kill someone...

159
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,060
or to crush this wooden chest.

160
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,660
-Stop!
-Wu You.

161
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,980
If it's his life you want,

162
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,580
we'll have our chances.

163
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,900
But your mother...

164
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,060
This is too great of a risk.

165
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,380
Fu Chou.

166
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,540
I swear in the name of heaven,

167
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,060
you won't get away alive next time.

168
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,660
Hold on.

169
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,820
We will let him go.

170
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,940
But you must hand over the chest.

171
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,380
As soon as my son is here,

172
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,060
I will lay the chest on the ground.

173
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,140
You can take it yourself.

174
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,460
If you play any tricks,

175
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,900
I will end both of you
with a dreadful death!

176
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,340
Get on the carriage.

177
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,420
Hand the chest over.

178
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,740
Mother.

179
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,940
I am sorry.

180
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,260
<i>The snow falls on my palm.</i>

181
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,140
<i>I just want to gaze
at you one more time.</i>

182
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,980
<i>I wait for the warmth of your gaze...</i>

183
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,220
<i>to melt it.</i>

184
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,740
<i>I am destined to fail as I met you.</i>

185
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,780
<i>I miss you but I can only
gaze at you in silence.</i>

186
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,500
<i>You are keeping me out with your care.</i>

187
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,860
<i>Although we are together, I feel lost.</i>

188
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,060
Fu Yuan!

189
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,300
<i>I will be your hearth
in the coldest of places.</i>

190
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,100
Wu You!

191
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,780
Wu You!

192
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,700
-Chang Jian.
-Yes.

193
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Pull over.

194
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,500
Chang Jian.

195
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,220
Give me your horse.

196
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,700
Your Highness.

197
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,540
Send Her Majesty to the palace.

198
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,460
-But...
-Wait.

199
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,780
Chou, what is this about?

200
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,140
Mother.

201
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,900
Chang Jian will send you back.

202
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,340
I...

203
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,060
I must go back there.

204
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,620
Going back?

205
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,900
Do you really wish to
get yourself killed?

206
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,940
Zongzheng Wu You hates you
to his very bone.

207
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,740
If you turn back now,

208
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,140
he will not let you
leave with your life.

209
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,180
I know you are trying to save me.

210
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,340
But why must you use
such a cruel mean?

211
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,220
You may be unfeeling in the past,

212
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,980
but you have become
much more gentle after we reunited.

213
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,700
But I never thought...

214
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,220
Are you surprised that...

215
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,540
I made Zongzheng Wu You
watch as her mother...

216
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,780
fades into oblivion?

217
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,620
Mother.

218
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,700
How could you...

219
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,020
make it sound so lightly?

220
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,340
Everything I told you...

221
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,220
was taken lightly as well.

222
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,340
You risked your life
and come here alone.

223
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,060
If I hadn't arrived in time,

224
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,620
you would have died by his blade.

225
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,060
But I have to go back there.

226
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,780
If I don't,

227
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,420
I will never be at peace.

228
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,300
What about the peace I deserve?

229
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,980
I was all alone...

230
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,180
in the palace full of sinister eyes.

231
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,540
I am worried for your safety.

232
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,780
I went through every plan
I could think of to finally...

233
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,460
figure out a way to save your skin.

234
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,020
But this is unnecessary.

235
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,900
This is unnecessary!

236
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,100
If you rush to your own death,

237
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,660
you won't be the only life
that is lost.

238
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,900
There will also be the soul...

239
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,620
of your pitiful mother you abandoned
in this cruel world!

240
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,540
What are you waiting for?

241
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,380
Help His Highness to the carriage.

242
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,900
We are leaving this place!

243
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,860
Help His Highness to the carriage.

244
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,660
Your Highness, let's go.

245
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,500
Your Highness, you need to rest well.

246
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,780
Thank you, doctor.

247
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
I shall take my leave now.

248
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,900
Your Highness, there is a
contraption under the chest.

249
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,180
Once it's opened,

250
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,900
the bottom of the chest
will open on the slightest touch.

251
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,500
I am afraid Lady Yun's ashes...

252
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,620
are already blown away by the gust.

253
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,700
Is my mother asleep?

254
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,020
Yes. She said she is tired
from the journey all day.

255
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,260
She went to bed.

256
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,420
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

257
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,740
Do not bother His Highness
unless it's urgent.

258
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,260
-Yes.
-Wait.

259
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,540
-What is it?
-Your Highness.

260
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,700
Prince Li and his soldiers retreated.

261
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,100
But his consort is still there.

262
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,660
Rong Le?

263
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,780
What is she doing there?

264
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,700
She kneeling in the snow
and digging for something.

265
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,500
-Dismiss.
-Yes.

266
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,140
Your Highness?

267
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,180
The doctor just advised you
to rest well.

268
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,820
You must take care of yourself.

269
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,660
Ready the carriage.

270
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,380
Ready the carriage.

271
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,780
Yes.

272
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,140
Rong Le.

273
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,380
Stop digging.

274
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,500
Rong Le, stop it.

275
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,140
Rong Le.

276
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,380
Rong Le, stop digging.

277
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,500
Rong Le, stop it.

278
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,780
Rong Le, stop it!

279
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,300
Rong Le, stop it.

280
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,740
Let go of me.

281
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,500
Rong Le.

282
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,540
It's pointless to dig for ashes now.

283
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,380
The wind is too strong.

284
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,500
All the ashes are blown away.

285
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,860
Even if you dig a grave here,

286
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,460
there is nothing to be buried.

287
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,300
There is nothing!

288
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,860
Rong Le.

289
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
Rong Le.

290
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,900
Leave me alone!

291
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,420
I spent a year...

292
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,540
to walk out from the
shadow of the past.

293
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,180
As soon as you are here,

294
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,860
I lost everything.

295
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,060
Zongzheng Wu You
is the reason you are happy.

296
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,620
That isn't your fault.

297
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,060
Do you honestly think
there could be any happiness for us?

298
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,340
Your mother is right.

299
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,540
In order to save me,

300
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,420
he gave up on all that
could have been his.

301
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,740
He gave you the chance to hurt him.

302
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,780
So tell me,

303
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,380
how is this not my fault?

304
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,380
I am to be blamed.

305
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,140
Zongzheng Wu You
won't blame you for this.

306
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,900
Yes, he won't.

307
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,420
But he will blame himself
for his mother's fate.

308
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,780
He will never shake away this guilt.

309
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,660
Fu Chou.

310
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,660
Leave my sight now if you
understand how much I hate you!

311
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,180
I don't want to see you again!

312
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,660
Perhaps...

313
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,540
I shouldn't come here at all.

314
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,060
<i>Wu You.</i>

315
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,820
<i>Wu You.</i>

316
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,860
Mother.

317
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,740
Come to me.

318
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,500
Your Highness, reports from
the prison guards.

319
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,140
Sun Ji Zhou escaped.

320
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,140
I have ordered the men
to conduct a man-hunt.

321
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,660
Your Highness.

322
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,700
My condolences for what
happened to Lady Yun.

323
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,020
I must avenge my parents' deaths!

324
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,300
Send out my order.

325
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,260
Gather the troops and provision.

326
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,900
I am launching an
assault on Zhongshan!

327
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,740
I swear I will slay...

328
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,620
both Fu Yuan and Fu Chou!

329
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,500
Your Highness,
I just received reports...

330
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,540
that the Consort is yet to return.

331
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,380
Should we search for her?

332
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,820
Anger caused blood congestion
at your heart last night.

333
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,300
I panicked.

334
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,260
So I chose to send you
back as a priority.

335
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,420
The Consort said she has work to do.

336
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,980
I assumed she would be back soon.

337
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,540
Man Yao?

338
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,300
Man Yao?

339
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,620
Man Yao?

340
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,940
Captain Xiao, there is
no sign of Sun Ji Zhou.

341
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,140
Captain Xiao, we found nothing either.

342
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,020
You, search every corner of the house.

343
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,220
Yes.

344
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,940
What do you want?

345
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,580
Captain Xiao, these are just
some clothes and jewellery.

346
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,500
There is no suspicious letters.

347
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,900
Your father just escaped the prison.

348
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,660
And now you are in a hurry to leave.

349
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,020
Are you meeting your father somewhere?

350
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,380
I don't know what you
are talking about.

351
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,420
If you refuse to confess,

352
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,100
then you shall come with us.

353
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,620
With you around, your father
will surely show himself.

354
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,460
-Take her away.
-Yes!

355
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,820
-Come with us!
-Miss Sun!

356
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,580
-Let go of me!
-Miss Sun!

357
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,100
-All right, dismiss.
-Yes.

358
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,500
Princess Rong Le,
the medicine has gone cold.

359
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,220
You should drink it now.

360
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,180
Why does this soup
has the taste of blood?

361
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,340
I brewed this soup
with the Blood Raven Root.

362
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,340
I am not drinking it.

363
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,220
No, Princess Rong Le.

364
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,620
You knelt in the snow for so long,
it took a toll on your body.

365
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,020
The coldness of the snow
is causing a relapse by the poison.

366
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,540
It wasn't easy to nurse you
back to health.

367
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,460
You are still in a bad shape.

368
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,540
If you don't take this medicine,

369
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,700
we won't have enough time
to search for a cure for your illness.

370
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,460
She is right.
Please, take the medicine.

371
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,260
So be it then.

372
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,260
You did your best.

373
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,220
I tried all I could.

374
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,140
This is my fate.

375
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,980
There is nothing we can do.

376
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,540
Princess.

377
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,340
He killed my father...

378
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,340
and now my mother is gone.

379
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,660
I hate him just as much.

380
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,420
But compared to your life,

381
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,260
owing him a favour for the herb...

382
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,980
is no big deal.

383
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,540
Don't think too much.

384
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,340
Rest well.

385
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,580
Wu You.

386
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,220
I am sorry.

387
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,460
This is all my fault.

388
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,260
Do not blame yourself.

389
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,020
I made this choice.

390
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,940
It's not your fault.

391
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,580
Rest well.

392
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,540
Your Highness, Sun Ji Zhou
is waiting outside.

393
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,140
Even if he runs from me,

394
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,940
I still have score to settle with him.

395
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,980
This could be good.

396
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,900
He actually come here by himself.

397
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,540
Let him in.

398
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,020
Yes.

399
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,620
It's been a year, how are you?

400
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,180
I am fine.
But you on the other hand...

401
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,140
is not doing so well.

402
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,460
I turned over a new leaf.

403
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,460
I will get back on my feet.

404
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,460
But there is something
that worries me.

405
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,300
Turning over a new leaf?

406
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,100
Do you mind enlighten me
how you are supposed to do so?

407
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,580
My daughter is still in Qingzhou.

408
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,220
I am willing to trade
military secret of the south...

409
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,180
for you to invade Qingzhou...

410
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,220
and reunite me with my daughter.

411
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,220
Sir Sun, why do you think
I would agree with this deal?

412
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,340
I have known you for years.

413
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,700
I think I have aided Your Highness
in some way.

414
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,060
Because of your deed
in the battles of south,

415
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,980
you became a renowned general.

416
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,700
Because of my support for you,
you became the Prince Regent.

417
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,420
And now, I have top secret
information of the south.

418
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,140
I can aid you in your campaign.
