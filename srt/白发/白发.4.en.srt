Episode 4

3
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,920
But this letter means nothing to me.

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,200
It's not worth a person's life.

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
Brother.

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,000
But for me, Miss Chen Yu is worth
more than any treasure.

7
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
Fine.

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,280
You may trade your hand...

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,520
for her life.

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,920
I have no other forte.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
My only strong point...

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,080
is that I know a little bit
about the art of steeping.

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,000
I heard that you love tea.

14
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,840
At first, I thought that if I can
show my skills in front of you,

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
I would live a life with no regrets.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,160
But from the looks of it now,

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
I would not have that chance anymore.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
Can you lend me your sword?

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,360
-Leng Yan.
-Yes, Your Highness.

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,040
My sword.

21
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,920
Brother, wait for me.

22
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,000
Madam Qin.

23
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,120
Since Miss Chen Yu
has offended Prince Li,

24
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,640
she'll only bring troubles
for you if she stays here.

25
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm very close with Prince Li.

26
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,160
I can buy her from you.

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,120
But now, she has no value anymore.

28
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,800
Chen Yu was once the
famous steal of the show here.

29
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,360
How much do you want?

30
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
-500 tael.
-100 tael.

31
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,880
I had taken care of her
for so many years.

32
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,800
-100 tael is not enough.
-50 tael.

33
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,920
100 tael and no less.
She's considered sold to you.

34
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,920
What a wench you are.

35
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
How dare you ruin my business.

36
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
Go now.

37
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Thank you, mister.

38
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

39
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Mistress.

40
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,080
Thank you for your kindness.

41
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,440
This is Long Yue.

42
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Long Yue, she is the new
instrumentalist that I hired,

43
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Chen Yu.

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,440
From now on, you can stay in
the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,200
You had taken good care of me.

46
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,760
If you want to ask me anything,

47
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,800
I'll gladly answer your question
without pause.

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Quick, get up now.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Your father is the former
subordinate of Chief Minister Qin.

50
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,960
I think you know a thing
or two about Qin family.

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,160
I wonder if you have heard about
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
Yes.

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,120
My father was once the
co-writer of this book.

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
Where is this book now?

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,720
I was only seven when
they confiscated the house.

56
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,480
My father hit me unconscious and
asked somebody to bring me away.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,520
When I woke up,

58
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,520
everything had changed.

59
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
I've reminded you of
your depressing past.

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,080
This is my fate. It's not your fault.

62
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
From then on,
I was stripped to nothing...

63
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
and led a vagabond life.

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,960
And after that, I never heard
anything about Qin family.

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
Miss, for the things
that you ask me today,

66
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll not tell anybody about it...

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,120
and I'll bring this secret
to my grave.

68
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,320
-Long Yue.
-Bring her to her room to rest.

69
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,480
-Yes, Mistress.
-Thank you, Miss.

70
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,880
This way please.

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,920
It is indeed the work of the
crown prince and his gang.

72
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,640
Brother, if we continue to
investigate along this evidence,

73
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
we can bring him down for sure.

74
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,840
We can't let Sir Zhao die for nothing.

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,040
By the way, the mistress of
Moon Embrace Teahouse...

76
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
is indeed courageous.

77
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,480
If we can really reveal
the truth of this case,

78
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,880
she would have done
the country a good deed.

79
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,120
She is not as simple
as you think she is.

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
She didn't lie but she was
not telling the truth either.

81
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
I think she already...

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,720
discovered this letter
since a long time ago.

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,680
As for the matter regarding Chen Yu,

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,920
I think that mistress
is the only one...

85
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,040
who dares to complicate things for me.

86
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
Who is it?

87
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Open the door!

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,520
Somebody help! Anybody there?

89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Open the door! Somebody, help!

90
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Somebody, help!

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,560
Fire! Somebody, help! There's fire!

92
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
-Somebody, help!
-Water, quick!

93
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,120
What is happening?

94
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,240
-Water!
-Quick!

95
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,600
-Stop, what happened?
-Captain. The kitchen is on fire.

96
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,440
Madam Qiu Yi gathering every servant
to go and put out the fire.

97
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,280
-Princess.
-Where is Lian Xin?

98
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,640
-Fire!
-Please stay calm.

99
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
I'll check on Lian Xin.

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,560
The kitchen is quite far from here.
Please wait inside the room.

101
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Don't go near to the fire.

102
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
Don't be afraid.

103
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,920
-I'm here.
-Get the water!

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
This way!

105
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,440
-Quick!
-Coming!

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
Get the water!

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,920
-Sir.
-The guards are doing patrol when...

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,240
we spot the flames here.

109
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,080
We are ordered to protect the princess
and the safety of this city.

110
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,280
-We can help with the fire.
-You came on the right time.

111
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
We don't have enough people here.

112
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank you for your
willingness to help.

113
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,160
-Help me! Any water left?
-Yes!

114
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,720
Quick! Pass it over!

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,120
Here you go!

116
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,680
Here!

117
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,320
-Assassin!
-Go and put off the kitchen fire.

118
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,720
-The rest, follow me to kill him.
-Roger that!

119
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
<i>They only said to let
Sir Yu in to the manor.</i>

120
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,400
<i>Why will there be an assassin?</i>

121
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,840
<i>If they look into it,</i>

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
<i>they will charge me
with capital offence.</i>

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,080
The water is here!

124
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,480
-Get more water here! Quick!
-Get more water!

125
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,160
Get me another bowl of water!

126
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
Lian Xin!

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
Lian Xin.

128
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,560
Get the water here! Quick!

129
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Get more water here! Quick!

130
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,400
Where are you going to run to?

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
-Sir!
-Go.

132
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,280
-Are you alright, Sir?
-Are you alright, Sir?

133
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,520
Princess, be careful!

134
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,000
-Push!
-Sir!

135
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,680
-Sir, are you alright?
-Sir!

136
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,880
-Sir!
-Are you alright, Sir?

137
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,240
-Sir!
-Sir, are you alright?

138
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
Princess.

139
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
No, Princess.

140
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,320
Don't do it, Princess.
This is inappropriate.

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
-Sir!
-Sir, are you alright?

142
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,240
-Sir!
-Sir!

143
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,960
-Are you alright?
-Sir, are you alright?

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,280
-Sir!
-Sir, say something!

145
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Sir!

146
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,960
Sir!

147
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,440
Ling Yue!

148
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,120
Ling Yue!

149
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,640
Ling Yue!

150
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,320
Ling Yue!

151
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,720
-Princess.
-Are you alright?

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,400
-Sir!
-Don't be afraid.

153
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,080
-Go and hide first. Don't be afraid.
-Sir!

154
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,760
-Sir!
-Go now.

155
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,920
-Quick.
-Are you alright, Sir?

156
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,800
-Say something! Are you alright?
-Sir!

157
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,280
Help!

158
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,360
Help!

159
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,040
-Princess.
-How dare this scoundrel...

160
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,520
takes advantage of me!

161
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
Arrest him!

162
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,800
Quick!

163
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,600
-Step aside! Princess.
-I was sleeping just now.

164
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,840
Then I saw someone walking up to me
and tried to take advantage of me.

165
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,520
I was so scared. So, I hit him
with a vase and ran outside.

166
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,080
Scoundrel.

167
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,560
Scoundrel!

168
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Today, I am going to teach
this low-life a lesson.

169
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,200
If any of you dare to stop me,

170
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
don't blame me for being
heartless towards you.

171
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,520
Our dereliction of duty has caused
such disgrace to you, my princess.

172
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
Please punish us.

173
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
Stop, Xiao Sha.

174
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm having a headache.

175
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,200
Princess.

176
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,480
Princess, are you alright?

177
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
Are you alright, Princess?

178
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,920
Your Majesty, the pulse condition
of the princess is chaotic.

179
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,040
I think she was too frightened...

180
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,080
until it caused her a headache.

181
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,240
She need to rest well.

182
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,280
I'll treat her again after a few days.

183
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
Alright, you may leave.

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll take my leave then.

185
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,880
Scoundrel.

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,480
How dare you do something so obscene.

187
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,720
You are a disgrace to our country.

188
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
Why do I need to keep you?

189
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,000
My sins are punishable by death.

190
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,520
But it was an emergency.

191
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,920
I went into the princess's room
in order to pursue the assassin.

192
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
All the servants in the
Princess Manor can attest to that.

193
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,920
I went into the princess's room...

194
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,720
and fell onto her bed after I
was wounded by the assassin.

195
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,640
I thought that the
princess fancied me.

196
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,160
That's why I acted inappropriately.

197
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,840
But all in all,
I just want to protect the princess.

198
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,640
I fancy the princess.

199
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,560
I'm willing to atone
for my misbehaviour.

200
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,520
Such nonsense!

201
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,160
You said that you were there
to arrest the assassin.

202
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,000
Where is the assassin?

203
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,520
The people that you
brought along can attest that...

204
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,520
when I opened the door,
you were the only one inside.

205
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
We didn't see any assassin.

206
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm innocent.

207
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,720
I really went into the princess's room
in pursuit of the assassin.

208
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,080
After that, I lost to the enemy...

209
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,880
and he managed to escape.

210
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
General Yu.

211
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,920
You made up the story...

212
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,280
about that assassin.

213
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
The assassin is fake.

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,840
The truth is, you wanted to
take advantage of the princess.

215
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Your Majesty.

216
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
Ever since the princess comes here,

217
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,720
first, she was barred from coming in.

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,600
Then, she was rejected
in a full court.

219
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,800
Now,

220
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
General Yu is creating
a story about assassin...

221
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
in order to destroy
my princess's innocence.

222
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,520
So much humiliation.

223
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,520
Looks like the Northern Realm...

224
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,280
is treating Western Qi as a nobody.

225
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,200
May I ask, where is the
etiquette of Northern Realm?

226
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
Where is the sincerity...

227
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
to from this alliance?

228
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,360
Your Majesty.

229
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,120
I didn't teach my son well...

230
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,720
until he did this kind of thing
that will bring harm to the country.

231
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,080
After I heard the news yesterday,
I searched the whole city immediately.

232
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,200
And I managed to arrest the assassin.

233
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,440
You can interrogate him.

234
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,120
Bring him in.

235
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,120
Your Majesty. He has
already confessed his crime.

236
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
He is the spy planted
in our country by Chen.

237
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,040
He wanted to assassinate
the princess in order to...

238
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,280
destroy the alliance between
us and Western Qi.

239
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,640
I already asked...

240
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,440
those guards that went along
with my son yesterday night.

241
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
They said that this man...

242
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,160
looks like the assassin who barged
into the Princess Manor yesterday.

243
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,480
Take him away and off with his head.

244
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,920
This time, it's my subject
who had done you wrong.

245
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
As for how to deal with him,

246
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,400
it'll be up to you, Princess.

247
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,640
Your Majesty.

248
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
I think that no matter it's
a misunderstanding or not,

249
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,800
I hope that we can
resolve this quietly.

250
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm an unmarried woman.

251
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
And I came to Northern Realm
for this alliance marriage.

252
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,280
First, I don't wish to make a
big fuss about this matter...

253
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,880
because it'll ruin my reputation.

254
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
Secondly,

255
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,120
if my brother hears about this news,

256
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,080
he'll be distressed and anxious.

257
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,800
And it will affect the relationship
between two countries.

258
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,880
The princess is indeed very virtuous.

259
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you, Princess.

260
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,360
Princess, do you have
any other requests?

261
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,640
Princess.

262
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,120
Your Majesty.
I have a severe headache.

263
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,840
I just want to rest.

264
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,360
Your Majesty, I think that...

265
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,200
the assassin can barged into
Princess Manor while there's no one...

266
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
because the guards don't really
understand her living habit.

267
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,200
That's why there was an oversight.

268
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
Please return the guards of Western Qi
back to the Princess Manor.

269
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,520
I don't trust anybody else
besides them.

270
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,960
Alright, I'll grant your wish.

271
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

272
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
Yu Wen Jie.

273
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Although it's with reason,
it's still true that...

274
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,320
you had offended the Princess.

275
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,320
No capital punishment,
but you'll be punished nevertheless.

276
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,920
Fifty beatings...

277
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,600
and two ranks down.

278
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,320
-Bring him away.
-Yes, Your Majesty!

279
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm innocent!

280
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,400
Father!

281
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,840
I'm innocent!

282
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,360
Your Majesty, I don't feel well.

283
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,080
I'll take my leave first.

284
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,760
Please go back and rest.

285
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,520
Princess, all the guards from
Northern Realm have been changed.

286
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,840
Now, we are surrounded only by
our guards and Madam Qiu Yi is here.

287
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Princess.

288
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,840
Princess. If you still need
my service after this,

289
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,040
please don't forget to come to me.

290
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,440
Madam. The way you said it, those who
know will think that you are diligent.

291
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
Those who don't will think
that our princess...

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,440
chased you away because she's petty.

293
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,120
Move along then.

294
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
Move along.

295
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll take my leave.

296
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,360
-Xiao Sha.
-Yes, Princess.

297
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,560
Princess, Minister Yu
has found a scapegoat.

298
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,440
And we can't revolt
against Northern Realm.

299
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,920
Although the real assassin is in
our hands, we can't expose them.

300
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,480
From now on,
we have to be more careful.

301
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,960
Yes, Princess.

302
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Ling Yue and Lian Xin must
have been in a shock too.

303
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,480
Lian Xin. Treat your wound with care.

304
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,120
Now, the manor is
surrounded by our people.

305
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,640
Both of you can be more relaxed.

306
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,800
By the way, where is the assassin
that was knocked unconscious?

307
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,840
That day, after I changed...

308
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,000
and came out from the room, I saw that
the hiding spot for the assassin...

309
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,080
was not very secure. I was afraid that
he'll cause troubles if he wakes.

310
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
That's why me and Lian Xin
tied up his hands and legs...

311
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
and threw him into
the firewood storeroom.

312
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
After that, we rushed to your side...

313
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,960
and we don't know what happened next.

314
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
That's right.

315
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,880
I already took care of him.

316
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
Are you alright?

317
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,400
I'm alright. The princess came
right on time yesterday.

318
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,400
I had failed my duty...

319
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,080
and gave those low-lives
an opportunity to cause harm.

320
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,240
Don't worry. I'll not let that
person of the hook so easily.

321
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
Actually, you don't need to
feel unfair towards me.

322
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,280
This kind of grievance is nothing.

323
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,680
Our main concern is princess.
We can't let the princess be affected.

324
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
This is for you.

325
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,160
I had already washed it.

326
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
I'll return it to you.

327
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,880
Your Majesty, Prince Fan Yang is here.

328
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

329
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,320
Xuan Ming.

330
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,480
Be at ease. Sit down.

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

332
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
Xuan Ming.

333
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,280
What do you think about the
assassination that happened...

334
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,080
in the Princess Manor last time?

335
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,320
You already have your conclusion.

336
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,440
Why did you ask me?

337
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
This matter...

338
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,120
is clearly the work of the
crown prince and Yu Shi Hai.

339
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
But in order to preserve
the dignity of Northern Realm,

340
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
I have to cover it up.

341
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,680
The crown prince has
disappointed me for so many times.

342
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm really worried to
entrust him with...

343
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,400
the whole nation.

344
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,440
I know that your preferred choice
for crown prince is Wu You.

345
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,120
But...

346
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,160
the misunderstanding
between you and Wu You...

347
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,440
Today,

348
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,080
it's Yun's death anniversary.

349
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,280
She had reminded me over and over...

350
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,000
before her passing.

351
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,720
How can I not keep my word?

352
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,720
Yun.

353
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,360
Yun.

354
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,720
Your Majesty.

355
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,840
I don't have much time left.

356
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,240
Promise me.

357
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,240
Wu You is a very sentimental person.

358
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,920
He has no interest in power.

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,840
If you force him,

360
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,160
you'll only push him into...

361
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
the abyss of endless sufferings.

362
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,400
Yun.

363
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,360
I...

364
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,080
If you really care about Wu You,

365
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,160
when he grows up,

366
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,680
give him a rank where
he can live freely.

367
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,200
Let him live a carefree life.

368
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
Promise me.

369
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,520
Promise me.

370
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,160
Useless thing.

371
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
-Pardon me, Your Majesty.
-Get lost!

372
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,360
Quick.

373
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,760
Useless thing.
You are not sensible at all.

374
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,600
How can you make mistake today?
Leave now.

375
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,160
Escort me.

376
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,400
Escort me to Yun's Tomb.

377
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,800
Your Majesty.

378
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,800
Brother.

379
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,760
" Yun's Tomb "

380
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,200
Lady Yun.

381
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,360
I'm here to pay you respect.

382
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,840
I hope that you can rest in peace.

383
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,520
Father.

384
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,680
Why are you here?

385
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,760
When Lady Yun was still alive,
I remember...

386
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,720
her care towards me.

387
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,000
For me, Lady Yun is just
like my real mother.

388
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,760
Today is her death anniversary.

389
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,760
Of course I need to come
and pay her respect.

390
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,560
At least you still remember
her care towards you.

391
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
Lady Yun.

392
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,720
I remember your kindness towards me.

393
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,440
Don't worry. In this life,

394
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,440
I'll take good care of Wu You...

395
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,360
just like how you had
taken care of me.

396
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,200
" Yun's Tomb "

397
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,880
Mother.

398
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm here to see you.

399
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,120
You are humble, modest...

400
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,440
and always compromise
for the sake of others.

401
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,360
In the end,

402
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,000
remorse and regrets are
the only things you get.

403
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,560
I promise you.

404
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
I won't be like that.

405
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
I'll live freely for my whole life.

406
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,720
I won't give anybody
a chance to let me down.

407
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,320
Mother.

408
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,800
Yun.

409
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm here to see you.

410
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
My mother doesn't want to see you.

411
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,960
You are the cause of her death.

412
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,000
Please leave.

413
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,880
Fu Yuan had spiked my drinks.

414
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
And that's why...

415
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,800
I hurt Yun.

416
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,240
You brought Fu Yuan here,
have you forgotten?

417
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,480
In order to gain power,

418
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,360
in order to secure your position,

419
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,640
you betrayed your promise
to my mother.

420
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,120
You married with other.
You have an imperial harem.

421
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,880
You are the one who broke
her heart and ended her life.

422
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I have no other choice.

423
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,400
Everything I did is for our country.

424
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,400
I did it for the greater cause
for Zong Zheng family.

425
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,640
Your Majesty.

426
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,640
You are too greedy.

427
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,680
You just sized up the situation and
took everything beneficial to you.

428
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,440
You clearly know that in this life,
you can't be loyal to one woman only.

429
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,800
But in order to gain
my mother's heart,

430
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
you made a false promise.

431
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,560
You tricked her.

432
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,440
Your mother is the only one I love.

433
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,680
Why can't you be understanding of me?

434
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,880
Why should I be understanding
towards you?

435
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
Because of your lies
and your betrayal,

436
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,560
my mother had suffered
her whole life in depression.

437
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,920
Wu You.

438
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,560
Your mother's death...

439
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,640
hurt me more than it hurt you.

440
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,880
She has left us for 16 years.

441
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,960
-Are you going to blame me forever?
-Yes.

442
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,640
I won't forgive you.

443
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,560
You'll disturb my mother...

444
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
if you stay here.

445
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,280
Please leave.

446
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,720
According to a
secret message from Kite,

447
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,240
the fire in Princess Manor...

448
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,640
was indeed planned by the
father-son duo of Yu family.

449
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,680
Anything else?

450
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Qiu Yi, the housekeeper
from Princess Manor...

451
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,680
went missing after that day.

452
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,640
But not long ago, we found her dead
inside a manor in a village.

453
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,840
I think she had accepted
the bribe from Yu family.

454
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,400
But after the plan failed,
she was silenced with death.

455
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,400
This father-son duo from Yu family
is indeed cruel and merciless.

456
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,120
Yu family has stayed in
Northern Realm for three generations.

457
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,960
Their power is deeply rooted here.

458
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,720
And they help the crown prince
with his personal gain.

459
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,000
In the future, you have to
guard against them.

460
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,640
But, when I investigate about the
father-son duo of Yu family,

461
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,560
I found a clue about
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

462
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,000
Yu family is related to The Book
of Mountains and Rivers as well?

463
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,040
Yu family's fort doesn't
belong to them originally.

464
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,440
That mansion used to be
the house of Qin Yong.

465
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,280
After Qin Yong and
his family were killed,

466
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,080
it was given to the new minister
of the Ministry of Personnel,

467
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,240
Yu Shi Hai.

468
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,760
Qin Yong?

469
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,280
So, did you find anything
in Yu family's fort?

470
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,760
Yu Shi Hai is a very
petty and cautious man.

471
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,080
He renovated the whole
mansion after he got it.

472
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,360
And he turned the mansion
into a well-guarded fort.

473
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,840
Now, Yu family is very well-known.

474
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,480
That is because...

475
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,640
many people have forgotten that
it was once the house of Qin Yong.

476
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,480
Report this news to
my brother immediately.

477
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,120
One more thing.
Please pass this letter to him.

478
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Yes, Princess.

479
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,120
Miss Long Yue. Prince Li is here.

480
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
-He is alone?
-Yes.

481
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,920
Today is his mother,
Yun's death anniversary.

482
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,320
Why will he come here?

483
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

484
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,320
I didn't get a good look before.

485
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,920
But the scenery here is amazing.

486
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,200
This is indeed the
best teahouse in Zhongshan.

487
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,360
Thank you for the compliment.

488
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,680
But Moon Embrace Teahouse is
not famous for it's scenery...

489
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,560
but for it's tea.

490
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,400
I had tasted the tea from Moon Embrace
Teahouse for quite a few times.

491
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,120
I don't think that it's any special.

492
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,480
I think the way to enjoy tea
is not about the tea itself...

493
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
but the state of mind one has
when one drinks tea.

494
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,280
How about you taste it again today?

495
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,840
Alright.

496
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,480
Taste it, Your Highness.

497
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,520
You said that tea tasting
is about the state of mind.

498
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,960
What do you think about...

499
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,640
my state of mind right now?

500
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,640
Looks like you are
troubled by something.

501
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,400
Looks like you know
how to read a person too.

502
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,720
Your Highness.

503
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,680
You can't change the past
but you can build the future.

504
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,960
How about you relax your mind...

505
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,200
and taste the tea in earnest?

506
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,760
You are really different from
other girls that I had met.

507
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,400
You are smart and you talk very well.

508
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,440
Just that sometime,
you are too reckless.

509
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,520
You are indeed not
as simple as you seemed.

510
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,320
Just because we have no guidance,

511
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,680
it doesn't mean that
we are uncultured.

512
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,680
You are not a simple man too.

513
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,280
Are you complimenting me...

514
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,360
or are you complimenting yourself?

515
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,440
You know how to play chess, right?

516
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,880
When we first started,
you seemed unsure.

517
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,320
But after a few rounds,

518
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,200
you can obviously win the game...

519
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,560
but every time,
you let me win instead.

520
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,320
And every time,
you just play it half-heartedly.

521
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,480
It's been a long time since I
last played so I'm quite rusty.

522
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,640
You are not in a good mood today.

523
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,640
So, I thought you want
to relax by drinking tea.

524
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,520
Chess is just a game.

525
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,880
I don't think I need to be
too serious about it.

526
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
Man Yao?

527
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,160
Like the blooming flowers...

528
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,120
that are bright and colourful,

529
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,200
a lady is going to get married
in a wondrous day.

530
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,080
Is that what your name means?

531
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,600
As for your name,

532
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,480
I think you parents...

533
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,520
hope that you can
live a carefree life.

534
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,640
To be exact, it is to have nothing.

535
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,640
It means I'll have nothing.

536
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,520
I'll live an empty life,
I'll have nothing...

537
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,400
and nothing will stay.

538
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,760
Since you are here, show yourselves.

539
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,160
<i>I think of you when the moon is full,</i>

540
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,800
<i>when it's a crescent
and when it's white.</i>

541
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,560
<i>You who came to a strange land
to build our lands together.</i>

542
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,960
<i>I think of you
when night has fallen...</i>

543
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,880
<i>and when the fog has parted.</i>

544
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,000
<i>My yearning for you has turned you...</i>

545
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
<i>into my reason.</i>

546
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,080
<i>You are my happiness,
my worries and...</i>

547
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,520
<i>my abyss.</i>

548
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,520
<i>I can't touch you for you are like...</i>

549
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
<i>the reflection in water.</i>

550
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,440
<i>I don't want distance
but I stayed away from you.</i>

551
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,040
<i>I want to do it but I can't.</i>

552
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,000
<i>I just want to watch you...</i>

553
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,560
<i>in this cold world.</i>

554
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,320
<i>I'm envious of your shadow
that follows you.</i>

555
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,920
<i>Do you want to have a drink with me?</i>

556
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,240
<i>The useless tears that
we are born with...</i>

557
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,800
<i>are for us to waste it.</i>

558
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,160
<i>Rather than having no worries...</i>

559
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,240
<i>and having a dull life,</i>

560
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,080
<i>I rather pursue you.</i>

561
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,080
<i>Even though the flower
might wilt and I might fail...</i>

562
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,720
Brother.

563
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,600
You can touch woman now?

564
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,040
-Search the place!
-Yes.

565
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,680
Brother.

566
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,480
Brother, why can you touch woman now?

567
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,680
Brother, why did you break your taboo?
What happened?

568
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,400
Mistress, are you alright?

569
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,280
Long Yue.
This place has become a target.

570
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,760
We have to leave immediately.

571
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,160
Don't worry.
I'll stay and tie up the ends.

572
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
" Black Bamboo Garden "
