00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:06,895
" Princess Silver "

2
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:09,705
Episode 55

3
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,681
Why are you back again?

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,280
Why are you here?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,280
Rong Le.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,840
You should come with me.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,303
I am sure you should know by now...

8
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:28,472
that the poison inside of you
is the Destined Poison.

9
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,406
You should also know...

10
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:33,542
I am the only one who can
remove the poison for you.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,759
What are you going to do this time?

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,853
I told you.

13
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,097
I am taking you with me
to cure you of this poison.

14
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,994
Don't bother waiting for their rescue.

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,252
If I can reach this room,

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,565
I would have already get rid
of those who will stop me.

17
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,569
If you wish for them to be safe,

18
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:02,501
and you hope for your child to live,

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,428
you must come with me.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,426
This is the only way.

21
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:17,355
I...

22
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,811
You have to trust me.

23
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:23,274
You don't want your child to
be born with a damaged body...

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,422
or lose his mother.

25
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:30,100
Rong Le.

26
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,096
If you promise me to come with me,

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,960
I will make sure both
you and your child are safe.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,746
Trust me, will you?

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,989
What?

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,652
Man Yao is gone?

31
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:51,998
Yes, when we went back,

32
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,745
Consort Rong Le is already gone.

33
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,822
All the men I sent to
keep watch on her...

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,212
are all drugged by someone.

35
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:01,114
After they are awake,
Her Highness is nowhere to be found.

36
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:02,999
I have informed the Hidden Ones...

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,899
to set up checkpoints around Qingzhou.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,797
All the routes are sealed off
for investigation.

39
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:10,490
I am afraid if she passed
the border of Qingzhou,

40
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:13,113
it would be like searching
a needle in the haystack.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,215
If she is kidnapped,

42
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:19,000
with her brilliant mind,
she will find a way to contact us.

43
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:21,115
Unless...

44
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:24,315
she left just to
avoid seeing me again.

45
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:26,572
The world is endless,

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,346
we might never find
any tracks of her again.

47
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,323
Your Highness, she is still
carrying sickness.

48
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,324
We can't let her leave.

49
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:36,056
Even if she left the south,

50
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,786
you can always send letters
to the neighbouring nations.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,250
Be it Chen or Western Qi,
we will figure out a way.

52
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,324
I can go to the north for you.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,097
We can ask for Prince Regent's help.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,735
Very well, I am sending him a letter.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,291
Please, hand it over for me.

56
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,707
Are you certain you will
leaving on your own?

57
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,301
We can always fight together.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,460
Come with me to Zhongshan,
we will move on to other places.

59
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,940
It's better than
searching on your own.

60
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,601
Just like we did before,

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,305
we can help each other.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,288
I knew it all along.

63
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:28,307
You have always been there to
protect and look after me.

64
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,240
But this is different.

65
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:31,642
How is this any different?

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,021
You said you will forget about him
and wipe him from your memories.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,584
Are you afraid to see him again?

68
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,335
This has nothing to do with Fu Chou.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,729
It has nothing to do with anyone.

70
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,182
After going through so much,

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,974
lost and found,

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,784
and then lost yet again.

73
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,716
These experiences made me strong.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,380
I can fend for myself.

75
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,364
I have the strength to
protect those I care about.

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,766
If that is the case,
 why won't you come with me?

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,511
Because I know...

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,317
since we were kids,

79
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,149
you have always been in love with me.

80
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:17,090
I...

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,160
have unknowingly got used to
stay under your protection.

82
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,678
You were always there
to shield me from danger.

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,880
But now,

84
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,920
I need to leave the shelter
you provided me.

85
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:28,317
I hope...

86
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,918
you can live a life for your own sake.

87
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,531
Stop making so many sacrifices for me.

88
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,153
If you knew it all along,

89
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,997
you should understand...

90
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,670
that I did everything
out of my own free will.

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,920
You may pursue whatever you want.
As for what I wish for...

92
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,440
is to follow you all the way.

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,637
This time, we will split up.

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
We will meet when
fate brings us together again.

95
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,358
I will be waiting for you.

96
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,155
Sure.

97
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,253
So long.

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,917
So long.

99
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,891
The place you tried so hard
to bring me to...

100
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:08,800
is this house?

101
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,491
Indeed.

102
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:12,390
Back then,

103
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,927
you brought me to this place...

104
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:18,415
showed me the memories of the past
and told me about the life I had.

105
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,792
But I can't even tell...

106
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:24,509
which of those are lies.

107
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,617
Bringing me here was
never your true intention.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,620
You seek the Book of
Mountains and Rivers.

109
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,266
Did you poison me just because...

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,802
you wanted to get
your hands on the Book?

111
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,869
You lied to me saying that
I am your sister.

112
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,363
But your true motive was to take
my father's work for yourself.

113
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,398
Calm down for now.

114
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:04,114
You don't want anger
to hurt the child.

115
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,427
I am warning you.

116
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:08,946
Don't you dare try to hurt my child.

117
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:15,544
We have come this far.

118
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,899
I don't expect you to
cure me of anything.

119
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,323
If you have any intention
to hurt my child,

120
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,597
I assure you,

121
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,441
you will never get any information
about the Book from me.

122
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,582
This child...

123
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,847
is the second chance
fate bestowed upon you.

124
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,139
If you redirect the poison onto him...

125
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,316
Not a chance.

126
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,559
I will never trade a
child's life for mine.

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,294
I knew it.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,756
Even if you went through so much pain,

129
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,846
your resolve will never waver.

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,625
-I'll get a doctor for you.
-Never mind.

131
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,793
Let's have a look at the village.

132
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,191
I wonder if the road
of this village...

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,251
still looks familiar to you.

134
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,865
Come on.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Sir, you are back.

136
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,498
Sir, you are back.

137
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,499
Sir.

138
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:02,905
-Mrs. Yu.
-You are back!

139
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:03,966
Yes.

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,516
I have been cleaning the house
to await your return!

141
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,146
This is great.

142
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:11,948
Madam, it's been years.
You look even more gorgeous now.

143
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:14,032
Are you going to stay here for good?

144
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,992
-Madam?
-Mrs. Yu, while we are here,

145
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
we will be staying for some time.

146
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:19,968
Good.

147
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,800
Here.

148
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,800
I can't take this.
Please, I can't accept this.

149
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,108
I was only cleaning off some dust.

150
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,668
It wasn't any hard labour.

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,896
All the money you sent over the years
are more than enough for me.

152
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,839
You just got back
and it's already dusk.

153
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,400
Why don't you have a dinner
at my place?

154
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,845
I appreciate the offer.

155
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:40,774
But she...

156
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,368
is getting heavier.
She needs more rest.

157
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,583
Madam, you are expecting a child?

158
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,626
Now that I think about it,
you've been married for years.

159
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,064
Is this your first child?

160
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,599
Yes, this is the first.

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,599
Mrs. Yu.

162
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,756
-Please, no.
-You need to accept this.

163
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
I still have a favour for you.

164
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,337
-Sure.
-My wife here...

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,741
got a bit of bad temper
ever since she got pregnant.

166
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,370
I am taking her out
to get some fresh air.

167
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:14,156
My parents didn't know about this.

168
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:15,931
If someone asks about us,

169
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,686
just tell them we are your
distant relatives,

170
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,337
that we are here to ask for your help.

171
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:22,645
-I am sure you understand.
-I understand.

172
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,750
With wealth comes gossips.

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,400
You can count on me.

174
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,156
Not just the outsiders,

175
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,863
not even the officers
will get anything from me.

176
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,948
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Yu.

177
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:34,855
Man Er.

178
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,583
Try to be nice here,
we will talk about it at home.

179
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,160
-Goodbye, Mrs. Yu.
-Sure, goodbye.

180
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:43,654
Come on, Man Er.

181
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,124
-Have a nice day.
-Goodbye.

182
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:48,390
Watch your steps.

183
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,365
Isn't this Lord Qi from the back hill?

184
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,198
His wife is such a nuisance.

185
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,102
She should be grateful to have such
a thoughtful husband.

186
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:57,645
She even ran away from home.

187
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,698
Who knows where she has been to
all these years?

188
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,462
Lord Qi always came here depressed.

189
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,755
Watch your steps.

190
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:07,095
Why did you call me 'Man Er'?

191
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,258
Have we...

192
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,449
been here before?

193
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:14,726
You need to remember
what I said just now.

194
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,141
All you need to do is
to play your role.

195
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:18,826
Remember,

196
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:20,509
in this village,

197
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,409
'Man Er' is your name.

198
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,824
I will find a way to cure you.

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,588
But in return, you must
fulfil one wish for me.

200
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,488
The is the only wish
in my entire life...

201
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,360
that is mine alone.

202
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:34,977
What is it?

203
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:37,322
We will stay here for some time,

204
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,880
a life not bothered by anyone.

205
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,650
A normal life.

206
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,365
How long will it take?

207
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,621
Around five to six months.

208
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,072
Once the child is safely born,

209
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,595
I will cure you of the poison.

210
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,046
You will be free to go.

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,760
No.

212
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,169
It takes too long.

213
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,434
I am afraid...

214
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,398
I won't so much time to live.

215
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:12,126
My child,

216
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,640
I must hand him over
to Wu You myself.

217
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,598
I need to tell him...

218
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,526
to love this child with all he has.

219
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,205
Are you afraid you can't live
to see Wu You one last time?

220
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,297
Don't worry about it.

221
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,506
You will live.

222
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:36,247
I will give you back
the time you lost.

223
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,393
But you need to be sure...

224
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,362
that Zongzheng Wu You is
the one love that you want.

225
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:46,201
I will do whatever I can to make
your wish come true.

226
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:48,315
Definitely.

227
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,809
Let's go.

228
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:09,839
You have my word I will stay.

229
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:14,400
Why do you keep making
all kinds of requests?

230
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,490
Why did you even bring me here?

231
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,739
How about some greengages?

232
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:22,777
They were your favourite once.

233
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,692
Why don't we pick some for ourselves?

234
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,390
I am not eating those.

235
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,779
Who says greengage is my favourite?

236
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:31,710
You gave me your word...

237
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,234
you would fulfil my requests
for the next six months.

238
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,656
Man Er, come down here!

239
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,669
Be careful with the child!

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,442
Man Er! Come down!

241
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,821
I promise you, I won't make you
do anything you don't like.

242
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:13,956
Man Er!

243
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,695
We can brew greengage wine
just like that?

244
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,677
Correct.

245
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:25,602
This is how we used to brew
greengage wine together.

246
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:34,051
It'll be just in time.

247
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,567
We will use this wine
six months from now...

248
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,310
to mark our farewell.

249
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:45,542
Very well.

250
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,040
Six months from now,
we will finish this wine.

251
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,582
We will be even from that on.

252
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,682
I always thought
I couldn't hold my bottle,

253
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:05,996
but after some drinks
in the Northern Realm,

254
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,560
I might actually be a mindless
drunkard before this.

255
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,613
As long as you like it,

256
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:13,281
I promise you,

257
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,322
while we are here,

258
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,564
I will make your wishes come true.

259
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,351
Remember what I told you.

260
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:32,195
Live on.

261
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,568
Live like every day is the last day
you will spend in this world.

262
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,347
You have a long journey ahead of you.

263
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,841
If there is anything you wish to do,

264
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,604
make them happen.

265
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,061
Do you leave yourself with any regret.

266
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:56,580
If the two of us had a normal life,

267
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:59,377
perhaps this simple bliss in life...

268
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,793
could have easily been ours.

269
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:12,089
We are not the same.

270
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:15,628
I had my share of happiness.

271
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,515
Even if my life ends now,

272
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,077
I am content with it.

273
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,661
I won't have any regret.

274
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,339
His Majesty is severely ill.

275
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,546
He is unable to attend to
our national affairs.

276
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:43,663
I must take on the responsibility
to share his burden.

277
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,187
From now on,

278
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,978
I shall reign in his place.

279
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,192
All the affairs of Imperial Court...

280
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,520
shall be decided by me.

281
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:04,214
Your Majesty's wish is our command.

282
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,586
Get up.

283
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,027
-Your Majesty.
-Speak.

284
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,209
Keep searching.

285
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,509
There is no way an ill man like him...

286
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,070
and a woman carrying a child...

287
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,724
can hide from the whole world.

288
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,407
Yes.

289
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,319
This tree is beautiful.

290
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,120
When the autumn arrives,

291
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:49,330
the whole yard will be full
of its petals.

292
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,280
We will be here every autumn
to watch this view, please?

293
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,404
Are you curious...

294
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,776
why the teahouses here
and in the palace...

295
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,712
are decorated with these wind chimes?

296
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:44,226
In the Qin family's mansion,

297
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,586
I saw these wind chimes before.

298
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,735
I like the sound they make.

299
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,653
Did you tell you...

300
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:55,516
that I like wind chimes?

301
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:58,829
So, are you the one that hung...

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,783
the wind chimes here and
in the palace teahouse?

303
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:06,106
Why don't we...

304
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,409
place these wind chimes together?

305
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,102
Should I hang it here?

306
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:16,667
A little higher.

307
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,695
Higher.

308
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:21,542
-Here?
-A little to the left.

309
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,490
-Here?
-Higher.

310
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,133
A little higher.

311
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,532
Higher!

312
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:32,848
Brother Qi, that is
not the way to do it.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,936
<i>When all the desires...</i>

314
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:50,080
<i>have burnt off with the good,</i>

315
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,200
<i>I know that we can't go back anymore.</i>

316
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,042
<i>I know that I have to leave you.</i>

317
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,280
<i>Ignorant is bliss.</i>

318
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:09,531
<i>The sound of flute from my memory
reminds me of the love we have.</i>

319
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,630
Man Er, get your meal.

320
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,840
Man Er?

321
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,001
Man Er?

322
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:36,210
<i>When the cloud and the rain
hears about your life,</i>

323
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,720
<i>even they will stop and wait for you.</i>

324
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,040
<i>I can saw you turning
your back towards me.</i>

325
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,573
<i>I weep for the good times
we had that was broken.</i>

326
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,596
<i>I have so many memories of you
but it'll never be enough.</i>

327
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:08,062
<i>The pain is unbearable.</i>

328
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,337
<i>Maybe this wasn't meant to happen.</i>

329
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,766
What?

330
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,264
Rong Le went missing?

331
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:36,458
Yes, she might have been
kidnapped by Rong Qi.

332
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:39,693
Prince Li ordered his men to search
all routes out of Qingzhou.

333
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,772
But we couldn't track them down.

334
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:45,341
I just arrested another man
from the Creed.

335
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,447
After some interrogation,

336
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,069
I found out Lin Shen might
have gone to Western Qi.

337
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:51,448
I suspect...

338
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,943
this conspiracy could be connected
to Western Qi as well.

339
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,823
Right.

340
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,184
Didn't Prince Li send his men
to search in Western Qi?

341
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,002
I received news from the Hidden Ones
when I reached Zhongshan.

342
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:03,240
They found some traces.

343
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:05,502
But most point toward
the Northern Realm.

344
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,989
Which is why Prince Li had to send
me here and ask for your help.

345
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:12,781
Will You Highness send some men
to search the area...

346
00:24:12,976 --> 00:24:15,809
and see if Rong Qi has sneaked Rong Le
into the Northern Realm?

347
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,146
Rong Qi is a mysterious person.

348
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:21,500
He is unpredictable.

349
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:24,951
It's not entirely impossible
for him to sneak into the land.

350
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,101
Right.

351
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,687
Pass this letter to Prince Li.

352
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,173
Tell him about the missing
of my father.

353
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,370
This letter contains
all the clues I found so far.

354
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:38,551
Your Highness,

355
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,760
if you reconciled with Prince Li,

356
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,817
why don't the two of you
talk about this together?

357
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:47,117
Do you have other plans in mind?

358
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,661
You know me the best.

359
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:00,584
For so many years,

360
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,901
I mistook a demon for my mother.

361
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:05,442
I committed countless sins.

362
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,505
I must find Fu Yuan myself...

363
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,153
and avenge my birth mother.

364
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,692
I have to find my father as well.

365
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:17,338
Take it as I am repenting.

366
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,710
But if you head to Western Qi alone,

367
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,734
you might run into dangers.

368
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,713
Bad news! Thirty thousand soldiers
 of Wei are approaching the border!

369
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:32,253
The officers are waiting for you
to devise a retaliation with them.

370
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,010
Your Highness, according to the
Hidden Ones, reports about Rong Qi...

371
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,192
sneaking into the Northern Realm
might be false news.

372
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,145
It's likely that he and
 Consort Rong Le are in Western Qi.

373
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,749
The Hidden Ones are searching
for them in Western Qi.

374
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:48,907
I should go there
personally this time.

375
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:50,801
I am afraid not.

376
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,399
We just received reports.

377
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,575
Thirty thousand soldiers of Wei
are approaching our border.

378
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,630
With the current strength of our army,

379
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:00,228
we can't hold off the invasion.

380
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:13,627
Perhaps Wei already knew...

381
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,649
the south and the north
will soon be united as one.

382
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:18,741
They want to use this last chance...

383
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,727
to seize the north as first step.

384
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:25,186
In that case,

385
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,723
order the Hidden Ones
to keep searching for Rong Le.

386
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,433
I will lead our army to
rendezvous with Wu Chou.

387
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:37,067
Your Highness, the peace treaty
doesn't have a conclusion yet.

388
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:40,824
Even if you go,
they might now agree with you.

389
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,908
From the aspect of duty,
the Northern Realm is a nation.

390
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,484
An invasion is upon us.

391
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,899
We must save the people from war.

392
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:49,787
From the aspect of kinship,

393
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:52,184
Wu Chou is my twin brother
who shares the same bloodline.

394
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:53,854
I must lend him my aid.

395
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:55,968
Muster the troops now.

396
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:58,376
-Follow me to the north.
-Yes.

397
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,844
-It smells great.
-Indeed.

398
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,609
It has a nice scent.

399
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,067
This greengage wine tastes
so familiar to me.

400
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,803
One last drink.

401
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,831
Of course.

402
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:21,736
<i>Man Er. We had our toast.</i>

403
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:24,215
<i>This is our...</i>

404
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,011
<i>last goodbye.</i>

405
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,984
When I went on this route
to seek refuge in the south,

406
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,854
I made Man Yao and
myself a promise.

407
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,089
I will bring order to this nation.

408
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:17,238
I will earn the people's trust.

409
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:19,926
Wei has surrendered.

410
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,164
The north and the south
are united as one.

411
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,513
Your ambition is realised.

412
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:33,174
But Agent Wu from just
sent a message from Western Qi.

413
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,007
The Emperor of Qi is ill.

414
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,520
The Empress Dowager
took his place at the throne.

415
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,695
Agent Wu tried everything he could,

416
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:41,518
but he never saw Rong Qi.

417
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,780
I fear Western Qi is still scheme
in place for the whereabouts...

418
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:49,349
of my father, Rong Qi and Man Yao.

419
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,577
An old handmaiden told me once.

420
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,912
Our father used a poison named
'Destined Poison' on Fu Yuan.

421
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,193
If we could find our father,

422
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:01,481
we might get a cure for that poison.

423
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:04,174
Rong Le would be saved.

424
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:13,009
In this life I have, my only wish...

425
00:31:13,847 --> 00:31:15,969
is for her live well and safe.

426
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,655
Indeed.

427
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,187
In all these years,

428
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,054
we lost too much.

429
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,755
We lost our father...

430
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:27,493
and our mother.

431
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,467
I made up my mind.

432
00:31:30,604 --> 00:31:33,395
I will set out on a journey
to search for our father.

433
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:36,295
And of course, Fu Yuan as well.

434
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:40,899
Right.

435
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,802
I asked you here today...

436
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,356
because I have a favour for you.

437
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,754
What is it?

438
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,140
I have decided to withdraw myself
from the Imperial Court.

439
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,835
This vast land...

440
00:31:57,438 --> 00:31:58,733
and its people...

441
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,764
will be your duty and responsibility
from now on.

442
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,921
All right, join me for a walk.

443
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:18,339
Sure.

444
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,161
I understand now.

445
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,572
So, this is the secret of the Book?

446
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,155
Brother Qi!

447
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,710
<i>Why would I call him that?</i>

448
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,562
<i>Did the two of us...</i>

449
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:00,856
<i>went through something together?</i>

450
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,490
Your hand,

451
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,449
how did it get hurt?

452
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,699
See?

453
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,895
This statue is almost done.

454
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,406
Do you like it?

455
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,318
You carved this statue yourself?

456
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:35,645
It doesn't matter who made this.

457
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,130
I am glad you like it.

458
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,593
Brother...

459
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,363
Man Er?

460
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:44,940
Man Er?

461
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,324
Man Er!

462
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,040
If the Hidden Ones
haven't found anything,

463
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:09,855
we won't be able to know
 the exact location of Rong Le.

464
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,364
So...

465
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,445
let's not alert the enemy for now.

466
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,757
Your Highness, I know
where Consort Rong Le is.

467
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,960
Madam, push harder!
You need to push harder!

468
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:37,190
Madam!

469
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,045
Madam, push harder!

470
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,711
Madam, you can't fall asleep!

471
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,758
Madam, pull yourself together!
Push harder!

472
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,920
-Push harder!
-Rong Le.

473
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:52,573
Man Er.

474
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,637
Man Er, open your eyes!

475
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,403
Man Er, hang in there!

476
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,730
I feel so tired.

477
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:03,156
You need to keep your eyes open!
You need to hold on!

478
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:05,634
Think about the child!

479
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,650
Think about how much you went
through the past few months!

480
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,106
Are you...

481
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:11,587
Are you going to give up now?

482
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,814
Are you going to give up
on your child?

483
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,505
My child?

484
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,450
My child?

485
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,610
Don't you want to see him?

486
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:21,731
I sent my men to inform him.

487
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:24,063
You need to hang in there
if you wish to see him again.

488
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,488
Did you hear me?

489
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,825
Wu You?

490
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,600
-Wu You?
-Yes.

491
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,842
Zongzheng Wu You is on his way here.

492
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,335
I swear to you, I am not lying.

493
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,835
Madam, you need to push harder.

494
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:42,097
If the child doesn't come out,

495
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,991
both you and the child
will be in grave danger!

496
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,817
Man Er, hang in there.

497
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:47,481
Man Er, be strong!

498
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,597
Congratulations, it's a boy.

499
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:35,262
Man Er, did you hear that?
It's a boy.

500
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:39,029
Bring him here, let me see him.

501
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,583
See?

502
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:50,354
He is adorable.

503
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,679
Does this boy have a name?

504
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,363
He doesn't have a name yet.

505
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,163
Let his father come up
with the name.

506
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,720
Lord Qi, give him a name.

507
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,168
All right, Man Er.

508
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:07,641
My wife needs to rest.

509
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,403
Mrs. Yu, I leave this boy
in your care.

510
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,379
Let me see him one more time.

511
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,371
All right, Man Er.

512
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,896
You need to rest.

513
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:18,039
Let Mrs. Yu take care
of the boy for now.

514
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,709
You have plenty of time later.

515
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,851
You need to take care of yourself.

516
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,360
Lord Qi is very thoughtful.

517
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,392
Madam, you have such a nice husband.

518
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,498
You have my thanks, Mrs. Yu.

519
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,085
Rest well for now.

520
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,904
Leave the rest to me.

521
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:39,335
But you said you informed Wu You.

522
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:41,823
Why isn't he here yet?

523
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,840
Who are you?
Why are you taking this child?

524
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,609
Who are you people?

525
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,640
Man Er, stay here.

526
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,888
Lie down, I'll go and take a look.

527
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:24,702
Greetings, Mother.
