Episode 28

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,540
Miss Ya Li, if you may.

4
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,980
Your Highness,
I'll go and take a look.

5
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,460
Go on.

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,100
Father.

7
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,700
Focus when you are playing the lute.

8
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,780
Come, let me show you how.

9
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,100
<i>Man Yao.</i>

10
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,100
<i>You never cease to amaze me.</i>

11
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,220
I am still an amateur.

12
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,540
My lack of control broke the cord
and caused that awful sound.

13
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,060
I apologise for that.

14
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,060
You may be an amateur,

15
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,380
but the song you played
has a vigorous spirit.

16
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,620
Each of you has your own prowess.

17
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,860
Indeed.

18
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
The melody of your song...

19
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,100
was more elegant than
what Ya Li played.

20
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,180
But you still have a
lot of trainings to do.

21
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,820
There are still some mistakes.

22
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,700
Your Majesty, you enjoyed
both the tea and the music.

23
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,100
It's about time.

24
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,420
We should go now.

25
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,940
Goodbye, my lord and Your Majesty.

26
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,180
General Fu, send the Empress
back to the palace.

27
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,580
There are some matters...

28
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,340
I must discuss with
Lady Rong Le in private.

29
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,620
Empress, if you may.

31
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,100
-Move on.
-Yes.

32
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,500
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

33
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,460
Your Majesty, I finally realised...

34
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,060
there are always people with
more talents than we do.

35
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,620
I wish to learn from Lady Rong Le.

36
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,540
I will be in Prince Li's manor
in a few days.

37
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,380
I was thinking about playing
some new songs for him.

38
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,620
Sure, I understand
what you are trying to do.

39
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,860
General Fu, let Ya Li
stay for a couple of days.

40
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,700
Let Lady Rong Le share
some of her techniques with Ya Li.

41
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,300
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

42
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,060
Your Majesty, you wish to talk to me?

43
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,820
Calm down, I come in peace.

44
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,380
When I met you at Lady Yun's tomb,

45
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,540
I know you are not one that
will cross the line.

46
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,420
Now that we meet again,

47
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,420
I can tell you are special.

48
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

49
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,060
That melody of yours...

50
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,500
carries an intense and strong message,

51
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,060
so strong that it felt like
the charging of an army.

52
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,060
It reminds me of the time
I spent on the battlefield.

53
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,500
It is reminiscent of my past.

54
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,260
I know.

55
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,500
You care for the peace of the world.

56
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,580
Even if your homeland
gave up on you,

57
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,260
you never stopped defending
the pride of its people.

58
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,420
I had always held a
prejudice against you.

59
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,220
But I finally understand why
Wu You is so madly in love with you.

60
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,260
Your Majesty, you told me...

61
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,260
to never overstep the line.

62
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,900
Why are you telling me these now?

63
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,260
That is because I remember
what happened in the past.

64
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,100
I feel like...

65
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,220
I should not let Wu You
repeat the same mistake as mine.

66
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,780
I don't want him
to live in regret like me.

67
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,220
So, I am asking for you thoughts
on behalf of him.

68
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,340
I don't know.

69
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,740
Reconsider what I said.

70
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,500
It took me so long to realise.

71
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,980
If you want to live without regret,

72
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,740
you must cherish what you have.

73
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,540
The small gathering with you...

74
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,060
was very pleasant.

75
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,500
Your Majesty came to
visit us in person,

76
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,260
I am greatly honoured and grateful.

77
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,780
You are one of the most
important officers.

78
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,820
You contributed to the peace of land.

79
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,780
I granted you this marriage...

80
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,540
as it was supposed to be a reward.

81
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,180
But I never expect it would
turn out to be a joke.

82
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,940
You are mocked by many.

83
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,300
I know it must have been hard on you.

84
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,860
Not at all, Your Majesty.

85
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
For my lord and the nation,

86
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,140
this is what I should do.

87
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,860
You are very devoted.

88
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,020
But I cannot be a heartless lord...

89
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,540
and let you suffer
from the humiliation.

90
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,700
The marriage alliance with Western Qi
is as good as empty hush.

91
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
Which is why I have decided...

92
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,700
to terminate this marriage.

93
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,780
No, Your Majesty.

94
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,980
There is no interest for us to gain
from the marriage alliance.

95
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,700
There is no need for it to continue.

96
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,980
Do you have other opinion
about this decision?

97
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,900
My marriage with Rong Le
was for the sake of our nations.

98
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,180
But after spending months together,

99
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,260
I have grown very fond of Rong Le.

100
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,900
I wouldn't want to leave her.

101
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,900
I hope Your Majesty
can withdraw that decision.

102
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,980
What about you?

103
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,820
Why? Do you also grow fond
of General Fu?

104
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,180
You don't want to leave him?

105
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,780
Ever since we are married,

106
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,540
General Fu never mistreated me.

107
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,500
I know I have brought him shame.

108
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,220
I don't deserve to be his wife.

109
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,740
I am willing to accept
Your Majesty's decision.

110
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,900
I will accept this dissolution.

111
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,620
Since you understand
the gravity of this matter,

112
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,260
then so be it.

113
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,540
General Fu, submit your letter
of dissolution as soon as possible.

114
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,060
Princess' house is no noisy.

115
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,700
Those people...

116
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,220
charged right into her house
wearing those weird clothes.

117
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,100
They walked in like
they are the bosses around.

118
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,540
That was so rude.

119
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,380
Come again!

120
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,940
Lady, you didn't pay for that!

121
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,220
Pay for what?

122
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,900
You took my food and
pretend nothing happened?

123
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,860
It's just some candied berries.

124
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,780
Had you spoken nicely
I might even give it to you.

125
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,740
Now that you stole from me,

126
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,260
and you lied!

127
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,860
I am taking you to the officers.

128
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,380
What?

129
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,980
Stop! Everyone, gather around!

130
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,780
Everyone, gather around! Look!

131
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,860
-What is going on?
-Gather around!

132
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,100
Gather around.

133
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,580
This lady over here took
the food from my stall.

134
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,060
She refused to pay and denied
knowing anything!

135
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,860
Gather around!

136
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,780
This girl took the food from me
and didn't pay!

137
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,380
How should I deal with her now?

138
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,260
This girl took the food from me
and didn't pay!

139
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,540
She lied about it!

140
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,540
Everyone, be my witness.
I am taking her to the officers.

141
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,620
Sir, excuse me.
This is my sister.

142
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,500
She has some mental problems.

143
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,580
She sneaked out while
we weren't looking.

144
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,540
Would you be so generous
and let her go this time?

145
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,900
There you go.

146
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,380
Judging by your outfits,
you seem to be from a rich family.

147
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,980
If she is ill, why didn't
you take her to a doctor?

148
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,420
And now she took my stuff
and caused me trouble.

149
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,420
Fine, I will let it slide this time.

150
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,140
Back to your work!

151
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,540
-You can go now.
-It's okay.

152
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,940
Everything is fine here.

153
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,100
-Get up.
-Don't touch me.

154
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,420
It's you again!
How dare you touch me!

155
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,260
Don't use your poison on me.

156
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,860
I just saved your neck.

157
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,340
Then do me a favour.

158
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,740
You are in the capital.

159
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,300
You are not in the mountain anymore.

160
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,540
If you want something
or get anything done,

161
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,300
you need money to pay for them.

162
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,660
-Do you get it?
-Are you going to help me?

163
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,140
Okay, what is it?

164
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,900
A bunch of people just came
to the Princess' house.

165
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,860
They walked right in without a word.

166
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,140
The Moon Embrace Teahouse
may be noisy,

167
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,020
but at least no one is trespassing.

168
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,420
Are you seriously asking me
to bring Man Yao out of the manor?

169
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,180
You really are a nut-case.

170
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,980
It's the General of Defence's manor.

171
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,500
It's heavily guarded.
Who would dare to trespass?

172
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,100
I am telling the truth.

173
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,620
Are you helping me or not?
If you won't,

174
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,660
not only will I make you
feel the itch,

175
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,460
I will make you feel
the pain for days!

176
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,220
Fine, you won.
I am going with you.

177
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,900
Come.

178
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,900
Ling Yue.

179
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,780
-Did you find her?
-No.

180
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
-Let's go inside and look.
-Let's go.

181
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Sir Xiao, you know the rules here.

182
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,060
No one can enter or leave the manor.

183
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,580
-But I am...
-Brother!

184
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,580
-Ke?
-Ke.

185
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,980
Come over here.

186
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,140
-Where did you go?
-I went to get us help.

187
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,740
Prince Chen.

188
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,180
I know you enjoy
the company of women,

189
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,180
but please stay away from my sister.

190
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
This is none of my business.

191
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,220
You and your sister sure love
to wrong the good guys.

192
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,580
I found her on the street.

193
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,260
She insists to drag me here.

194
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,460
She mentioned there are
people making noises here.

195
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,020
Please, Your Highness.

196
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,540
His Majesty is visiting the manor.

197
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,860
He is still inside.

198
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,180
I was just passing by.

199
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,180
Take it as I was never here.

200
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,620
-Is that clear?
-Yes.

201
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,580
-Ke.
-Where are you going?

202
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,940
Brother?

203
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,300
Brother?

204
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,340
Brother, I get what you are doing.

205
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,740
In order to protect Man Yao,
you went through great efforts.

206
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,020
You sent your men
to watch over her house.

207
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,780
Both you and I know that...

208
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,660
Fu Chou is planning something ill.

209
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,380
Man Yao will most likely
be caught up in it.

210
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,980
But I was so surprised today.

211
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,300
I never thought our father
will go in person...

212
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,740
just to make Fu Chou end the marriage.

213
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,500
He is doing it for your own good.

214
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,220
If Man Yao is freed,
you can be with her again.

215
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,500
This is great.

216
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,740
But to win her back,

217
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,660
it will take true love.

218
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,380
Any means by force....

219
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,300
will only push her away from me.

220
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,580
However, leaving General Fu...

221
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,820
is still what's best for her.

222
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,380
Yes, we also severed the connection
between Fu Chou and Qi.

223
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,860
It's two birds with one stone.

224
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,220
Father made a very wise move!

225
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,860
I am afraid Fu Chou
won't give up so easily.

226
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,700
Perhaps behind all of his patience,

227
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,140
a greater plot is brewing.

228
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,020
Your Highness.

229
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Your Highness.

230
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,340
It's from the Hidden Ones.

231
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,740
There are disturbance in the south.

232
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,260
Agent Wu wishes to remind you...

233
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,140
the main routes in the south are
blocked by natural and human causes.

234
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,020
Delivery of messages
will be obstructed.

235
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,660
If anything does happen,

236
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,140
we might not received
the news at once.

237
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,340
I knew it.

238
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,780
Someone might use the campaign
as opening for an uprising.

239
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,620
My father set his mind
on the taking down Wei.

240
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,660
But there are others that wait
to strike from the dark.

241
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,180
Leng Yan, inform the Hidden Ones.

242
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,380
There is a change of plan.

243
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,380
Defence of the south is our priority.

244
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,700
Yes.

245
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,420
-General Fu, I am...
-Get out!

246
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,820
You can talk to me,

247
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,780
but please show some respect.

248
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,460
You are jealous because of
Ya Li and Zongzheng Wu You.

249
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,940
While the Emperor and
Empress were here,

250
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,660
you tried to show off your skill
to Zongzheng Wu You's fiancée.

251
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,380
When you did that,

252
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,860
have you thought about respecting me?

253
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,860
You took it wrongly.

254
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,660
-Your shoulder was...
-I misunderstood?

255
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,860
Haven't you noticed?

256
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,460
You have been overstepping the line
since he returned to the capital.

257
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,500
You were in the water with him
at Linglong Palace. I let it pass.

258
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,020
On Zhao Yun's wedding day,

259
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,580
you two spent the night at the inn,
I let that pass too.

260
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,820
You were secretly meeting him
in the tomb, I look past that too!

261
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,820
Do you know what the tomb means to me?

262
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,220
It's humiliation.

263
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,780
The greatest shaming of all!

264
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,620
If you know everything,
you should realise that...

265
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,060
all of those are mere coincidence.

266
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,700
-The Linglong Palace...
-It's coincidence?

267
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,180
Once? Maybe.

268
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,420
Twice? Maybe.

269
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,220
But it happened again and again.

270
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,740
How is that coincidence?

271
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,940
Rong Le.

272
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,500
When it comes to Zongzheng Wu You,

273
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,460
you will always forget
that I am your husband.

274
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,180
So this is how you see me?

275
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,380
Every time I came back here,
I could feel someone is watching me.

276
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,580
You were spying on me,
eavesdropping and tailing me.

277
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,940
You are living under
fear and suspicion.

278
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,980
You don't even have the
slightest trust for me.

279
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,580
What more do you expect from me?

280
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,540
I want to be there
for you all the time.

281
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,540
Every time I come home,

282
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,020
the first thing I want...

283
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,900
is to see your face
and hear your voice.

284
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,980
But what do I get in the end?

285
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Zongzheng Wu You refused to marry you.

286
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,500
His Majesty searched
for a replacement.

287
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,020
Now that Zongzheng Wu You
is deeply in love with you,

288
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,700
he wants me to end this marriage.

289
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,260
What is this all about?

290
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,900
Do you take me as a fool?

291
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,620
The Emperor wants
to terminate this marriage,

292
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,260
and you said you don't deserve me.

293
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,100
Such a noble excuse!

294
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,380
All of you only ever care
about Zongzheng Wu You!

295
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,100
You only care about Zongzheng Wu You!

296
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,420
What am I? What I am to you?

297
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,460
Why is everyone giving up on me
because of him?

298
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,100
-Why?
-Let go of me!

299
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,980
Today, I will let you know
you are my wife!

300
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,420
Let go of me!

301
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,020
Let go of me!

302
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,060
Let go of me!

303
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,380
Your broke our agreement.

304
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,820
I have nothing more to say to you.

305
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,820
From now on,

306
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,180
we will never see each other again.

307
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,500
If you really want to leave,

308
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,820
I won't stop you.

309
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,220
But I hope...

310
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,180
for the sake of my reputation...

311
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,860
and the alliance between
Western Qi and Northern Realm,

312
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,020
for the next three month,

313
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,580
please don't meet
Zongzheng Wu You again.

314
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,260
If you won't agree with this,

315
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,140
I would rather have the two of us...

316
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,940
die in here.

317
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,620
Fine.

318
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,780
You have my word.

319
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,780
After three months,

320
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,340
it's all over for the two of us.

321
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,780
General Fu,

322
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,580
why are you doing this?

323
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,060
That was embarrassing.

324
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,460
I shall...

325
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,460
send you home right away.

326
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,940
No, I am not leaving!

327
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,580
Don't you understand my love for you?

328
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,340
Miss Sun, what exactly do you want?

329
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,540
All the officers in the
Imperial Court know that...

330
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,260
Prince Li is your fiancé.

331
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,540
No!

332
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,820
You know what I meant.

333
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,580
Prince Li is just
using me as an excuse.

334
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,380
It's just like the marriage
you had with Rong Le.

335
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,700
I always suspected you are
not having any joy in this marriage.

336
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,860
But today, I finally know...

337
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,940
the two of us are the same.

338
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,580
We are all shackled by love.

339
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,180
I really do love you.

340
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,980
You are the only one I will love.

341
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,020
If you can't escape from
this false marriage,

342
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,500
I am willing to spend
my life with you.

343
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,780
I don't care if I am
banished from my family.

344
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,220
I don't care...

345
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,900
if I could only become a
lowly servant of yours.

346
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,140
I will be there for you.

347
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,340
Princess, the curfew of
the city is in effect.

348
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,780
If General Fu did
something awful to you,

349
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
there is no need to
leave in such hurry.

350
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,220
Xiao Sha, ready the carriage.

351
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,900
Ling Yue, pack up all the things.

352
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,660
I don't want to stay here
for another moment.

353
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

354
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,340
Your Highness.

355
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,660
Are we really leaving?

356
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,140
General Fu is actually
very nice to you.

357
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,980
Look.

358
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,500
After the two of you came back
from Lady Yun's tomb,

359
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,300
you refused to wear this wedding gown
for the wedlock ceremony.

360
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,140
But he didn't say anything about it.

361
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,380
He even hired the best tailor
in the city to mend it.

362
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,020
After some repairing,
it looks like new.

363
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,300
All the General wanted is
to see you wear this dress...

364
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,180
and become his real wife.

365
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,500
But you never even bat
an eye for this dress.

366
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,020
It's been kept inside the closet.

367
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,100
It looks a little old now.

368
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,340
All his effort just
went down the drain.

369
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,980
<i>Rong Le.</i>

370
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,860
<i>It takes three lifetimes of fate
to become husband and wife.</i>

371
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,940
<i>We may be married,</i>

372
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,700
<i>but the two of us...</i>

373
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,420
<i>are not part of fate's plan.</i>

374
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,140
<i>I couldn't swallow it.</i>

375
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,100
<i>I forced you to be my wife.</i>

376
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,900
<i>It was our wedding day.</i>

377
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,060
<i>I still hold a wee bit of hope...</i>

378
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,140
<i>that in one year...</i>

379
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,140
<i>I can turn things around for us...</i>

380
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,180
<i>and be a real couple.</i>

381
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,180
<i>If while you are
reading this letter...</i>

382
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,260
<i>and still have not the
slightest love for me,</i>

383
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,900
<i>or even hate me,</i>

384
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,460
<i>I am willing to set you free.</i>

385
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,100
<i>Let this be the end of us.</i>

386
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,420
<i>Let us part in peace.</i>

387
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,220
Princess.

388
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,460
Are we taking this with us?

389
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,900
Take everything.

390
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,900
Don't leave anything behind.

391
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
Yes.

392
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,340
Have some tea.

393
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,740
General Fu wrote you this letter?

394
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,340
Have you thought about
what you will do next?

395
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,500
Right now, I am just
as lost as I was before.

396
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,540
When I am leaving,
I am so determined and bold.

397
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,380
I just want to leave
this place for good.

398
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,460
I won't let them hurt or use me again.

399
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,980
I want to leave this cage.

400
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,860
But when I step out of it,

401
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,860
as soon as I walk out from the shadow,

402
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,340
I have no idea...

403
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,740
what danger lies ahead of us.

404
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,740
You mean...

405
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,740
not only will you leave the manor,

406
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,140
you are also leaving Zhongshan?

407
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,420
I must severe all ties with Fu Chou.

408
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,060
He is frustrated, so am I.

409
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,660
Three months from now,
all the burden will be released.

410
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,580
I will leave Zhongshan.

411
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,180
But if you leave just like that,

412
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,660
aren't you going to
find out who you are?

413
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,460
I remember you saying that...

414
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,460
the secret of your past might be
hidden inside Fort Yu.

415
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,700
I remember now.
While I was playing the lute,

416
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
some flashes of memories came to me.

417
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,900
Perhaps Ke's treatment...

418
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,860
is making those memories
much clearer for me.

419
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,700
Why don't we go to Fort Yu
before you leave this place?

420
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,900
It might bring back even more
memories of the past.

421
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,900
Miss Man Yao, do you know
the person on this drawing?

422
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,540
It feels familiar to me.

423
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,260
But I am not sure.

424
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,700
I hope this is the truth.

425
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,540
With that, I can know for sure...

426
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,220
that I once had a mother...

427
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,260
and a happy family.

428
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,100
But I also wish it's not the truth.

429
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,620
I don't have to face the truth
of my family being killed...

430
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,180
and the pain of losing
everything again.

431
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,980
Please, don't see it that way.

432
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,100
Sir Qin may be dead,

433
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,820
but he lives on inside
the people's heart.

434
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,700
After I got here,

435
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,940
it reminds me a lot of my childhood.

436
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,500
What do you remember?
You have been here before?

437
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,460
Maybe.

438
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,900
Everything here seems
so familiar to me.

439
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,940
When my father wrote...

440
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,900
the Book of Mountains and Rivers
with Sir Qin,

441
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,060
this is where they were.

442
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,300
The woman on the drawing...

443
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,140
would be Lady Qin.

444
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,580
I remember she gave me
some candies before.

445
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,620
What else can you recall?

446
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,860
Have you seen
the two daughters of Sir Qin?

447
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,700
I wish we had more time.

448
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,700
We can spend more time
in here to recall the past.

449
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,500
Miss Man Yao.

450
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,180
Now that you are here,

451
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,300
it means you have found the book.

452
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,820
Why don't we look around?

453
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,780
Maybe we can find more clues.

454
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,620
The book...

455
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,620
is not with me.

456
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,860
Where are you keeping it?

457
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,980
You only told Long Yue
about its location?

458
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,300
You must be curious...

459
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,700
about the fallout
I had with Prince Li.

460
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,060
That's because I handed over
the book to him.

461
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,900
But I later found out...

462
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,100
he was using me to get the book.

463
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,780
You mean...

464
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,180
the book is now with Prince Li?

465
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,540
Yes.

466
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,060
I am sorry.

467
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,020
I cannot let you go.

468
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,780
Your Highness,
there is a letter for you.

469
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,780
Your Majesty.

470
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
The Court started over an hour ago.

471
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,380
We can't just wait and do nothing.

472
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
Father.

473
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,060
You knew my brother has some
objections for the campaign.

474
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,940
Why must we wait for him
to discuss about it?

475
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,260
Besides, you know very well
about his temper.

476
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,100
Even if you drag him here,

477
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,900
he wouldn't give any
constructive ideas.

478
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,260
Just shut it.

479
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,580
I don't care how many objections
he has for the campaign.

480
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,140
There are rules to follow
in the Imperial Court.

481
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,460
He can't just be absent
without any reason.

482
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,420
I sent Captain Xiang
to search for him.

483
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,940
Let's see what he has to say.

484
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,180
Captain Xiang arrives!

485
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,100
Your Majesty.

486
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,140
What took you so long?
Where is Prince Li?

487
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,460
Your Majesty, when I arrived
at the manor,

488
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,820
the guard said Prince Li left in the
night and hasn't come back since.

489
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,260
I led my men to the places
and shops His Highness frequented.

490
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,020
But he is nowhere to be found.

491
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,740
Curse him!

492
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,660
He hides himself
right when I need him!

493
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,580
Does he think the campaign
can't go on without him?

494
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Father,

495
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,180
Wu You was never interested in
the politics of Imperial Court.

496
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,300
All the national affairs
he worked on...

497
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,940
are mere covers.

498
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,940
His old habits started to kick in.

499
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,380
Father, just let him be.

500
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,380
I have some suggestions
for the campaign.

501
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,740
I shall gladly discuss them
with the fellow officers...

502
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,260
and be at your services.

503
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,420
Forget it.

504
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,180
I am getting tired of this.

505
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,580
Let's get this over with and dismiss.

506
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,260
As for your plans,

507
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,340
write them down
and submit your proposal.

508
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
-I'll read it when I am free.
-Yes!

509
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,300
Dismiss.

510
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,140
Long live Your Majesty.

511
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,180
Rong Le?

512
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,620
Rong Le?

513
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,060
Where is she?

514
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,100
I don't know.

515
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,980
After the quarrel you had that day,

516
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,380
she left in night.

517
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,980
She hasn't come back since.

518
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,060
We never intervene with
your matter with Lady Rong Le.

519
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,020
I wouldn't dare to stop her
without your permission.

520
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,900
We could only let her leave.

521
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,100
Why didn't you inform me
she was leaving?

522
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,220
-I apologise for that.
-Look for her now!

523
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,060
Yes, I will look for her right away.

524
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
I didn't have the courage
to talk to you.

525
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,540
I couldn't face you.

526
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,620
But I never thought...

527
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,100
it was just my wishful thinking.

528
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,780
You were such a hurry to leave me.

529
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,460
Can't you wait for another moment?

530
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,900
Your broke our agreement.

531
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,580
I have nothing more to say to you.

532
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,020
From now on,

533
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,580
we will never see each other again.

534
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
<i>Your Majesty, when I arrived
at the manor,</i>

535
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,580
<i>the guard said Prince Li left in the
night and hasn't come back since.</i>

536
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,220
<i>I brought this down to myself.</i>

537
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,540
<i>I can't even have a false marriage.</i>

538
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,860
<i>Rong Le.</i>

539
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,620
<i>I should have sworn...</i>

540
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,740
<i>to never deceive you again
on the wedding day.</i>

541
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,580
<i>That dissolution letter...</i>

542
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,100
<i>took me fourteen times
just to complete it.</i>

543
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,060
<i>But I never thought...</i>

544
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,340
<i>you would be so cruel.</i>

545
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,940
<i>As soon as you are freed,</i>

546
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,700
<i>you eloped with him.</i>

547
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,620
Hen Xiang?

548
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,180
What are you doing here?

549
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,980
Are you searching for Rong Le?

550
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,180
Is this all your doing?

551
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,980
Tell me where she is now!

552
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,340
So, in your eyes,

553
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,460
every harm done to her is my doing?

554
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,940
But not this time.

555
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,180
It's Chen Yu, the person
she trusts the most.

556
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,220
Chen Yu?

557
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,180
As for Chen Yu's true identity,

558
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,300
not even our master knows about her.

559
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,260
I don't know why she would
take Rong Le with her.

560
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,540
But we found out that...

561
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,340
she informed Zongzheng Wu You.

562
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,140
We can know her target is not Rong Le.

563
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,940
We have Zongzheng Wu You
to rescue Rong Le.

564
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,900
You don't need to worry.

565
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Are you sure Zongzheng Wu You
will be there?

566
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,820
If he doesn't go,
Rong Le will be in grave danger.

567
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,380
He definitely will.

568
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,420
We tried it so many times,

569
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,060
isn't that right?

570
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,740
I can't trust him.

571
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,820
Stand aside.

572
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,900
Zongzheng Wu You is not
the one you can't trust.

573
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:30,085
You are afraid after he saves Rong Le,

574
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,958
they will fall in love again.

575
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,100
Stand aside!

576
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,980
Young Master.

577
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,780
Our plan is in motion.

578
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,660
This is the crucial time for us.

579
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,140
There are other matters
you must see to.

580
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,180
You can't give up the greater good
for the sake of a woman.

581
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,260
I know what the greater good is.

582
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,220
I don't need you to lecture me.

583
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,100
Stand aside now...

584
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,180
or I won't show any mercy.

585
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,220
You can't go!

586
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,860
Even if you kill me,

587
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,860
I still won't let you go to her.

588
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,180
But if I am dead,

589
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,084
no one in this world...

590
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,740
will ever truly care for you.
