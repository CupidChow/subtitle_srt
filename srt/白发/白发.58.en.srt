" Princess Silver "

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,480
Episode 58

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,800
My master...

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,880
recorded another way to remove
the poison on another tome:

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
blood for blood...

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
a life...

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,240
for a life.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,720
From now on,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,760
your life is my life.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,960
I'll make sure to protect you well.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
I already found a way to
neutralise your poison completely.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,920
As long as you agree to go
to a place with me,

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,080
I'll make sure that you
and your child will be safe.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,800
Why?

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,240
Why?

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
Hen Xiang, what are you waiting for?

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,920
Alright.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Hen Xiang!

19
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
Your Majesty.

20
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,760
Nian.

21
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,600
Chou.

22
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,880
Go now!

23
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
Nian.

24
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,640
Chou.

25
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,560
You've done very well.

26
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,320
And you've protected...

27
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,600
both of the children well.

28
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,240
Chou.

29
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
I'll find you again...

30
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,120
in my next life.

31
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,240
<i>I regret the one mistake
that I made so much.</i>

32
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,440
<i>All hopes are lost,
how do I start over?</i>

33
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,400
In your next life,

34
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,840
don't meet me anymore.

35
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,680
<i>I blamed the mistake
that happened too soon.</i>

36
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
Wu Chou.

37
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,880
<i>It never ends, love will fade.</i>

38
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,160
<i>The blossoms fall,
and I waited in silence.</i>

39
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,640
<i>I cling onto the past
despite the pains.</i>

40
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,800
<i>I won't let our love be a regret.</i>

41
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,320
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

42
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,720
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

43
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Nian.

44
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
Nian.

45
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,720
<i>Live without sorrow,
die without any hate.</i>

46
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,320
<i>This is the leniency that
you've shown me.</i>

47
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
Don't worry.

48
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
I promise you.

49
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,640
I'll take good care of your child.

50
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>Wu You.</i>

51
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
<i>From now on,
we don't owe each other anymore.</i>

52
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,120
<i>Luckily, a ray of light has
shone into my life...</i>

53
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,160
<i>before I'm totally swallowed up
by dark hatred.</i>

54
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,760
Father.

55
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
Father.

56
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Father.

57
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,920
Father.

58
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,160
-Father.
-Father.

59
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
Father.

60
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,000
-Father.
-Father.

61
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,360
Father.

62
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
Father.

63
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,040
I know that my life
is coming to an end.

64
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,520
So, I'm holding on
to my last breath...

65
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,080
to wait for both of you here.

66
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,880
All these sins.

67
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
They should be bore by me alone.

68
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,600
Back then,

69
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,200
because of my wild ambition
to rebuilt the country,

70
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,880
I had played with other's feelings.

71
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,320
And the price I have to pay...

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,640
is to see both of you brothers
destroying each other.

73
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
Father.

74
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
Crown prince.

75
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
Wu Chou.

76
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,240
And your children...

77
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,680
Father.

78
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,360
have become the innocent victims.

79
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,000
Both of you...

80
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,560
have to remember the mistake I made.

81
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
In the future,

82
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,960
don't fail to live up to...

83
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,360
the people of our country.

84
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,160
-Father.
-Father.

85
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,720
Father, we haven't met
each other for so long.

86
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
I still have many things
to report to you.

87
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,680
Yun.

88
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Father.

89
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Father.

90
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,680
Father!

91
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Zongzheng Yun He!

92
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,640
This is your karma.

93
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
Your karma!

94
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,240
Cut the nonsense.

95
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Where is Man Yao?

96
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,160
You have...

97
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
searched the whole palace for her...

98
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,680
but you couldn't find her.

99
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
It means that...

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,880
she is dead.

101
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Wu You, we have searched the
whole palace from the inside out.

102
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
And we couldn't find Consort Rong Le.

103
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,400
But Xiao Sha is still looking for her.

104
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't believe you.

105
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,240
Give her back to me.

106
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
Man Yao.

107
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,320
Man Yao.

108
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,000
Brother Qi.

109
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
Wait for me.

110
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
Brother Qi.

111
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,800
Wait for me.

112
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,000
Stop right there.

113
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
You...

114
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,480
Why are you still alive?

115
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,200
How is it possible that my Qi is dead?

116
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,040
Although he has contacted
the Destined Poison,

117
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,240
for the past 20 years and more,

118
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,840
I had carefully used the most
valuable medicine to prolong his life.

119
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,440
You must be...

120
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,640
the reason behind his death.

121
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,520
Brother Qi is dead?

122
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,040
Brother Qi.

123
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,160
Why are you still here?

124
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
Are you...

125
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,640
afraid that your mother
will suspect you?

126
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
Are you afraid that your mother...

127
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,160
will stop Ke from getting rid
of the poison inside me?

128
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
You have already given
your blood and life to me.

129
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,800
Now, you even use your dead body...

130
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,560
to protect me.

131
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,640
No.

132
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
That is impossible.

133
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,640
That is impossible.

134
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,680
Brother Qi.

135
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
I'm sorry.

136
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,680
I shouldn't have forgotten about you.

137
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,080
How could I have forgotten about you?

138
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,840
Then, why don't you...

139
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,880
die together with him?

140
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,280
You are not worthy for all the things
that Qi had done for you.

141
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
You...

142
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,160
should have already been dead
when you contacted...

143
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,960
the Scorpion Toxin.

144
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,720
If Qi had not saved you...

145
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
by putting the medicine...

146
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,240
in your snacks to protect your heart,

147
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,160
you wouldn't have gotten off
with just white hair.

148
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
But in order to save you,

149
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,160
do you know what
punishment he received?

150
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,120
You are unworthy of being a mother.

151
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,120
The things that I did...

152
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,280
were nothing.

153
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,840
The physical pain Qi felt...

154
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,320
is nothing...

155
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,480
compared to the heartache
he felt when he knew that...

156
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,840
you had fallen in love
with Zongzheng Wu You.

157
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,480
In order to save you,

158
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,680
he gave you to others
with his own hands.

159
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
He had to put his pride
in his pocket...

160
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,720
and he had to put up with
your hatred towards him.

161
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,600
No.

162
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,480
It's all because of you.

163
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,640
Fu Yuan.

164
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,480
My father had indeed hurt you before.

165
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,720
But my mother had forgiven you.

166
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,440
Wu Chou had respected
and taken care of you.

167
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,800
Man Yao had helped you before.

168
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,600
And the people from
several countries...

169
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,480
had protected and served you.

170
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
But because of your own hatred,

171
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
you have hurt so many people.

172
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,960
And you almost...

173
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,840
incite war between us few countries.

174
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,160
Reprisal breeds reprisal.

175
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,920
But the people are innocent.

176
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,840
When you willingly let yourself
be swallowed up by hatred,

177
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,160
-you should have expected this ending.
-Everything that all of you did...

178
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
is fake and insincere!

179
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,120
I have nothing now.

180
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,560
<i>Everything that you see
can be fabricated.</i>

181
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
<i>So, you have to believe in your heart.</i>

182
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,200
<i>I'm the one who wishes for
your happiness the most in this world.</i>

183
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,760
<i>What I can promise you now is,
your child will be fine.</i>

184
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,240
<i>Your child will be safe.</i>

185
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
<i>I won't lie to you.</i>

186
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,320
<i>I promise to neutralise
your poison for sure, Man.</i>

187
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
<i>I just hope that you can
trust me for one last time.</i>

188
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,120
<i>Man.</i>

189
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,520
<i>Since...</i>

190
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
<i>I won't be able to
bring you happiness,</i>

191
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,040
<i>I should just...</i>

192
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,680
<i>give you my blessings.</i>

193
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,400
<i>Man,</i>

194
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,040
<i>don't forgive me.</i>

195
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,880
<i>Continue to hate me like this.</i>

196
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,080
<i>Because, when the people
you hate leave you,</i>

197
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,440
<i>you won't be too sad about it.</i>

198
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,040
" Here lies Zongzheng Wu Chou
and Qin Xiang "

199
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,600
Wu Chou.

200
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,840
Mother had taught me this song.

201
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,760
I hope that you'll like it.

202
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Whenever she thought
about her other lost child,

203
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,160
he will play this song alone.

204
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,200
Unfortunately,
you didn't get to hear it...

205
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,320
when you are still alive.

206
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
Man Yao...

207
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
is still not willing
to leave Western Qi?

208
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,240
Consort Rong Le is
not willing to talk much.

209
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,240
She just sits in the tearoom alone...

210
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
and wanders around the Cold Harem.

211
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,560
If that's the case,
no need to disturb her anymore.

212
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,880
All of us are not able to
blot out our past...

213
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,600
and the deep hatred that is
engraved in our heart.

214
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,080
A few years ago, I might force her
to come with me at all cost.

215
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,080
But time has changed.

216
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,680
Sooner or later,
we will understand that...

217
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,800
putting down things that
we are persistent on...

218
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,400
is leniency towards ourselves.

219
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Your Highness.

220
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
When Emperor of Qi was still alive,

221
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,760
he had asked you to
help him with something.

222
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

223
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,360
When His Majesty was still alive,
he wrote this letter...

224
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,640
and instructed me to give it
to you and only you.

225
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,040
<i>Prince Li.</i>

226
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,040
<i>This letter represents me.</i>

227
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,040
<i>My life is going to end soon.</i>

228
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,560
<i>But I still have
some regrets in my life.</i>

229
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,080
<i>Although we are not close,</i>

230
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,880
<i>in this world,</i>

231
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,480
<i>you are the only one
generous enough...</i>

232
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
<i>for me to count on.</i>

233
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,400
My mother had sinned
throughout her life.

234
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,920
As her son,
I'll repay it with my life.

235
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,560
I hope that her victims will be able
to forgive her for her crimes...

236
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,640
and let go of their hatred.

237
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
Me and Qin Man's destiny
has ended a long time ago.

238
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,160
You are the only one she loves...

239
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,160
in this whole wide world.

240
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,440
I hope that you can
keep your promise...

241
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,320
to respect and love her forever.

242
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,520
Western Qi is poor and weak.

243
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,400
Our people are suffering.

244
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm afraid that my death will
lead to the destruction of our nation.

245
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,440
I hope that you can
take care of my people...

246
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,000
as a benevolent ruler.

247
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,040
<i>I can saw you turning
your back towards me.</i>

248
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,760
<i>I weep for the good times
we had that was broken.</i>

249
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,120
<i>I have so many memories of you
but it'll never be enough.</i>

250
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,480
" Five years later "

251
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,760
<i>I tried to capture you
but I've broken your wings.</i>

252
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,800
<i>Separation is our only end.
I promise you with my burning heart.</i>

253
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,640
<i>If you are willing to
believe in this world again,</i>

254
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,760
<i>please remember that...</i>

255
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,760
<i>I once loved you.</i>

256
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,160
" Here lies Brother Rong Qi "

257
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,680
Xiao Sha.

258
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,760
Thank you for taking care...

259
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,760
of my brother all these years.

260
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,600
If His Majesty can hear us
from the underworld,

261
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,240
he can definitely hear your grief.

262
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,240
I still feel guilty
after all these years.

263
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,200
When you and His Majesty were in Chen,

264
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,080
His Majesty had insisted
to take you away...

265
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
because he had found the other half of
the medical book of Lone Frost Sage.

266
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,080
If I had chosen to
believe in him back then,

267
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,560
we might be able to
turn things around.

268
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,360
You are not to be blamed.

269
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,080
Destiny is called destiny...

270
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,440
because...

271
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,160
it's about the choice
you make with your destiny.

272
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,480
Somebody...

273
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,120
will sacrifice their own child...

274
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,000
to save themselves.

275
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,200
Somebody...

276
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,480
will sacrifice their own lives...

277
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,240
for others.

278
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,760
Brother Qi is that somebody.

279
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,440
Since birth,
he knew that life is short.

280
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,600
That's why he could
sympathise and forgive...

281
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,400
the sufferings in this world.

282
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
He rather sacrificed himself...

283
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
for others' well-being.

284
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,280
Consort Rong Le.

285
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,080
Have a chat with His Majesty.

286
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,920
I'll take my leave now.

287
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
Brother Qi.

288
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,560
The green plum wine this year...

289
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,440
is much more sweeter
than the previous year.

290
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,640
I wonder if your wishes...

291
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,800
have come true in your next life...

292
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,200
where you can be a normal person...

293
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,920
who lives without
the torture of illness...

294
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
and one who can live
a simple and happy life...

295
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,400
with the one you love forever.

296
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,320
" Linan Door "

297
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,760
Rong Le, the Elder Princess
of Western Qi has arrived.

298
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,440
Why isn't Prince Li here...

299
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,520
to welcome the princess in person?

300
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,880
If Wu You doesn't wish to do it,
nobody can force him to.

301
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,720
My advice for you is to
go back as soon as you can.

302
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,120
Stop the carriage.

303
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,560
<i>I think of you when the moon is full,
when it's a crescent...</i>

304
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,800
<i>and when it's white.</i>

305
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,160
<i>You who came to a strange
land to build our lands together.</i>

306
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,120
<i>I think of you when
night has fallen...</i>

307
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,600
<i>and when the fog has parted.</i>

308
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,040
<i>My yearning for you has
turned you into my reason.</i>

309
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,160
<i>You are my happiness,
my worries and my abyss.</i>

310
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,320
Finally, my wait has come to an end.

311
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,960
All these years, I...

312
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,840
<i>I don't want distance but
I stayed away from you.</i>

313
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>I want to do it but I can't.</i>

314
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,920
Say no more.

315
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,280
I understand.

316
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,880
" Yu and Ke Apothecary House "

317
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
Now, the country is peaceful
and the people are rich.

318
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,480
There are less and less people
who come here to be treated.

319
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm glad to be in this idle life.

320
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,800
You know that in this life,

321
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,040
I just want to be a free man who
drinks and writes poems as I please.

322
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,360
Yes. I know you want to visit
the public house every day.

323
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,000
Are you jealous?

324
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,080
All these years, it had taken us a lot
to bring peace to the world.

325
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,880
And the transformation
is successful too.

326
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,480
When I come back to
the capital this time,

327
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,720
I didn't talk to any
other ladies at all.

328
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,480
I had accompanied you every day.

329
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,600
This apothecary house has
almost become my home.

330
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,040
Enough. We have nothing to do anyway.

331
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,920
Let's go out and have a walk.

332
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Alright.

333
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
" Closed "

334
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
The coronation is in two days' time.

335
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,200
Even my brother has gone
into the palace to help.

336
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,760
But you are still here,
doing nothing every day.

337
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,720
Are you really not going back
to the palace to be a prince?

338
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,440
-Actually, I...
-Isn't this Prince Chen?

339
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,880
-Prince Chen.
-Prince Chen.

340
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,320
Isn't this Prince Chen?

341
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
-Come in. Come and play.
-Prince Chen!

342
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,720
So, you brought me out because
you want to visit the public house.

343
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,960
No. This is just a coincidence.

344
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,480
Purely coincidence.

345
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,720
I don't care anymore.

346
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,720
I've already decided to treat
patients for the rest of my life.

347
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,640
If you can't bear to separate
with your public house,

348
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
you can go back and be a prince then.

349
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,240
Of course I can bear it.
For you, I can bear anything.

350
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,920
In the future,

351
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,280
if you want to sample
all of the herbs in this world,

352
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,640
I'll travel the whole
wide world with you.

353
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,400
If you want to publish medical books,

354
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,520
I'll prepare the ink
and brush for you.

355
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,480
But,

356
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,000
about that thing,

357
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
when are we going to do it?

358
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
I don't know what
you are talking about.

359
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,800
You had already
promised me before this.

360
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,600
Since you pretend not to know
about it, I'll ask you again then.

361
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,560
Xiao Ke.

362
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,800
When are you going to marry me?

363
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,080
I don't know what
you are talking about.

364
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,600
I don't understand.

365
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,160
-You already...
-Ke.

366
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,400
What Wu Yu meant is,

367
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,880
when are you going to marry him?

368
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,320
-That's right, Wu You, Rong Le.
-You are here, Princess Rong Le.

369
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,680
When did I promise to marry him?

370
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,960
Is that right?

371
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,680
Ying has called you aunt
for so many years.

372
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,400
I didn't see you
correcting him about it.

373
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,280
That's right. Although Ying
is quite naughty since young,

374
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
he has done well with this.

375
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,680
Wu You is right.

376
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
Ke, come.

377
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,280
I have a solution.

378
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,200
How about...

379
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,960
Let me tell you.

380
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,720
Wu You, help me.

381
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,240
Alright.

382
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,200
Alright. I'll do as
Princess Rong Le says then.

383
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,120
Take a guess.
Which hand is holding the flower.

384
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,880
-If you managed to guess it right...
-You'll marry me.

385
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,040
-It's a deal then.
-It's a deal.

386
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,680
I'm guessing that it's
in your right hand.

387
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,240
-I got it right.
-How did you know?

388
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,360
I...

389
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,000
How dare you cheat.

390
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,920
I don't care. We have to do it again.

391
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,360
-You already promised to marry me.
-What are you doing?

392
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,160
-You promised to marry me!
-Let go of me!

393
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,840
Let go of me, Wu Yu.

394
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,320
All of you are so shameless. No.

395
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,520
-We have to do it again. Let go!
-No, I'm not going to let go!

396
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,400
" School of Wisdom "

397
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,080
The class starts now.

398
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,720
We are going to talk about The Book
of Mountains and Rivers today.

399
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,760
Back then, Prince Li and his consort
were brought together by this book.

400
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,840
The world thought that the book
contains brilliant military scheme.

401
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,920
And those who have it
will rule the world.

402
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,840
So, many countries
had their eyes on it.

403
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,800
But those who are buried by the
lust for power didn't know that...

404
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,200
more than 10 years have passed since.

405
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,600
The mountains and the rivers
have changed...

406
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,000
and more so for the people
and things that live in it.

407
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,640
In this world, there is no
monotonous art of war.

408
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
" The Book of Mountains and Rivers "

409
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,280
Aunt Luo Yan.

410
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,160
What about this Book of Mountains
and Rivers that you gave us then?

411
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,760
There is nothing...

412
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,680
in our Book of Mountains and Rivers.

413
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,680
Ying, Nian.

414
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,200
Do you know what was
written inside the book...

415
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,840
that everybody is fighting for?

416
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,520
Do you know?

417
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,720
I don't know.

418
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,240
-How about you?
-I don't know as well.

419
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,680
That book contains some drawings
of mountains and rivers...

420
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,040
as well as some boring poems
written during one's free time.

421
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,320
Father, mother.

422
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,560
Don't be rude.

423
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,520
Uncle, aunty.

424
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,400
It is a drawing book
used by my father...

425
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,520
to teach me and my sister back then.

426
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,800
It's called The Book
of Mountains and Rivers...

427
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,560
because he wants us
to have aspirations...

428
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,400
as lofty as the mountains and rivers.

429
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,120
After that, somebody had
spread false rumour about it...

430
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,240
until there was a huge issue
because of it.

431
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,240
The strategy used by my late teacher,
Qin Yong, to strengthen the country...

432
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
was by being generous to the people...

433
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,120
and with the whole world in his mind.

434
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,600
He used his courage,
knowledge and wisdom alone...

435
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,080
to take care of the people...

436
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,960
and to protect the world.

437
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,800
So,

438
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,880
the blank Book of Mountains and Rivers
is for you to fill it up...

439
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,240
with new aspirations
and bold visions...

440
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,080
when you grow up.

441
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,680
Study well. Don't be naughty.

442
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,080
Let's go now.. Let's not disturb
the children anymore.

443
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,

444
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,480
Emperor Wen watches from the heaven,

445
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,160
shining bright and brings us light.

446
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,120
shining bright and brings us light.

447
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,520
The Zhou kingdom has it's age,

448
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,960
but the fate of nation
is yet to be known.

449
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,280
<i>Wu You.</i>

450
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
<i>How unlucky we are...</i>

451
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,880
<i>to be straddled in a chaotic world...</i>

452
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,120
<i>and to be strapped in other's plot.</i>

453
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:43,520
<i>The world is warm but
sincerity is easily gone.</i>

454
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,480
<i>And how lucky we are...</i>

455
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,040
<i>to be able to lay down the
foundation for a peaceful world...</i>

456
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,080
<i>while keeping our aspirations in mind.</i>

457
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,800
<i>There are greed and jealousy and
people's hearts are unpredictable.</i>

458
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,320
<i>Actually, there is
no absolute destiny.</i>

459
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,000
<i>One's destiny...</i>

460
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,160
<i>is up to oneself after all.</i>

461
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,480
<i>Some were utterly helpless.</i>

462
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,520
<i>Some betrayed themselves.</i>

463
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,760
<i>Some had lost their way to darkness.</i>

464
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,760
<i>Naturally, there were some who
came back to their senses completely.</i>

465
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,200
<i>Some who seek and explored.</i>

466
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,200
<i>And some who sacrificed
themselves for others.</i>

467
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,760
<i>I just hope that from now on,</i>

468
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,760
<i>I can be with you until
we are old and Gray...</i>

469
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,440
<i>to walk determinedly...</i>

470
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
<i>on this path...</i>

471
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,320
<i>that we had chosen.</i>

472
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,080
<i>How love and hatred fool the people.</i>

473
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,960
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is waiting for you.</i>

474
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:28,040
<i>I'm lost in thought,
thinking about my lonely fate.</i>

475
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,080
<i>The world is warm but
sincerity is easily gone.</i>

476
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,360
<i>How right and wrong the people.</i>

477
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,360
<i>Time is passing and
your lover is hurting.</i>

478
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:53,280
<i>It's inevitable that we part but
I just wish that it won't be so cruel.</i>

479
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,520
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>

480
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:07,720
<i>After the harsh winter,
comes spring again.</i>
