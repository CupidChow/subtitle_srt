00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,432
Episode 11

3
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,580
His Highness must
be the famous Prince Li...

4
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,891
that won the battle
of south with tactics.

5
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,507
Yes, that is my son, Wu You.

6
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,263
I hope he is what you expected.

7
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:56,803
Prince Li does have
the outstanding figure of a royalty,

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,376
the look of a righteous prince.

9
00:00:58,507 --> 00:01:00,985
He will indeed be a suitable
husband for Princess Rong Le.

10
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,329
I came all the way to
the Northern Realm...

11
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:07,311
in order to hasten the progress
of our marriage alliance.

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,741
It doesn't really matter
who the Princess marries.

13
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:14,401
The good will of
the two nations comes first.

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,941
There are other princes
in the Northern Realm.

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,619
Since you are here,
why don't you have a look around?

16
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:24,797
Maybe there is a man that
suits the Princess better.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,494
Your words do have a point.

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,980
After all, Rong Le is my only sister.

19
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:34,151
I should spend more time
in considering the options.

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,100
Princess Rong Le has
the quality of a good queen.

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,950
But unfortunately,
the Crown Prince is already married.

22
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,766
A hunt is just the same as a battle.

23
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,814
Even if we face a powerful enemy,

24
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,040
even if the opponent
has the higher ground,

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,248
as soon as we find out
what his weakness is,

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,939
we can turn the tide of the battle.

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,974
I thank you for the advice.

28
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,899
See?

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,157
I think I know where the entrance of
the secret chamber in Qin manor is.

30
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,128
So, the Book of Mountains and Rivers
is within our reach?

31
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,629
No.

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,220
This is an emergency signal.
It's an urgent message.

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,375
Someone wants to
assassinate His Majesty.

34
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,551
What?

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,620
There is faction that
objects the alliance...

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
and is using this opportunity
for assassination.

37
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,647
This is bad.

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,119
My brother is on a hunt with
the Emperor of Northern Realm.

39
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,620
I will send my man
to inform His Majesty.

40
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,280
No, there are others on the hunt.

41
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,927
If the soldiers find out about
the mole from Qi,

42
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,498
we have nothing for our defence.

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,980
I should go.

44
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,620
No, this is too risky.

45
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,460
As the last resort, I can
save my neck with my identity.

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,686
-But my lady, this is...
-I should go.

47
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,740
Don't worry, you can count on me.

48
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:55,250
Who is there?

49
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,220
I thank the Crown Prince
for joining our hunt.

50
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,664
You are welcome.

51
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,368
It's my honour to join you.

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,416
It's also part of my duty.

53
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,703
Just now,

54
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,408
I could tell Prince Li has
remarkable wits and skills.

55
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,340
And now we are having
this friendly conversation together.

56
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:26,007
The Northern Real
is full of decent people.

57
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:30,054
My brother, Wu You,
is an arrogant person.

58
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,041
If he offended Your Majesty,
I apologize for him.

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,000
-It's okay.
-Your Majesty.

60
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,411
Your Highness.

61
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:38,913
Beasts lurk in the area
ahead of us.

62
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:41,709
We need to be cautious
if we move forward.

63
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,386
Your concern is unnecessary.

64
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,663
I may not possess your prowess
in martial arts,

65
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,541
but I am good with the bow.

66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,589
It's not the beast that I fear.

67
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,382
I only fear there might be
no game for our hunt.

68
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,519
Hold on.

69
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,846
What's wrong?
Are Your Majesty afraid?

70
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:09,405
I shall accompany you to the
main camp after I shot this deer.

71
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:11,556
I have no fear for the game.

72
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,257
But this deer is walking
with a slow pace.

73
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,780
There is sentiment in its eyes.

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,691
From what I see,
it's already pregnant.

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,196
Animals are sentient beings.
Such act of killing...

76
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,113
is too much for me to bear.

77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,140
Your Majesty are right.

78
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,768
Emperor of Qi,
you are a ruler of a nation,

79
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,489
but ever so merciful.

80
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:33,647
I am surprised.

81
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,700
Since it's pregnant,

82
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:38,086
I shall not kill it.

83
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,207
Wu You, we have been
looking for you.

84
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:48,709
You are here all this time?

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,620
Greetings, Emperor of Qi.

86
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:54,301
Crown Prince.

87
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,581
Thanks to the Emperor of Qi,

88
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,269
you finally get a chance to
leave the Eastern Palace.

89
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,620
Wu You.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,236
Didn't you see the deer is with child?

91
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,020
You are always so reckless.

92
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,871
If you really did hit the mark,

93
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,500
that would be your sin.

94
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,415
Congratulations, Prince Li.
Hit at the seventh inch.

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,780
It's a python.

96
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,800
Prince Li really is remarkable.

97
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,475
Brave and adept with a bow.

98
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,295
A man of sympathy too.

99
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,279
Emperor of Qi, you should know that...

100
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,140
we need to kill the evil
to save the good.

101
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,222
If we simply speak on paper,

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,500
there is no difference from
pretentious diligence.

103
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,436
Wu You.

104
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,063
How could you be so rude
to the Emperor?

105
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,625
Your Majesty, I apologize
for my brother.

106
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,900
Prince Li never minces word
when he speaks.

107
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,860
Otherwise he wouldn't
have refused the engagement.

108
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,708
He rejected the kind offer from
Your Majesty and the Princess.

109
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:52,346
I never run away from
my responsibility.

110
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,137
Your pretentious concern is
not needed here, Crown Prince.

111
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,187
I refused the engagement
on my own free will.

112
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:00,517
If you need someone to
be responsible for that,

113
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,174
you may place the blame on me.

114
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:04,655
I, Zongzheng Wu You, am no coward.

115
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,500
I don't need the other
to defend my action.

116
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,649
Rumour has it
Prince Li is a prideful person.

117
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:12,536
He thinks he is
superior of everyone.

118
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,970
I get to see just how true
the rumour is.

119
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,988
Rumour has it Emperor of Qi
loves his sister more than anything.

120
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,660
I feel like...

121
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:22,716
that is just an exaggeration.

122
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,340
Your Majesty traded
your sister's life for an alliance.

123
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,290
You used her as your pawn.

124
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,486
There is no love in this action.

125
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,888
That is hilarious.

126
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:35,942
In the world we live in,
war ravaged every corner.

127
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,420
Life is full of uncertainty.

128
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,227
I had no other choice.

129
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,340
I don't know about the others.

130
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:45,726
But I will never do
the biddings of others.

131
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,964
That is only your accusation.

132
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,896
It is not my motive at all.

133
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,999
I simply feel that my sister
is no ordinary lady.

134
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
You two could make the perfect couple.

135
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,799
I should do my best to persuade you...

136
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,700
so you would agree to this marriage.

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,430
If you miss this chance,

138
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,099
I hope you won't
find yourself regretting it.

139
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,097
I have never known the taste
of regret in my entire life.

140
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,460
So long.

141
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:32,033
Wu You must have found a big game.
I should help him out.

142
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,956
Brother, wait for me!

143
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,988
Young and arrogant.

144
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,028
I hope Your Majesty are not offended.

145
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:40,125
General Fu,
you are close to Wu You.

146
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,589
Go and check on him.

147
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:43,872
Yes.

148
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,420
Come.

149
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,424
What happened?

150
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,412
Someone sneaked in
when I was on patrol.

151
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:01,928
I was knocked out.

152
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,535
Did you see the person?

153
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,236
It happened too quickly.

154
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,331
Animals can tell the scent
of human beings.

155
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,340
That eagle might have
recognized my scent.

156
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,774
This is bad, I can't let it find me.

157
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,267
Let's split up.
You lead the troop to the right,

158
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:06,898
-I will go to the left.
-Yes.

159
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,403
Prince Li.

160
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,385
What majestic game
have you found here?

161
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,285
There is no game.

162
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,769
I simply wish to be away
from the vile man...

163
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,779
and take a break.

164
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,998
I am a little exhausted as well.

165
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,989
May I take a break with
Your Highness here?

166
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,258
I said I wish to be away
from vile man.

167
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,548
I shall be on my way now.

168
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,795
What will you do to me next?

169
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:00,504
What do you want of me?

170
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,132
I told you.

171
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,860
We have different backgrounds.

172
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,884
We shouldn't have
be involved in any of these.

173
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,740
You lied to me.

174
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,718
And now you are
blaming me for it?

175
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,550
I wish there was another way.
But I had no other choice.

176
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,784
The duty I have on my shoulder...

177
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,815
is the task I must carry out.

178
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,448
You knew I won't harm you.

179
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,070
That is why you are acting so bold.

180
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,738
That is not what it is.

181
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,224
For me, Your Highness...

182
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,180
are like the moon
shrouded by the clouds,

183
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,900
a blossom hidden by the mist.

184
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,132
I can't seem to understand you.

185
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:46,393
I know.

186
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:49,631
Perhaps you already know
I am from the Western Qi.

187
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:53,798
You even brought me here
to lure me into your trap.

188
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,803
You had everything planned,

189
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,540
you wouldn't let me
get away so easily.

190
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,353
You are asking for the rhetorical.

191
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,198
Can't you see?

192
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:09,437
You will most likely be executed
if the others catch you.

193
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:10,805
But me,

194
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,620
I am the only one that
can't bear to see you get hurt.

195
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,571
-I am putting this on a bet.
-What bet is it?

196
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:16,857
A bet on my life.

197
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,895
I want to know if you
are truly in love with me.

198
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,029
I want you to know,

199
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:29,845
you won the bet.

200
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,096
I hope Your Highness
haven't forgotten.

201
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,628
The difference between us...

202
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,755
is more than just
our status and background.

203
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,300
There are duties the both of us
must carry out.

204
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,188
Man Yao.

205
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,609
We are the same.

206
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,878
Your duty is mine too.

207
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,999
Once, the burden was too much
even for me.

208
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,100
I thought all hopes are lost.

209
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,249
But Man Yao,

210
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:15,097
fate brought us together.

211
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,102
Because of you,

212
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,060
I learned to never give up.

213
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,205
I made up my mind.

214
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,514
Whatever it takes,

215
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,031
I will hold onto those
that is right in front of me.

216
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,620
I will never give up.

217
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,820
But somehow,

218
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,667
there will always be
something you must let go.

219
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,151
No.

220
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,573
Man Yao, that is not true.

221
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:49,674
Do not despair so easily.

222
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:52,383
I care not about who you were.

223
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,580
I don't care what your motives are.

224
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,621
None of those matter to me.

225
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,540
I just want you by my side.

226
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,831
-Your Highness.
-Man Yao.

227
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,035
I love you.

228
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,281
War is upon our nations.

229
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:03,274
Catastrophe ravaged the land.

230
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:07,273
The alliance shall be formed
to free the lands of suffering.

231
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,382
The marriage alliance
shall last forever...

232
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,222
as the two nations join hands.

233
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,915
Together, we shall fend off
the Wei forces...

234
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,380
so the land can finally know peace.

235
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,765
The treaty will be signed
and with the world as witness,

236
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:22,209
none shall betray this vow.

237
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,093
In celebration of
the forming of this alliance,

238
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,477
for the next three nights,

239
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:33,468
curfew will be lifted.

240
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,676
Everyone can enjoy the celebration
with the lantern festival.

241
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,288
Long live the Emperor.

242
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,260
Your Majesty have my gratitude.

243
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,000
Man Yao.

244
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,740
I care not about who you were.

245
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,258
I don't care what your motives are.

246
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,914
I just want you to stay by my side.

247
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,498
Rong Le.

248
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,620
Brother.

249
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,534
I have a report from the Kite.

250
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:18,990
I have never expected a trap will be
set up in the hunting ground.

251
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:21,628
Rong Le.

252
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:23,727
You shouldn't have
risked yourself for me.

253
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:25,770
What if you got hurt?

254
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,909
With the jade amulet you gave me,

255
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,984
I can overcome any danger
that is thrown at me.

256
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,775
But Wu You...

257
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,555
I mean Prince Li...

258
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,296
is almost certain I am no commoner.

259
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,393
He thinks I am a spy from Qi.

260
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:48,066
It doesn't matter what he knows.

261
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:50,214
I won't allow him to hurt you.

262
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,700
Zongzheng Wu You
has a sinister intention.

263
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,436
Refusal of the marriage,

264
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,080
the taunting during the hunt,

265
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,020
and the set-up to test you,

266
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:00,491
he doesn't plan to hide
his hostility for us.

267
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,696
He has a bold ambition.

268
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:05,411
If he finds out who you really are,

269
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,500
things won't end well for us.

270
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,228
Should I...

271
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,686
request to the Emperor and
cancel the engagement?

272
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:16,357
Brother, Prince Li is not
an unreasonable person.

273
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:20,111
With the alliance formed,
Western Qi is the inferior force.

274
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,972
We need the Northern Realm
to recover from the damage of war.

275
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,980
We cannot terminate
the engagement now.

276
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,632
I don't want to be the cause...

277
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,813
of your worries.

278
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,300
Rong Le.

279
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,100
You don't need to shoulder
everything on your own.

280
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,031
Because you are the person
that care for me the most.

281
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,345
You are also the person
I trust the most.

282
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,421
My good sister.

283
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,560
I will not disappoint
your trust in me.

284
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,298
I will live up to
your expectation too.

285
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,540
Once I get the
Book of Mountains and Rivers,

286
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,580
the two of us can go home.

287
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,820
Man Yao.

288
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,942
I love you.

289
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,505
What's the matter?

290
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:20,456
Rong Le?

291
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:23,869
I am fine.

292
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:25,840
I am fine.

293
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,307
What are you laughing at?

294
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,660
I was just thinking that...

295
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,445
since His Majesty came here,

296
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:50,511
Princess Rong Le has been smiling
a lot more.

297
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,790
She told me His Majesty
might bring her back to Qi.

298
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,530
I am so happy for her.

299
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,095
Did she say anything about
going back with her brother?

300
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:01,365
Yes.

301
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,906
Well, the Princess is always
in danger while she is here.

302
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,624
If she is back at Qi,

303
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,693
no one would dare to harm her
under His Majesty' protection.

304
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,872
Do you want to go back too?

305
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,786
Honestly, for me,

306
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,125
wherever the Princess is,
that is where my home is.

307
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,300
We rely on one another in this land.

308
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,460
There is the Princess...

309
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,153
and there is you, Sir Xiao.

310
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:28,272
Sometimes, I don't feel like
we are master and servants.

311
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,020
It's more like a bond of kinship.

312
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,310
I just want my loved ones...

313
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:35,129
to be happy, well
and have a good life.

314
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,774
No matter what happens,

315
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,444
you must take good care
of the Princess.

316
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:43,236
I will give it my all to protect you.

317
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,812
The treaty may have been signed,

318
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,300
but the Emperor of Qi is persistent.

319
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,740
The marriage must be settled
for good before he leaves.

320
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:19,219
Without the marriage as reassurance...

321
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:21,905
and keep Princess Rong Le
in our nation,

322
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,621
the alliance is as fragile
as a piece of paper.

323
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,100
It can be broken at any moment.

324
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:28,413
Indeed.

325
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,467
Both nations want the advantage.

326
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,358
Without any limiting factor,
the treaty will break at anytime.

327
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:38,541
The matter with the marriage
alliance must be dealt with.

328
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,802
The Emperor of Qi
hinted me several times.

329
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,671
He thinks Wu You can be
a great leader one day.

330
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,833
He is willing to help Wu You
with the strength of Qi.

331
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:48,727
But Wu You is unbending.

332
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,780
No one can force him to do anything.

333
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,108
Your Majesty, how are you
going to persuade him?

334
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,150
What happened to Concubine Yun...

335
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,644
was indeed my fault
for letting him down.

336
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,824
All these years, this child of mine
never bowed down to anyone.

337
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,660
He went against me at every corner.

338
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:05,637
I let him do as he pleased.

339
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,567
But the future of
Northern Realm is at stake.

340
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,118
I cannot allow him to act ruthlessly.

341
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,919
Your Majesty, you mean to...

342
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:16,465
I knew it all along.

343
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,207
For the past few months,

344
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,979
Wu You has grown intimate
with the peasant girl.

345
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:23,949
Your Majesty?

346
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,525
My lady, you are frowning
and look absent-minded.

347
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:14,544
Is there anything I can do
to share your burden?

348
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,525
Chen Yu, I appreciate this.

349
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,732
There is one matter...

350
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,720
that I'm still struggling to decide.

351
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,100
No, I do have a decision.

352
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,869
But I just couldn't be certain enough.

353
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:40,646
I wonder what is the matter
that is bothering you.

354
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:43,603
Chen Yu.

355
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:46,059
Have you ever loved someone?

356
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:49,199
My lady.

357
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:51,318
Someone like me...

358
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:53,821
doesn't have the right
to speak about love.

359
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:59,620
I keep having this odd feeling lately.

360
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,602
I feel like my heart...

361
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,196
is being filled with something.

362
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,568
It's so warm and sweet.

363
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:11,134
It's taking my breath away.

364
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,100
I feel like...

365
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:17,212
he means more than anything
in this world to me.

366
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:19,317
However,

367
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:22,653
the feeling is also bitter at times.

368
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:25,427
It feels like a burden
is weighing you down.

369
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,700
Which is why there are
many other things...

370
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:31,837
that are more important
than loving someone.

371
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,914
I will live up to your expectation.

372
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,180
Once I get the
Book of Mountains and Rivers,

373
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,024
the two of us can go home.

374
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:54,627
My lady!

375
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,860
What is this?

376
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:07,309
Prince Li ordered his man
to send this here.

377
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:09,806
Open it.

378
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:15,823
This is so beautiful.

379
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,980
My lady.

380
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,660
I think Prince Li made this
specially for you.

381
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,180
His Highness is inviting you
to the lantern festival.

382
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,900
It's the custom here.

383
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,033
As the lanterns are lit,
lovers meet with each other.

384
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,797
They make the promise for life.

385
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,030
My lady.

386
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:34,267
Whatever your decision is,

387
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:36,263
you will always have my support.

388
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,085
I was thinking...

389
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:41,708
I should just follow my heart.

390
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,287
I need to make
the choice I think is right.

391
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:53,339
Brother, you are still
not done with Man Yao yet?

392
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,929
The lover in the dream of
countless ladies in this country?

393
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,020
The all mighty Prince Li...

394
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,220
is being toyed by a mere lady.

395
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,163
You spent months on her
and made no progress.

396
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,780
You got nothing on her either.

397
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:06,692
I need an opening.

398
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,131
Right, you need the right moment.

399
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,523
But you can't always send me
to guard that old house.

400
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,663
While the Emperor of Qi is in
Zhongshan, we need more security.

401
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:16,489
Especially during
the lantern festival.

402
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,121
Crowds of people will be there.

403
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:19,976
It's easy for someone to sneak in.

404
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:22,518
Just stay put and guard the house.

405
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:24,489
Brother.

406
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,849
Let me take a break for once, okay?

407
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,220
Our father hardly ever launches
celebration in the city.

408
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,780
I was hoping to meet some
pretty ladies with this opportunity.

409
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,674
Thanks to you, I have to
guard the old manor.

410
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,890
Maybe the old man was
just lying to you.

411
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,534
-There is no vault to begin with.
-Don't be ridiculous.

412
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,166
Brother.

413
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:45,592
Why don't you decorate the manor
with some lanterns?

414
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:48,886
You can bring Man Yao
with you there for the night.

415
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,746
In that quiet house,

416
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,495
you two can do whatever you want.

417
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:55,998
Killing two birds with one stone.

418
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,758
I won't be available that night.

419
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,815
Fine, I get to be the expandable.

420
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:26,394
Ya Li, are you going to the
lantern festival with someone?

421
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,340
I never like to be in the crowd.

422
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,180
I want to be at home
and have some rest.

423
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,894
Besides, there is no one to invite me.

424
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,218
You are brilliant and gorgeous.

425
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,225
That is a fact known by all.

426
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,569
I heard there are tonnes of men
waiting to propose to you.

427
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,140
But sadly, none of them
is to your liking.

428
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:49,169
Your Majesty, please
don't make fun of me.

429
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,780
I know.

430
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,239
Are you waiting for someone
to meet with you?

431
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,780
I heard from someone earlier.

432
00:28:56,954 --> 00:29:01,074
They say you were meeting
Wu You in the Teahouse.

433
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:05,665
Ya Li, you have nothing
to be worried about.

434
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,388
For the time being, Prince Li
might not marry Princess Rong Le.

435
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,780
I was thinking about
matchmaking you with Prince Li.

436
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,780
His Majesty can grant you
the engagement with Prince Li.

437
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,331
Your Majesty,
I don't wish to get married.

438
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:21,611
I don't deserve the love
of Prince Li either.

439
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,620
Ya Li, please get up.

440
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:28,318
Why? Do you think Prince Li
will mistreat you?

441
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:30,765
His Highness has never mistreated me.

442
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,702
-But I am just...
-Mother!

443
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,154
Greetings, Your Majesty.

444
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:40,834
Please don't make it hard
for Miss Ya Li.

445
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,160
Miss Ya Li has her own reasons.

446
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,693
She had to keep it
a secret for Wu You.

447
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,860
What does that supposed to mean?

448
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,943
Mother.

449
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,590
I shouldn't be the one that tells you.

450
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:56,508
But seeing how concern you are
with Wu You's marriage,

451
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,262
I must bring it up to you.

452
00:29:58,502 --> 00:29:59,677
Be quick with it.

453
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,427
Wu You is in love with someone.

454
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,658
-What?
-However,

455
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:09,926
the lady is a daughter of a merchant.

456
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:13,727
She meets clients and
runs a teahouse alone.

457
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,038
What?

458
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,709
This is getting more outrageous.

459
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:20,113
This is not adequate at all.

460
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,344
No, Your Majesty.
That girl is actually...

461
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,815
So, he was telling the truth?

462
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,974
Ya Li, I assure you,
I won't leave you disappointed.

463
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,189
I must inform His Majesty now
and get this problem solved.

464
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:39,171
Mother, calm down.

465
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,060
Did you hear what
the Crown Prince said just now?

466
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,245
We didn't hear a word.

467
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,540
Good. If the rumours
reach His Majesty's ear,

468
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:12,736
the consequences is more than
any of you can handle.

469
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,249
We understand.

470
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,655
The arrival of the empress.

471
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:40,610
Your Majesty.

472
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,527
It's been a while
since I am summoned here.

473
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,660
I heard from the physician that...

474
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:06,077
Your Majesty
are a little under the wind.

475
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:08,782
The Emperor of Qi came to our visit.

476
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,004
There are much affairs to work with.

477
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:13,629
Your Majesty must
take care of yourself.

478
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,422
I thank you for the concern.

479
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:22,400
Your Majesty.

480
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:26,482
I wonder if
the Emperor of Qi came here...

481
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,635
to discuss about the engagement
of Prince Li and Princess Rong Le.

482
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:35,373
Lately, there seems
to be some rumours...

483
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,100
about Prince Li's engagement.

484
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,369
Have you heard anything about it?

485
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,028
I don't have a clue about this matter.

486
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,351
Recently, the daughter of
Secretary Sun entered the palace.

487
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,806
I do feel pity for her...

488
00:32:57,003 --> 00:33:00,494
and her bond with Prince Li
as childhood friends.

489
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:02,864
This is nothing to be worried about.

490
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,969
Wu You is a temperamental child.

491
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,380
Please keep an eye on him for me.

492
00:33:09,543 --> 00:33:11,903
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,195
Brother.

494
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,281
Rong Le.

495
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,660
This is the scene
I have been seeing in my dream.

496
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:28,618
It finally came true today.

497
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:32,917
I feel like we went back in time...

498
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:35,668
to the life we spent
in the royal palace of Qi...

499
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:38,468
which was peaceful and quiet.

500
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:43,104
It would be great if there is
no war to be fought.

501
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,220
I could stay by your side
for the rest of my life.

502
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:48,658
Rong Le.

503
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,328
Do you feel unhappy
with your life here?

504
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,420
No, not at all.

505
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,911
Why don't we have some fun
at the feast in palace tonight?

506
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,087
Every time I went to the palace,
people question my motive.

507
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,460
I don't like that.

508
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,332
I can send Xiao Sha to take you
to the lantern festival.

509
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,229
Xiao Sha should be in the palace.

510
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,198
Your safety comes first.
You need not be worried for me.

511
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:17,268
Tonight,

512
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,276
I am not going anywhere.

513
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,780
Very well.
Have a good rest tonight.

514
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,760
Rong Le.

515
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,099
Something seems to be bothering you.

516
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,637
Is there something
you haven't told me?

517
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,018
I...

518
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,545
Nothing.

519
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:41,602
I'll go home once I get the book.

520
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:44,110
Then, I can stay by your side forever.

521
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,540
Sure.

522
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:48,523
I should be on my way now.

523
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,960
Brother, are you all right?

524
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:00,412
Are you having a relapse?
I'll get the medicine for you.

525
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:01,835
Little Xun!

526
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,664
-Little Xun!
-I am fine.

527
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,501
My dear sister.

528
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,947
I have a good news for you.

529
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:11,667
My men has found the
whereabouts of the Physician.

530
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,508
I believe your headache
can finally be cured.

531
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,621
Rong Le.

532
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,519
As long as you are well,

533
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,940
I'll be free from all sicknesses.

534
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,900
Thank you

535
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,986
I should go now.

536
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:32,851
Take care.

537
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:34,736
Same goes for you.

538
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,531
Your Highness.

539
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:53,515
Is Prince Li really going
to leave tonight?

540
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,350
I am not certain either.

541
00:36:57,086 --> 00:37:00,042
Do you really plan to get
the Book of Mountains and Rivers...

542
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,633
and leave this land for good?

543
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,908
Tonight is
the best opportunity we have.

544
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:08,119
" The Minister's Manor "

545
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:11,492
-Leng Yan.
-Yes.

546
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,620
There are eyes and ears
everywhere in the festival.

547
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,380
-Keep your eyes open.
-Yes.

548
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,580
Understood. All the entrances
and exits are heavily guarded.

549
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:20,632
No one shall pass through here.

550
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,566
Brother, you can always
count on Leng Yan.

551
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,336
I want you to stay put as well.

552
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,454
I give you my word.

553
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:29,282
I won't even step out of this house.

554
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,900
I have other matters to see to.

555
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:48,131
Don't you dare sell me out.

556
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:49,985
Otherwise...

557
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,460
Brother, what are the odds?
Why are you here?

558
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,780
Who said you can come out?

559
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,718
I talked to Leng Yan about this.

560
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,720
He will guard the house for me.

561
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,700
I can have some fun here.

562
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,000
You came out without my permission.

563
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,900
Here is something you don't know.

564
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:57,714
There is a tournament
in the House of Fragrance.

565
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,776
Any who gets the right answers
for the riddles...

566
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:02,016
can watch the new
Flower Queen get elected.

567
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,660
You should come with me.

568
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,915
I am not interested.
Go if you want.

569
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,980
You are not
interested in riddles,

570
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,391
but what's so fun about
watching the lanterns?

571
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,982
I am waiting for someone.

572
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:17,286
Man Yao?

573
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,121
You need to be
careful not to fall for her.

574
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,392
-What if...
-What about your riddle games?

575
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,397
Right.

576
00:39:26,086 --> 00:39:27,369
You agree to let me go?

577
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,917
-I am really going now.
-Just go.

578
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:44,235
Brothers on patrol,

579
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,460
come in and get some warmth.

580
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,913
Let's have some wine.

581
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,980
-Come on.
-Let's go.

582
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,422
Come on.

583
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,934
Brother, to Master Leng's health.

584
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,620
-Sure.
-To Master Leng's health.

585
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,056
I'll get you some wine.

586
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:02,913
-Fill the cup.
-Come on and start eating.

587
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:04,191
Dig in.

588
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,629
Man Yao.

589
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,008
You must come here.
