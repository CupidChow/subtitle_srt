Episode 2

3
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,452
I am Princess Rong Le
of Western Qi.

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,809
It's my honour to meet Your Majesty.

5
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,413
At ease, Princess.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,620
Rise.

7
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:28,824
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,167
-Xiao Sha.
-Yes, Princess.

9
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,484
Present the gift to His Majesty.

10
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:37,704
Yes, Princess.

11
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:38,822
Bring it in.

12
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:43,435
Your Majesty, in order to
thank you for your generous gift,

13
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,380
my brother has prepared
this returning gift.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,140
Please accept it.

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,683
White jade glaze cup.

16
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,493
Word is, this white jade glaze cup
has been here for hundreds of years.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,159
There is only a pair of these
in this world and it's priceless.

18
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,073
If you use them to drink tea, the tea
will be fragrant and refreshing.

19
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:12,626
If you use them to
drink water in summer,

20
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,978
they can cool you off, quench your
thirst and you'll feel invigorated.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,504
And your body will be revived.
These cups are really intriguing.

22
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:22,758
The Emperor of Qi has
given me such a treasure.

23
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,520
Minister Yang, write a letter for me.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,494
I want to express my thanks
towards Emperor of Western Qi.

25
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,371
Your Majesty,

27
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:35,292
before our princess
departs to come here,

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,708
my emperor has ordered me
to pass on his words to you.

29
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:42,072
What is it that
Emperor of Qi has to say?

30
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,707
He said that...

31
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:46,725
the white jade glaze cups
are indeed rare treasures.

32
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:50,296
But they are incomparable
to Princess Rong Le...

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,350
who took a high place in his heart.

34
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:55,223
He hopes that your country
can treat our princess well.

35
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,393
By doing so, the hundred-year-deal
between us two will be secured.

36
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:00,174
Of course.

37
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,372
Princess Rong Le is the peace
ambassador between us two countries.

38
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:05,808
She is undoubtedly the
honoured guest of our country.

39
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,096
And she will be marrying my son.

40
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,445
We will give her the best treatment.

41
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,581
Your Majesty, Prince Li...

42
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,397
What is wrong with him?

43
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:21,157
I have already summoned him for
more than two hours. Where is he?

44
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:25,453
Servants in Prince Li's Manor
said that Prince Li is resting.

45
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,202
So, he cannot attend the court.

46
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,267
-Wu Yu.
-Yes, father.

47
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,970
Go to Prince Li's Manor to summon him.

48
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:38,446
Bring him to the court
no matter what you have to do.

49
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:40,168
Yes, father.

50
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,656
Wu You, come out!

51
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,062
Wu You, I beg you.
Let's attend the court, alright?

52
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,944
" Simple and Unadorned "

53
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,465
Wu You.

54
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,540
If you don't come out,
I'll be sent to the royal tomb.

55
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,805
Your Highness.

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,776
We can't continue like this.
His Majesty is still waiting for us.

57
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,990
Don't blame me then.

58
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,248
Father, Wu You is here.

59
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,834
Arrival of Prince Li.

60
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:44,703
Insolent! How dare he comes here
in this manner?

61
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:46,836
Father.

62
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:49,804
Just now, you told me
to use any way I can...

63
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,735
to bring Wu You to the court, right?

64
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:52,949
Shut up!

65
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,214
Scoundrel, get up now!

66
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,460
Wu You, don't be rude.

67
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:23,267
The princess is the peace ambassador
between us two countries.

68
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:26,426
I already prepared your wedding suit
for you. Change into it quickly.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,814
We'll seal this engagement...

70
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,206
in the great hall today and you'll
get married as soon as possible.

71
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,382
When did I agree to getting married?

72
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,300
Your marriage is already set.

73
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,544
Whether you agree or not,
this marriage will go on.

74
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,182
Guards!

75
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:14,714
-Change the clothes for Prince Li.
-Yes, Your Majesty!

76
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:24,934
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,538
Do you really want to use force?

78
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,990
If you really don't want to do it,

79
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:34,055
I can find another person to
get married in your stead.

80
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,793
Wu Yu.

81
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,951
Father.

82
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,167
Since you can find a stand-in
for my marriage,

83
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,493
how about letting him
consummate the marriage too?

84
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,692
Scoundrel, how dare you say that.

85
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,294
I won't marry her.

86
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,140
If you really want to forge alliance
with Western Qi through marriage,

87
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,496
please choose another person.

88
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,747
I'm not sure about other things...

89
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,573
but in this Northern Realm,

90
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,262
we have a lot of princes.

91
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,236
You are chosen by Emperor of Qi.

92
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,631
The marriage is already set.
How can you just change it?

93
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:18,250
Your Majesty.

94
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,487
Please allow me to speak my mind.

95
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,476
Please do, Princess.

96
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:30,129
When I was coming to the
Northern Realm, I was thinking...

97
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:33,469
about how will my
future husband be like.

98
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:37,056
I was thinking that even though
he might not be perfect,

99
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,902
at least he would not
behave like this.

100
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,175
The Northern Realm's
marriage proposal...

101
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
has described so highly of Prince Li.

102
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,526
It said that he is courteous,

103
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,542
brave, intelligent and
extremely resourceful.

104
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,940
But the Prince Li that I saw...

105
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:54,805
is not courteous.

106
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,739
He is arrogant and rude.

107
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,438
He is not brave and intelligent.
Just fallacious reasoning.

108
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,265
He is not resourceful.
Instead, he is wilful and wild.

109
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,936
Just like a kid that
will never grow up.

110
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,905
He acted like a
spoiled child in public.

111
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,936
I understand.

112
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,639
Mutual consent is needed
in a marriage.

113
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:21,704
I too, want to marry a
husband of my choice.

114
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:24,015
And I want to have a
happy and beautiful life.

115
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,053
I don't want to move so far away
from my country to get married.

116
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,237
But for the benefit of my country,

117
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,676
I came to this country out of duty.

118
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,549
I as a woman can do that...

119
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,550
while a manly prince
like you keeps on rejecting it.

120
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,308
Can't you take this righteous cause
for your country?

121
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,998
So all in all, you are set on me.

122
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,250
That might not be true.

123
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:13,667
I just hope that you can give us
a chance to know each other.

124
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,590
But if you still haven't change
your mind after half a year,

125
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,037
I'll do as you say.

126
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,061
I'll marry to another
without complaint.

127
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,358
You sounded so righteous.

128
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,300
But in my opinion,

129
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:30,517
a strong country does not rely
on alliance through marriage.

130
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,337
Only the weak will cower
behind the skirts of a lady...

131
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,741
to hide his own weaknesses.

132
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:38,248
Of course,

133
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:41,915
your self-sacrificing spirit today
is very touching.

134
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,373
But I, Zong Zheng Wu You,

135
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,565
will not exchange my marriage...

136
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,422
for some benefits.

137
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,733
I'm not interested at all...

138
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,018
in your half-a-year deal.

139
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,577
Do you have no interest or
do you have no confidence?

140
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,098
You gave excuses and wanted to escape.

141
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:03,258
Are you afraid that you'll lose to me?

142
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,442
A taunt.

143
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,477
You said that you are strong.

144
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,840
Are you afraid to take on this bet?

145
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,144
Looks like the famous Prince Li...

146
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,604
is not that impressive after all.

147
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,924
We'll do as the princess has said.
Half a year it is.

148
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,780
This court is adjourned.

149
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:49,200
Wu You, I think your plan
will fail this time.

150
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:51,799
Princess Rong Le is not
an easy opponent.

151
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,622
What if she still forces you
to marry her after half a year?

152
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,053
Nobody can force me against my will.

153
00:10:57,853 --> 00:11:00,973
Although it's rumoured that
she is ugly, she has a nice voice.

154
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:04,481
She has a sharp tongue too.
It'll be fun to bicker with her.

155
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,455
Wu You, how about just marrying her?

156
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:08,417
If you admire her so much,

157
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:10,094
you can marry her.

158
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:15,209
No. She is too capable.
I can't handle her.

159
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:18,197
Greetings, Your Highness.

160
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,182
His Majesty has summoned Prince Li.

161
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,660
I don't have time for him.

162
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,307
If you don't have time to come
to me, how about I come to you?

163
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:33,969
Father.

164
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,204
Father, I'll take my leave first.

165
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:43,948
Let's go.

166
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,360
I know.

167
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:52,910
You still bear grudge towards me for
the things that happened in the past.

168
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:56,183
All these years, you paid no attention
to the country's affairs...

169
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:57,695
and you didn't attend court.

170
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:59,533
You don't even want to see me.

171
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,089
And I let you.

172
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,035
But today's matter holds great
importance for our country.

173
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,258
You can't act recklessly about it.

174
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,614
During the war against Wei last time,

175
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,333
crown prince had directed
the armies with ill ease.

176
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:21,052
In the end, they lost and fled
from the war until they were...

177
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,199
forced by Wei army to strip off
their armours. Such disgrace.

178
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,524
I have to bring back
the honour of our country.

179
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,141
So, I have to declare war
against Wei again.

180
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,108
And having an alliance
with Western Qi...

181
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,821
can strengthen our hold.

182
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,940
It is of vital importance
for our country.

183
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,153
Crown prince is the one who made
the mistake in the war with Wei.

184
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,879
What has it got to do with me?

185
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,580
I already made an exception by
helping out with the issue in south.

186
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,322
What else do you want?

187
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,730
I was very glad when you
lent a helping hand...

188
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,661
with the issue in the south.

189
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,311
It shows that in your heart,

190
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,185
you still care for the country.

191
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:57,907
Wu You, if you can forget the past...

192
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,708
and let go of the prejudice
and resentment towards me,

193
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:03,966
with your brilliance, you'll pioneer
a great undertaking in the future.

194
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:07,942
You want me to forget the past?
Impossible.

195
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,670
And it's impossible that I'll marry...

196
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,447
that princess from Western Qi
after half a year.

197
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,972
Your Majesty.

198
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:18,178
You are the one bent on using woman
to consolidate your power.

199
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,380
As for what I want,

200
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,359
I'll get it honourably with
my own capability.

201
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:27,122
Wu You.

202
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,362
Recently, my body is not
as strong as before.

203
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:33,704
I'm already past my prime.

204
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,216
This country...

205
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:39,208
needs a capable and reliable heir.

206
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:41,198
You are still in the prime of manhood.

207
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,652
You have so many women and sons.

208
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:45,815
Your heir is the crown prince.

209
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,395
Nothing to do with me.

210
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,191
This princess is as spoilt and
wilful as the rumours said.

211
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:03,051
Never thought that this arrogant
Prince Li will suffer too.

212
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,415
He always looked down on me
because His Majesty dotes on him.

213
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:11,429
This princess...

214
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:15,152
has helped me to vent out
my grievance towards him.

215
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,815
I think that this arranged marriage
between Prince Li and the princess...

216
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,269
will be very unfavourable to you.

217
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,494
If Prince Li really marries
the princess of Western Qi,

218
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,509
his might will be redoubled.

219
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:31,387
And sooner or later,
he will threaten your position.

220
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,350
Minister Yu, you worry too much.

221
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,490
Before my father regains
his lands back then,

222
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:41,397
as the eldest, I had gone into war
by his side far and wide.

223
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,388
I'm so much more popular
than Wu You...

224
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,565
who paid no attention
to the country's affairs.

225
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,945
Even though I lost in
the war with Wei,

226
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,977
my father has never
tried to demote me.

227
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,603
As for this Prince Li,

228
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,913
do you think they will
really get married...

229
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,036
based on today's situation?

230
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,512
How wise of you.
You outmatch you opponent.

231
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,856
Your Majesty, Princess Rong Le has
reached the Northern Realm safely.

232
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,900
And she had entered the palace to meet
the emperor of Northern Realm.

233
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,193
Have you released the Kite to
search for highly-skilled doctor...

234
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:01,641
as I had ordered?

235
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:02,785
We had sent a team....

236
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,845
to Winter Mountain and other places
the doctor went to search for him.

237
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Arrival of Her Majesty!

238
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,611
-Step out first.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,632
Greetings, mother.

240
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,481
-Rise.
-Thank you, mother.

241
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:43,157
I had reminded you time after time.

242
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,607
Those who seek to be successful...

243
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:49,231
have to be ruthless and incisive.

244
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,936
Rather bear brief, sharp pains
than lasting ones.

245
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,063
Thank you for your teachings.

246
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,995
Have you investigate the
assassination done to you by Chen...

247
00:16:58,141 --> 00:16:59,901
when you went out from the palace?

248
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,188
Don't you know that...

249
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,072
those people had already
been silenced by death?

250
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,700
Greetings, my princess.

251
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,772
We have reached the Princess Manor.
Please get off from the carriage.

252
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,716
" Princess Manor "

253
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:48,509
His Majesty had decreed.

254
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:51,119
Princess Rong Le is an honoured guest
of this Northern Realm.

255
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:53,724
Make sure to serve her well.
Give her the best treatment.

256
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,970
We'll do as his command.

257
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,030
This way please, Princess.

258
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,829
You are our honoured guest.

259
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,958
We should be the one
responsible for your safety.

260
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:07,807
Your entourage is new here.
They are not familiar with this place.

261
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:10,740
They need to get used to it slowly.

262
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,817
Your guard will be staying
temporarily in a post-house.

263
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:14,418
No need to worry about them.

264
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,303
I don't mind with the others.

265
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:20,453
But my personal bodyguard,
Xiao Sha, is sent by my brother.

266
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,731
Before I left, my brother
specially reminds me that...

267
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,780
I can't let this guard leave my side.

268
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:27,014
If even he has to
stay in a post-house,

269
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,441
I would not know how
to explain to my brother.

270
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,245
Alright.

271
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,020
Let him through.

272
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,771
This way please, Princess.

273
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:43,418
This manor is specially
made for you, Princess.

274
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:46,593
The design in this place is
made according to your likings.

275
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,196
We hope that you'll find this
a home away from home.

276
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,552
His Majesty is deeply apologetic for
the things that happened yesterday.

277
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,434
He has specially prepared some gifts
as a way of expressing that.

278
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:59,546
Thank you for His Majesty's kindness.

279
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:01,073
Madam Qiu Yi.

280
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,814
She is the housekeeper
of this manor, Qiu Yi.

281
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:08,152
You can go to her
if you need anything.

282
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,212
Greetings, Princess.

283
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,557
Be at ease.

284
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,186
I won't keep you from
resting then, Princess.

285
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,840
You may leave too.

286
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,995
-Anything else?
-You are still an unmarried lady.

287
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:27,986
Although Captain Xiao is with you,

288
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
he is still a man.

289
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,375
According to the rules, he can only
stay in the outer courtyard.

290
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,176
I am the princess of Western Qi.

291
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,051
As long as I'm still unmarried,
I'll still be a Western Qi's citizen.

292
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:39,677
This is none of your concern.
You may leave.

293
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,414
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

294
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,317
Please don't make it difficult for me.

295
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:47,063
I'm entrusted by His Majesty to
take care of Princess Manor.

296
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,047
-I'm just following the rules.
-What are the rules?

297
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:53,528
Since His Majesty has given me
a manor with Western Qi design,

298
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,568
here, my words are the rules.

299
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,042
Leave.

300
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,601
Looks like you are not willing
to obey my order as well.

301
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:08,158
If that's the case, I won't be
staying in this Princess Manor.

302
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,622
Let's go.

303
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,996
Princess.

304
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,056
Princess.

305
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,735
Please calm down, Princess.
I don't mean to disobey you.

306
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,828
I'm just doing it for your own good.

307
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,014
Xiao Sha.

308
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,197
Captain Xiao.
What are you doing?

309
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,294
I should be the one asking you.

310
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:32,174
How dare you block
the princess's path.

311
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:33,637
What are you trying to do?

312
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:35,490
I want to ask His Majesty.

313
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,660
Are you treating me
as an honoured guest...

314
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,421
or are you trying to cage me.

315
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,071
You have overstated things.

316
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:44,167
I can do nothing when
Prince Li rejected the marriage.

317
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:47,528
But if the servants in my manor
dare to disobey me...

318
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,767
I think Prince Li
wouldn't blame her...

319
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,469
for killing one or two of her servants
to vent out her anger.

320
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:55,084
Please spare my life.
I've learnt my mistake.

321
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,880
You are the mistress in this manor.

322
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,372
If you insist that Captain Xiao
should stay here,

323
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,059
I won't dare to stop you.

324
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:02,832
But if you want to leave the manor,

325
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,283
even if you kill me,

326
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:06,448
I'll have to send some guards
from the manor to go with you...

327
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,037
in order to protect you.

328
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,171
If something dangerous happens to you,
even my death...

329
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:12,914
wouldn't be enough for me
to atone for my sins.

330
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,340
<i>Prince Li of the Northern Realm,
Zong Zheng Wu You,</i>

331
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,439
is a very talented man,

332
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,698
the sole disciple of Qin Yong,
ex-chief Minister of Northern Realm.

333
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:50,358
So, it's very possible that he has...

334
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,962
'The Book of Mountains and Rivers'
written by Qin Yong.

335
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,564
-The Book of Mountains and Rivers?
-That's right.

336
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,933
The Book of Mountains and Rivers...

337
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,012
has recorded the rise and dip
of the mountains,

338
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,780
the cities, the pools and strategic
places from all over the world.

339
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:06,827
It has detailed information about
astronomy, geography, meteorology...

340
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:09,258
and the fastest way to win a war.

341
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,306
So,

342
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:13,911
there is a rumour that...

343
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:16,921
those who possessed the book
will possess the world.

344
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:19,579
<i>If I can get my hands
on this book within half a year,</i>

345
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:22,578
<i>I can go back to Western Qi
and stay by my brother's side.</i>

346
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,575
-Princess.
-Do you have the information?

347
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,310
Yes. It's in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

348
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:28,453
Alright. I have to go out a while.

349
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,249
You want to go out alone?

350
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:33,248
This Princess Manor
is heavily guarded.

351
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,740
We need to find a way
if I want to go out.

352
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:37,386
Alright, Princess.

353
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,140
Madam.

354
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:44,330
Madam, such beautiful flowers.

355
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,602
You just plucked it for
the princess, right?

356
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,176
How kind of you, Madam.

357
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,119
Miss Ling Yue.

358
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,128
The princess is our mistress.

359
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:54,288
It's only right to serve her.

360
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:55,983
But you are not our mistress.

361
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,900
This pot of flowers is very expensive.

362
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:01,289
What if you break it?

363
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,514
Madam, let me bring it in for you.

364
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,687
Have you no regards for the rules?

365
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,696
Ever since the princess lives here,

366
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,561
as the housekeeper, I don't even
have the chance to meet her.

367
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,243
It's all because of you and Lian Xin.

368
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,460
Princess gave the order
to not let you in.

369
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,180
How dare you threaten me
with princess.

370
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,894
Captain Xiao.

371
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:33,252
This is just a misunderstanding.

372
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:36,154
It's just that I haven't been
serving the princess lately.

373
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,851
Those who know...

374
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,281
will know that those two
have served the princess well.

375
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:43,053
Those who don't will think that
the princess is being petty...

376
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:46,053
and is still mad at me
for the incident last time.

377
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:50,903
Madam, you think too much.

378
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,452
Our princess is very magnanimous.

379
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,702
She just complimented you just now.

380
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,498
She said that you are very meticulous.

381
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:59,567
And you ensured that everything
in the manor runs smoothly.

382
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:03,059
By the way, the princess
is going to award you.

383
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,727
She had asked you to gather
everybody in the garden.

384
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:08,841
She wants to award everybody at once.

385
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,617
I'll leave this to you then,
Miss Lian Xin.

386
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:25,302
Thank you, Captain Xiao.

387
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,049
Please give these out to everybody.

388
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,648
Please ask the kitchen to
prepare more food for tonight.

389
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:56,068
Tonight, there will be a feast
for everybody.

390
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,941
Thank you, Princess.

391
00:24:58,183 --> 00:24:59,663
Thank you, Princess.

392
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,860
There are enough for everybody.

393
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,274
Don't fight for it.

394
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,106
Take it. This is for you.

395
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:24,829
Wu You.

396
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:27,708
No need to strike out at father
every time you see him.

397
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:30,005
Actually, he cares for you the most.

398
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,735
Alright.
I won't talk about it anymore.

399
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,188
Wu You, look.

400
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,441
Look at what I've brought you.

401
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
Take a look.

402
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:51,435
-This is a good tea.
-Of course it is.

403
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:54,209
This tea set is not a
normal tea set as well.

404
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:57,130
I got this treasure from the Rare Item
Chest in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

405
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,154
I heard that this
Rare Item Chest contains...

406
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,020
luxurious clothes and rare treasures
from all over the world.

407
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:05,574
I have to plead the shopkeeper...

408
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:08,191
to sell me the tea and the tea set.

409
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:12,358
Wu You, I know that you love tea.

410
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:15,453
If only we can go for tea tasting
in the Moon Embrace Teahouse...

411
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:17,840
and take a look at their
Rare Item Chest...

412
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:19,544
Moon Embrace Teahouse, right?

413
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:22,050
That's right. Come along with me.

414
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:25,479
This is indeed a good tea.

415
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:29,168
But I think it doesn't
taste very pure.

416
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:32,581
It's not pure? Impossible.

417
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:34,924
I can't possibly lie to you, Wu You.

418
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:36,332
Do you think you can lie to me?

419
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:38,285
-No.
-Fine.

420
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,273
On behalf of this tea,

421
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,010
I'll go with you this time.

422
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,676
" Moon Embrace Teahouse "

423
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,614
How rude. How can you just go away
after running into me?

424
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,042
Mistress, you are here.

425
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:27,671
We have been waiting for you.

426
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:32,402
Although it's far,
I have arrived safely.

427
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:35,410
This teahouse is
brimming with customers.

428
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:36,904
Looks like it's doing well.

429
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,510
Good soil to plant the tea tree in.

430
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,460
And the best water to
steep the tea leaves in.

431
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,699
Our master has high aspiration.
Of course we'll have good business.

432
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:46,810
You might be doing well.

433
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:50,612
But I heard that you are already
carried away with your success.

434
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:53,619
Just like the kite that
flies high above.

435
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,702
We are no longer of
importance to you.

436
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:57,673
That is not true, Mistress.

437
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:01,762
No matter how high the kite flies,
the master still holds the string.

438
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,359
Since you are already here personally,

439
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:06,374
from now on,
you'll be the decision-maker...

440
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:08,428
for every matters
regarding this teahouse.

441
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,464
Looks like you are the shopkeeper
of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

442
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:14,424
Yes, I am. Greetings, Mistress.

443
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,089
This way please, Mistress.

444
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,358
Greetings, Princess.

445
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,736
Be at ease.

446
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,748
From now on, when I'm here,
I won't be a princess.

447
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,789
You just need to address me
as mistress.

448
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:15,699
Yes, Mistress.

449
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:17,585
Before this,

450
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,660
there were rumours about the
princess of Western Qi being ugly.

451
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,963
Is that the work of Moon Embrace
Teahouse and the Kite?

452
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,053
You are indeed brilliant.

453
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,725
His Majesty knows that
you didn't do it willingly.

454
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,380
So, he wants to buy you
as much time as he can.

455
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,923
I understand the troubles he took.

456
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,263
We'll come back to this matter
after half a year.

457
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,882
I think you know the purpose
of me coming here.

458
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:42,791
We are still searching for
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

459
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,002
Can you tell me more about
The Book of Mountains and Rivers?

460
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,185
Have a seat.

461
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:56,323
Sixteen years ago,

462
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,780
there were a few major incidents
in the Northern Realm.

463
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:00,757
For example,
Fu Yuan passed away in a fire.

464
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:02,158
Fu Yuan?

465
00:30:02,355 --> 00:30:04,449
Fu Yuan is the youngest daughter
of the previous Emperor of Chen.

466
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,951
Before Northern Realm reclaims
their lands, they align with Chen.

467
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:08,912
Fu Yuan was set for marriage.

468
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:11,050
In the end, Fu Yuan had
to leave her home town...

469
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,697
to marry the Emperor
of Northern Realm.

470
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,313
After the emperor reclaimed his lands,
he appointed her as Queen.

471
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,639
But after that, they turned against
each other for reasons we don't know.

472
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:20,997
Fu Yuan was sent to the Cold Harem.

473
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:23,292
And she passed away
in an accidental fire.

474
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:26,311
So, this fire is related to
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

475
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,580
We are yet to be sure
about the relations.

476
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:32,455
But there are a few other incidents
that happened on the same year.

477
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:35,889
Emperor of Northern Realm's most
favourite concubine passed away too.

478
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:38,506
These two women were
eyesores for each other.

479
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,669
But they died one after
another in accidents.

480
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:45,019
Not long after, ex-chief minister,
Qin Yong and his family were killed.

481
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:48,269
Word is, he was related to
Lady Yun's death.

482
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:51,013
From then on, the Emperor of
Northern Realm has imposed a ban.

483
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,752
Everything regarding Qin Yong,
including the book became taboos.

484
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:56,501
Nobody dares to mention
about it after that.

485
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,527
There is no word about it at all?

486
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:01,734
Although Qin Yong is dead, many
of his former subordinates still live.

487
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:03,429
I started my investigation from here.

488
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,166
And I did find a person.

489
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,165
Princess.

490
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,152
The night feast is ready.

491
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,450
Please inform the princess,
Miss Lian Xin.

492
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,894
When are we going to start the feast?

493
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,426
The princess hasn't
been sleeping well lately.

494
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,788
She is still napping.

495
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,608
When she wakes, I'll inform her.

496
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,347
I'll take my leave then.

497
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:38,824
-Ling Yue.
-She's gone?

498
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,403
Why is the princess still not here?

499
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,100
I'll go and bring back the princess.
Both of you stay here.

500
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,948
Wu You, we are here.

501
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:57,716
If you want to drink tea in Zhongshan,

502
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,951
everybody will come to
Moon Embrace Teahouse.

503
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,082
But if they want to listen
to music and drink wine,

504
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,213
they will go to House of Fragrance.

505
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,273
The Flower Queen of the
House of Fragrance, Miss Chen Yu...

506
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:09,028
is indeed a beauty that put
the moon and flowers to shame.

507
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,633
But nobody knows her true identity.

508
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:16,609
So, Miss Chen Yu has news about
The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

509
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:18,434
I'm still not sure if she has...

510
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:20,170
any usable information.

511
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:22,032
But I'm sure that...

512
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:24,964
her father who was punished is the
former subordinate of Qin Yong.

513
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:28,566
Good.

514
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,471
She is an important lead.

515
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,386
You have to investigate more
about her.

516
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,271
By the way, is there anyone
looking out for her?

517
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:40,598
Miss Chen Yu is a beauty of her own.

518
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,597
Of course she has a lot of admirers.

519
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:45,571
A lot of aristocrats from the capital
want to get close to her.

520
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:48,587
Recently, I heard that Prince Chen
has frequented that place.

521
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:51,402
Alright, understood.

522
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,735
From today onwards,
you are the mistress here,

523
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,980
your name is Man Yao.

524
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,780
Before this, you roamed the world
doing business with your father.

525
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,019
And you came back recently
to take over this teahouse.

526
00:33:01,174 --> 00:33:03,960
On the surface, Moon Embrace
Teahouse is opened to all.

527
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,492
And we have the best silks and satin
in the Rare Item Chest.

528
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:09,250
But actually, we are using it as
a cover to gather information...

529
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:11,366
and as a cover up for
the Kite's activities.

530
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:13,778
So, this is the rendezvous
point for the Kite.

531
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,131
Using a shop as a cover.
That is quite smart.

532
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:20,606
Mistress, we had prepared the papers
that'll prove this identity of yours.

533
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:22,293
Everything is flawless.

534
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:28,904
" Rare Item Chest "

535
00:33:57,895 --> 00:33:59,455
Help!

536
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,129
Sir Zhao!

537
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:39,346
Are you alright, Mistress?

538
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,200
Go.

539
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:55,510
Sir Zhao!

540
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,380
Sir Zhao is dead.

541
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,036
So,

542
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,593
this is the real reason
you brought me here.

543
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,308
Wu You, I don't mean to lie to you.

544
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,331
But this man holds the evidence
against higher-ups in court...

545
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,660
that worked with local officers
to sell posts and titles.

546
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:31,142
He doesn't trust anybody.
He trusts only you.

547
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,015
He said that he'll only hand over
the evidence when he sees you.

548
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:40,526
Wu You. I know that you rarely
meddle with this kind of things.

549
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:43,101
So, I rarely trouble you with these.

550
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,950
But look at him.

551
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,085
Sir Zhao is just a
minor local officers.

552
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,796
He risks his life to keep
this piece of evidence...

553
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:53,325
so that one day, he'll have the
chance to clean up the officialdom...

554
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:56,652
and give a glimmer of hope
to those with real talents.

555
00:36:57,161 --> 00:37:00,169
Wu You. I just want to help him.
I don't know that it'll be like this.

556
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:03,768
So what if he's a good officer?

557
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:07,991
He has aspiration but
he overreached himself.

558
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,733
They dare to murder him
under our scrutiny.

559
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,946
This is outrageous. I have to
avenge Sir Zhao for his death.

560
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,064
Wu Yu. Selling official posts
and titles are grave crimes until...

561
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:24,089
they dare to kill someone during
daylight in heavily-guarded capital.

562
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:27,978
Do you still think that
the power behind this...

563
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,334
is something that you
can take care of with ease?

564
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:34,020
What do you mean then?

565
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:36,195
Even if you report this case
to the authorities,

566
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:37,875
you won't get any results.

567
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:41,169
Unless you have an
irrefutable evidence.

568
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,678
Give this man a proper burial.

569
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,163
Take care of his family.

570
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:53,428
Your Highness. All of the assassins
had ended their own lives.

571
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:55,436
We found only this.

572
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,886
No need to look.

573
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,279
Someone must have
taken the things inside.

574
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:06,499
Father.

575
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:09,455
-What's the situation?
-Luckily we took precautions.

576
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,471
We managed to murder Sir Zhao
before he meets the two princes.

577
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:15,567
Just that none of my men came back.

578
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:17,328
And the paper is gone.

579
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:22,141
We can't let Prince Li
get his hand on this paper.

580
00:38:22,414 --> 00:38:24,961
It seems that those princes have
ended up empty-handed as well.

581
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:28,571
Maybe the assassins had taken care
of that paper before they die.

582
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,307
We can't lower our guards.

583
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:35,950
Most of the money from selling posts
goes to the crown prince.

584
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,526
But our family is the middle-man.

585
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,510
If this matter is exposed,

586
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:42,508
our family will be standing
at the line of fire.

587
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:44,391
And we'll be in big trouble.

588
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,909
The crown prince never thought
of Prince Li as a threat.

589
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,993
If he doesn't meddle with official
affairs, why would he meet Sir Zhao?

590
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,821
Prince Li is a beast that lurks in
the dark waiting for his chance.

591
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,172
Crown prince has underestimated
his opponent.

592
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,722
Keep a close eye on
Prince Li and Prince Chen.

593
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:03,897
Report to me if something is amiss.

594
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:05,730
Yes, father.

595
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:12,060
Are you alright, Mistress?

596
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,672
Prince Li has two major taboos.

597
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:21,243
One is alcohol and another one
is touching women.

598
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,108
Just now was a close call.

599
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:32,586
No wonder.

600
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,419
I just never thought that...

601
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:37,245
they'll be here.

602
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:38,726
Prince Li loves tea.

603
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:41,063
That's why they hide their
identities and come here.

604
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,216
You have to be careful.
There must be no flaw.

605
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:45,539
Understood.

606
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,984
Come here, both of you.

607
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:59,732
Let me ask you,
why is Sir Zhao murdered?

608
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,542
And, why did they
try to kill both of you?

609
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:06,554
Is Sir Zhao your friend?

610
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:08,148
That's right.

611
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,842
Let's be clear. Are you asking me
or am I asking you the questions?

612
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:13,794
Pardon me.

613
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,462
Your friend is the cause
of the incident today.

614
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,898
Moon Embrace Teahouse
has suffered great loss.

615
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,620
Normally, we will have to ask for
compensation from both of you.

616
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,167
But since that both of you
had saved us just now,

617
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:28,158
I won't be asking you
for the compensation.

618
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,201
Let's just say that you had
repaid it by saving our lives.

619
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:31,592
Who are you?

620
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:34,451
-This is...
-I'm not asking you.

621
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,423
My name is Man Yao.

622
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,478
I'm the mistress of this teahouse.

623
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,349
Mistress?

624
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:44,831
Why I never know that the
Moon Embrace Teahouse has a mistress?

625
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,434
And you are a woman.

626
00:40:46,723 --> 00:40:49,418
Although I'm a woman,
I have the aspiration of a man.

627
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,372
Since young, I roamed the world
doing business with my elder.

628
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:53,488
I never thought that
I'll encounter this incident...

629
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:54,947
right after I reach here.

630
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:56,401
Is that so?

631
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,834
You haven't answered me.
Why did they chase after you?

632
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:00,660
Did you see anything?

633
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,380
I really don't know.

634
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:07,082
When I came out just now,
they were already fighting.

635
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:10,189
Luckily both of you managed
to save my life in time.

636
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:12,409
Have you seen this before?

637
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:16,838
Think carefully. This is the
possession of the deceased.

638
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:19,708
We found it here.
But the things inside are gone.

639
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,740
I really don't know.
