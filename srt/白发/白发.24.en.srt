Episode 24

3
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,640
I heard that Prince Zhen Bei
from Chen is very handsome...

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,040
and he's good in riding and shooting.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,320
He's here this time
to choose his bride.

6
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,760
I wonder which lady
will be so fortunate.

7
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,240
But if we were to be married to Chen,
we'll be far away from our homeland.

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,520
Arrival of Her Majesty!

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,840
All of you have found it, right?

10
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
Next, Prince Zhen Bei will...

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,320
personally reveal the treasure to us.

12
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,160
Have you found the treasure?

13
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,440
You better think about how are you
going to apologise to me later.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,920
Zhao Yun, we meet again.

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,320
You've found the treasure
that I've hidden.

16
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,600
So,

17
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,080
I'll give this horsewhip that
represents the supreme power...

18
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,000
of Chen to you.

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,400
And please agree to my request...

20
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
to be my wife.

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,840
What? Wife?

22
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
This must be a surprise for you,
Princess Zhao Yun.

23
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,960
Prince Zhen Bei wanted
to use a special way...

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,760
to choose his bride.

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,280
He has discussed this
with me in private.

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
The lucky lady who can
find his treasure today...

27
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,760
will become his wife.

28
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
So congratulations, Princess Zhao Yun.

29
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
He has plotted against you.

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,080
-Let me teach him a lesson.
-Wu Yu!

31
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
Don't be reckless.
This is a serious matter.

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
-Let's bring this to father. Let's go.
-Wu You.

33
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
It's alright. Don't be scared.

34
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
Everything is set.

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
We have to win this war against Wei.

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,000
According to our agreement
with Western Qi,

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
as soon as we go into war,

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,920
they will support us with food
and give us a safe passage.

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,920
But now, not only they
didn't send us any food,

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,400
they had sealed off the public road
between us and them.

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,680
If this public road is sealed off,

43
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,440
we'll have to make a detour
if we want to march into Wei.

44
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,720
As soon as our travel time lengthen,

45
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm afraid that Wei will find out
about us and take precautions.

46
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,800
No need to worry about our route.

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,560
As soon as we form
an alliance with Chen,

48
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,320
they'll send us their best horses.

49
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,440
After the marriage alliance,

50
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,040
they'll send us 1,000 horses
of the best quality.

51
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,960
If we have strong horses,

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
we can shorten the travel time.

53
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
Your Highness, you can't go in.

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
-Let me inform His Majesty first.
-Move aside.

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,600
They cannot get married.

56
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,440
They cannot get married.
I don't agree with it.

57
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,840
Insolent fool.

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,920
Do you think I need your agreement
for this marriage alliance?

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,960
Father.

60
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,800
I love Zhao Yun.

61
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,320
I want to marry Zhao Yun.

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,320
You can't let her marry
Prince Zhen Bei.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
What happened?

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Father, at the imperial garden today,

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,800
Prince Zhen Bei has proposed
to Zhao Yun in public.

66
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,840
I don't think that...

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
we need Chen's support
to fight the war against Wei.

68
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,680
Besides, I don't agree to form
an alliance through marriage.

69
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,400
This marriage alliance is
already a done deal.

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,440
Moreover, I've already promised him
to let him choose his own bride.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,600
Since he has chosen Zhao Yun,

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,200
I'll keep my promise to him.

73
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
I won't go back on my words.

74
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,200
Uncle. Please help me
change my father's mind.

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,080
Your Majesty, I think we still
have room to save this situation.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,880
Prince Zhen Bei doesn't know
the ladies here well enough.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,200
If you tell him that...

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,680
Princess Zhao Yun is already
engaged to Prince Chen,

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm sure that Prince Zhen Bei
won't force her to marry him.

80
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,960
That's right. You are right, uncle.

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Father, please tell
Prince Zhen Bei that...

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Zhao Yun belongs to me.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,800
Your Majesty.

84
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,840
The envoy of Prince Zhen Bei
has requested to meet Your Majesty.

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,760
-Let him in.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,520
Greetings, Emperor of Northern Realm.

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
Please be at ease.

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,280
Why are you here, envoy?

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,760
Prince Zhen Bei has chosen
Princess Zhao Yun as his bride.

90
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,520
As soon as they are married,

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,480
we will act up to our agreement...

92
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,840
and send 1,000 horses of the
best quality to Northern Realm...

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,240
with an extra of 100 horses.

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
Aren't there any women in Chen?

95
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
Why did you come here
to take away ours?

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,040
Father.

97
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,080
When we form a marriage alliance
with Western Qi,

98
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,920
they had promised us to
hold up their end of bargain.

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,680
But until now, they have
paid no heed to the deal.

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,360
We've already learnt a lesson from
the alliance with Western Qi.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,040
We can't make the
same mistake again with Chen.

102
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,280
Emperor of Northern Realm,

103
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,240
if Northern Realm violates
this marriage alliance,

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,000
Prince Zhen Bei will return
to Chen immediately.

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,160
And thus, I'll bid my farewell
with Your Majesty in his stead.

106
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Thank you for cordial hospitality.

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,560
Please inform Prince Zhen Bei.

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,200
Since I've agreed to this marriage
alliance, I won't go back on my words.

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
Princess Zhao Yun will be...

110
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,680
the bride for this alliance and she'll
travel to Chen in two days' time.

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,440
Please ask Prince Zhen Bei...

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,440
to carry out his promise immediately.

113
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Thank you for your generosity.

114
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Father, for the marriage alliance
with Western Qi,

115
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,280
you've already sacrificed
Wu You's happiness.

116
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
Now, for the marriage
alliance with Chen,

117
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,840
you've sacrificed my happiness.

118
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,640
If we lost in the war against Wei,

119
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,720
are you going to sacrifice
another child's happiness...

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,120
-to form a marriage alliance with Wei?
-How dare you.

121
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,800
How dare you question me.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,160
You are the one...

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,720
who didn't make clear about your
relationship with Zhao Yun.

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,160
Now, Prince Zhen Bei
has beaten you to it.

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,960
Now, you want to question me
about sacrificing you?

126
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,640
Even if I do, it'll be
my right to sacrifice you.

127
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,360
As my son,
you've enjoyed a life of luxury.

128
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
It's time for you to take up
your duty as the prince.

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,480
Father.

130
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,440
I've never wanted to be a prince.

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
If I have a choice,

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,480
I rather be a commoner.

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,440
I want a father who
loves and adores me.

134
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,040
I want a father who will
put my happiness first...

135
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,080
and not a high and mighty emperor who
cares only about power and benefits.

136
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
You!

137
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Wu Yu, calm down.

138
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
Don't be so childish.

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
Wu You.

140
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,560
You are so calm and collected.

141
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,160
But why couldn't you stop Man Yao from
getting married back then?

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
You argued so hard with father...

143
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,760
to try to stop this marriage alliance.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,880
But do you know that
this form of alliance...

145
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,760
has been here for hundreds of years?

146
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,440
You want to change it all by yourself?

147
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,440
Am I the one being childish or
are you the one being naive and proud?

148
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,600
Wu Yu.

149
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,320
Even if Prince Zhen Bei
didn't choose Zhao Yun today,

150
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll still stand out to protest
this marriage alliance.

151
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,520
Wu You,

152
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
can we prioritise our problems first?

153
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,880
Now, we can't even stop Zhao Yun from
getting married for this alliance.

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,440
Do you think it's the right time
to talk about our protest?

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
This is absurd.
I haven't even fight against Wei...

156
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,440
and both of you are already
fighting with each other.

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
If both of you are
fighting each other,

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
how are we going to fight
against our enemies together?

159
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,480
Wu Yu, stop rubbing salt
onto your brother's wound.

160
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
Wu You, your brother has spoken
those words in a fit of rage.

161
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,680
Don't take it to your heart.

162
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Your Majesty, your sons are
still young and full of passion.

163
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,400
They aren't able to understand
your difficulties for the moment.

164
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,160
Please forgive them.

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,400
Father, you were once
young and full of passion too.

166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
Have you forgotten...

167
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,000
about those wild things that you
did for Lady Yun back then?

168
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,600
Scoundrel!

169
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
Xuan Ming.

170
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,960
I have to put our nation first.

171
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,360
You are their uncle.

172
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
Why didn't you help me
discipline them well?

173
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,840
It's my fault for not
teaching them well enough.

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
Same goes to you, Wu You.

175
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,680
Your brother spends
most of his time with you.

176
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,320
And he had only learnt
all the bad from you.

177
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,560
Both of you came to me
to make a huge scene...

178
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,600
because of a woman!
How disgraceful!

179
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
Wu You, go and get
your brother back...

180
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,200
in case he does something absurd.

181
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, father.

182
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Your Majesty, calm down.

183
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Zhao Yun!

184
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm here, Zhao Yun!

185
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,760
Come out now!
I'm here for you now!

186
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,960
Zhao Yun!

187
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
-Who are you?
-I'm here for Zhao Yun.

188
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,160
Who are you to knock on
the door so late at night?

189
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
Who are you?

190
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,360
You are looking for Zhao Yun?
I'm her step-aunt.

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,080
Her servant before this
has gone paralysed.

192
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,280
Useless wench.

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
-She's always with shady people.
-Who are you calling wench?

194
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,240
Say it again if you dare!

195
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,800
Let go of him.

196
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,040
Why wouldn't I dare to say it?

197
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,880
Since young, that wench has
stayed for free in our manor.

198
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Others will think that
how glorious it is...

199
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,720
to have a princess in our manor.

200
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
But she's just a person
who lives off others.

201
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
She doesn't even know
how to serve tea.

202
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
She's worse than a servant.

203
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,160
I've asked her to
learn up something...

204
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,680
so that she can marry well one day.

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,520
But she always went out to play.

206
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,240
I'm just hoping to marry her off
as soon as possible.

207
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,280
I want her gone as far as possible.

208
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,000
If you dare make her leave,
I'll make you leave first!

209
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,920
Let go of me!

210
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,160
Stop!

211
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,080
Let go of me!

212
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,440
-Release me!
-Let go of him!

213
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
Where is Zhao Yun?

214
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,800
I heard that Prince Zhen Bei from Chen
has chosen her as his bride.

215
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe she has already eloped
with that prince.

216
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,040
Is it Zhao Yun?

217
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
Just some uncultured men
that Zhao Yun knows.

218
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
Do they think they are
some kind of royalty?

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
Greetings, Prince Li.
Greetings, Prince Chen.

220
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,440
Prince Li.

221
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
So, this is how you treat
Zhao Yun usually.

222
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,200
I won't forgive you!

223
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,680
From now on, Princess Zhao Yun
will be my sister.

224
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,680
She has nothing to do
with you anymore.

225
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,840
If you dare pester her again,

226
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,480
I will punish you severely.

227
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,040
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Highness.

228
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
-Go back.
-Yes, Your Highness.

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,600
-Quick, let's go.
-Let's go.

230
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,720
Go and find Zhao Yun.

231
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll meet Ning Qian Yi
in the inn tomorrow morning.

232
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
Wu You,

233
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,560
when we were at the royal study
just now, I was in a fit of rage.

234
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
So, please don't take
my words seriously.

235
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,280
If I take all of your words seriously,

236
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,680
I would have had a heart seizure
since a long time ago.

237
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,240
You are the best, Wu You.

238
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,360
Don't worry.
We still have time to fix this.

239
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't be anxious.

240
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,920
Prince Zhen Bei has really
chosen Zhao Yun as his bride?

241
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,760
Yes, he has chosen Princess Zhao Yun.

242
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,560
I heard that Prince Zhen Bei
has brought along...

243
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,040
a very valuable treasure
from Chen with him.

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
And it's a priceless horsewhip.

245
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
And he had proposed to
Princess Zhao Yun in public.

246
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Her Majesty and other ladies
were present as well.

247
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,640
So were Prince Li and Prince Chen.

248
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,880
That horsewhip is really
a treasure of his.

249
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,760
Looks like Zhao Yun
has guessed correctly.

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
I never thought that
it'll turn out like this.

251
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,040
No. I can't let Zhao Yun
be married off to Chen.

252
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,320
Greetings, General Fu.

253
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,400
Get her another bowl of medicine.

254
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,760
Roger that.

255
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,000
You've decided to go
and meet Prince Zhen Bei?

256
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
Prince Zhen Bei...

257
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,520
has sent his envoy to formally
announce it in the court today.

258
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,040
After two days,

259
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,440
he'll leave together with
Princess Zhao Yun.

260
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,960
Prince Zhen Bei is the one
who holds the true power in Chen.

261
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,680
He won't easily change his mind
for the decision that he had made.

262
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,960
Do you think there's still....

263
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,880
a chance to fix this?

264
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,880
But the one going to Chen
is Princess Zhao Yun.

265
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,880
-I can't just look on unconcerned.
-How are you going to stop him?

266
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,400
Don't forget. You are
the princess of Western Qi.

267
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,440
If you want to meddle in this and
stand against this marriage alliance,

268
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,400
you'll be representing Western Qi...

269
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,360
to put a spoke in their wheels.

270
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,440
Not only you can't save
Princess Zhao Yun,

271
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,800
you'll make this problem even muddier.

272
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,400
Moreover,

273
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,280
if Princess Zhao Yun is not
willing to be married to Chen,

274
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm sure that Prince Li will do
his best to help her.

275
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,080
Don't tell me that...

276
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,480
you don't trust Zongzheng Wu You?

277
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
What happened today
is not what you think it is.

278
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
-We...
-The truth is not important.

279
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,960
If you still treat me as your husband
and have some feelings towards me,

280
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,200
listen to my advice.

281
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,120
Don't meddle with Prince Zhen Bei...

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,400
marriage alliance.

283
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Princess.

284
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,640
Don't you think that the general
is a bit strange lately?

285
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,720
His personal bodyguard,
Xiang Ying, is gone.

286
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Now, his personal bodyguard
is a man named Chang Jian.

287
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,240
-Princess Zhao Yun.
-Princess Rong Le.

288
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,440
Sister Chen Yu.

289
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,600
Princess Rong Le is not coming today?

290
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,920
Princess Zhao Yun, it's late already.

291
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,960
I think she will not come today.

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
-You can find her in General's Manor.
-I don't want to go there.

293
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,160
Although General Fu looks like
a caring and tender person...

294
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
and I don't know why,

295
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,320
I always feel that he'll lose
his temper suddenly.

296
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,160
The way he holds himself
in check is so scary.

297
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
If you have anything urgent,
I can go there to help you convey it.

298
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,600
I don't think Princess Rong Le
can help me with it.

299
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,920
Even Brother Wu You
can't help me with it.

300
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,680
I just want to have a talk
with Princess Rong Le.

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
In my heart,

302
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,120
Princess Rong Le is the only one
I can share my thought with.

303
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,560
If you don't mind,

304
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
you can pour out
your heart's content to me.

305
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,520
I promise that I won't
tell it to anybody else.

306
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,880
Are you troubled by the marriage
alliance with Prince Zhen Bei?

307
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,360
I only realised that I have
no one to turn to.

308
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,600
I really hope that I have
my parents by my side.

309
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm sure that they'll do
their best to fight for me.

310
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,640
But I'm glad that they are gone now.

311
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,640
Or else, they'll have to send me away
and not being able to do anything.

312
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
So, you are just like me.

313
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
I've lost my parents since young too.

314
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Actually, I'm forced to be in a public
house because I have no other choice.

315
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,720
I have no choice but to mingle
with all sorts of people.

316
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Many times, I've dreamt that
my parents are still alive.

317
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,880
But if they see me like this now,

318
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,520
they'll be very disappointed in me.

319
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,800
Do you have a person that you like?

320
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
I do have someone.

321
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,080
And it's beyond just liking him.

322
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,040
Then you can understand
my feelings now.

323
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,320
I really want to go and meet
the person that I like.

324
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,600
But when I was already at
the door of his manor just now,

325
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,720
I don't dare to go in to meet him.

326
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,840
I understand what you are
feeling now, Princess Zhao Yun.

327
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,080
It has been so long since I last
see the person that I like.

328
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,720
I heard that he has came
back to Zhongshan recently.

329
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,680
I really want to meet him,
but I'm afraid to.

330
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,040
Because...

331
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,280
Because I...

332
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,680
Is something troubling you?

333
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,360
Princess Zhao Yun.

334
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,360
Whenever I'm suffering beyond reason,

335
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,920
I'll play my zither.

336
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,320
How about I play a song for you?

337
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
<i>Wu Yu.</i>

338
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,320
<i>Are you looking for me?</i>

339
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
" Southern City Inn "

340
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,520
-Stop.
-Fool.

341
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
How dare you block Prince Li's way.

342
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,800
Please notify Prince Zhen Bei
that I would like to meet him.

343
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
Greetings, Prince Li.

344
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,120
Prince Zhen Bei is
not in the inn today.

345
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,280
But he has instructed me that
if you come, I am to tell you that...

346
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,840
he has gone to pay his respect
to a late friend in Northern Realm.

347
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>Pay his respect to a late friend?</i>

348
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,440
<i>And he purposely let me know about it?</i>

349
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,840
<i>Could it be that...</i>

350
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,480
I heard that before this,
Lady Yun and Sir Qin Yong...

351
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,160
had carried out a
People-Based Transformation.

352
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,080
Leng Yan, tell Wu Yu that...

353
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,320
we'll devise a plan
after I meet Prince Zhen Bei.

354
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,000
" Yun's Tomb "

356
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,600
I've waited you for quite some time.

357
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,280
Would you give me to honour...

358
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,000
to drink this jar of wine with me...

359
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,360
while we pay our respect and
pour out our hearts to each other?

360
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,920
I've made a swear...

361
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,640
not to drink wine ever again
in this lifetime.

362
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,400
Are you here today...

363
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,800
to persuade me to give up on Zhao Yun?

364
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,480
Yes.

365
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,440
I've also sworn to myself that...

366
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,040
if I ever get to meet
a lady that I love,

367
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,160
I'll give her a life of happiness.

368
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,240
Since I've already met her,

369
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,480
there's no reason for me to give up.

370
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,720
But,

371
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,800
if both of us can drink to
our hearts' content together today,

372
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,320
I might be open to your suggestions.

373
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,560
If you are not willing to do that,

374
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,440
I'll have to take my leave then.

375
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,160
Drinking wine is too common.

376
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,080
I wonder if you are willing
to play something...

377
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,640
more exciting...

378
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,920
and different with me.

379
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,640
If the wine in my cup
falls to the ground first,

380
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I lose.

381
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
And I'll honour your choice.

382
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,640
But if the wine in your cup
falls to the ground first,

383
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,360
I won't force you to change your mind.

384
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,280
I just hope that you can
listen to my suggestions.

385
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
Interesting.

386
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,040
You are indeed an outstanding person.

387
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,680
I admit my defeat.

388
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,480
" Yun's Tomb "

389
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,200
How are you planning to persuade me?

390
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm all ears.

391
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,680
You said that you wanted to give
Zhao Yun a life of happiness.

392
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,800
But have you asked Zhao Yun...

393
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,360
whether or not she is willing
to hand herself to you?

394
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,280
Maybe Zhao Yun's heart belongs
to another right now,

395
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,920
but if I can't see for myself
that she is really happy,

396
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
I won't give up.

397
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,760
Because I don't want to be like you...

398
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,400
who sit back and do nothing...

399
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
while the one you love...

400
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,520
are deeply stuck in
an ominous marriage.

401
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,040
Do you think your
self-scarification...

402
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,520
can bring her happiness?

403
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,720
If I can bring her happiness by force,

404
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,520
do you really think that
I won't try it?

405
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,320
On her wedding day,

406
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,800
I had wreaked havoc in her wedding...

407
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
and brought her by force
to this Yun's Tomb.

408
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,680
I've kept her here for
three days and three nights.

409
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,400
At first, I thought that...

410
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,000
as long as we love each other,

411
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,680
nothing can draw us apart.

412
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,520
But after that, I realised that...

413
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,720
it's not others
who had drawn us apart.

414
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,360
We are the one who did that.

415
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,040
Both of you did that to yourselves?

416
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
What do you mean by that?

417
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,400
You asked me before
whether I regret it or not.

418
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,240
I can answer that right now.

419
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
I regret it.

420
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,480
But my regret is not about...

421
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,000
me not stopping her from getting
married to others back then.

422
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,560
My regret is that when
I met her back then,

423
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,720
I didn't treat her wholeheartedly.

424
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,360
I had lied to her...

425
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,040
and I had used her.

426
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,240
My actions will always be
a painful wound between us.

427
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,040
And even now,
that pain won't go away.

428
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,240
But I don't plan to
trick or use Zhao Yun.

429
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,440
My love for her is sincere.

430
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,200
Your Highness.

431
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,680
If you are sincere,

432
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,760
why don't you let her
make her own choice?

433
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,680
Let her make the decision herself.

434
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,200
Princess Zhao Yun, are you waiting
for the one in your heart?

435
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
When he arrives,

436
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,040
are you going to go with him?

437
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,440
Although I really want to meet him,

438
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't know how to choose.

439
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,040
Sister Chen Yu, what should I do?

440
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,480
Actually, it can be very simple.

441
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,000
You can choose to
marry Prince Zhen Bei.

442
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,440
I've been to Chen once.

443
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,960
And I've heard about
Prince Zhen Bei's character.

444
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,640
Not only he's an open
and aboveboard gentleman,

445
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,000
he's a very generous prince.

446
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,240
And he will be the emperor
of Chen one day.

447
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,960
And as his empress,

448
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,720
you'll hold ultimate power and status.

449
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,440
I don't care about all of those.

450
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,520
I've already gotten used
to being treated coldly.

451
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,480
Alright.

452
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,680
Then you can choose to be
with the person you like.

453
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,920
But you have to pay a price for that.

454
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
Not only you have to
sacrifice your power,

455
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,680
wealth and status,

456
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,440
you might even lose your life.

457
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,440
I want to be with him.

458
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,200
But I don't want him to
sacrifice himself for me.

459
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,080
Princess Zhao Yun.

460
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,800
Although you're from a noble family
and you're used to a comfortable life,

461
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
if you want to choose
your own happiness...

462
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,080
and get a grip on your own life,

463
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
sooner or later,

464
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,080
you have to learn how to deal with
the consequences of your choice.

465
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,840
Zhao Yun!

466
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,040
Brother Wu Yu!

467
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,120
Zhao Yun. Finally, I've found you.

468
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,000
What is it?
Where are Zhao Yun and Wu Yu?

469
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,280
I've failed my duty.

470
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
When I reach here,
they have already left.

471
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,160
I only thing I found is this letter...

472
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,880
from Princess Zhao Yun's room...

473
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,080
together with this wooden box.

474
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,440
<i>Brother Wu You.</i>

475
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,000
<i>I've already made up my mind.</i>

476
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,480
<i>Take care.
Don't miss me too much.</i>

477
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
<i>From Zhao Yun.</i>

478
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,800
<i>My heart is with another.
Please forgive me.</i>

479
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,840
Li Wu.

480
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Yes, Your Highness?
What do you need?

481
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,560
Inform the emperor
of Northern Realm...

482
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,640
that I wish to meet him.

483
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,880
Yes, Your Highness.

484
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,640
-Your Highness.
-Prince Li.

485
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,560
Just now, in Yun's Tomb,

486
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,120
you've put in so much effort
to persuade me...

487
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,120
to give Zhao Yun a chance to choose.

488
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,280
Now, looks like I've never had
any chance since the beginning.

489
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,320
The bride that I want
has eloped with another man.

490
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,520
Looks like I can only be...

491
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,920
a tyrant that forces
my will against a lady.

492
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,240
Your Highness.

493
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,960
Since Zhao Yun has already
eloped with another man,

494
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,240
it means that she has
already made her choice.

495
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,600
I hope that you can
give them your blessing.

496
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,040
Give them my blessing?

497
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,960
Do you think that a man
who is so sloppy...

498
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,800
and doesn't even care for
Zhao Yun's reputation...

499
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,720
can bring her any sort of happiness?

500
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,280
<i>As long as you are willing
to travel the world with me,</i>

501
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,360
<i>I'm willing to give up
everything for you.</i>

502
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,960
I'll leave it to you then, General Fu.

503
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,680
I'll try my best to bring them back.

504
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,960
Rest assured, Prince Zhen Bei.

505
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,800
You can stay if you want.

506
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,800
Farewell, Prince Zhen Bei.

507
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,600
Your Highness.

508
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,400
Prince Li, His Majesty
has asked for you.

509
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,120
Greetings, Prince Li.

510
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
I still have work to do. Farewell.

511
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,040
Your Highness.
His Majesty is waiting for you.

512
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,240
Your Majesty, Prince Li is here.

513
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,000
Greetings, father.

514
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,680
Wu Yu has eloped together
with Zhao Yun.

515
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,360
Have you already known about it...

516
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,160
or even a part of it?

517
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,200
Father, I don't know that
they'll do that.

518
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,560
But Wu Yu and Zhao Yun are
still young and hot-headed.

519
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,720
Their actions are pardonable.

520
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,520
Pardonable?

521
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,640
As my son, he has no regards
for the greater good of our nation.

522
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
He made off with the princess
meant for the alliance.

523
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,040
Do you think that Prince Zhen Bei...

524
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,720
can accept it just because
their action is pardonable?

525
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,640
Father.

526
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,640
Please allow me to chase after
Zhao Yun and Wu Yu.

527
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,880
No need.

528
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
I've already ordered General Fu
to bring them back.

529
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,720
And I've already promised
Prince Zhen Bei...

530
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,200
that the marriage alliance
will proceed as planned.

531
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,520
In two days' time,
Princess Zhao Yun...

532
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,440
will be married off to Chen.

533
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
But father,

534
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,120
it's already very clear that Fu Chou
has colluded with Western Qi.

535
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,640
Western Qi...

536
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,280
has every intention to prevent
our alliance with Chen.

537
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,960
I'm worried that if Fu Chou
is tasked with this,

538
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,960
their lives might be in risk.

539
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,720
I'm worried about that too.

540
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,920
But Prince Zhen Bei...

541
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,840
has specifically appointed General Fu
to bring them back to him.

542
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
He even threatens me that...

543
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,720
he'll cancel this alliance with us...

544
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,480
and form an alliance
with Western Qi instead.

545
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,720
Father.

546
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Chen knows that we are...

547
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,960
impatient to start the war
and we need immediate help.

548
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,520
That's why he is so arrogant.

549
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,840
If we are willing to change
our plan for the war against Wei...

550
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,160
or think of another alternative,

551
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,960
Chen wouldn't dare to
threaten Northern Realm.

552
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,960
You have a solution?

553
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,320
Do you have any solution
that doesn't need Chen's horses?

554
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,720
Father.

555
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,360
When I was in Qingzhou,

556
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,320
besides taking in refugees to reclaim
wasteland to support themselves,

557
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,360
I've asked them to train up
some soldiers and horses.

558
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,640
And it's quite a success.

559
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,000
As long as you are willing
to delay this war,

560
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,120
I'm sure that I can solve
this problem about horses.

561
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,800
We can't delay this war
against Wei anymore.

562
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,200
But we can let Prince Zhen Bei
know about this.

563
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,600
I want to let him know
that I'm not helpless.

564
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,200
I won't be threatened easily by him.

565
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,640
But I'll have to put Wu Yu
through this.

566
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,640
In this world,

567
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,600
are there any fathers...

568
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,960
who don't wish for
their sons' happiness?

569
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm the emperor of this country.

570
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,760
But I can do nothing when it comes
to my son's happiness.

571
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,400
Father.

572
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,840
Although Prince Zhen Bei
is a shrewd person,

573
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,960
he is not an unreasonable person.

574
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,520
I think there might still be room
to fix this marriage alliance.

575
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,480
Father, let me bring back
Wu Yu and Zhao Yun.

576
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,840
When the time comes, I'll deal
with Prince Zhen Bei directly.

577
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,400
Trust me.

578
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,800
I promise that I can
solve this issue perfectly.

579
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,400
If I had known, I would have brought
some food along from the manor.

580
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,320
Not only you didn't bring any food,

581
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,120
you didn't even bring any money.

582
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,360
Even if we are able to get away
from pursuing troops,

583
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,000
we'll be starved to death.

584
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,560
This is my first time eloping.

585
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,600
I don't have any experiences.

586
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
And I'm too excited.

587
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,680
But look,
I managed to catch a fish, right?

588
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,760
Did you really catch it?

589
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,720
The fish is dead because
it hits it's head.

590
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,840
Just be thankful to this blind fish.

591
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,680
Or else, we'll be
starving ourselves tonight.

592
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,720
Don't worry. I won't let
my wife starve to death.

593
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,240
Didn't I tell you that I'm your fish?

594
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,040
You can catch me anytime you want.

595
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,040
If you can't catch a fish,
you can catch me.

596
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,760
Who is your wife?

597
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,920
Who is your wife?

598
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,120
Who wants to catch a fish like you?

599
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,880
Be careful with this fish.

600
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,480
Wu Yu.

601
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,560
If we really managed to escape
from pursuing troops,

602
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,400
we won't be a prince and
princess anymore.

603
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,040
Are you going to regret it?

604
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Are you going to miss the wealthy life
in your prince manor?

605
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,960
From now on,

606
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,080
there will be....

607
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,920
no prince and princess,

608
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,120
no wealth and status...

609
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,240
and no duties for the country.

610
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,400
In our world,

611
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,560
there will be only me and you.

612
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,080
From now on, we'll be homeless.

613
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,000
The world will be our home.

614
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,000
-We have to drift from place to place.
-The world will be our friends then.

615
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,320
We have to sleep under the stars.

616
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,640
I've always loved a challenge.

617
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,840
Let's go.

618
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
Prince Chen.

619
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,880
His Majesty has ordered...

620
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,760
Princess Zhao Yun
to be married to Chen.

621
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,520
I'm here with an order
to bring her back.

622
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,680
Please don't make things
difficult for me.

623
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,120
Stop with the nonsense.

624
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,000
If you want to bring her back today,

625
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,160
you have to go through my dead body.

626
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,240
Please reconsider,
Prince Chen and Princess Zhao Yun.

627
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,720
This is not just a love story
between two love birds.

628
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
This will affect the safety of
the people in Northern Realm.

629
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
When Prince Zhen Bei heard that
Princess Zhao Yun has ran away,

630
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,600
he is already on the brink
to renounce the alliance.

631
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,640
Wu Yu.

632
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,760
This has become something so serious.
What should we do?

633
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,280
Zhao Yun,
don't listen to his nonsense.

634
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,760
I don't believe it.

635
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,080
Northern Realm is a big country.
Will all of them die just because...

636
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,760
me and you are not there?

637
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
I will bring Zhao Yun away
from here today.

638
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,520
I want to see...

639
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,840
what can Prince Zhen Bei do to me.

640
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,200
Since both of you are so stubborn,

641
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,440
please don't blame me for my actions.

642
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
Arrest them.

643
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,920
Let's go!

644
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,680
Wu You.

645
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,080
Are you here to help me...

646
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,040
bring them back to the palace?

647
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,640
Or are you going to defy
the emperor's order...

648
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,160
and let them leave?

649
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm here on the emperor's order...

650
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,320
to bring them back safely
to the palace.

651
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,080
Fu Chou. I believe that His Majesty
is just asking you to bring them back.

652
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,080
He didn't ask you to kill them.

653
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
Don't you know that...

654
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,760
a sword doesn't choose it's victim?

655
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,000
If they follow us back willingly,

656
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,280
I would never have to hurt them.

657
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,200
I hope that you can change
Prince Chen's mind.

658
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,880
Wu You, how could father
send him to bring us back?

659
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Does he really have the heart
to take us back?

660
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Brother Wu You,
is it really that serious?

661
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Wu Yu is hurt. What should we do?

662
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,320
Zhao Yun, Wu Yu, listen to me.

663
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,440
Go back to the palace first.
I'll deal with Prince Zhen Bei myself.

664
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm not going to go back!

665
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,200
Wu You, are you here
to help us or catch us?

666
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,600
-Wu Yu.
-Wu You.

667
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,720
Do you have the heart to let us
repeat after you and Man Yao?

668
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,720
Looks like you can't change
Prince Chen's mind.

669
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,960
Let's go!

670
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
Don't blame me for doing my job.

671
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,200
Wu Yu!

672
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,040
Wu Yu.

673
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Why are you so foolish?

674
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,560
Dummy, don't cry.

675
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,400
I said that I won't let you get hurt
even if my life is at stake.

676
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,560
I don't want you to die.

677
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,920
I want you to live well.

678
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,520
I'll go back with you.

679
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,560
No!

680
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,160
Zhao Yun!

681
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,520
Zhao Yun!

682
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,160
Zhao Yun!

683
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,200
Greetings, Father.

684
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,360
Be at ease.

685
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,960
Father.

686
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,760
I've brought Zhao Yun back
in one piece.

687
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,840
As for Wu Yu,
although he's seriously hurt,

688
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,880
he's still kneeling in front
of the Great Hall.

689
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,480
Please forgive him.

690
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,120
He's hurt?

691
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,920
General Fu.

692
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,600
Didn't I already remind you...

693
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,280
to bring them back in one piece?

694
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,160
It's my fault.

695
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,560
When I asked Prince Chen to come back,

696
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,480
he had opposed very strongly to it.

697
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,920
He even fought with my men.

698
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,160
I've already advised him kindly,
but he still got hurt in the end.

699
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,120
Wu You.

700
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,680
Now that you've brought them back,

701
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,080
how are you going to negotiate
with Prince Zhen Bei?

702
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,520
Your Majesty.

703
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,520
I'm willing to marry
Prince Zhen Bei of Chen.

704
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,800
Please allow me to do so.

705
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,120
Zhao Yun, we can still turn the table.

706
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,800
Don't act rashly.

707
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,080
Brother Wu You.

708
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,080
If my marriage can bring safety
to the people of Northern Realm,

709
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,560
if it can ensure the safety of you,

710
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,840
Wu Yu and Princess Rong Le,

711
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm willing to do it...

712
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,520
without any complaints.

713
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,880
Zhao Yun.

714
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,480
This is a serious matter regarding
the alliance of two countries.

715
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,760
Once you've agreed,
there'll be no turning back for you.

716
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,880
Your Majesty. I've already
made up my mind.

717
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,120
I won't go back on my words.

718
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,520
Alright.

719
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,920
I'll confer you the title as
Princess Zhao Yun immediately.

720
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,000
And you'll be married off
to Chen in two days' time.
