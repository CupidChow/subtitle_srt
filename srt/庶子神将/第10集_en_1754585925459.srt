1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
Living in the past can only degrade the past

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,060
Being swindled for a lifetime

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,720
That's true that I was always brave

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:48,900
Listen to the

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Episode 14

6
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Please bless me, Buddha.

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,900
I'll come back safely from the dead.

8
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,900
Please bless me, Buddha.

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Please bless me, Buddha.

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
I'll come back safely from the dead.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,900
Please bless me, Buddha.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Episode 14

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,900
General, there's no one in the house.

14
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,900
But there's a temperature difference in the fire.

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,900
He should have left soon.

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Could someone have done something to him?

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Master, we've saved him.

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
But the princess went to jail alone.

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Oh, no.

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
Be good.

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
It's okay.

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
Your Highness.

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
The Princess is here.

24
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Let her go.

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Your Highness.

26
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
I...

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
I dare not disobey the order of the little prince.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
If you don't let her go,

29
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
I'll punish you right now.

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Well...

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
Huang Qian,

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
you're so strong.

33
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
Move.

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
You're making a crime

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
and framing innocent people into jail.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
Aren't you afraid of the punishment?

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
Isn't the prison

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
set up for the guilty?

39
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
Since they're not locked here,

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
they must be guilty.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Oh, right.

42
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,900
There are many dead prisoners in here.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
If anything happens to the imperial family,

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,900
don't blame the emperor for being unprotected.

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Your Highness.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
The imperial family is in danger.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Wait for me.

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Your Highness.

49
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
Leave here.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Jiang Wu You.

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
How dare you threaten me?

52
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,900
Why not?

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
My sister was born

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,900
under the threat and oppression.

55
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
When she was pregnant with the imperial concubine,

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
everyone in the palace thought she was a prince.

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
She was born to be the crown prince.

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,900
Unfortunately...

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Come here.

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Your Majesty.

61
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,900
The imperial concubine holds the power.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
If she gives birth to a prince,

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
she might be in danger.

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,900
I suggest

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
you should be

66
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
as bold as your mother.

67
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
She'll be out soon.

68
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,900
I'm going to help her.

69
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,900
I have orders.

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
I have orders.

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Your Majesty, please

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,900
punish Prince Qi for the world.

73
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
The outside world can't be disturbed.

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Your Majesty.

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
I'm the princess.

78
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,900
The imperial concubine...

79
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
The imperial concubine died.

80
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,900
She passed away.

81
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Instead of ruining my plan,

82
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
why don't I

83
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
give you a lesson?

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Wei Zhi.

85
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Your Majesty, save her.

86
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
I'll teach her a lesson.

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
Okay.

88
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Let's go.

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Hurry up.

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Hurry up.

91
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Your Majesty.

92
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,900
Chu Weichen.

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
You're useless.

94
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Do you know

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
robbing the court

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,900
is a crime against the nine tribes?

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Do you believe

98
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I'll punish all the Chu family?

99
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,900
After killing the loyal and good people,

100
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
you should be the one who's the most guilty.

101
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh, right.

102
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
I almost forgot

103
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
you're also a member of the Xuanjia Army.

104
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Youzhuang, kill me.

105
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I'll keep your life.

106
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
I'll let you

107
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
confess your crime

108
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
in front of the people.

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
I'll kowtow

110
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
and confess my crime

111
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
in front of the soldiers.

112
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
As for your death,

113
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
I'll leave it to the people.

114
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
No.

115
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Chu Weichen.

116
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
I'll kill you.

117
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Young Master.

118
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
The nine women of the family has gone to the palace.

119
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
But my son

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
was taken away by the female emperor.

121
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
What?

122
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
The emperor is dead.

123
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
The emperor is dead.

124
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
The emperor is dead.

125
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
The emperor is dead.

126
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
The emperor is dead.

127
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
The emperor is dead.

128
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
The emperor is dead.

129
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
The emperor is dead.

130
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
The emperor is dead.

131
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
The emperor is dead.

132
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
The emperor is dead.

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
The emperor is dead.

134
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
The emperor is dead.

135
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
The emperor is dead.

136
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
You don't know

137
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:59,940
how much you paid for my

138
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm not that important to you.

139
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
She's just

140
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,500
that important to you.

141
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,300
Nonsense!

142
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,500
I still remember nine years ago,

143
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,700
I was just a little girl.

144
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
I could only look at your back.

145
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,100
Mother was killed by my brother.

146
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,300
I have no way to go.

147
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Please,

148
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
help me take revenge.

149
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Revenge can't solve any problem.

150
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,300
Your mother entrusted you to me

151
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,900
because she wanted me to teach you

152
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
the way of the Ming army

153
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,900
so that you can protect the people in the future.

154
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,100
After you figure it out,

155
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
I'll teach you how to take back this country

156
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,300
and become the Queen of Northern Lian.

157
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,500
The ice is not as usual, the water is not as usual.

158
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,300
The ice is not as usual, the water is not as usual.

159
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
It's not easy to win

160
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,100
when you're not good at it.

161
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,700
It's not easy to win when you're not good at it.

162
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,300
The long and long road is full of wildness

163
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
The rainbow is in the middle of the world

164
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
The blue is not bloody

165
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:51,060
Naked magical mountains and trees

166
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,260
Blessed perp,

167
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,760
beg you give me

168
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,420
a good세요 for this battle.

169
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,060
Песо.

170
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,260
Have a good конце.

171
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,280
Please grant me

172
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,540
theighs once again.

173
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,520
Your Majesty,

174
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,220
I swear

175
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,680
I won't fuck again.

176
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,900
I will play initiates.

177
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,420
Do not get me wrong.

178
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,060
You women

179
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,580
can't play a girl!

180
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,440
I will bring Jimmy Liao

181
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
and our company

182
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,940
toline the war for me.

183
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,860
Why did you go back to Qingzhou.

184
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
No need to see me again.

185
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
I thought

186
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
I could build a palace

187
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,060
in the palace

188
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
for thousands of people.

189
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,060
But when I saw your back then,

190
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
I thought

191
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,060
you were a woman.

192
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
You were a woman.

193
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
You were a woman.

194
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
I was a woman.

195
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
I was a woman.

196
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
I was a woman.

197
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,060
When I saw your back,

198
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
I realized

199
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
I only wanted you.

200
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Enough!

201
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
Qionghua,

202
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,060
your brothers were bloody cruel.

203
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
I helped you

204
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,060
to make a good emperor

205
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
in Beilei

206
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
and to save the world.

207
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
I've never forgotten

208
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
these things.

209
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,060
But now I'm in charge of Beilei's 13 states.

210
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
I've taken care of the people and have no worries.

211
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
There are no military bases in the four realms.

212
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
But I still miss you

213
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,060
and can't forget you.

214
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,060
I've got everything I want.

215
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,060
I want you, too.

216
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Otherwise,

217
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
I'll throw the Princess of Datian

218
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
into the mess

219
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
and make her starve to death.

220
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
Even if she's alive,

221
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I'll make her lose her head.

222
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
How dare you!

223
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Why wouldn't I dare?

224
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
You've been in a coma for three years.

225
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
You thought the Black Armor Army

226
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,060
was still the same?

227
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
I've been out of the border for so many years.

228
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
It's all for you.

229
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
If you don't obey,

230
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
I'll destroy the world.

231
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
If you want me to do it,

232
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
I'll do it.

233
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,060
See if your 13 states

234
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
will listen to you tomorrow.

235
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
I'll do it.

236
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
You knew you wouldn't do that.

237
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,060
But you still won't let go of the soft words.

238
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
You married the Princess of Datian.

239
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Do you really think

240
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
she was there for you

241
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
for three years?

242
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
Do you know that after the missing of the General of Kunlun,

243
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
it was Shen Feixue who took over?

244
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
All the states were in chaos.

245
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
If it wasn't for my help,

246
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,060
how could we be so safe now?

247
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,060
How could the Black Armor Army survive?

248
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Siyan has been in the dark for many years.

249
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
We're on the same page.

250
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
And you

251
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
are the one who gave me power.

252
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
But no matter how much power you have,

253
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
it can't control people's heart.

254
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
Let's go.

255
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
Chu Beizhi.

256
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,060
I'll make you change your mind.

257
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Change your mind.

258
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Princess.

259
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
Mr. Chu, something bad happened.

260
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
The Crown Prince took the family of the Black Armor Army

261
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
and the West Tree.

262
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,060

and the West Tree.

268
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
How could it be?

269
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Not only that,

270
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
he and the Northern Flamingo Army

271
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
set up a trap.

272
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
They took the lives of the people

273
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
and put them in danger.

274
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Please stop them.

275
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
The Black Armor Army is in danger.

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
