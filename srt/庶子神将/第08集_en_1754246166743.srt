1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Fight for what I want

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,500
I couldn't keep on surviving

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,880
after playing for a long time

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,080
Alley morals

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,040
just installed

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,640
They take on me

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,280
The rise of Beforeear

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,320
The secret of Heartleben

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,240
Jianghu becomes my great hero

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,720
Highness in love

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,340
He subscribed to the scroung

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
Why are you so anxious?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,480
In case I have too many dreams at night,

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,800
I'll have to take the initiative.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,840
Your Highness.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,480
Bai Chi, you're finally back.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,640
I was blinded by a villain

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,080
and you suffered a lot.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,920
I'll take you to marry the princess and become the prince consort.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm sure I can lead the Chu family

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,520
to be in the limelight and be the most important person in the family.

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
Didn't you say

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,320
only a crazy person can be the most important person in the family?

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,040
Why did you change to me now?

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,080
I was confused before.

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,680
If you want,

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,840
the Chu family can entrust you with everything.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,640
The ancestors of the Chu family are blessed.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,520
They know that the Chu family

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,800
will be happy

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,640
to have a child like you.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,320
I heard from Lord Chu

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,680
that the fire in the ancestral hall in Beichi

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,400
was left out by Lord Chu.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,360
It's all a misunderstanding.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,600
Chu Bai Chi.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,200
You...

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,320
You let my son go.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,160
Lord.

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,400
You saw the wind and rain.

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Why are you so indifferent?

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
I wanted to save him.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
But it was the princess who gave the order.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,320
Who dares to disobey?

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,040
Besides,

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
the wind and rain are the descendants of the Kunlun God.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,320
He won't just sit around and do nothing.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,560
I just saw you.

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
I suddenly remembered something.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,600
The Chu family has received a lot of money

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,680
for the Beichi family.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,600
We are about to get married.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Just take out the money

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,840
and consider it as a wedding gift.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,640
When the wedding day comes,

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,120
I will spread the whole city

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,000
and enjoy it with you.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,720
No.

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,400
This is all the money of the Chu family.

60
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
You can't spend it like this.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
Lord.

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,280
You must help me.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,680
I will do it.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,440
Lord.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
If you really do it,

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,480
I will be hanged to death in this mansion today.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Okay.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
Since you like it,

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,440
I think the back yard of the Chu family is very well-maintained.

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,560
I will send someone to find you a class.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Father.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
It's my fault for making so many mistakes.

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
But Feng Yu is your biological brother.

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,160
Please think about it.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,040
Let the Princess Royal let him go.

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay?

77
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I didn't think about killing Feng Yu.

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,400
It's just that you are more concerned about him than the Heaven.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,400
It's just that you can use this opportunity

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
to touch his temper.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,680
I think it's good to lock him in the prison.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm tired.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
I want to go back to my room and rest.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Chu Bei Chi.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,200
You insist on marrying the Princess Royal.

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I won't agree.

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,400
You want to poison me?

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,240
You are the Princess Royal.

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,040
How dare you do such a thing?

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,960
It's okay if you want to kill the Princess Royal.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,440
But if you want to poison me,

92
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
you must stop her.

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,640
If she really does it,

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,120
I will kill her.

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
If she really does it,

96
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,240
I will let people know about it.

97
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's see what she has to do in the Northern Lies.

98
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,920
Let's go.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Master.

100
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,280
Master.

101
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,120
What should we do about Feng Yu?

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,920
The Princess Royal is here.

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,680
I didn't know Your Majesty would come.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
Stop talking nonsense.

105
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Where is Chu Bei Chi?

106
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,160
She is resting in the villa.

107
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll let her come here.

108
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,440
No need.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
I want to go there myself.

110
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Find someone to lead me.

111
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,920
Okay.

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,640
Master.

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Master.

114
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,840
Your Majesty.

115
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,120
Please follow me.

116
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,600
The Northern Lies' female emperor was in the villa.

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,080
She wanted to marry Bei Chi.

118
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
Now...

119
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,560
Is she trying to compete with the Princess Royal?

120
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm just a doctor.

121
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
But I have a good son.

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,480
He is really amazing.

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,640
Amazing.

124
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
Master.

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,680
What about Feng Yu?

126
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,720
The big picture is important.

127
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
We have to let her go first.

128
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,480
It's about the future of the Chu family.

129
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,400
If you make a mistake,

130
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
I will ask you.

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
The Ninth Mother, General Shen is here.

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,480
Why is there another person?

133
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Is Mr. Chu in the villa?

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,440
Yes.

135
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,360
No need.

136
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Follow me.

137
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,200
The Princess Royal,

138
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,240
the Northern Lies' female emperor,

139
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,200
the Ninth Mother,

140
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,840
and General Shen.

141
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,160
None of them are the top of the Chu family.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Why do they all like Bei Chi?

143
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Your Majesty, please.

144
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,520
The Ninth Mother, General Shen

145
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,120
Jiang Wu You is not a simple person.

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,280
He must have hidden something.

147
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,120
Your Highness, please be careful.

148
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,680
Yes.

149
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
General Shen, the Ninth Mother.

150
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Why are you here?

151
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
Bei Chi made it clear.

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,840
He and I...

153
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,400
No.

154
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm here for this.

155
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
I have to give the medicine to the Chu.

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
We have to stop him before he does it.

157
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,840
What are you doing?

158
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
As a woman chancellor,

159
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,840
why are you doing this?

160
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
The data on this cakes are hundred percent correct.

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,760
Chu Bei Chi is my robot.

162
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,640
You...

163
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
What's the smell?

164
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,800
Why does the air quality look too bad?

165
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
Why is it a gas tank?

166
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,160
You...

167
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,800
What is that thing

168
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,480
you put in that bottle?

169
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,320
This is a joke.

170
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
I thought it was in the tea.

171
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,920
Liuli.

172
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,240
Liuli.

173
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,560
Princess.

174
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I'll go find Master.

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,400
Master.

176
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Master, bad news.

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
The Highness...

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
The Highness is in trouble.

179
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,440
Chu Shun.

180
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,240
Are you okay?

181
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,400
Chu Shun.

182
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Are you okay?

183
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
I deserve to die.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
This is a love letter.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,560
I'll kill them all.

186
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,640
I'll also protect Chu Shun.

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,120
Come on, Prince.

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,520
Master.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,520
No!

190
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,200
The poison in your body...

191
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
I've used my inner power

192
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,600
to force you all out.

193
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,920
Are you okay?

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,400
Stop crying.

195
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,120
Hush.

196
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,560
What's wrong?

197
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Come on, be serious.

198
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,720
What's wrong?

199
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,680
You're buried with your 2020's name.

200
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,120
What is it?

201
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
I was justTerhapsick.

202
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,400
Tell me.

203
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
Tell me.

204
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,440
Are you fine?

205
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,920
If a manipulation like this gets exposed before time

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,120
I found one.
