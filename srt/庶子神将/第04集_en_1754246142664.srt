1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,300
I am locked up by the past

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:39,620
miracle and

3
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,120
Drinking, foil replay,

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,820
account becomes my big hero.

5
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,840
Deer Hunt

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,180
That...

7
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,680
That's...

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,560
The Blood Feathers' Moziity blow!

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,220
That blood inom citizen lot got into the martial art world over.

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,180
Blood Plaster is Bryony's boiled Balm.

11
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,220
We're going to invade the whole Binzhou City.

12
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,740
We can't escape.

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,020
What should we do?

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,140
General Chu,

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,380
please save Binzhou City.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,700
Save our lives.

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,860
We're willing to sacrifice our lives.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,980
It's just a blood?

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,060
Don't be so stingy.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,020
Let's see how I'll destroy it.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,340
General Chu,

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,180
you're so determined.

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,860
You're a great general.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,620
With you here,

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,140
we can fight with no worries.

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,100
If you leave now,

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,260
I can still think of the peace and harmony of the army.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,340
I'll let you go.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,780
Who are you?

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,260
How dare you try to threaten me?

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm afraid you haven't heard my name.

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,740
I'm the successor of Kunlun God.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm the Great General of Zhenyuan, Chu Feng Yu.

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,460
Kunlun God?

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,740
You're not worthy of that.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,620
General Chu,

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,900
don't bother him.

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,220
Let's fight him on the battlefield.

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,300
Hurry up.

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,980
Let's go.

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,060
Ready?

42
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,060
Go.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,580
Go.

44
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:24,580
Go

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,700
Hurry.

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,180
Edit, edit.

47
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Hurry up.

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,600
Yan Xiong,

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Yan Xiong.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
Mr. A isarÃ¡- pregunta Esmeralda.

51
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,020
If offenders take all today,

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,860
Kill them!

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,060
Who set the lantern?

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,260
It's like a blood feud!

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,060
Even General Chu is no match for him.

56
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,380
Who's so bold?

57
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,860
We...

58
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,580
We're all going to die in the blood feud!

59
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,420
It's me.

60
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,500
I...

61
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,620
You've caused a big trouble!

62
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,460
You'll be tortured to death

63
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,500
and you'll be involved with the whole Chu family.

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,940
Even the people will have to die with you.

65
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,220
You're so low-key.

66
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,820
Today, I'll show you

67
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,740
the real strength of Mr. Chu.

68
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,700
Chu Bei Chi,

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,740
go die for me.

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,260
Go.

71
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,860
I've wiped out all the bandits three years ago.

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,140
Who are you?

73
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,020
Go.

74
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,980
See?

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,300
Mr. Chu will kneel down

76
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
once he's here.

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,420
You little cat, run!

78
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,060
Get out of the way!

79
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,500
Get out of the way!

80
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,020
Get out of the way!

81
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,380
Deputy Chief, this...

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Let's go.

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,980
Idiot.

84
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,580
Why was she the one who scared the Consort?

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,460
How could she do that?

86
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,700
Why?

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,500
Why did she leave as soon as she saw him?

88
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,580
Chu Bei Chi is involved with Consort Xue!

89
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,220
He's a cripple.

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,020
How could he kill Consort Xue?

91
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,980
Did she collude with Consort Xue three years ago

92
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,620
and now she wants to do it again?

93
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,300
If that's the case,

94
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,380
I'll make her pay for it!

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,620
Let's get justice!

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,940
Let's get justice!

97
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,180
The female heroine of Beijing, Consort Xue, is here!

98
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,260
Sister Fei Xue.

99
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,780
What's going on?

100
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,380
It must be Sister Fei Xue.

101
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,060
That's why they were scared away.

102
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,380
It's true that Chu Bei Chi is involved.

103
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,980
General Shen must have come for my son, Feng Yu.

104
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,260
In that case,

105
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,460
it's as if my son saved the whole city.

106
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,500
General Chu,

107
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,460
you saved the city

108
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,860
because of the female heroine, Shen Fei Xue.

109
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,020
You saved us.

110
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,380
We'll never forget it.

111
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,460
Everyone,

112
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,500
tomorrow, we'll be robbed of our rites.

113
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,580
I'll ask General Shen Fei Xue

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,220
to personally judge her.

115
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,020
Great!

116
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,900
Good son!

117
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,500
I just wanted to teach Chu Feng Yu a lesson.

118
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
I didn't expect

119
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,820
he'd be a blood thief.

120
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,060
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,300
It's okay.

122
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,140
Young Master,

123
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
look at General Shen's grand show.

124
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
He emptied my Ruyi Pavilion.

125
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Greetings, General Chu.

126
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,860
You're finally awake.

127
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,980
Fei Xue,

128
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,100
the Black Armor Army has done well

129
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,700
thanks to you.

130
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,740
The Black Armor Army has done well.

131
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,820
The Black Armor Army has done well.

132
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,900
The Black Armor Army has done well.

133
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,940
The Black Armor Army has done well.

134
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,100
The Black Armor Army has done well.

135
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,740
Fei Xue,

136
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,020
from now on,

137
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,340
you'll be the first female heroine in the world.

138
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,180
From now on,

139
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,260
you must protect the country

140
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,100
and protect the country.

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
Thank you, General Chu.

142
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
This is the female heroine, Shen Fei Xue.

143
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,820
She's indeed a heroine of Jin.

144
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,460
Shen Fei Xue.

145
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,420
Three years ago,

146
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,220
you led the Iron Pillar of the Seas and the Jade Snow Fist

147
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,020
to go home to be an ordinary person.

148
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,100
But you saved the people of Binzhou

149
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,260
and got poisoned by the blood thief.

150
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,700
How could you be so heartless

151
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
and heartless?

152
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm showing them

153
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
my identity now.

154
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,700
I still have some things to do.

155
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,380
I can't reveal my identity for now.

156
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,780
Since General Shen is here,

157
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,260
then stay at my Ruyi Restaurant for dinner.

158
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,860
Everyone,

159
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,300
let's get started.

160
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,740
Chu Chuan, wait.

161
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,900
What do you mean?

162
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,700
Fei Xue,

163
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,980
sit down.

164
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,420
Let's eat.

165
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,460
Shen Yi,

166
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,420
you've served General Chu for three years.

167
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,380
Now, you should be able to make a comeback.

168
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,220
General Shen, you must be joking.

169
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,460
I've been staying with Mr. Chu

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,380
for the past three years.

171
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,740
We can't separate.

172
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,100
Let's eat.

173
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,100
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,740
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,340
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,900
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,700
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,300
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,260
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,060
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,980
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,220
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,260
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,580
You think you can control all the information

192
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,860
and you'll break the rule in front of General Chu?

193
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,260
General Shen is an expert in martial arts.

194
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,340
But you do have some little tricks in you.

195
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,620
You're childish.

196
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,180
Now the people in the city

197
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,780
say that you colluded with the bandits.

198
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,180
Chu Feng Yu said that

199
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,380
Shen Feixue

200
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,420
asked you to be the judge

201
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,300
of the birthday gift.

202
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,620
My lord,

203
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,700
three years ago,

204
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,900
you said you would hold a birthday gift for him.

205
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,660
In my opinion,

206
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
it's better to cancel it.

207
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,460
In a few days,

208
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,020
I'll make him bow to you.

209
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,060
No.

210
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,700
The birthday gift

211
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,020
can't be canceled.

212
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,020
It has to be sold.

213
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,860
My reputation is small.

214
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,420
But I represent

215
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,140
the whole Black Armor Army.

216
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,620
So

217
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,580
the birthday gift can't be canceled.

218
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,820
Yes.

219
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,940
We'll see.

220
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,340
But

221
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,340
why is there no one here?

222
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,620
Why?

223
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,740
loudly

224
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,740
Be quiet.

225
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,340
Colorado,

226
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,940
my favor fellow

227
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,780
can't be stopped by you.

228
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,100
How could he be stopped by the Peleres?

229
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,420
He said

230
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,500
he would make a birthday gift.

231
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,780
Huastan

232
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,180
Chu BEChi

233
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,980
13 North Lian

234
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,500
the convicted criminal

235
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,260
tomorrow

236
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,260
the punishment is ready
