Episode 1

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Chu Bei Chi, a young soldier,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
was at the border of the northern border,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
helping the female emperor to regain her position

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
after the internal chaos in the northern border of the Western Realm.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He helped the Northern Jin Army

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the Yishuang Jiu Niang

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to establish the first intelligence organization

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to help the female general

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shen Feixue,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to save the people of the Great Heaven

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and to gain the admiration of the Princess of the Heavenly Kingdom.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But when she was promoted

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
as the General of Kunlun,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
she suddenly returned to the camp

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and never heard from her again.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The mountain river is not stable.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't die yet.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't die yet.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
General of Kunlun, wake up.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Wake up.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's her.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mr. Chu,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it's been three years.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I still can't wake you up.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was born to be a medicine.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There is only one way to stop it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's to become a heavenly man.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,920
I will be a

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
pervert.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't make sacrifices for me.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You finally wake up.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will tell the world.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The teacher is awake.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Go to the ice state immediately.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your Majesty, think twice.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Majesty.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Chu Bei Chi is my teacher.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Without him,

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
how can I be the female emperor of Northern Lie?

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The master is awake.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Gather the two princes of the world

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and stop the master.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If the master is lost, I will be dead.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The master is finally awake.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Guards.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Take the black armor and the gold pendant.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come with me to the ice state

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to welcome the General of Kunlun.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
When the General of Kunlun wakes up,

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the world will be in peace.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All the countries will be at peace.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
all the people

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
will be in his eyes.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are now well-prepared.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You will wake up at any time.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When you wake up,

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Chu's Mansion will become the most powerful mansion in the world.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It will be worshiped by thousands of people.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In the past three years,

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
everyone has kept their promise.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No one has ever disturbed you in Jingyang.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The whole Chu's Mansion

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
has no one who knows your true identity.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's time to wake up.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I remember

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
everyone's kindness to me.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will also remember

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Jiang Shengyi's kindness to save lives

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and company.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Three years ago, the blood was spilled on the road.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It was said that the body was lost.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Chu Bei Chi had to fight against him.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He made the three families

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
free from the disaster of the destruction of the family.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They had to raise him.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
These years,

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the interest that I borrowed from the money

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
has already been made a lot.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now our Chu's Mansion

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is a rich and powerful mansion.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm afraid that my son will come back soon

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and help the family.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In the future,

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will inherit these family business sooner.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a little worried

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
about the useless person in the backyard.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The money

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
came back to the base because of him.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What if he wakes up?

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You mean

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
he will

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
compete with Feng Yu

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
for a big family business?

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Madam,

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
did something happen in the mansion?

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What happened?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This useless person has been in the Chu's Mansion for so long.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How much money did he waste on us?

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is their real mother.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You two

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
should die together.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The Chu's Mansion is in this state.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't blame me.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Something happened to the General.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have to hurry up.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hurry up.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who dares to hurt the master?

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll make him suffer.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'd rather die.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Greetings, Madam.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hurry to the Chu's Mansion.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If you are disrespectful to the young master,

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
kill him.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's already dawn.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What do you think you can expect?

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Kill them.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You insist on doing this.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You will regret it in the future.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'd like to see

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
if he still has the ability.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What I regret most now

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
is that I was not handsome enough

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to let this useless person live until today.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
A girl's family

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
has no fame and no respect.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You protect a man like this.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you ashamed?

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sister.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Why don't you

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
let me go?

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go away.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on, young lady.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't touch me.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll show you.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll let you go.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let me go.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't know what to do.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let me go.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can't hurt me.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me go.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You little beauty.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can't hurt me.

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll let you go.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hurry up.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go to the mountain.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Little beauty.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Go.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let her go.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hurry up.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Go.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
God Jiang.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You finally wake up.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
These three years,

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I've been trying my best to cure you.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I've never been easy on you.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I know.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Does it hurt?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Chu.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's all my fault.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I didn't know that

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
they've been hiding the bad news for the past three years.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
God Jiang has been working hard

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to take care of me for three years.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How dare you do this to her?

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You want to die?

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The ancestors of the Chu family,

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the children of the Chu family,

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
are all good and evil.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They use the sacrifice as a credit and the connection as a system.

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now you betray your family.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're a member of the Chu family.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're not.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What happened to Fuli?

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
God Jiang.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The ancestors of the Chu family, the children of the Chu family.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
God Jiang.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We've been working hard

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to take care of this evil child for three years.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now he's awake.

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He's reporting to us like this.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He beat me.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He even pretended to be an old man.

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He ruined the ancestral hall.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He's really heartless.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother-in-law.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is your father.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Father.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Baishi.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What the hell are you doing?

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You've been in a coma for three years.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're crazy again when you just woke up.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
These years,

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I thought you were really good to me.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But now it seems that

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you're just acting.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now, for just a few parents,

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you're in a coma.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't forget.

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The Chu family can have today's glory.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's all thanks to whom?

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're talking nonsense.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The Chu family can have today's glory.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's all thanks to you.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You've been working hard.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're blessed with the title of the best archer.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you?

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I chose to stay in the Chu family

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
because I didn't want others to take the Chu family's initiative.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But now,

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I shouldn't be guarding outsiders.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I should be guarding the Qing family.

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The Chu family.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The Chu family.

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Father.

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Somebody, save me!

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Father.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Somebody, save me!

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Father.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Save me!

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Save me!

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Save me!

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Save me!

234
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Jiang Cheng, it's time to leave.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hurry up.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Save me.

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Even if I die,

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
my family will be sealed.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If the ancestors have the power,

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I won't be here.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Rather than being humiliated,

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'd rather die.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'd rather die.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
General Zhen Yuan is here.

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The world is settled.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If I still stay in the North,

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Fei Xuan,

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
my brother, Chu Feng Yu, will come to Beijing today.

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll entrust him to you.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Once he establishes the military,

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and accomplishes a great feat,

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll naturally pass the Kunlun God Gun to him.

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And he

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is the next Kunlun God Gun.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Fei Xuan, I'll obey.

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He's awake.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Feng Yu.

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You haven't died for three years.

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're useless.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Even though you're useless,

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
you're still alive.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The red shoes are still floating in the sea of stars.

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The clouds are falling on the mountain.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The cold face is floating in the mountains.

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The white moon is looking for the old man.

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The wind is blowing to the top of the mountain.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The old man is holding the sword.

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The moon is bright and the white horse is like a flower.

269
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The white horse is holding the sword.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The old man is waiting for the light to go out.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The white horse is waiting for the light to go out.

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Miss Van없's sudden match with a companion.
