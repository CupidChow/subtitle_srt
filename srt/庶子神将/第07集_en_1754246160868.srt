1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,180
I've been through habeas.

2
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,500
Being so difficult is as old as a righteous woman.

3
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,820
Listen to local rites.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,840
Who is the younger brother?

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
Give me a high five.

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,300
Ray-blastllinquan element of the hero!

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,120
See how outlook is changing.

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,700
Apprentice travels the energy!

Episode 18

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Since the scene is so lively,

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,700
my Princess Royal also wants to give a gift,

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,700
to show her respect.

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Isn't this the Royal Doctor by Chu Bei Shi's side?

16
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,700
How dare he wear a wedding dress

17
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
to block the Princess's way?

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
The Royal Doctor dares to offend the Princess?

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Let's see how Chu Bei Shi ends up.

20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
How dare you!

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
You're using Chu Bei Shi's useless protection

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
to block in front of the Princess.

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,700
My Lord, please punish him and Chu Bei Shi.

24
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,700
My Lord, we're both officials.

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Why are you insulting my mother?

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,700
This person blocked in front of the Princess's way.

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
The Princess hasn't appeared for a long time.

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
Could it be that she's the one who caused the trouble?

29
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Stop your nonsense.

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
This is the Princess,

31
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
the most beautiful and noble of our country.

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Long live the Princess.

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Long live the Princess.

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
You have three crimes.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
First, you shouldn't bully the Prince of Chu.

36
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Second, you shouldn't frame the Lady.

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Third, you don't see the royal family and don't kneel to me.

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Forgive me, Princess.

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Siye.

40
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
It's really wonderful.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,700
The Princess is good at planning.

42
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,700
She doesn't hesitate to hide her identity

43
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
and take care of her for three years.

44
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
My information is not wrong.

45
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
What's going on?

46
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
You're playing tricks on me.

47
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Your information is not wrong.

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
I didn't mean to hide it.

49
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
It's just that I've been studying medicine outside the palace since I was young.

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Three years ago,

51
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
I learned that the Prince of Chu was seriously ill.

52
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
So I'm willing to stay in the Chu's Mansion for three years.

53
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Prince of Chu,

54
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
you just said you were going to marry me.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Is it true?

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
The flower blooms in the garden.

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,700
The snow falls and the fire is long.

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
For the past three years,

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
I've been seriously injured and can't get out of bed.

60
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
You took care of me without leaving me.

61
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
If you hadn't taken care of me,

62
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
I would have been dead by now.

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
If you're willing,

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
I'm willing to work with you for the rest of my life.

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,700
I'm willing.

66
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I'm naturally willing.

67
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,700
I've been alone since I was young.

68
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
It's because of you.

69
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
I've been hoping that you would wake up every day in these three years.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
You are my hope.

71
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,700
I've been alone since I was young.

72
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I've been alone since I was young.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
I've been alone since I was young.

74
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
I've been alone since I was young.

75
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I've been alone since I was young.

76
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
I've been alone since I was young.

77
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
I've been alone since I was young.

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
I've been alone since I was young.

79
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
I've been alone since I was young.

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,700
I've been alone since I was young.

81
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
I've been alone since I was young.

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
I've been alone since I was young.

83
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
I've been alone since I was young.

84
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
I've been alone since I was young.

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
I've been alone since I was young.

86
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
I see you as family.

87
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Fei Xue knows.

88
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
I've done wrong today.

89
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
In my dreams.

90
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Master.

91
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
I'm happy

92
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
that you can find your own happiness.

93
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,980
I'm a man of my word.

94
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,300
I'm a man of my word.

95
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm a man of my word.

96
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,460
Chu Bei Chi,

97
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,340
I'll get you eventually.

98
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,180
I won't let you go.

99
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,940
I never thought

100
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,540
my son Bei Chi

101
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,340
is not only a black-clad emperor,

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,860
but also a princess.

103
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,740
He refused to marry a female emperor.

104
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,180
This is the hope of my Chu family.

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,780
Bei Chi.

106
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,340
The little prince is here.

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,180
The little prince?

108
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,260
The little prince?

109
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,500
What a wonderful show!

110
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,300
I didn't expect that

111
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,820
the eldest princess of my country

112
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,140
has been a minister for many years.

113
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,540
She's asking for a concubine.

114
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,020
She even abandoned

115
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,340
my family's honor.

116
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,020
This marriage

117
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,300
was arranged by my father.

118
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,780
Are you saying

119
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,540
you're questioning my father?

120
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,980
Liuli.

121
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:48,220
Crown Princess

122
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,860
Your Grace.

123
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,700
It's only a small!?

124
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,300
What disappeared?

125
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,500
Why......

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm not a poor girl.

127
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,540
But the hardships in the world

128
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,500
will not be eliminated.

129
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,620
I'm a woman.

130
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,500
I can't share your burden.

131
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,980
But the Kunlun God

132
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,540
has protected the country for many years

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,460
and was injured for the people.

134
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,900
He...

135
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,660
He deserves my help.

136
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,460
In that case,

137
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,980
I won't stop you.

138
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,020
But when he wakes up,

139
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,540
you must announce to him

140
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,340
my marriage decree.

141
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Thank you, father.

142
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,980
Chu Beichi?

143
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,100
Why?

144
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
His Qi has been used!

145
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,700
Speaking of which,

146
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,060
we have a grand presentation today.

147
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Furthermore, the grass god of Kunlun

148
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,140
is absent for a long time.

149
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,380
Can I

150
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,580
do all these for nothing?

151
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,860
Yes!

152
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:40,820
In other words,

153
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,460
Yes.

154
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,820
The victim's gift has been removed.

155
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,540
But there's another thing

156
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
that can't be removed.

157
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,700
Chu Feng Yu has been disrespectful to me many times.

158
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,780
Today, in front of everyone,

159
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,340
I'll give him a punishment.

160
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,260
And these two officials

161
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,660
will be punished together.

162
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,100
Princess, please forgive us.

163
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,220
Chief, please forgive us.

164
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,860
I won't let you die.

165
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,900
This is my fault.

166
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,300
Don't hurt my mother.

167
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,500
Mother.

168
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,380
Baishi.

169
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,940
Mother.

170
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,700
Feng Yu is your brother.

171
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,660
Please.

172
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,820
Let the Chief let him go.

173
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,780
As for this Mrs. Chu...

174
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,180
Forget it.

175
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,260
For the sake of Mr. Chu,

176
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
let her go for now.

177
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Thank you, Princess.

178
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,580
Since it's settled,

179
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,660
why don't we

180
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,420
get married tomorrow?

181
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,020
Americans love being University arranged this.

182
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,220
Tomorrow?

183
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,820
Yes.

184
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Ah
