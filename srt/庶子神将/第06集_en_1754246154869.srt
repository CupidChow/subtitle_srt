1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm a man of my word.

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,840
I dare not to be a coward.

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,960
The world is shaking.

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,920
Who is the mastermind?

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,480
I'll hold it in my hand.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,320
I'm a man of my word.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,200
I'm a man of my word.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm a man of my word.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,640
Why don't you

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,160
try it?

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,560
Master Chu, try it!

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,160
Try the speech.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,640
Master Chu, give it a try.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,960
Is that is!

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,920
Is that said!

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,080
Exactly!

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,680
How can it

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,300
be McCondict and Dry-Dry

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,000
to think so highly of him?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,560
I agree.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,880
How could he agree to it?

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,840
Look at how he offered it.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,620
Master Chu!

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,200
Tried it.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,900
Master Chu, try that!

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,600
Master Chu, try that!

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,840
Master Chu, try that!

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,560
Similarly!

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,360
Tried that!

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,920
Tried that!

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,640
Those are the skills of the stepdad.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Hurry and try that!

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,600
Tried that!

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Master Chu, try that!

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,120
Try that!

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,840
That's right!

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Tried that!

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,960
Tried that!

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Kill him! Kill him!

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,560
Kill him! Kill him!

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Kill him! Kill him!

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Kill him! Kill him!

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Kill him! Kill him!

44
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
Kill him! Kill him!

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Master!

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,320
What's going on?

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Chief Chu, are you trying to kill me?

48
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
Yes.

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm dedicated to the country.

50
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,680
But you don't know me.

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I don't blame you.

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,960
My reputation is as good as a red hair.

53
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,200
But the reputation of the Black Armor Army is as high as Mount Tai.

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
Today,

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,280
I'll show you

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
what is called

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,320
the truth.

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,520
What's going on?

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,480
Chu Bai Chi,

60
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,080
what are you doing?

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,560
Master!

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,000
Come down!

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,040
Why wouldn't he?

64
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Why are you doing this?

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
No one in this world

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,520
is more qualified than him.

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,640
Because he is...

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,520
Shen Fei Xue, here comes the General!

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,840
Here comes the General!

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
Fei Xue!

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,560
This is the most famous

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
Beijing female general, Shen Fei Xue.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,240
It's rare to see her in such a tough condition.

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
Why isn't the General here?

75
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,720
He should kill this useless woman first

76
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,160
and clear up the misunderstanding.

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
Then he can welcome the General of Kunlun.

78
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,560
Fei Xue, it's been a long time.

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,160
Who is your sister?

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I don't know you.

81
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,200
Don't make fun of me.

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,920
Since I came to Beijing,

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,160
you've been taking care of me.

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
You taught me martial arts.

85
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
How could you not know me?

86
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Taking care of you?

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,000
I'd rather take care of a wolf in Beijing.

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
You're so ungrateful.

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
You're ridiculous.

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
What are you talking about?

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
What's the point of taking care of a wolf in Beijing?

92
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I can't tell you.

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I...

94
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Anyway,

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
the birthday gift was made for me.

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Shen Fei Xue,

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
don't think you're a female hero.

98
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,320
You can do whatever you want.

99
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
If the General knew

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,720
you treated me like this today,

101
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
he wouldn't have let you off easily.

102
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
The General of Kunlun

103
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,600
must have regretted it.

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
General Shen,

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,080
Chu Bei Chi, the son of the Chu family,

106
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,080
was not guilty at first.

107
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,480
He took the holy spear secretly.

108
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,680
Now he's going to be the throne.

109
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,760
He's belittling the Black Armor Army.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He's so scary.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,280
We have to get him down first.

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
Yeah, the Black Armor Army.

114
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,040
Why is he so high up?

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,680
Chu Bei Chi is the high-ranking general.

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,240
He's already committed a serious crime.

117
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
Fei Xue,

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,480
you must be punished severely.

119
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah.

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,520
He's disrespectful to the General of Kunlun.

121
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,120
He deserves to die.

122
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,320
He deserves to die.

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,280
So this is the person

124
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,160
you're talking about?

125
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Yes.

126
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Guards.

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes.

128
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,920
Get on the army.

129
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Yes.

130
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,920
Now it's up to you.

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
Think about it.

132
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,880
Because it's you,

133
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,680
the Cap wrong me.

134
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,180
Today,

135
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,640
I will punish you.

136
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
Will you forgive me?

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:49,380
So don't bl 만들 such aе

138
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
You will not feel guilty

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
because you're dead.

140
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,120
You just kneel here and wait for the punishment.

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,720
General Shen.

142
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,480
These people are saying

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
that Mr. Chu colluded with the bandits last night.

144
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,960
Unfortunately, I have a witness.

145
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Pass the witness.

146
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,400
Who is this?

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
The first time I saw a bandit.

148
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,920
General Shen, please help me.

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,600
I am a imperial envoy, Liu Li.

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,240
This...

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
This is really a imperial envoy.

152
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Last night, I pretended to be a military spy

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,080
to test if Chu Feng Yu was good at it.

154
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,480
But I didn't expect he was not loyal.

155
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,880
That's right.

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Not only the bandits you mentioned

157
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,480
are imperial envoys.

158
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,320
Chu Wei Chi is also a member of the Black Armor Army.

159
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,920
The reputation of the Black Armor Army is the best evidence.

160
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
It proves that he would never do such a sinister thing.

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
The bloodthirsty thing last night

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
was the imperial envoy's wild love.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
And he is the Black Armor Army?

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,760
No wonder General Chu...

165
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
That's right.

166
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,160
No wonder.

167
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
I didn't expect he was such a person.

168
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not true, General Chu.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,840
Indeed.

170
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
He's wronged.

171
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,360
That's right.

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,440
I didn't expect that.

173
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,600
Feng Yu.

174
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,960
Do you accept it or not?

175
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,320
Are you really the Black Armor Army?

176
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,840
Of course.

177
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,760
You will discuss with Mr. Chu later.

178
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,920
I have something more important to do.

179
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
What's going on?

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
What's going on?

181
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,520
This...

182
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,920
How can he kneel down?

183
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Kneel down for him?

184
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Mr. Chu.

185
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,040
Can you

186
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,560
do me a favor?

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,960
Fei Xu.

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Don't make a fuss.

189
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,440
Mr. Chu.

190
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,240
Let me do whatever I want.

191
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,760
The leader of the Black Armor Army, Jin Xian.

192
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,080
The leader of the East Lake State, Qi Ling.

193
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,240
The leader of the South Sea State, Bilo.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
The leader of the Golden Dragon and Xianglu.

195
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,080
Mr. Chu.

196
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm late.

197
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
I made you suffer.

198
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,560
To make up for you,

199
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,600
you didn't marry me.

200
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,760
I'm asking you.

201
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
Will you marry me?

202
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,840
The leader of the veggies market, Yan Fu.

203
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,880
Fei Xu,

204
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
don't do that.

205
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,400
Get married?

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,880
Here comes Lady Y glitter!

207
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,980
That man's form is surelyisine.

208
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,080
But when he took the form,

209
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,680
his power was very unstable.

210
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,780
Fine.

211
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:38,660
Consort Su rises first to judge

212
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,880
and then marries boutIC by the prey here.

213
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,980
That man will be living in his grave soon.

214
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,180
How is that possible?

215
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,260
How is that possible?

216
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,260
Besides,

217
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,020
you're the brother of Northern Lie,

218
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,220
so it's not proper for you to marry the emperor.

219
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,220
If you want to propose,

220
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,940
you have to do it without any effort.

221
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,460
It's too cold.

222
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,580
Cold?

223
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,740
Do you know what it is?

224
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,180
This...

225
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,020
This...

226
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,540
This is...

227
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,900
This is the imperial jade seal of Northern Lie!

228
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,340
The imperial jade seal.

229
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,660
The imperial jade seal is such a big sign.

230
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,340
It'sêmuch package,

231
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,900
indeed,

232
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,460
very strong.

233
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,300
I used my country

234
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,340
for just it

235
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
The imperial jade seal is a part of the N rubles.

236
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,060
How could you give it to someone else?

237
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,700
Love has one character.

238
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,540
Not yet over what you can afterwards.

239
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,460
Not yet over what you can do for your wife's safety.

240
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,140
Since I love it,

241
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,140
I will give her the most precious gift.

242
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,500
Besides,

243
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,500
I respect her style and talent.

244
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,020
I believe she can afford

245
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,340
and deserve

246
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,380
this thousand miles of land.

247
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,020
Land?

248
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,100
You are so considerate.

249
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,980
Who can get such a good marriage?

250
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,420
Are you going to have two weddings today?

251
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,660
Your Majesty, you are here.

252
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,780
I have something to tell you.

253
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,100
Why don't you tell me in advance?

254
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,380
I can prepare in advance.

255
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,940
I'm not here to see you.

256
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,580
May I ask who you want to marry?

257
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,380
I want to marry

258
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,620
the General of Kunlun.

259
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
The General of Kunlun is not here yet.

260
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,140
You...

261
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,660
The General of Kunlun is not here yet.

262
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,820
But the future General of Kunlun

263
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,380
is here.

264
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,100
Even the female emperor of Beilei is willing to marry.

265
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
General Chu has a bright future

266
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,660
and is a hero.

267
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,500
General Chu, wake up.

268
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,700
General Chu, you are so smart.

269
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,860
If you are willing to make mistakes

270
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,420
when I ascend to the position of Beilei State,

271
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,620
I can spare you

272
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,540
for the sake of the love of the first clan.

273
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
So smart.

274
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,300
You said he was the General of Kunlun?

275
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,500
The great love of the female emperor of Changbao

276
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,140
will be entrusted to me.

277
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,540
I will protect her with my life.

278
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,580
It will also make our country and Beilei

279
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,340
forever close to each other.

280
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,820
It's really rare.

281
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,260
Then who is he?

282
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,660
The female emperor knows nothing.

283
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,060
The criminal of Binzhou, Chu Beishi.

284
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,060
It's General Shen who protected him.

285
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,260
That's why he didn't save her.

286
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,500
As long as you nod,

287
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,100
I will kill these women for you.

288
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,660
You can go back to Beilei with me.

289
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,900
How about it?

290
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
Mr. Chu,

291
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,420
of course you will stay at my Ruyi Pavilion.

292
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,700
Mr. Chu is going back to Beijing with me.

293
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
Mr. Chu is going to stay at Ruyi Pavilion.

294
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,940
He is going to go back to Beilei with me.

295
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,620
You are not qualified to compete with me.

296
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,900
I will kill you.

297
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,300
This is not your place.

298
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,940
Enough.

299
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,260
I have my own place.

300
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,700
I have my own place.

301
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,740
I have my own place.

302
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,020
I have my own place.

303
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,260
You have your own place.

304
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,340
You have your own place.

305
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,420
You have your own place.

306
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,580
Lord Beast,

307
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,520
never

308
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,620
of my life

309
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,220
is that��을

310
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,840
Don't you dare

311
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,020
Are they not invited?

312
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,800
Since the venue is so lively,

313
00:13:45,820 --> 00:14:00,960
I spare the Princess

314
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

315
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

316
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

317
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

318
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

319
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

320
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,420
The moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

321
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Sharing story that belongs to the workouts

322
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,800
the moon shines on the mountain, the moon shines on the river

323
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,900
The white horses follow the Lu Hua
