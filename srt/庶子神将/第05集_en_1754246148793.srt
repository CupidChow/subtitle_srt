1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Unitedly meet

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A happy encounter

3
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,840
Sun is shining

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,720
It's a dream

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Right?

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,620
He wants to destroyensions

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
against me

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:26,220
to remain in the temple

9
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,780
General

10
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,900
I'm Chu Bei Chi.

11
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,620
Please forgive me.

12
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,940
Chu Bei Chi is a useless fool.

13
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,620
I'll see how I can kill him today.

14
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,420
I know that you're a gentleman.

15
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,540
I knew he wouldn't dare to come.

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm afraid he's already in a hurry.

17
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,460
It's so lively here today.

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,500
Chu Bei Chi.

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,500
You really dare to come?

20
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,380
It seems that I don't have to

21
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,540
kill him today.

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,780
What's that?

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,940
Right after...

24
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,900
The suffering meanest one

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,620
simply has audacity!

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,580
What crime would I commit

27
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,620
that everyone would forgive?

28
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,020
Chu Bei Chi.

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,180
to smear our name.

30
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,580
Therefore,

31
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,340
he even planned for the death.

32
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,980
Such a heartless man

33
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
is a fated enemy!

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,580
Exactly.

35
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,100
Expnce General Chu!

36
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:09,060
Extinguish the

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,020
I'm afraid the whole of Binzhou City

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,020
has been lost for a long time.

39
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Yeah.

40
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Your family

41
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,020
is trying to get revenge

42
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
by three families.

43
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
How dare you say no?

44
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,020
How dare you slander our family?

45
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
Slander?

46
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,020
I have a book and a playbook in my hand.

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,240
The

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
General Chu,

49
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
so many.

50
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Come on,

51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
take a good look.

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
You too.

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
You can take a look.

54
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Is this real?

55
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
It's not fake.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
There are so many real estate properties in the Chu family.

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,020
It's a little bit

58
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
useless for Mr. Chu.

59
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
It's really...

60
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,020
Mr. Chu didn't get much money.

61
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
How could this be?

62
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
Yeah.

63
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
I want to make money in the army

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,020
and give some money to my family.

65
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Plus, my mother is a businesswoman.

66
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,020
Money is not

67
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
that important.

68
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
Don't be fooled by him.

69
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Our purpose today

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
is to judge Chu Beichi

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
for colluding with the bandits.

72
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Say it.

73
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Are you on the same side?

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
Are you on the same side?

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Say it.

76
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Say it.

77
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Are you on the same side?

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
How could this be?

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
Are you on the same side?

80
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Are you on the same side?

81
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm so angry.

82
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
I saved your life.

83
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
I asked you for money.

84
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,020
I saved your life last night.

85
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
I did this.

86
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
I got a good result.

87
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Besides,

88
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
I'm rich.

89
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
You don't have to say that.

90
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Why don't you answer me?

91
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
Actually...

92
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Actually,

93
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,020
he's been pretending for three years.

94
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,020
I have to say it now.

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
Say it.

96
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
Say it.

97
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
Say it.

98
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
Yan

99
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,020
wants to keep Feng Yu as the key.

100
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
These three years,

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
he and this girl

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,020
are fighting every night.

103
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
We will protect the dignity of the Chu family.

104
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
We have to hide it from him.

105
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Nonsense.

106
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,020
And this Jiu Niang,

107
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,020
where did she get her money?

108
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
She came from a rich family.

109
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
She's a housekeeper.

110
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
What kind of good thing is that?

111
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Shut up.

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,020
You're all bankrupt.

113
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,020
You're hitting me.

114
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Come on.

115
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Mr. Chu,

116
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
this girl is so arrogant.

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
She's a member of the Kunlun god's family.

118
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
How dare she hit the god's family?

119
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,020
The god's family killed her like a grass.

120
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
The whole family

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,020
is suffering from the whole family of the Chu family.

122
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
So, as you said,

123
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,020
the god's general is a man without any rules.

124
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,020
He only knows how to kill people and demons.

125
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Nonsense.

126
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
You're a traitor.

127
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,020
Don't make trouble again.

128
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Today, you have to endure everything

129
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,020
to protect the dignity of the Chu family.

130
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Sometimes I wonder

131
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
if you're my father.

132
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
You

133
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Before sister Chen Feixue comes,

134
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
I advise you to confess your crime as soon as possible.

135
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,020
She is the most powerful general around the god.

136
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,020
When she comes,

137
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,020
you will only expect more.

138
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Shen Feixue?

139
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
She has to kowtow to me when she comes.

140
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
She's so stupid.

141
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,020
How can Shen Feixue in Beijing

142
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
listen to her orders?

143
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,020
Since we're brothers,

144
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,020
I can kill you with Kunlun God's spear.

145
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Old friend,

146
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
I almost entrusted you to such a despicable person.

147
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
I'm afraid.

148
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Since childhood,

149
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
you've been suppressing me.

150
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
But now,

151
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,020
you've been despicable.

152
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
And my future is good.

153
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Everyone's eyes are on me.

154
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
It's your honor

155
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
to die under the Kunlun God's spear today.

156
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
You had a bright future.

157
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,020
But you've ruined it.

158
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
You want to kill me today.

159
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Let's see

160
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
if you can get the God's spear.

161
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
What's going on?

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
General Chu,

163
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
why can't you get it?

164
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Can you do it?

165
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Can't you get it, General Chu?

166
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
Fang Yu,

167
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
take it down.

168
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
I can't.

169
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
I can't.

170
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
I can't.

171
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I can't.

172
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
I can't.

173
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
I can't.

174
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
I can't.

175
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
I can't.

176
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,020
I can't.

177
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,020
I can't.

178
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
Take it down.

179
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Fang Yu.

180
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
General Chu can't get it.

181
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
I just remembered

182
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
the God's spear

183
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
is used to protect the country.

184
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
How can you kill such a villain

185
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
with such a great skill?

186
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
It's true.

187
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
It's true.

188
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
General Chu is smart.

189
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,020
I believe you.

190
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
How about

191
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
I get it for you?

192
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,020
You

193
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
can also get the God's spear?

194
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Yes.

195
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
Yes.

196
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
Yes.

197
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
I forgot

198
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
you are a cripple.

199
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
A cripple can't even stand up.

200
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,020
How can you get it?

201
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
You're right.

202
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
I can't stand up

203
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
sitting on this chair.

204
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,020
If you can get the God's spear,

205
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I'll kowtow to you

206
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
in front of everyone.

207
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
I'll leave my words here.

208
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,020
As long as you can get the God's spear,

209
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
General Chu and I

210
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
will kowtow to you.

211
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
It's my share.

212
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
It's my share.

213
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
It's my share.

214
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
It's my share.

215
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
It's my share.

216
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
It's my share.

217
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Really?

218
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
What?

219
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
You dare not?

220
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
You can't

221
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
regret your words.

222
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I'll keep my word.

223
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
I'll keep my word.

224
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
I'll keep my word.

225
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
I'll keep my word.

226
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
Good.

227
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,020
What's going on?

228
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
What's going on?

229
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,020
He's lying to us.

230
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
What's going on?

231
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
What's going on?

232
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
What's going on?

233
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
Look.

234
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
It's Zhuangzi.

235
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
I was right.

236
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
After this,

237
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
leave the spear to Feng Yu.

238
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
Yes.

239
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
It's so scary.

240
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
It's so scary.

241
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
It's so scary.

242
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
It's so scary.

243
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
It's so scary.

244
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
It's so scary.

245
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Get out.

246
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,020
Who is he?

247
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,020
How could he hold this spear?

248
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
I heard that this spear was hit by him.

249
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,020
I thought that the general couldn't hold it.

250
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
But this thing is even more difficult to hold.

251
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,020
But this thing is even more difficult to hold.

252
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,020
How can this be good?

253
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
He can hold this spear.

254
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
He must be a hero.

255
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
Brother.

256
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,020
He's not that ugly.

257
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Why should I kneel to him?

258
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
Don't forget

259
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
the purpose of today.

260
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I've found out that

261
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
this spear

262
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
is a fake.

263
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,020
You'll know when General Shen comes.

264
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
Fake?

265
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
Fake?

266
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
That's weird.

267
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Are you stupid?

268
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
How about

269
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
you try it?

270
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
