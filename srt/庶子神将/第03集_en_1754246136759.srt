00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,620
had

5
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,620
It's not a big deal.

6
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,620
It's not a big deal.

7
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,620
It's not a big deal.

8
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,620
It's not a big deal.

9
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
Jiu Niang.

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,220
You're touched by the court's disease.

11
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
You must be so impatient.

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
It's a misunderstanding.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,620
I think it's a misunderstanding.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,220
Jiu Niang is straightforward.

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
I think something must have happened.

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,620
Yes.

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,620
If you're straightforward, you can do whatever you want.

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,620
These years,

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,620
the Chu family has been bad to you.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,620
But you have been good to me.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
You're so kind.

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,620
The Chu family is not good to you.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,620
You must give me an explanation today.

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,620
Feng Yu.

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,620
Jiu Niang is strong.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,620
She has been taking care of the Chu family.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,620
If you offend her,

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,620
how can you be sorry?

29
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,620
Especially

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,620
the business between your uncle and me.

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,620
Forget it.

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,620
Don't mind women.

33
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
Jiu Niang.

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,620
Just now, the Lord Chu

35
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
said he wanted to see you.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Why don't you ask him

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
what's going on?

38
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,620
What?

39
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,620
You hurt my men.

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,620
You should kneel down to apologize.

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
Kneel down to apologize?

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
Yes.

43
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,620
General Chu of the Ming and Zhen Beijing

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,620
is still standing here.

45
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
I think I kneeled wrongly.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,620
Yes.

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,620
You don't want to reveal your identity.

48
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
It's been three years.

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,620
I can only wait for you.

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,620
Jiu Niang.

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
I'll leave these business

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
to you.

53
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
Thank you, sir.

54
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
I'm no longer

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,620
a useless widow.

56
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,620
I'll be a rich woman

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
and a rich woman.

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
I'll get the world's information

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
and protect the country.

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
When you come back,

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,620
I'll repay you.

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,620
Get up.

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,620
You've worked hard these years.

64
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,620
They've been blinding me for so many years.

65
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
It's Jiu Niang's negligence.

66
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,620
Kneel down to apologize.

67
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,620
Kneel down.

68
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
My wealth

69
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
comes from your kindness.

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,620
Since you treat him so well today,

71
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
I'll take back all the cooperation

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
between the three families

73
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
and Chu Fu.

74
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,620
What?

75
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,620
What?

76
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
What did Chu Beizhi

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
hide from us?

78
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Exactly.

79
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,620
You're just pretending.

80
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,620
I'm here.

81
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,620
You don't have to be afraid of him.

82
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,620
With General Chu's support,

83
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,620
and our financial strength,

84
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
what can you do to us?

85
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,620
It's ridiculous.

86
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,620
You're just a little capable.

87
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
You want to fight against me?

88
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,620
We three families

89
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
may not be able to fight against you.

90
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,620
But you're powerful.

91
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,620
General Chu

92
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
is the best general

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
that His Majesty appointed.

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,620
He can't defeat you.

95
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Do you know

96
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
who my master is?

97
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
General Kunlun.

98
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
I know that.

99
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Everyone knows that.

100
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Who knows who he is?

101
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,620
I'll make a great contribution.

102
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,620
I'll inherit his position soon.

103
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
Then,

104
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,620
you have to kneel down to apologize.

105
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,620
How dare you mention General Kunlun?

106
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,620
I have a close relationship with him.

107
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,620
Even his female star, Shen Feixue,

108
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
calls me her sister.

109
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,620
I dare not be rude.

110
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,620
Good for you.

111
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
You're so stupid.

112
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Have you really met the General?

113
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
When you were defeated at the border,

114
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
why did the enemy give up at the last moment?

115
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
Feixue told you in Beijing.

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,620
She's been waiting for someone.

117
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Aren't you curious?

118
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
So what?

119
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Are you saying that

120
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,620
you're General Kunlun?

121
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,620
You're kidding.

122
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,620
You've been lying in bed for three years.

123
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
You must have lost your mind.

124
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Feng Yun.

125
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
I shouldn't have given you a chance.

126
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,620
I'll kill all of you today.

127
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
I'll punish you for your disobedience.

128
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Feng Yun.

129
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
You dare to do that?

130
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,620
You don't believe me?

131
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,620
You don't believe me?

132
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
My Lord.

133
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,620
How could you raise such a

134
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
treacherous son?

135
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Why don't you let them stop?

136
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
Young Master.

137
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,620
Don't waste time with them.

138
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Let's go.

139
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
They'll know

140
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
what they've lost later.

141
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,620
Enough.

142
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
Let's go.

143
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,620
The King's Mansion

144
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
My Lord.

145
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
My Lord.

146
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,620
Something bad happened.

147
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
Under the spell of the Lord,

148
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
the managers of over forty stores

149
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
left suddenly.

150
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
The servants in the restaurant

151
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
ran away.

152
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
There were many suppliers

153
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
who suddenly came to us.

154
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
They said they'd never

155
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
cooperate with our Chu family

156
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,620
and the Seda family.

157
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Oh, no.

158
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,620
My Lord.

159
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,620
My Lord.

160
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
You must save us.

161
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,620
My Lord.

162
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
My Lord.

163
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,620
My Lord.

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Chu Bei Chi is a useless man.

165
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
He'll only be behind a woman.

166
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,620
When Feixue reaches Bingzhou,

167
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
I'll deal with him.

168
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
In recent years,

169
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,620
the city of Bingzhou has been

170
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,620
harmonious and peaceful.

171
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,620
There's no more corruption.

172
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Nonsense.

173
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,620
It's all thanks to

174
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,620
General Chu's fame.

175
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
General Chu,

176
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,620
I'll propose a toast to you.

177
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
General Chu is good at martial arts.

178
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
He's not like Chu Bei Chi,

179
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
who's not good at fishing.

180
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,620
General Chu has guarded Beijing for many years.

181
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,620
Now he's back to the throne.

182
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,620
We can finally

183
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,620
be at ease.

184
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Although I've made some military achievements

185
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
and learned from the generals,

186
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,620
I'm not worthy of your praise.

187
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,620
I'm so sorry.

188
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Tomorrow,

189
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
the generals will hold

190
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
the birthday party for me.

191
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
I hope you'll enjoy it

192
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
and come with me.

193
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Tomorrow,

194
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
we'll witness General Chu

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,620
take the throne as the General of Kunlun.

196
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
We'll be proud of him.

197
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
Father,

198
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
I've learned so much today

199
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
thanks to your teaching.

200
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,620
I'll be the General of Kunlun

201
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,620
and the Prime Minister.

202
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
I'll make Chu's family

203
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
a great country

204
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
and a great country.

205
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Great!

206
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Great!

207
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
My son, Feng Yu,

208
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,620
will be a great man.

209
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Don't worry,

210
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
Feng Yu can carry the Kunlun's weapon

211
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
and protect the peace of Bingzhou.

212
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
As long as I'm here,

213
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
I'll be free from the troubles.

214
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
I'll be the one to make the world better.

215
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
With General Chu here,

216
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
I'll be happy.

217
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
We've learned a lot!

218
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Great!

219
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Xuenfei!

220
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
What should we do?

221
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
What should we do?

222
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Move aside.

223
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
Move aside.

224
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
How's your leg?

225
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
Of course it's fine.

226
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
But sometimes,

227
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
I can see the real face of a person.

228
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,620
You're my real family.

229
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Just a family?

230
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
There should be a sense of propriety.

231
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
I'm not joking.

232
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
How is it?

233
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
Childe.

235
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,620

236
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
It's just a normal tonic.

237
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Childe Chu is just in good health.

238
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,620

239
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
He needs to be well-treated.

240

Here, Childe Chu.

241
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
Childe.

242
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Wipe your mouth.

Okay.
