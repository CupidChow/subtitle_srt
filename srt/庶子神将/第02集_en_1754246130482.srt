1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
To the sorrowful past,

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,400
we dance and drink,

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,960
yet we don't dare to live.

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:53,340
Counting thello Felix C ì“°

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Yao.

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,960
You've come back.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
You should be polite.

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,480
Chu's food and drink are good for her health.

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,040
But she's angry with us when she wakes up.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Look at her.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,560
You should vent your anger on us.

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,120
Feng Yu, your brother is crazy.

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,160
He even dares to burn the ancestral hall.

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,520
Father, mother,

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,400
don't panic.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,160
I've been taught by the General.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,720
He said

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
he'll hold a gunfight for me in a few days.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,920
Then

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,760
I'll be the heir to the throne.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,000
You're my good son.

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
You've lived up to your father's expectations.

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,560
You've been training in Beijing for three years.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,960
But you've become like this.

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,640
What?

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,080
You're jealous?

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,800
You're jealous?

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,680
That's right.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,960
I can't believe you've become like this

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
even when I'm fighting against a group of bandits.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,560
In order to cure you,

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,360
the food and drink in the whole of Bingzhou

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,560
are almost dried up by you.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,160
You're just losing the face of the Chu family.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,960
The world is so big.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,440
But you only see a small Chu family.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
Do you really think you're the king of the capital?

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
I don't need to talk to them.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
From now on,

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,880
I, Chu Bei, will choose to leave the Chu family.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Everything that the Chu family does in the future

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,720
will have nothing to do with me.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
I'll burn the ancestral hall

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
and beat you.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,640
How can the Chu family

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,440
do you wrong?

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
Did you hear that?

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,600
You beat your uncle and aunt,

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
and burned the ancestral hall.

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,760
You even want to take away all the wealth of the Chu family.

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,960
Please come this way, masters.

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,320
What kind of person is Chu Bei Chi?

53
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm sure you all know what he's like.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,080
What are you doing here, masters?

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,320
We happened to meet General Chu

56
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,360
and come back from the expedition today.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,800
I didn't expect to see you here.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
You're so kind.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm so sorry.

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,880
I didn't expect to see you here.

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,480
Chu Bei Chi

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,400
saved the lives of the Li family.

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
But because of this,

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,680
he threatened us to go on a trip three years ago.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,920
Mr. Chu,

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,440
are you too greedy?

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,640
Chu Bei Chi is ill.

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
You don't have to pay him back.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,960
I was talking about the North Chess.

71
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
He refused to do it.

72
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
And he wants us to do it.

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,400
If it weren't for the sudden return of the wind and rain,

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,840
I don't know what would have happened.

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,200
In recent years,

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
if it weren't for the Jiu Niang,

77
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm afraid there are many people in the family

78
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,560
who are hungry to death because of your illness.

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,440
That's right.

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Jiu Niang?

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,800
It's said that Jiu Niang has a good eye and is rich.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,320
Ordinary people look at her and they're all disappointed.

83
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,680
What?

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,080
Are you scared?

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Jiu Niang is so Again!

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Don't worry.

87
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,920
Don't worry.

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
I bet you two

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
will meet her soon.

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
If Jiu Niang really comes,

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
you'll surely die.

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,040
Three.

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,240
Why don't we kill him today

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
and end it all for nothing?

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,880
Master Cao, what do you think?

96
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Yes, yes.

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,760
It's better to ask Lord Chu to help us.

98
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,280
It's not that I won't spare you.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,040
If it wasn't for the great mistake we made before,

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,520
it wouldn't be like this today.

101
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
That's it.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,840
I only have useful people in the Chu family.

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
You...

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
You'd better kill yourself.

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
Er...

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
What?

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,960
Master, since he doesn't want to kill himself,

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,760
then we can carry him to the pond

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
and let him drown.

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,320
Yes.

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,520
Miss Chu, you're not willing to leave the hospital.

112
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
You should do it.

113
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Feng Yu.

114
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,760
How is that possible?

115
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
General Chu has been suppressed.

116
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,760
Yes, how is that possible?

117
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,680
One.

118
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Who gave you the guts?

119
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,080
One.

120
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
Two.

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,360
Three.

122
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
One.

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,760
We've destroyed the battle.

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Why do you still wear

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
this fake expected stirrup?

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,320
It'soney to me.

127
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,720
can't be obtained.

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
You want to kill the Queen?

129
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
You're determined to do it?

130
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
But don't forget

131
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm a man of great virtue.

132
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
Even if you're the Queen of Northern Lie,

133
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,920
I won't give up.

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,600
Report!

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,880
Report!

136
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,120
Your Majesty.

137
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,320
General.

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,560
He's indeed a man of great virtue.

139
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
A widow

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,360
who dares to be a general of Kunlun?

141
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,200
He's even taken over by the Nine-Birds.

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,640
And that doctor.

143
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't fall behind.

144
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Right.

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
Why don't you

146
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,400
compete first

147
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,660
for

148
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
a rank

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,280
besides being a Maybelline?

150
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,240
I am waiting for the firefly to fly

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,760
The wind blows under the sea

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,360
The wind flows under the stone
