1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,420
Won't stop for too long

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,480
it's just a race

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,080
I can't lag

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,100
in the middle of the field

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,300
Sometimes if somebody thinks

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,660
I'm the man toCin JU

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,240
Jump onto the mountain

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,520
H 말이

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,200
Loal

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,680
The hero

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,640
Insignia

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,720
quarterly

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,340
weekly

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,840
weekly

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,000
weekly

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,260
weekly

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,100
Sigh

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
I feel terrible

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,080
Go.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,000
Go.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,960
Don't move.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,000
Lord Cang,

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,440
I've got a clue.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
He seems to be

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,840
a relative of a military officer of the Black Armor Army.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,560
Seems?

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,640
He...

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,200
My brother was born and died in the field.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,160
You didn't ask him for his rank

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
and thought he was a deserter.

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,320
And you killed your family.

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,360
What's your intention?

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,440
I want to report to the court.

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,560
I want to report to the court.

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,800
I want to report to the court.

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,080
I want to report to the court.

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
I want to report to the court.

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
I want to report to the court.

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
I want to report to the court.

40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,920
I want to report to the court.

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,520
You...

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,600
It's not right

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,320
to make such a misunderstanding.

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,880
Why don't I

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
apologize to you in person?

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
But...

47
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,840
I hate it when people look at me like this.

48
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,400
Why are you going to let me get angry?

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Human!

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
I 트� GREGORY YOU!

51
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,360
MY EYES!

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,600
Young Master.

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
How should we deal with him?

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,120
Young Master.

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
You should pay attention to your behavior

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
and leave the mountain immediately.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Then, what about her family?

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Why don't you stay here

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
and you come to Shanya?

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
You come to Shanya?

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
The crime of escaping the army

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
should be punished according to the law.

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Lock them up and interrogate them.

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Yes.

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Get up.

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Get up.

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
The Black Armor Army of the God of Kunlun

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
is always a threat to my father's business.

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
The best way to do it is to kill the soldiers

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
and their families to create a case.

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
And the Black Armor Army is a traitor.

72
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Once they rebel,

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
the country will be in chaos.

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
In addition,

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
the God of Qi, Chu Feng Yu,

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
is the successor of the God of Kunlun.

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Then, he can do this

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
and make it more appropriate.

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Yes.

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
The God of Qi

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
General Chu,

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
a spy reported that

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
a village was on fire last night.

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
No one was alive.

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
The people around said

86
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
that the Black Armor Army escaped.

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
The family of the escaped soldiers were severely punished by the court.

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Everyone in the village was punished.

89
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
The Black Armor Army never escaped.

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
It must be the plan of the Crown Prince.

91
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
You set up the Black Armor Army.

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
It's the backbone of the Northern Jin Army.

93
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
It has done a lot of military service for our country.

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Now, the people are accused of escaping.

95
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
There will be a bigger plan in the future.

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm afraid that escaping is just a lie.

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
It's actually a crime to kill the loyal soldiers.

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
So, they forced the Black Armor Army to rebel.

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Jiang Wu You is not that smart.

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm afraid that the one who wants to rebel

101
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
is the King of Qi.

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
The soldiers are the most powerful in the country.

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
They know the army better than the Zhe Jin soldiers.

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Fei Xuan,

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
go back to the North Jinan Prefecture to settle the army.

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Leave the rest to me.

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes, Fei Xuan.

108
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
The Black Armor Army

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I heard that the Little Prince

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
has attacked the Black Armor Army.

111
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
If the Black Armor Army's morale is in a mess,

112
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
even the Kunlun General

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
will not be able to return to the sky.

114
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
If the Northern Jin Army sends troops,

115
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
my father's great cause will be achieved.

116
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Help you?

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
What's the use of helping me?

118
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
But when the world is open and the world is open,

119
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
how many ships will His Majesty like

120
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
when the border is small?

121
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
How many ships will I give to the Great Tian?

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
No.

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
I only want one person.

124
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Chu Bei Chi.

125
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
What's so hard about that?

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
It's just a small number of officials.

127
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
But His Majesty reminded me,

128
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
so I remembered that

129
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
he seems to be one of the escapees.

130
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
If you want to touch him,

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
this deal is impossible.

132
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Because I have already

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
met your end.

134
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,120
The Kunlun General is your teacher?

136
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Your Highness,

137
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
it's true.

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
You have military achievements,

139
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
but you are not a god of the world.

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
I'm poor.

141
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I have no teacher or student.

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
What's the point of being a teacher?

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Your brother is always pressuring you.

144
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Don't you hate him?

145
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
I hate him.

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
I hate him.

147
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
In the future,

148
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
if you are willing to be loyal to me,

149
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
and eliminate the Black Armor Army and the Kunlun General,

150
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
you will be under one person.

151
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Are you willing to do that?

152
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
As long as you can let me do anything

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
on the Chu Bei Chi.

154
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Okay.

155
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Since you are my dog,

156
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
how can you not leave any traces

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
on your body?

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
You...

159
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
You are lying.

160
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Enough.

161
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm so dizzy.

162
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Master,

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
no matter what,

164
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
you must save Feng Yu.

165
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
He is your biological son.

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
But isn't Bei Chi also my biological son?

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Who told you to be disrespectful to the princess?

168
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Now that it has come to this,

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
it's too late to say anything.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Chu Bei Chi,

171
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
you are so mean.

172
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
You are so mean.

173
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
You are so mean.

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
You are so mean.

175
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Chu Bei Chi, Chu Bei Chi.

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
I can only see the face of the Chu family in your eyes.

177
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
You old fool.

178
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
No.

179
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Everything is still in place.

180
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Feng Yu.

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Feng Yu.

182
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Feng Yu, you are back.

183
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
My son suffered.

184
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
He is to blame for everything.

185
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
That Chu Bei Chi is cruel and cruel.

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
How can I live

187
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
with my son?

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Mother, don't worry.

189
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I have taken the order from Prince Qi.

190
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
He also promised

191
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
that he would treat me seriously.

192
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
You are indeed my son.

193
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
If the court sees this,

194
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
the future will be bright.

195
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Good.

196
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Good.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
This is a good opportunity.

198
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
You must not slack off.

199
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Father.

200
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Mother.

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Don't worry.

202
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
I will definitely take care of the Chu family.

203
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I want everyone to know

204
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
who is the glory of the Chu family.

205
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Chu Bei Chi destroyed my reputation

206
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
and took away my honor.

207
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
I must make him pay.

208
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Go.

209
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
The red shoes are embroidered

210
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
and the sea flows into the name card.

211
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
The clouds fall on the face of the mountain

212
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
and the mountains are covered in blood.

213
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,120
The three-step victory drifts in the cold face of the dream.

214
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,120
The old story of love is in the past.

215
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,120
A lifetime of wind flows to the next point.

216
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,120
But when no one understands,

217
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
you and I lack something special.

218
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
We always want to show care for each other

219
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
and listen to each other's secret.

220
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Your Majesty,

221
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
sorry for myquéreality this time.

222
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Yes.

223
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
At this rate,

224
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
you will hold the banner in rake high before everyone's attention.

225
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
How could you work for the Qi Family?

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm a common that

227
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
caused our site to be destroyed.

228
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
How dare you disturb me?

229
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Let love talk

230
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Tomorrow night, the snow falls, the moon hides

231
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,120
The white horse is like a deer

232
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,120
The wind blows, the mountains and villages are like a windfall

233
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Tonight, the most beautiful flowers are blooming

234
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,120
The people are busy, the flowers are not in bloom

235
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,120
The wind blows, the sea is deep, the wind is strong
