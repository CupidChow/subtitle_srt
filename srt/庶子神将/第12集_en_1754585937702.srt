1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,200
When the wine burns,warming will be 72

2
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,200
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Episode 16

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Chu Bei Chi was so reckless at the beginning.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
He had no way to play.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
How...

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
How did he start to take the upper hand?

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
It's been a long time.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Yeah.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
What a bunch of idiots.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Amazing.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
It's all under Chu Bei Chi's control.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Your Highness,

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Chu Bei Chi is good at plotting.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
It seems that these people

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
may not be able to kill today.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
I think it's too early.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
I have a killer to kill.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Chu Bei Chi

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Bei Chi,

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
the incense is burning.

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
He's dead.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
It seems

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
you still won.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
In that case,

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Chu Bei Chi,

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
end this game.

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
If you don't do it,

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
the incense will be burned.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Fei Xue.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Fei Xue?

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
What's going on?

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
What's going on?

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
What's going on?

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Why is Shen Fei Xue here?

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Help!

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Help me!

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
My husband is not a fugitive.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
My husband is a blacksmith.

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I'll take you away.

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Help me.

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
The drug of Nanjiang

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
is really effective.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Of course.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Jiang Wu You,

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
the winner is decided.

48
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You still won't let go.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
As long as both sides haven't fallen,

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
the game is not over.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Right, Your Majesty?

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
He's poisoned by the drug of Nanjiang.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
He can take the soul and shoot it.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
He can't wake up.

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Since you're the enemy,

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
you'll live or die.

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
You just have to kill him.

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
It's too late.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Good!

60
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Good!

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
That's great!

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Fei Xue!

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Fei Xue!

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
My Lord,

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
what did I do?

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,200
What did I do?

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Fei Xue!

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Fei Xue!

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Fei Xue,

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I thought as long as I hid my identity

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
and returned home,

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
there would be no war in the Forbidden City.

73
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
You and the Black Armor Army would be fine.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
But,

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I was wrong.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Fei Xue,

77
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
from now on,

78
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
you're the best female hero in the world.

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
You must protect the Forbidden City

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
and protect the country.

81
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Xie Chushuai!

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You've been with me for years.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Everyone thinks you're the best female hero in the world.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
But only I know

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
that you're just a little girl

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
if not for protecting the country.

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
My Lord,

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm late.

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
I've let you suffer.

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
You haven't married me.

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I haven't married you.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
If I ask you again,

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
will you marry me?

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Fei Xue,

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I wanted to protect you for life,

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
but I didn't expect you to suffer this.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
It's my fault.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I couldn't protect the Black Armor Army

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
and you.

100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Fei Xue,

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I'll sacrifice my life

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
to save you.

103
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Chu Bai Chi,

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I didn't expect this to happen.

105
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
You...

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Go back to the North!

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Master,

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I just...

109
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
The Black Armor Army

110
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Although I didn't kill Jiajue,

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,200
it's worth it to kill Shen Fei Xue.

112
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Jiang Wu You,

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
how could you be so vicious

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
to harm the people and the people?

115
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
You're too harsh.

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
You really

117
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
don't fear me to be punished?

118
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Punished?

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm the royal family

120
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
and the son of Prince Qi.

121
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Even if you don't have the power,

122
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
even the emperor will come.

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
He has to think about it.

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
No one can punish me in this world.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
You...

126
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Fei Xue,

127
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
he's the royal family.

128
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Have you made up your mind?

129
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Chu Bai Chi,

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
how dare you touch me?

131
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I'll admit my crime.

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll tell you how to frame the Black Armor Army

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
and kill the loyal and good people.

134
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Chu Bai Chi,

135
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
the little prince is the royal family's national flag.

136
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
How dare you?

137
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Chu Bai Chi,

138
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
how dare you kill the royal family?

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Are you trying to get the Chu family involved?

140
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Let go of the little prince right now,

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
or I won't let you go.

142
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Fei Wu,

143
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
go to my father and save me.

144
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
You've been trying to kill me.

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm sure

146
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
you've never tried this before.

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Tell me.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I'll tell you.

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll tell you.

150
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I framed the loyal and good people.

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
I framed them for escaping.

152
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I... I harmed their general.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I framed General Xue Fei Ye.

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I killed him.

155
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I was so vicious.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I...

157
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I've already said it.

158
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Are you still not letting go?

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you want to be killed?

160
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Fei Xue,

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
brothers,

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
brothers,

163
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I'll take his life today

164
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
and apologize to you.

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Your Highness.

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Your Highness.

167
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
The Prince

168
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
was killed

169
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
by Chu Bai Chi in public.

170
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
What did you say?

171
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,560
Chu Bei Chi

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,960
dares to kill my son.

173
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,080
I will cut him into pieces.

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,600
Your Highness,

175
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Chu Bei Chi has already taken the initiative

176
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,680
to kill his son.

177
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
Killing the royal family

178
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
was done by me alone.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,520
It has nothing to do with others.
