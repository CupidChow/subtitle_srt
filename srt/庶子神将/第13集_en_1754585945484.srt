1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,120
Can'tạnh Matthew

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Chu Bei Chi killed his royal family in public.

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
He's the most vicious.

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,680
He's being punished.

5
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Chu Bei Chi!

6
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,480
How dare you murder your royal family?

7
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,440
Are you trying to get Chu's family into trouble?

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,920
No!

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,120
Let go of His Highness right now!

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,480
Or I won't let you off!

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Fei Xue!

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,760
Brothers!

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,360
I'll use his life

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,920
to make you pay for your crimes!

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,280
Is Father still well?

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,800
Now that I think of him,

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,320
you killed your royal family for the sake of the family.

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,000
If you hadn't broken off your relationship with him,

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,320
and the King of Qi was kind,

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm afraid the whole Chu family would be locked up here.

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't expect Father to save you.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Just wait for your death.

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,840
You and I are brothers.

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,440
Do you really want me to die?

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,480
You're clearly looking for your own death.

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,560
You're just a concubine.

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
You don't know how to be a good wife.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,440
You've been against me several times.

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
You knew I was working for him,

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,720
but you killed him.

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,880
You even humiliated me in front of everyone.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
How could I let you off?

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,880
His Highness killed his loyal servant.

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
He deserves to die.

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
Enough!

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,640
You're still trying to get a reason for your death.

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,080
I only know that since the moment you woke up,

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
everyone's eyes

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,880
have been on you.

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm the legitimate heir of the Chu family,

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
but I'm your accomplice.

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
Isn't that funny?

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,040
But now,

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
you're not qualified to compete with me.

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,360
It's funny.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
You used to be

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,200
unwilling to give up your future for the Chu family.

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,600
Now,

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
you're willing to risk your life

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
for a few irrelevant people.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,760
Chu Feng Yuan,

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,840
as a soldier of the Great Tian,

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,040
you see them as escaped soldiers

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,280
and suffer from family troubles.

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,680
What's your intention?

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm a general.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm just following orders.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Whether they're escaped soldiers

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
or not,

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
it's none of my business.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,040
In my eyes,

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
they're just

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,040
the cornerstones of my achievements.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
A general's foundation

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,440
is to defend the common people.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
If you only know how to kill,

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,880
you'll only become a tool for killing.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,200
You'll win without killing

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,400
and the world will be at peace.

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,400
In this letter from general Kun Lun

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
he wrote about the angels,

72
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,320
do you remember

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
all I said?

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,760
How could you?

75
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,680
인 Kill and the world will be at peace.

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,760
物 Dunhou

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
I've said this.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Do you remember?

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,360
How could you?

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,160
You...

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Even if you have all the skills,

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,840
not only did Prince Qi not get angry at the nuns,

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,120
but also for the sake of my Kunlun General's successor,

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
you still have to be loyal to me.

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,440
I can make a contribution again.

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
But you

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
can only bring shame to your death

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
and be forgotten by everyone.

89
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,400
Between you and me,

90
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm still the one who will win.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,720
Bring him in.

92
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,520
Yes.

93
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,400
Let's go.

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,040
This way.

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,160
In this case,

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,160
we'll soon know what's behind this conspiracy.

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,040
Your Highness.

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,160
Where's Beichi?

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,560
Your Highness.

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,560
Chu Beichi killed his royal family.

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,400
It's hard to escape from the death of his royal family.

102
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
Even you

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,800
can't change the law of the court.

104
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
If I investigate it,

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
he's not only innocent,

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,080
but also capable.

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,280
In a few days,

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,120
my father will be going to Qilin,

109
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,640
and will investigate this case.

110
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,560
His Majesty wants to investigate this case?

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,880
Then I will tell my father everything.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,600
Not only will I let the Bejing warriors of the conspiracy

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,440
to be elected, I will also give Beichi freedom.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,520
And those who create the escape case

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
and the accomplices,

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
none of them can escape.

117
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,400
Beichi.

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,920
Deputy Chief.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,320
Why didn't you show your identity?

120
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
You suffered here for nothing.

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
Calm down.

122
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,200
If I show my identity now,

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,920
how can I get rid of the poison?

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,240
Where's my family?

125
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,600
Don't worry.

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,680
Jiu Ning is all settled.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,480
Where's she?

128
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,280
She's fine.

129
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,880
Thank you, Chief.

130
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Your Highness, please show me your identity.

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,200
Your Highness.

132
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,360
Your meridians are injured.

133
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
You need to rest.

134
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,920
Your Highness.

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Fortunately, Beichi sealed your death.

136
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,920
Otherwise, I can't even save you.

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,560
But Beichi also has a scar on his meridians.

138
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,320
But don't worry.

139
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,200
He's fine.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,640
It's good that you're fine.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
I'll return to Beijing as soon as I get rid of the poison

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,120
and lead the Black Armor Army to read the military order.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,800
Your Highness.

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Prince Qi has arrived at Chu's Mansion.

146
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't expect Prince Qi to be in such a hurry.

147
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,200
It's even better.

148
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
Let me see

149
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,720
which show they're going to sing.

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
If you kill a loser,

151
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,680
you'll be exiled to prison.

152
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Beichi has his own plan.

153
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,560
We should trust him.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,520
Your Highness, something bad happened.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,280
The informants couldn't find any clues.

156
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,560
People may die or be sealed.

157
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,600
Prince Qi is so vicious.

158
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,360
Calm down.

159
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,120
Since you're in the game,

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,160
Prince Qi's game is over.

161
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Chu's Mansion

162
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,280
Prince Qi, things are changing outside.

163
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,240
You stay here and be safe.

164
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,320
His Highness sent me to save you.

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,120
Come with me.

166
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,240
Simba

167
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
The moon is in the air

168

193
