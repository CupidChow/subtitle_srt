1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,080
The questions mark the end of today,

2
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
coming to an end for the game.

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,960
Re ðŸŽµ

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,280
Three, two, one, go.

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,360
Three, two, one, go.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,160
Three, two, one, go.

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,000
Second Grounds.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,440
Three, two, one, go.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,440
I admit

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,200
that there are many roads where we must take them.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Let us out!

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Let us out!

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Let us out!

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Let us out!

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Why is he so cruel?

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
My lord, he's not a bad person.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Let us out!

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Let us out!

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Stop!

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Letting those innocent people go

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
is to let us take their place.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Their families may be buried in other villages

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
or be killed in the battlefield.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
If the gun is full of loyal people,

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
they can only bring about a family destruction.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Who dares to serve the country?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Who dares to serve the country?

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Who dares to serve the country?

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Who dares to serve the country?

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Who dares to serve the country?

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
We have no guns or troops.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
We have no guns or troops.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Let us go.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Yes, let us go.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Let us go.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Let us go.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm willing to go.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm willing to go.

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm willing to go.

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
A Jizi is a good match for a fugitive.

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,200
You're really a lowly person.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
In my opinion,

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
we should arrest them all.

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
You...

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
You...

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
You're brilliant.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Chu Bei Chi has a bunch of prostitutes

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
to serve him.

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Stop talking nonsense.

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
How can we let them go?

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Tell me.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Why isn't Chu Bei Chi here?

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Is this chess game

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
designed by the Crown Prince for Chu Bei Chi?

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
What?

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
You women are the ones who are in danger.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Are you waiting for me?

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Let them go.

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Chu Bei Chi.

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
You're trying to kill me.

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Let them all die with me.

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Stop talking nonsense.

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Stop talking nonsense.

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Let them go.

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Let them go.

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Let them go.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Let them go.

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Let them go.

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Let them go.

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Let them go.

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Chu Bei Chi, how dare you?

72
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Killing the Crown Prince

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
is a serious crime against the Zhu Jiu Tribe.

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Jiang Wu You.

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
You framed the Black Armor Army

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
and harmed their family.

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I will report to Father one by one.

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
If you don't let them go today,

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
don't blame me for being rude.

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Let them go?

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm afraid

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
he can't let them go now.

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
This is the Qian Kun chess game of the Northern Lies.

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
It tests the minds,

85
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
military skills and inner power of the opponents.

86
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Every piece of chess on the board

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
is as heavy as a thousand pounds.

88
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
If you want to push the chess forward,

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
you must have a deep inner power.

90
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
If you lack inner power,

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
you can't even hold on

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
to the divine weapon.

93
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I said

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
I would get you by my own way.

95
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Even if it destroys you,

96
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I will not give up.

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,020
The

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
As the bow of the Chuhe Han Realm,

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
if you break the game,

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
the cage will open.

101
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,200
But if you fail or stay still for too long,

102
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
the hidden mechanism under the hand of the party

103
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
will naturally be in the box.

104
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
The bomb will explode.

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I forgot to mention.

106
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Don't think about breaking the cage directly.

107
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Because the hidden mechanism under the cage

108
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
connects several mechanisms.

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
So, if you want to save someone,

110
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
there is no other way except breaking the game.

111
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
If you promise me now,

112
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I will let them go.

113
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Otherwise...

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I will do it.

115
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Bei Chi!

116
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Prince!

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Bei Chi!

118
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
You must win!

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
This guy

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
looks like a real man.

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,840
He looks like a

122
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm afraid that

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
the game will end

124
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
before the end of the world.

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
In this case,

126
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
these escapees will die.

127
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
The chess is heavily loaded.

128
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
How many points can the Chuhe Han Realm win

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
if they go on the battlefield?

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
If he can't win,

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
no one in the world

132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
can win this game.

133
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Your Majesty,

134
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
we will win

135
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
the game.

136
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Guo Yuan, your dream is different.

137
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Master,

138
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
No matter what you think of me,

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I just want you.

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Let us out!

142
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Let us out!

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Let us out!

144
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Let us out!

145
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Let us out!

146
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Let us out!

147
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Let us out!

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
The Three Armor Army always use iron face to test people.

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
They only protect the people of the Western Realm

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
for the sake of the Wei State.

151
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Many people have not yet

152
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
got the chance to get the reward.

153
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
In this life, we can only end the battlefield

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
and eliminate the people.

155
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I, Chu Bei Chi, will stand here

156
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
and save you.

157
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Please believe in the Three Armor Army.

158
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Please believe in me.

159
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
We believe in you!

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
We believe in you!

161
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
We believe in you!

162
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
We believe in you!

163
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
We believe in you!

164
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
You want to see

165
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
how you can break the game?

166
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Let's start.

167
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
The Three Armor Army

168
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Did you see that?

169
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
My son-in-law has a strong inner force.

170
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
He can take the lead in the beginning.

171
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Chu Bei Chi,

172
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I thought you had some tricks.

173
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm afraid you have a strong inner force.

174
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
You are so stupid.

175
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
How can you jump the horse as soon as you get on it?

176
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Feng Yun,

177
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
shut up.

178
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
You used the Three Armor Army

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
to defeat the Great Kun

180
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
in the first round.

181
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Chu Bei Chi,

182
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
have you not been able to think

183
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
after you were awakened?

184
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
How can you be so reckless

185
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
before you regained your mind?

186
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Or

187
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
you want to use the army?

188
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
You lost both your hands.

189
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
You are so stupid.

190
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
You can even tell that you lost.

191
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Chu Bei Chi,

192
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
keep going.

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I want to see

194
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
how you can be killed

195
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
into a man.

196
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
The ten moves of the star-shaped stone

197
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
are the only ones that can be taken away.

198
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
All the soldiers and horses

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
are on their knees.

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
They should take the bomb.

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
You should keep hiding

202
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
in order to hide from the danger.

203
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Hmmph!

204
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Chu Cab below!

205
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,980
The Lord ofurai

206
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,160
Guys.

207
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,900
Hanzo.

208
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Hanzo!

209
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,120
Go after your opponent.

210
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
In this case,

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,360
he's just a poor man.

212
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,160
But as a friend in the palace,

213
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,960
he's still a loser.

214
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,320
Save me!

215
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Save me!

216
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
Save me!

217
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,120
Save me!

218
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Save me!

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,160
A man is as good as a man.

220
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,080
Only when you're not suspicious

221
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,640
can you win.

222
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,500
Goods created in wine,

223
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Scottish law is forbidden,

224
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,680
checking wine and saltï¿½ï¿½

225
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
Make a needy remuneration

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
whole of people reload!

227
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,480
Make a query and you'll learn the trick.

228
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,560
Back to the entrance of the door,

229
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,120
turn in when you reach rose.

230
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Black-tpedAL charge

231
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
and the blood will remove!

232
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:28,280
The will of the people is blinding, waiting for the
