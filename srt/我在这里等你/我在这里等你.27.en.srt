1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:20,380
פ."

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,380
I don't know if this hand of Yuzhi has the same color of black.

3
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,380
You're old, why do you paint powder?

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,380
No matter how thick the foundation is, it can't cover the wrinkles on your face.

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,380
Miss Tong, you're speaking too seriously.

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,380
We're both public figures.

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,380
Public figures?

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,380
Do you really think that I'm a public figure?

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,380
I'm a public figure.

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,380
Public figures? What do you mean?

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,380
Is it just the appearance of the scenery, the background, and the moral values?

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
Miss Tong!

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,380
So this Yuzhi has a big black color.

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,380
This sister, the director is calling for a photo.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,380
Understood.

16
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,380
In the world of Ula-Nara,

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,380
you need to work until sunset to raise me.

18
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,380
Yes. I'll keeps that order.

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,380
Isn't she the girl from the world of Ula-Nara?

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Why don't you find the one from Ula-Nara valuable?

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,020
Whether Concubine Du likes me or not

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,620
is none of your business.

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,980
How dare you speak so harshly!

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,660
Concubine Du, I'm kneeling here

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,100
because Concubine Du asked me to.

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,260
I'm not Concubine Du.

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,980
You don't have to force me.

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,340
You're such a bitch!

29
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,900
Is there any part of this play that doesn't hit people?

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,740
Xuan Pei.

31
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,940
But...

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,340
But it failed.

33
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,460
Plus,

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,580
plus 1.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,940
P獲得了

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,780
Time flows through our eyes

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,900
Who is this?

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,700
What's going on?

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,860
Director, she is the agent

40
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,940
What's wrong with the agent?

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,300
Our show

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
We have to rely on her knowledge to promote

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,420
No, isn't Tianxuan and Tong Feng a pair?

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,740
What's going on?

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,900
Who knows who said that?

46
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,780
I don't know how to fight back

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,780
Why are you standing there?

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,220
I'm acting

49
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,940
You didn't get hit in the script

50
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,300
I wanted to fight back

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,820
But you took me away

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,780
And now we left the set

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,500
Yuzhi will not miss this chance

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,140
Now you see Liu Song

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,100
It's probably something

56
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,420
Tong Feng doesn't follow professional ethics

57
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,460
The news of leaving the set in advance

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,660
The crew is from the Xuan family

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
But nothing will be known

60
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,460
in the crew

61
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,060
How did you get into the fantasy world?

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,460
And you have such a good identity

63
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,420
Remember

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,740
If anyone bullies you in the future

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
I'll beat them back

66
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,540
Whether it's responsible or compensatory

67
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,260
I'll take the responsibility for you

68
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,020
My lord

69
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,020
You are in the fantasy world

70
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,260
You can't use magic

71
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,060
You are not as strong as you were in the long trip

72
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,940
Don't say anything

73
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,060
I said

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,260
Whether it's in the long trip or in the fantasy world

75
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,660
I can protect you

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,020
I never knew

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,620
You are so sweet

78
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,820
I will not break my promise

79
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,940
Tong Feng's hotel

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,100
The manager's eyes are full of love

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,900
The famous boyfriend Tianxuan is in a bad mood

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,460
Tong Feng is always like this

83
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,260
Among female artists

84
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,100
He has the most negative news

85
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,660
Tianxuan's husband is so miserable

86
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,620
Tianxuan

87
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,580
Love is mysterious

88
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
I'm super sweet

89
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,100
Tong Feng

90
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,580
Get out of the entertainment circle

91
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,380
Tong Feng

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,060
Your ticket sales are going down

93
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,540
It should be Yuzhi's side

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Yuzhi started to be a little bit more aggressive

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,620
Yuzhi started to act

96
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,980
The crew's story didn't get exposed

97
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,260
The hotel's story was exposed

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,900
The news words are quite good

99
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,820
What words

100
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,260
No one knows

101
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,460
What time is it

102
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,940
You still have the heart to joke

103
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,500
Last time you said

104
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,820
What is the second way to make artists

105
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,140
Increase popularity quickly

106
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,700
What is the second way

107
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Tong Feng

108
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,060
Open the door

109
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
Tianxuan

110
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
Tong Feng

111
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,060
You have to argue with me

112
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm sorry

113
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I'm sorry

114
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm sorry

115
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
I'm sorry

116
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,060
I'm sorry

117
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,460
You

118
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
Go out

119
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,300
Yeah

120
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,580
You guys made a lot of noise

121
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:20,620
Only then Keolouta and

122
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,100
Power to lighten

123
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,900
Tong Feng image

124
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,180
Do you want to watch the competition

125
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
to protect his image.

126
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Then the second method,

127
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,100
will you tell Tong Feng

128
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
or should I tell him?

129
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,660
I've asked Xuan Pei today.

130
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,940
He just won't tell me.

131
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,020
You're so narrow-minded.

132
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,700
The second method is to attract a couple.

133
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,940
Attract a couple?

134
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,980
The letters in your bag

135
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,540
tell you to pretend to be my lover.

136
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,460
Now the comments on Weibo are all scolding you.

137
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,020
Only by protecting the image of the couple

138
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,180
can we avoid the incident.

139
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,700
Then what should we do?

140
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,180
It's simple.

141
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,620
As long as we take a picture,

142
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,940
the news will be leaked.

143
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,260
But if we take a picture together,

144
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,500
will the husband be angry?

145
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,780
No.

146
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,540
It's all fake.

147
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,260
For the competition.

148
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,660
Right, brother?

149
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,300
Yes.

150
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,140
Okay.

151
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,500
Go.

152
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,580
Look.

153
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,580
My position

154
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,180
works better than to protect my image.

155
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,220
Oh, i see.

156
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,860
I see.

157
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,300
It does.

158
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,940
Thank you, Tian Xuan.

159
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,060
You're welcome.

160
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:51,900
By the way,

161
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,980
we have to go.

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,380
You said goodbye to me for so long.

163
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,100
There must be someone behind this.

164
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,300
It's the time to make a speech.

165
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,380
Your father

166
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,380
won't let Tong Feng be in a difficult situation, right?

167
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,060
Wait for me in the room.

168
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,220
If we go together,

169
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,500
the rumors will spread again.

170
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,220
Let's go.

171
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,020
Let's go.

172
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,980
洛阳

173
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,900
If others find you acting like this,

174
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,860
I'm afraid you will

175
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
be famous.

176
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,940
Si Mo,

177
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,580
you are already a relative.

178
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,340
Why don't you help me at all?

179
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,700
You're late.

180
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,140
Fu Sai is young.

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,480
Surfing的是十年

182
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,260
wishes to be fulfilled.

183
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,940
Can be fulfilled?

184
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
It's the dead end.

185
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,660
Enough.

186
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,380
Tong Feng and I are to be...

187
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,900
I'm here.

188
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,020
What's wrong?

189
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,980
I think you can't get her.

190
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,540
That's true.

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,500
She's been with Lord Jiuyou

192
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,140
for a long time.

193
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,860
Why are you here?

194
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,740
It's none of your business.

195
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,620
No matter what,

196
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,820
I'll win over Tong Feng.

197
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,620
Mr. Tong Feng is here.

198
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,380
It's Tong Feng's play.

199
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,300
So what?

200
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Why are you making so much noise?

201
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,260
I didn't expect it to be so hard to film.

202
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,420
You'll win.

203
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,220
Thank you.

204
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,380
Over there.

205
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,260
Hurry up.

206
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,980
Tianxuan, Tong Feng,

207
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,340
can I take some photos for you?

208
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,700
Of course.

209
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,340
Look at me.

210
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,260
I'm here.

211
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I knew it.

212
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,820
Tong Feng's leg injury

213
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,060
is fake.

214
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,100
There's no photo on the news.

215
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,500
It's a lie.

216
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
It's fake.

217
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,100
The real one is here.

218
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,100
Tianxuan is so manly.

219
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,620
He's a real man.

220
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,100
Manly?

221
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,980
When I get back to Jiuyou,

222
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,340
I'll make him a man.

223
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,740
What?

224
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,180
Tong Feng is so beautiful

225
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,740
and then turn me into a man too?

226
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,660
Every man has a friend.

227
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,780
This naded beauty is too pretty.

228
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,580
Help.

229
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,140
We can be a couple.

230
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,620
That's right.

231
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,940
Hanshi orchestra

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,140
Hello?

233
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
It's me.

234
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,340
No. Listen to me.

235
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,620
Hello?

236
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,420
Go.

237
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,460
Get Tianxuan here.

238
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,460
We need to change the play.

239
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,340
It's important.

240
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,540
But...

241
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
Go.

242
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,420
Okay.

243
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,340
Coco.

244
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,260
I'll make you my plantsite for sure.

245
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
The play today was good.

246
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,900
It's a success.

247
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,380
Why must the play of confession

248
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,540
be a big hit?

249
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,580
Yeah.

250
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
And they didn't give me an umbrella.

251
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,580
And I was naked.

252
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,380
Why are the people of the 21st century

253
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,300
so strong-minded?

254
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,940
Are there really people

255
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,060
who look so similar?

256
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,020
Demon Lord.

257
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,100
Do you have

258
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,260
any twin brothers?

259
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,580
I have an elder brother.

260
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,740
He has left me for a long time.

261
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,940
Is your brother

262
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,060
Si Mo?

263
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,580
Tong Feng.

264
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,020
You rejected your manager

265
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
this morning.

266
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,900
Now you're rejecting

267
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,980
my manager this afternoon.

268
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,220
Princess Yuzhi.

269
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
I respect you

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,060
because I don't want to provoke

271
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,380
the dispute between the nine-traveller and the Demon Realm.

272
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,540
But if you

273
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,580
keep provoking me,

274
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,700
I won't be so polite.

275
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,300
You're so arrogant.

276
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,980
What else do you want?

277
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,700
I don't think

278
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,540
it's true.

279
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,500
It's full of

280
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,860
my best friend's soul fragments.

281
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,180
My best friend

282
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
loved to eat chicken with sugar and vinegar.

283
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,620
When my friend

284
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,820
gave me this bracelet,

285
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,580
he said

286
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,140
if I could burn a red-tailed

287
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,940
rooster to worship it,

288
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,140
it would be more sincere.

289
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,460
Who are you burning?

290
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,420
You said it was from someone else.

291
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,300
Why are you...

292
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,820
Just give it to him.

293
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,260
Let me go.

294
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,700
Let go.

295
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,380
You can't control it.

296
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,740
She's Tianxun's

297
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,580
official girlfriend.

298
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,940
You can't control

299
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,780
what I say to her.

300
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,180
She's a fake official girlfriend,

301
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,460
but she's a real wife.

302
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,820
Who said she's fake?

303
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,860
My wife.

304
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,260
It's time to go back to work.

305
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,420
It's time to stop talking.

306
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,260
Let's go.

307
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,540
Where are you taking me?

308
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
It's 5 p.m. now.

309
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
There are 32 hours

310
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
left before the competition ends.

311
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,860
Except for the eight hours of sleep,

312
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,580
you can have a date with me for five hours.

313
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
It won't affect your competition.

314
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,340
Date?

315
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,260
Where are we going?

316
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,940
Wherever you like,

317
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
I'll take you there.

318
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,380
Let's go.

319
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,860
Let's go.

320
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,740
The thousand years of love

321
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,660
bloom in the essence.

322
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,820
The summer is falling,

323
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,460
the future is reborn.

324
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,100
I don't know

325
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,420
where I am.

326
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,620
I'm still in love with you.

327
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,660
I'm still in love with you.

328
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
I'm still in love with you.

329
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,620
Who is moving?

330
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,260
The first tear is love,

331
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,900
but you're the one who breaks it.

332
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
Did you have fun today?

333
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,820
Yes.

334
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,660
Xuan Pei,

335
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,300
stand here.

336
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,260
Let me take a picture for you.

337
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,900
Come this way.

338
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,260
Xuan Pei,

339
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,060
you're so pretty.

340
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
After I go back to Jiuhou,

341
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,220
I'll go to school, too.

342
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Childish.

343
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Not only that,

344
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,740
I'll hang a 300-year-old

345
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,660
on the small newspaper.

346
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,660
That side is more beautiful.

347
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,140
Xuan Pei, come here.

348
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,100
Come here, I'll take a picture for you.

349
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,460
The 21st century is really fun.

350
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,860
The competition is over tomorrow.

351
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,900
I don't want to go back.

352
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,220
Is Jiuhou not good?

353
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,900
Of course it's good.

354
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,900
But the 21st century

355
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,060
is more fresh and interesting.

356
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,020
Then which one do you like the most?

357
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,620
I like it the most.

358
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,500
I like Xuan Pei

359
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
wherever he is.

360
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,460
Since you like the 21st century so much,

361
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,580
I'll let you come to the 21st century

362
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,980
when you're on your night shift.

363
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,300
No.

364
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,500
I don't want to go to your back door.

365
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,140
I want to be like others.

366
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,780
I want to have the opportunity

367
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,740
to get a job.

368
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,860
Is my job okay?

369
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,540
At least I can hire an ordinary person.

370
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,380
If I know my chance to change the world,

371
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,780
what's the point of fighting?

372
00:16:48,100 --> 00:17:14,580
Correct.

373
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580
So sudden.

374
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,660
Thanks.

375
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,060
to have a good cultivation.

376
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,980
It's a goal to know my own career.

377
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,660
Some souls want to cultivate into the second generation.

378
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,380
Some souls want to become the emperor.

379
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,140
And some souls want to become masters.

380
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,380
And some souls

381
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,900
want to cultivate a beautiful face for themselves.

382
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,980
But I don't want any of these.

383
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,180
Actually,

384
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,580
I don't know what I want.

385
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,060
The soul-closing is up to the fate.

386
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,020
Go wherever the tree goes.

387
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,180
You really don't have any wish?

388
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,100
I want

389
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,220
to let Ma Yichun come back to life.

390
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,660
Go wherever the tree goes.
