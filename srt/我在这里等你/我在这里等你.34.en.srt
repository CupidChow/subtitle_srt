00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now I've absorbed the power of the soul and the magical flag.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There's no more opponent in this world.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now you mention the jade emperor,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you don't want to die. It's too miserable!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Qingyuan, no! You'll be destroyed!

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't just watch the ghost shadow

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and destroy everything.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll destroy the world!

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The god has destroyed the tears.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll be doomed if I die!

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Xuanbei.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Xuanbei.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Xuanbei.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xuanbei.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I've erased all his memories about me.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll use all my power to defeat the ghost.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll fall into the devil's trap and become a blood demon.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Only my next husband, Zeding,

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
will be able to save me.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll be the next one to be killed.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll be the next one to be killed.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Xuanbei.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Xuanbei.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Xuanbei.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Who are you?

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why are you on the Jiuyou Mountain?

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm Xuanru.

32
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Xuanru.

33
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Xuanru.

34
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The ancient method of re-reconstructing the body

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is something that you can't do by yourself.

36
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Xuanru.

37
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Xuanru.

38
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My Lord.

39
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's going on?

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't come over.

41
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The ancient method of re-reconstructing the body.

42
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't come near me.

43
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's go.

44
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Go before you can see it.

45
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Go.

46
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
However,

47
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
not to mention the usefulness,

48
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
that'sê¸”

49
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Safeguarding the evil merit you bestowed on me

50
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
is not something you would want.

51
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If the brightness and the doubt

52
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
were not in my control then you

53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
wouldn't have knelt upon him.

54
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I must let you live.

55
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Once you die,

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the soul will be taken back to the body

57
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and passed on to me.

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You plant the soul

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
just for today?

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How can I let you be a demon again?

61
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A demon?

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
4,000 years ago,

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you turned into a demon.

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I stabbed Li Jian into your heart.

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
For 4,000 years,

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I hated myself every day and night.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Forgive my selfishness.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I understand.

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Just let me live.

70
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why did you do that?

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm a demon.

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
From now on,

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm the blood demon.

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's no Xuan Pei in this world.

75
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Xuan Pei fell into the demon trap.

76
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's just in the state between Xuan Pei and the blood demon

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to come back and change.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Tong Feng has sealed the blood demon with his magic.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's not a way.

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Sooner or later,

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Xuan Pei will be completely turned into a blood demon.

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you going to kill the master?

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Only the Lord can kill the Lord.

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going to kill the master.

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're still here?

86
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The blood demon in Xuan Pei's body

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
has been sealed by you temporarily.

88
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But Tong Feng,

89
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
what are you going to do next?

90
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you really going to let history repeat itself?

91
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We were born to be gods.

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is our destiny.

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Although we don't know why the Lord

94
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
chose us to carry the world and the world,

95
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
since you're in charge of the shoulder,

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you have to take responsibility.

97
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can you really kill Xuan Pei?

98
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I lost my sister 4,000 years ago.

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you want my sister and my husband to lose them together?

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Jun Wei,

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
don't think I don't know what you're up to.

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If Xuan Pei dies, you'll be the only one to blame.

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Destiny

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
can't be violated.

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you can change destiny at will,

106
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what is it called?

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What did you mean by that?

108
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What do you mean by that?

109
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you going to kill the Lord?

110
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Ming Xiang,

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it's none of your business.

112
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Lord gave up his life and everything for you.

113
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How can you be so selfish?

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Even if the Lord becomes a blood demon,

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
what's the point?

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's for saving you.

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He wants to kill the Lord.

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Just like 4,000 years ago,

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the Lord killed him.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't believe

121
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Tong Feng would do that.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But look at him.

123
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Does he look like he's going to save the Lord?

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Once the Lord dies,

125
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
he can go back to the Nether World and continue to be his husband.

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Tong Feng is my good student.

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I know his character best.

128
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He will never be that kind of person.

129
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Tong Feng.

130
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Tong Feng.

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Tong Feng.

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tong Feng.

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Tong Feng.

134
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Tong Feng.

135
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Tong Feng.

136
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Tong Feng.

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tong Feng.

138
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Tong Feng.

139
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Tong Feng.

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Tong Feng.

141
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Tong Feng.

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Tong Feng.

143
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Tong Feng.

144
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Tong Feng.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Tong Feng.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Tong Feng.

147
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tong Feng.

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Tong Feng.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Tong Feng.

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Tong Feng.

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tong Feng.

152
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Tong Feng.

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Tong Feng.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Tong Feng.

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Tong Feng.

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Tong Feng.

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tong Feng.

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Tong Feng.

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Tong Feng.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Tang Feng.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Tong Feng.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Tong Feng.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Tong Feng.

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Tong Feng.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tong Feng.

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Tong Feng.

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Tong Feng.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Tong Feng.

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Tong Feng.

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tong Feng.

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Tong Feng.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Tong Feng.

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Tong Feng.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Tong Feng.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Tong Feng.

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tong Feng.

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Tong Feng.

178
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Tong Feng.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Tong Feng.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Tong Feng.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Tong Feng.

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
Can't we break the destiny

183
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,080
of four thousand years ago?

184
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
Will the thing that happened four thousand years ago

185
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,800
happen again?

186
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,240
What destiny is this?

187
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
It's clearly a curse.

188
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Only the Lord of the Deceased

189
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,920
can kill the Lord of the Deceased.

190
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,920
***

191
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,720
How dare a broken soul

192
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,080
to go against me?

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
your guidance...

194
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,420
...tell my story to you Dashe

195
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
can you tell me

196
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
a secret of the Ministry of Justice?

197
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,220
I've already told you

198
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,740
everything about my Mother

199
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,540
she will tell me

200
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,980
The money, bring it

201
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
My miracle?

202
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Let's go to the bar and see the night-blooming flowers, okay?

203
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,980
The owner of Gu Yunqiao told me that the flowers in the garden are in pairs.

204
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
So I bought two.

205
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Xuan Pei, I will be responsible for you.

206
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,980
I hope that we can meet each other in the years to come.

207
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
I like Xuan Pei.

208
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Miss Zhang, would you like to be husband and wife with Mr. Li under the witness of God?

209
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
From now on to forever.

210
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
I do.

211
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
No!

212
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
I will do it.

214
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,380
Don't be sad.

215
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,980
I have no regrets.

216
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,180
Meeting you

217
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,180
is the greatest happiness in my life.

218
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Moreover,

219
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,820

220
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,060
We love each other.

221
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,100
This is heaven and earth.

222
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,780
It's our greatest grace.

223
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,020
God bless you.
