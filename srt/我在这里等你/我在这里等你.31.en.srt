1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,240
So you woke me up

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
to let me

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,480
use the method of re-repeating the body

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,280
to re-repeat the cultivation.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,880
That's right.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Only in this way

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,600
can you live.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,680
The three thousand lives of the soul-suppressing spirit

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,280
can only last for a thousand years.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,840
The life of an immortal

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,760
is like a beast in the sky.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,440
Is it a good thing

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,280
to live for a long time?

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,240
A long life

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,720
is a long and lonely life.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,120
We have the chance to control the mortal.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,280
But I have never had a reincarnation.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,280
I want to

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,440
live their lives

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,720
like mortals.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,920
Meet again,

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,680
meet again,

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,520
part again,

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,680
and meet again.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,160
Xuan Pei,

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,360
how about this?

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
I ask

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,680
that if this is supposed to be a love-struck relationship,

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,680
why did

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,400
you notice it together.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,880
You made this?

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,440
That's right.

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,880
I have been learning

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
aunt's cooking from Xiao Mengzi.

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,840
I have greateko ISHHF,

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,420
and I'm Zaphrin.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,440
I will be fine.

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,520
It's not as delicious as yours

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,840
but it smellsеб fantastic.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Your face is like a face.

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,080
I hold your hand and hold your hand.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,800
My heart is filled with love.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,960
How is it? Is it good?

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,440
It can't be.

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,680
I can't stop thinking about you.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,480
It's delicious.

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,080
How dare you tease me?

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll eat it all up.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
The moon is endless.

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
The phoenix is flying.

53
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,720
Actually, eating is not a difficult thing for me.

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
But you are very shy.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Would you like to have a meal with me?

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
Sure.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
My heart is broken.

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,920
I drink with you.

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,640
Why do you laugh?

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,360
The moon is with you.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,960
The phoenix is flying.

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
If you have a chance,

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,320
let's go together.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,600
The moon is endless.

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,440
The phoenix is flying.

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,640
The phoenix is flying.

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,120
The phoenix is flying.

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,200
May you have a long life.

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
May you have a long life.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,040
The heaven and earth sent me a message.

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,360
They want to see you tomorrow.

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,760
I see.

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,320
Xuan Pei.

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
Why are you here?

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm making breakfast for my kitten.

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
I thought you...

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
You thought what happened to me?

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know why.

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,280
I've been distracted recently.

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,280
I always think you will disappear.

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Silly girl.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
You are so silly.

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm not silly.

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm just a cat.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm not silly.

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I'm not silly.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
I'm not silly.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
I'm not silly.

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm not silly.

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Silly girl.

91
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm right here.

92
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
You...

93
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,760
You won't disappear suddenly, right?

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Disappear?

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Where can I go?

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
You sleep so soundly.

97
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
When you were a cat,

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,720
you woke up as soon as I made a move.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,240
Now you are an immortal.

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
You are not as alert as when you were a cat.

101
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Xuan Pei.

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Lian Hua is looking for me.

103
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
You go with me.

104
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,440
What is he looking for you?

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I guess...

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
It's about the Ghost Camp.

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,200
You know about the Ghost Camp?

108
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I know.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,920
I not only know about the Ghost Camp,

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
but I also know something else.

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
What else do you know?

112
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
I also know that Lian Hua has abolished

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
the rule that the three realms can't interact with each other.

114
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,760
You went to the Heaven Realm to find Lian Hua.

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
What else did he tell you?

116
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
He didn't tell you about the rules, right?

117
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Of course not.

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,520
I gave him our wedding invitation.

119
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,760
Our wedding date is coming soon.

120
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
You are still thinking about my disappearance?

121
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Yes.

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,280
Our wedding date is coming soon.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Xuan Pei.

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Will you...

125
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
will you stay with me

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
for a long time

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
and forever?

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Yes.

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
For a long time and forever.

130
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Forever.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Xuan Pei.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,480
There is a night market in Jiuhou today.

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Let's go there.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

135
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Xuan Pei.

136
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,800
You have managed Jiuhou very well these years.

137
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
What did Jiuhou look like before you left?

138
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
What does it look like now?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If you say it's well managed,

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
it's all your credit.

141
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
I was a good player back then.

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,920
Jiuhou is not as prosperous as it is now.

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Wish Tree?

144
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
It's a wish tree.

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,200
This tree is a symbol of the ritual in the mortal world.

146
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
The mortal world will tie a red ribbon

147
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
to ask for marriage.

148
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,400
In Jiuhou, apart from marriage,

149
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,800
you can also make other wishes.

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Some people hope that there will be a high-ranking official in the next life.

151
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,720
Some people hope to have a great reputation.

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,120
Some people hope to make another wish with their previous life family.

153
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I want to make a wish.

154
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
What wish do you have?

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Wish, wish.

156
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
It's not going to work if I say it.

157
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Wait for me here.

158
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm going to make a wish.

159
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Let's go.

160
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
You really won't tell me what wish you made?

161
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
I will.

162
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'll wait for you here.

163
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You're not going to tell me anything else?

164
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I'm going to make a wish.

165
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Okay.

166
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
I'll wait for you here.

167
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I'll wait for you here.

168
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I'll wait for you here.

169
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I'll wait for you here.

170
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I won't tell you.

171
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Let's go.

172
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I want to be with Xuanpei forever.

173
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Mingxiao, do you think you can really keep Xuanpei's life

174
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
after killing those three thousand souls?

175
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
What do you mean?

176
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Every time there is a soul killing,

177
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Xuanpei will be temporarily out of control.

178
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Have you ever thought about what's hidden in it?

179
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
You are the Lord of the Nine Devils.

180
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
It's closely related to the Nine Devils.

181
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
The Nine Devils have changed.

182
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
It should have a reaction.

183
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I am also the Lord of the Nine Devils.

184
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Why can't I?

185
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Why?

186
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Mingxiao, you were deceived by Xuanpei.

187
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Since you said you were going to restore the physical ability,

188
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
I realized something was wrong.

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
The three thousand souls you killed

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
were all sleeping in the cat's body.

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Xuanpei didn't know he would die.

192
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
On the contrary,

193
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
he knew that the method of restoring the physical ability

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
would bring the death of the cat.

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
He divided the souls into five people.

196
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Gouhu, Duomi, Niubaba, and Ma Yichun.

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
They were all separated according to my thoughts.

198
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Only you created them according to his thoughts.

199
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
The so-called killing of three thousand souls

200
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
is not really killing.

201
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Instead, you protected them.

202
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Because the souls in the soul-gathering forest

203
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
are not in the cultivation.

204
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
They will be separated sooner or later

205
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
in the world of the Nine Devils.

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
You were following his instructions

207
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
and led you to find that book in the Five-character Building.

208
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,720
On the surface, you killed these souls.

209
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
In fact,

210
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
it was sealed into the cat's body.

211
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
It was sleeping.

212
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
But every time you killed it,

213
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Xuanpei would separate some of its spiritual power

214
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
to seal those souls.

215
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
It would lose its power every time.

216
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Xuanpei.

217
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
You did this

218
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
not to kill it,

219
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
but to kill it.

220
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Impossible.

221
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
This is absolutely impossible.

222
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
You are a soul-gathering soul.

223
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
It is impossible to get another soul-gathering soul.

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
This cat

225
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,720
was the place where the souls of Xuanpei were created.

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
It was put into your body

227
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
and you took it out.

228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
What about Ma Yichun?

229
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Ma Yichun is really dead.

230
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
She was killed by Dr. Ma's order.

231
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
You five were separated souls

232
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
because you are adults.

233
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Only Ma Yichun was a child.

234
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Because when Xuanpei was separating the souls,

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
the souls were not enough.

236
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
When you killed Ma Yichun,

237
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Ma Yichun was about to lose her soul.

238
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Xuanpei needed to put Ma Yichun's soul

239
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
into this cat's body.

240
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Impossible.

241
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
This is absolutely impossible.

242
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I have already sensed

243
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Ma Yichun's soul in the cat's body.

244
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
You have to believe it.

245
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
What I did

246
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
was just to speed up the death of Master.

247
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Mingxiang,

248
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
since you were born,

249
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Xuanpei has put the order

250
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
into your consciousness.

251
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Three thousand souls

252
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
are only me.

253
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I think

254
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
it should be his craft.

255
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
What should I do?

256
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Now

257
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
you have taken all the souls

258
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
of the Soul-gathering Forest.

259
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Now you have absorbed a lot of souls.

260
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Xuanpei cannot be reconciled.

261
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Master.

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Xuanpei is fine now.

263
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I have sealed

264
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
all the souls

265
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
in the cat's body.

266
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
But when I did it today,

267
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I think he has also realized

268
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
that I have known it all.

269
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I didn't expect

270
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
the four of us

271
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
could drink tea together like this.

272
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
It's been four thousand years.

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
I can't even dream of it.

274
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Junwei,

275
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
you go first.

276
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Guiyin,

277
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
four thousand years ago,

278
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
you made a big mistake

279
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
and killed the soul of the Soul-gathering Forest.

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
The Three Realms saw you as a thorn in their side

281
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
to protect your life.

282
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I made such a mistake.

283
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
That's right.

284
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I turned you from a male to a female.

285
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
I sealed your memory

286
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
and hid it for four thousand years.

287
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I really had no other choice.

288
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
I think

289
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
you must have lost your mind.

290
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
I think

291
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
you must have lost your mind

292
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
and wanted to give you a chance to change your mind.

293
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
I really didn't expect

294
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Junwei to hide it.

295
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
But you did make a big mistake.

296
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Four thousand years is already a clear punishment.

297
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
After the war,

298
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
I saw your goddess in the Three Realms.

299
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I knew that was Tong Feng.

300
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
I brought you back to the Nine Demons

301
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
and gave you the Wangchuan Soup Shop.

302
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I just hope you can revive your life.

303
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Little Mengzi,

304
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
if you blame me for what happened that year,

305
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
I have no complaints.

306
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
But,

307
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
whether it's Junwei,

308
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
or Guiyin,

309
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Tong Feng,

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
or Meng Dihua,

311
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
the relationship is real.

312
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Actually, after I recovered my memory,

313
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I didn't mean to blame you.

314
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
I know you did that

315
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
to save my life.

316
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
I just can't accept

317
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
that I hurt you so much that year

318
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
and caused you to die for four thousand years.

319
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
I caused the Three Realms to be in chaos.

320
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
I caused Xuanpei

321
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
to be alone for so long.

322
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Alright.

323
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Let bygones be bygones.

324
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
When I knocked you out,

325
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I had let go of your life.

326
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
There were too many things that happened that year.

327
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
You don't have to mention it again.

328
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Are we

329
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
really safe now?

330
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
No.

331
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I'm here.

332
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
No one will be in danger.

333
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
You're still like a sister.

334
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
It's been four thousand years.

335
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
You're still like this.

336
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Alright.

337
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
The military is about to start.

338
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
We have to get ready.

339
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Since the first king is here,

340
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
we can't lose our face

341
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
and let the young people see

342
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
our glory.

343
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Si Mo Xuanpei became the Lord of Demon's Mansion.

344
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
It's not interesting to make fun of us.

345
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
It's the most perfect ending

346
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
for Si Mo and I to get to know each other.

347
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
When your wedding with Xuanpei ends,

348
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Si Mo and I are going to leave the Nether World.

349
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
It's time to go back to the Demon Realm.

350
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
We're going back so soon.

351
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
I can't stay in the Nether World anymore.

352
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
I didn't have any memories before.

353
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Now that I have recovered my memories,

354
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I know that I'm the Lord of Demon Realm.

355
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
I have to go back.

356
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
This is the destiny

357
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
that exists in my blood.

358
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Do you want to recover your body?

359
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
I have to think about this question.

360
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Tong Feng.

361
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Four thousand years ago, I made a big mistake.

362
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You and Xuanpei lost each other

363
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
over and over again.

364
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
The origin of the ten thousand-year-old incident

365
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
is because of me.

366
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Everything has passed.

367
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Don't take it to heart.

368
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
You, me, and Lian Hua,

369
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
how many tens of thousands of years have we been together?

370
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
How come in these ten thousand years,

371
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
we've been living like a novel

372
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
and falling into a trap?

373
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
The fate of mortals is up to you.

374
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Then who is

375
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
arranging our lives?

376
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
We are

377
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
from the Heavenly Emperor.

378
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Enjoying the monologue of peace with Tianqi,

379
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
no matter who arranged us,

380
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
it's the best arrangement.

381
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I wish you all the best.

382
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Tong Feng.

383
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
There's one thing

384
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I've been meaning to tell you.

385
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
What is it?

386
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
The light of the night

387
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,720
will always shine for you

388
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,720
The wind blows the night away

389
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
The night is still young

390
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,720
The night is still young

391
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
The parting is short

392
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
The fate is short

393
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,720
How can I exchange for your thoughts?

394
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
The three lifetimes

395
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
The fireworks

396
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
are so bright
