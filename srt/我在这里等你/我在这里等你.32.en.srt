00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everyone thinks I like Xuan Pei.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But actually I...

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I always think I am waiting for someone.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But I can't remember who it is.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Sir, are you waiting for someone too?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am waiting for someone to come back.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will wait for you.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am waiting for you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am waiting for you.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am waiting for you.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I am waiting for you.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am waiting for someone to come back.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will never forget

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that he never returned.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How long has he left?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He has left for more than a thousand years.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But I will always remember

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that he was the first one to leave the heaven and earth.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He told me that

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
he would come back for me.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A person who has left for a thousand years.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How long will you wait for him?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The old ground is in full bloom.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sun is setting.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will wait for him to come back.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will wait for you.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tonghua, Tonghua.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hurry up.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Drink the soup.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hurry up.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In my heart,

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
a man and a woman's love

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is not as good as a sister's love.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Everyone has wronged me.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't like Xuanpei.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Except you,

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
who would like that blind tiger?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Shenmei is providing.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Si Mo.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Tong Feng.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
For you, actually, I...

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I have long wanted to let go.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But if Xuanpei dares to bully you,

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will definitely not let him go.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My brother and I...

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My sister.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We are all

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
from the same family.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm here.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They didn't stop you.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I wanted to see you.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who dares to stop me?

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are still so domineering.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why did you have to let me come

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
before the wedding night?

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Didn't you say you wanted to see

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
what you look like

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in the film?

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is...

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mr. Li.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm here.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Miss Zhang.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Would you like to

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
marry Miss Zhang

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
under the guidance of God

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
from now on

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
whether it's a smooth life or a bad life,

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
rich or poor,

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
healthy or ill,

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
happy or sad?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You will love Miss Zhang forever

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
until death

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
separates you.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I do.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Miss Zhang.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Would you like to

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
marry Mr. Li

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
under the guidance of God

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
from now on

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
whether it's a smooth life or a bad life,

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
rich or poor,

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
healthy or ill,

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
happy or sad?

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You will love Mr. Li forever

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
until death

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
separates you.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I do.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You brought this film

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
back from the Republic.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will give you

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
whatever you want.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The sun, the moon,

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the mountains, the rivers, the lakes, the seas.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will see you

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in your dreams.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My dear bride.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why haven't you

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
brought the crown?

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The groom's sedan chair

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
is coming.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My lord.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Luoluo.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why is the procession so slow?

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The bride is waiting for her husband.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm afraid the adults will be anxious.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The bride is here.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The bride is here.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's time.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Get up.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Come on.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Come on.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Come on.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Come on.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Come on.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come on.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Come on.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Come on.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Come on.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Come on.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come on.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Come on.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come on.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Come on.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Come on.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come on.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Come on.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Come on.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Come on.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Come on.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Come on.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Come on.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Come on.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Come on.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Come on.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Come on.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What are you doing, Xuannan?

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Call the groom.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The bride is here.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The bride is here.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The bride is here.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Come on.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Come on.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come on.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Come on.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come on.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What are you doing?

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thank you, thank you.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come on.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Come on.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Come on.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Come on.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come on.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come on.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240

I'm sorry.

179
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm sorry.

181

I'm sorry.

182
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840

I'm sorry.

199
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,160
Are you okay?

202
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,200
It's time

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,440
to worship.

204
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,160
Who else can Circle?

205
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,180
Stop you nervous face,

206
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
who else can feel,

207
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,340
bad eyed worry for you.

208
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,560
The sky and the moon are the most beautiful moments.

209
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,720
The second bow is up.

210
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,600
How many years have passed since we last met?

211
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,560
We are destined to meet again.

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
The fifth and seventh bows.

213
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,120
I will never forget.

214
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,960
The sky and the moon are the most beautiful moments.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
How many years have passed since we last met?

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,680
We are destined to meet again.

217
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,640
I will never forget.

218
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,280
Send her to the east.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,160
How can you go to the east so early?

220
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,800
You are so thoughtless.

221
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,520
That's right.

222
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,160
Xue Pei.

223
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,400
You made me fall today.

224
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,720
Don't think about the East Hall.

225
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,400
That's right.

226
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,200
Tell us the rules of the game.

227
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,120
Mr. Meng will ask questions

228
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,880
about your love experiences.

229
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
You write down your answers on the whiteboard.

230
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
We want to see

231
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,280
how the husband and wife get along.

232
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Don't I know Xue Pei?

233
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
Give me the horse.

234
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,920
Listen carefully.

235
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,840
The first question.

236
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,960
When did you first meet?

237
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,400
Where did you meet?

238
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,520
Please answer.

239
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,160
Your answers are different.

240
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,080
Why did you write down the first question?

241
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,080
They don't know each other.

242
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,320
I remember

243
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
you followed me on a few streets in Yuancang Mountain.

244
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,280
I had no choice

245
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
but to pick you up.

246
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
Of course not.

247
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,440
It was 64,100 years ago

248
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
that I met you by the Three-Long River.

249
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,560
I followed you for 100 years

250
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,640
before you found me.

251
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,560
I was followed by a black cat

252
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
for 100 years?

253
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
You really don't know

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,720
that I followed you for 100 years?

255
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,160
You should solve your family conflicts

256
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,800
when you're in the East Hall.

257
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,080
Xue Pei, you get 20 points first.

258
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,280
Here's a friendly reminder.

259
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
You must drink a cup of wine

260
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,880
every time you get a point.

261
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
You didn't want us to be in the East Hall

262
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
in the first place, right?

263
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,760
You're the Lord of the Nine Oceans.

264
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
You're the Lord of the Nine Oceans.

265
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,040
You can't even move your house

266
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
if you don't drink a few cups of wine.

267
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,400
Xue Pei,

268
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
your wife didn't allow you to drink, right?

269
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,360
In my family,

270
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,240
my wife is the one who decides.

271
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,120
I don't have to worry about her.

272
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,840
What's going on?

273
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,480
You're talking about a secret.

274
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,200
All right.

275
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,760
Xue Pei, let's drink first.

276
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,040
Let's go.

277
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
You two don't have enough understanding.

278
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,720
After the decision of the East Hall Group,

279
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,800
we've decided to

280
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,640
ask in another way.

281
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
What way?

282
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
Don't worry, sister.

283
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,920
Then,

284
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
do you have anything

285
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
that you can't tolerate?

286
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
We're not drinking anymore.

287
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,760
We should destroy their relationship.

288
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,520
That's right.

289
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,360
You're so mean.

290
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
You're so mean.

291
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,880
You're so mean.

292
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
You're so mean.

293
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
You're so mean.

294
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
You're so mean.

295
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
You're so mean.

296
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
You're so mean.

297
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
You're so mean.

298
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
You're so mean.

299
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
You...

300
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,960
Xue Pei is so slow.

301
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
He likes Tong Feng.

302
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,880
He doesn't know how to confess.

303
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,160
Tong Feng confessed first.

304
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,000
You...

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,280
You don't know my deep feelings

306
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
and beauty.

307
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,400
This...

308
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What does it mean?

309
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,360
What you mean is

310
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,920
he thinks you're a monkey

311
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,480
and he thinks you're not a monkey.

312
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,760
Are you satisfied with

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
your answer?

314
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,400
No.

315
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
No.

316
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
If you're not satisfied,

317
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,280
you still have to drink.

318
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
Sir, please.

319
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Drink.

320
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,400
You're bullying my man.

321
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,160
Little cat,

322
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
I'll drink for you.

323
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Thank you, sister.

324
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,240
Is...

325
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,960
Is this a man?

326
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Yes.

327
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:57,760
발

328
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
That was the last question.

329
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,240
When did the two of you

330
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,800
like each other?

331
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,640
No, I haven't finished my question.

332
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
She hasn't answered.

333
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,440
That's all?

334
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,840
Yes.

335
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,640
Okay.

336
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,240
The sky is dark.

337
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,760
The blackboard is beside me.

338
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
My heart is like the wind.

339
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,960
I love your face.

340
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,520
The fish and the dragonfly are holding hands.

341
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,200
The road ahead is deep.

342
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,280
The fish and the dragonfly are holding hands.

343
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,360
They are talking about love.

344
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,840
The moon is always the same.

345
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,240
The phoenix is flying.

346
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,200
I...

347
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,720
I have no time.

348
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,920
I can't forget this moment.

349
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,160
I want to be with you forever.

350
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,760
Is it that hard?

351
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,960
The fish and the dragonfly are holding hands.

352
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,760
The phoenix is flying.

353
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,080
The phoenix is flying.

354
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,360
After that, the military command sent all the forces of the army.

355
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,560
The military command is the same as the phoenix.

356
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,880
You know that?

357
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
So the dream flower,

358
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,040
you became the dream flower now.

359
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,560
The phoenix protected me.

360
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
That's why I became like this.

361
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,200
I just want to know

362
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,640
why

363
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,240
only Xuan Pei can kill the phoenix after he was murdered.

364
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,360
Only the army

365
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,800
can kill the army.

366
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,200
scorpions

367
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,480
The young boy was come by.

368
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,080
We never read this story.

369
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Reren,

370
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
Start following her.

371
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,880
Ad gevus.

372
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,880
You've been screened with too much energy

373
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,680
I can't stand it anyway.

374
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,100
You will find your balance

375
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,580
after a break.

376
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,480
I felt your power

377
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,400
when Ming Xiang went to

378
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,820
the voracious soul forest a couple of days ago.

379
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
I felt your spiritual power.

380
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,420
I think you already know that the cultivation of the mirror is a fake.

381
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,420
And Mingxiang, you've finally got the truth, right?

382
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,420
4,000 years ago, I became a blood demon

383
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,620
and destroyed the mortal world.

384
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,020
All the souls were buried in the Nether World.

385
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,620
The Nether World can't bear so many souls.

386
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,420
And these souls have the ability to disperse after staying in the Nether World for half a year.

387
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,020
So you created the fake cultivation mirror

388
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,820
and let them sleep in the cultivation mirror.

389
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,220
This way, the Nether World can continue to operate

390
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,220
and these souls won't be disperse.

391
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,420
Xuanmei, I have a question.

392
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,020
What was the place we went to before?

393
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,420
The fate is uncertain.

394
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,620
How can I exchange my thoughts?

395
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,620
What is the meaning of life?

396
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,420
The fireworks are burning.

397
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:10,420
The moon shines in the wind.

398
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,420
The Long Ballad

399
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
