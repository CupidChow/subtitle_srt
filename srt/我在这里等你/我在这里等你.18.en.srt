1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 2

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Meng Dihua!

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Meng Dihua!

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Oh no, the competition is about to start.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Where did Meng Dihua go?

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Meng Dihua!

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Tong Feng, Tong Feng, hurry up!

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Drink the soup, hurry up!

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Yuzhi's team has been scoring points by deducting the points.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Tong Feng has to find her own pace.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
What's going on?

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
I suddenly want to sleep.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
The second round of competition has already started.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Oh no, oh no.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:13,000
the final round's opener

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Tong Feng's state seemed to be jaką noch.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
But it's completely해서

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
What happened?

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,980
Madam, where are you going?

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,860
Let me have a good meal.

23
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,380
Let me drink some.

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,260
Bad omen.

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,260
What, what happened?

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,280
Z

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,380
Z

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,480
is blind but is a man of his own with the position of MP

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,740
He is just a initiation

30
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,180
You shouldn't worry too much

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,500
This is my personal issue

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,360
Don't set our eyes on it

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,360
The competition is between the Nine-Demon and the Demon Realm.

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,960
The Heaven and Earth are not alone.

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,560
They are also in love.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,160
How could I be defeated by a small rain ball?

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,960
Something's wrong with this ball.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,960
The rain ball is from my tribe.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
Of course, I'm good at it.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,360
How could you tell who's the winner?

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
You're the winner.

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,960
Come on.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
You can do it.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,760
No matter what you do to this rain ball,

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,360
I won't give up.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,160
What's going on?

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Did the rain ball make a fool of me?

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
If the rain ball makes a fool of me,

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
I'll...

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,560
I'll smash it with this sugar spoon.

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,160
I'm so worried about Tong Feng.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,360
You're indeed Tong Feng from the Nine-Demon Realm.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Come on. Hold on.

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,760
Tong Feng, you're the winner.

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,160
You're the winner.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Tong Feng, you're the winner.

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Tong Feng, hold on.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Tong Feng is in a rush.

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
The gap between the scores is getting smaller.

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,360
It's 17 to 20.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
It's time for the competition.

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,360
Yuchi is leading the game.

63
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Tong Feng is much behind Princess Yuchi.

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,560
Is Tong Feng and Yisao having a fight?

65
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,160
Or is it a miracle

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,960
that Tong Feng lost to Princess Yuchi?

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,760
Who is the real winner?

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,160
Who yours?

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,760
Tell me.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,560
Whose heart Hond songs will sound when Tong Feng顆❤

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,960
Jin listening to the handled melody will win.

72
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,160
Where is Princess Yuzhi?

73
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,360
The competition is coming soon.

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
You almost lost.

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,840
You'd better admit defeat now.

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
You don't look so bad.

77
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,560
I've been doing the nine-oil explosion for 3,000 years.

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Finally, I have a chance to turn the tables.

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,960
I won't give up.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,760
Come on!

81
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:31,800
The

82
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Please.

83
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,960
It's getting more and more interesting.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
The nine-oil army went down to the battlefield.

85
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,560
Do you think something is wrong?

86
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,160
Tang Erhuang used the magic of the Demon Realm to hurt people

87
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,960
and killed them all.

88
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
That's right.

89
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I don't understand what you're talking about.

90
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,360
The nine-oil army will never allow you to win.

91
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,760
The feather on the rain ball is from the rain feather of the rain tribe.

92
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,160
The rain tribe can use magic that the other world can't see.

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,360
You just turned the rain ball into a cold knife.

94
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,160
The magic on it hasn't been used yet.

95
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
If you don't believe me,

96
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
you can find the person from the rain tribe.

97
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Now the army has been heated up to the point

98
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
that our wise and wise father-in-law

99
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,560
and Demon Lord are fighting.

100
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,160
It's Wei Hongyan who is angry.

101
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,360
Princess Demon Realm's cheating is not true.

102
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,360
If it's true,

103
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,360
then Princess Yuzhi's behavior is a little despicable.

104
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
I told you.

105
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
That Yuzhi must have played tricks on us.

106
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
You're a bad guy.

107
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,560
It's okay.

108
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,360
It's okay.

109
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,360
Okay.

110
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
I think Princess Demon Realm is eager to win.

111
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
It's a little girl's heart.

112
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,760
It's not intentional.

113
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,760
How about playing a match between a man and a woman?

114
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,760
It seems that the husband is going to be a partner of Tong Feng.

115
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,560
If the husband and the princess fight,

116
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,560
it's inevitable that the two will be in danger.

117
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,360
How about the Demon Lord and the princess team up?

118
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,960
This match will show the power of the king.

119
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,160
Let's go.

120
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,160
Go.

121
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,160
The last match.

122
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm your teammate.

123
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,760
But I'm afraid of dragging you down.

124
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
It's your match anyway.

125
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
There's nothing to drag you down.

126
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,160
Sit here first.

127
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,360
How's the wound?

128
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
Are you okay, Tong Feng?

129
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Tong Feng.

130
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
It's just a small wound.

131
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Are you feeling better?

132
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
You don't need to get hurt anymore.

133
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,360
Just now,

134
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,960
I used some tricks on the princess.

135
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
Please don't mind it.

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,160
Why does the Demon Lord look like Si Mo?

137
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
You killed my husband.

138
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
Do you think you can solve it with a bottle of water?

139
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm just concerned about Tong Feng.

140
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
I won't allow it.

141
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,360
Wu Jun.

142
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
If the Demon Lord makes a mistake,

143
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,160
he will definitely give the police an explanation.

144
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
But this match,

145
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,160
is between me and my husband.

146
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,760
I must win.

147
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,560
Demon Lord.

148
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Before the match starts,

149
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,760
you'd better be careful.

150
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,960
Wu Jun.

151
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,360
Please.

152
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
After Tong Feng's teammate got hurt,

153
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,560
both sides switched to the other team.

154
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
The match starts.

155
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
The Demon Lord has won.

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,160
Good job.

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Congratulations.

158
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,760
Look at this beautiful muscle line.

159
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Look at the beautiful face of the other women.

160
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
Look at this unparalleled bounce.

161
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,360
Look at this handsome and attractive movement.

162
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
The cat and strength are together.

163
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
The most powerful idol group.

164
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
The most handsome and powerful group.

165
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,360
Tong Feng's team has regained its state.

166
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
The Demon Lord's strength is not to be underestimated.

167
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,560
It's hard to tell

168
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
between the Demon Lord and the Lord of the Deceased.

169
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
This match

170
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,560
is not only the match between Tong Feng

171
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,960
and the Demon Princess.

172
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,160
There are also battles

173
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
between the Demon Realm and the Nine Devils.

174
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,160
Lord of the Deceased, fighting!

175
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Tong Feng, fighting!

176
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Tong Feng!

177
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,560
Both sides are leading in the contrast.

178
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
It feels like a breath is coming to the end.

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,160
Great!

180
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
It's really great!

181
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
It's really the match

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
between Lord of the Deceased and the Demon Lord.

183
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,960
The pace is fast and scary.

184
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
Who will be the last winner?

185
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,960
We'll see.

186
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
We'll see.

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,960
Great!

188
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
It's really great!

189
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,760
29 to 29.

190
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,960
The score is even again.

191
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
It's really the match between Lord of the Deceased and the Demon Lord.

192
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,560
It's really great!

193
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,560
The strength of the White Flower

194
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,360
is beyond imagination.

195
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,960
The match is over.

196
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,160
The Nine Devils have won.

197
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
We won!

198
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,960
It's great!

199
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
It's great!

200
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
This match is great!

201
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
In the final three points,

202
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
the winner is

203
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,360
the match between Lord of the Deceased and the Demon Lord.

204
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
This is the match

205
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,360
that can be included in the history of the Winged Star.

206
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,960
I feel like I'm going to cry.

207
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,560
It's really not easy

208
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,360
for Tong Feng to come this far.

209
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
The three-tier talent competition

210
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,160
has started.

211
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,960
The champion of the first round

212
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,160
is our Tong Feng.

213
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
This is the feeling

214
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,760
of having a daughter.

215
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,560
Tong Feng doesn't want to be a daughter.

216
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,560
It's funny.

217
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,760
We all know

218
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,960
Tong Feng is the most uneducated student in the Nine Devils.

219
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
Today,

220
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,960
he has changed his mind and is back to the past.

221
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,760
Let's give him a big hand

222
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
and wish him a long-lasting success.

223
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,560
His success will tell us

224
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,360
that if you work hard, you will create a bright future.

225
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
The flag is raised.

226
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,560
All right.

227
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
The ceremony has been completed.

228
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,560
I think everyone is curious about

229
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,760
the prize of the champion.

230
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,360
Now,

231
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,160
I'll give the award

232
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
to the champion of the first round.

233
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
The prize of the dream lottery.

234
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,360
Now,

235
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
let's welcome Tong Feng, the champion of the first round,

236
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,560
to give the award.

237
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,560
Thank you.

238
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,960
Thank you,

239
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
organizer.

240
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,760
Thank you, judge.

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,560
The champion of the first round.

242
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
When you get the award,

243
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,360
don't look at the hand-written note.

244
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
Actually,

245
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
I read that part

246
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,560
online.

247
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,760
I

248
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,360
am a person

249
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,560
who has never won the prize.

250
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,160
So I don't know

251
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,960
how to say the award.

252
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,160
But if I want to thank someone,

253
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I want to thank someone.

254
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,160
He has been with me for three thousand years

255
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,160
and taught me magic and principles.

256
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
He also cooked for me every day.

257
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,560
When I was in a mess,

258
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
he always looked after me.

259
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,560
Later,

260
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
I practiced hard

261
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
and he encouraged me to study.

262
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I used to think

263
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,160
if everyone

264
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
was as lucky as me.

265
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Later, I found

266
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
my luck

267
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
is like

268
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,360
a lottery ticket.

269
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,560
It's rare and scary.

270
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
It's so lucky.

271
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Thank you.

272
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,360
You have been with me

273
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
for so many years.

274
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,160
I hope we can see each other

275
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,160
in the years to come.

276
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,560
Good.

277
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Good.

278
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,960
I'll take you to a good place.

279
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
What place?

280
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,960
You'll know when you get there.

281
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,360
You'll know when you win the prize.

282
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,560
Si Mu, are you coming back to the Demon Realm with me?

283
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,760
Not now.

284
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I have an important mission in the Nether World.

285
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,360
What mission?

286
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,160
You saw it.

287
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
That woman is obviously a matchmaker.

288
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,360
Shut up.

289
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,360
You forgot why you came here, right?

290
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,960
You're not here for that woman.

291
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,360
Why should I do this?

292
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
I don't need you to teach me.

293
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,560
I...

294
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,160
Why does it look so similar?

295
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Why?

296
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,560
Brother Tian, who are you talking about?

297
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,360
My best friend

298
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
is also the God of the World.

299
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
He is extremely kind

300
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,760
and extremely terrifying.

301
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,360
He has been through a lot.

302
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
He is called the God of War.

303
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
He is also called the Blood Demon.

304
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,760
I have dreamed of being with you in the vast wilderness.

305
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
In the vast wilderness.

306
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,160
The light is so bright.

307
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,960
My heart will forever shine for you.

308
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,360
Oh...

309
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:40,260
A

310
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,960
The Long Ballad

311
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Episode 18
