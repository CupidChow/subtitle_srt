Are youентовw

00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,300
Sweet?

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
It's been a few days.

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
And so many ideas.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
This teacher really has no patience.

18
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Tong Feng.

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Tong Feng.

20
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Someone's looking for you.

21
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
Xu Jing.

22
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,300
Xu Jing!

23
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
Miss Tong Feng.

24
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,300
I have officially got rid of the evil spirits.

25
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
I am here today to thank you.

26
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Thank me for what?

27
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
It's a small matter.

28
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Don't be too formal.

29
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
It's my pleasure.

30
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
You can come in.

31
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Thank you very much.

32
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Miss Tong Feng.

33
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,300
What are you doing?

34
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Come on, let's go.

35
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Go.

36
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,300
You can't be that way.

37
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,300
You are so rude.

38
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
You can't go this way.

39
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,300
I am not going to go this way.

40
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,300
I came to thank you today.

41
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,800
For what?

42
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
It's nothing. Don't take it to heart.

43
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,800
I have something to say to you.

44
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Something to say to me?

45
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,800
You're hiding it from me.

46
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,300
I brought you here.

47
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,800
Do you have any conscience?

48
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
What is it that you can't listen to?

49
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Ma Yichun,

50
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,800
you're a ghost. You should learn to see others' eyes.

51
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,300
I'm sorry, Ma Yichun.

52
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Ma Yichun.

53
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,300
That's more like it.

54
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,800
Please sit.

55
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,800
It's great that you can't enter the Soul Land.

56
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Before entering the Soul Land,

57
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,300
I was thinking

58
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
why I would be treated like a stranger.

59
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,300
Why would Wang Ruonian love so much other people?

60
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Wudan, Lan Xiang,

61
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
and the white-global dancers.

62
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Of course,

63
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
there's also that person he can't face.

64
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
He loves them,

65
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
but he put me in a dead end.

66
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Since he doesn't want my precious love,

67
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm not the one who's losing.

68
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,300
Because today,

69
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
I've understood one thing.

70
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
What is it?

71
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,300
Someone gave me his endless love.

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,300
In the end,

73
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
I'm the richest one.

74
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,800
Miss Tong Feng,

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,300
I'll wait for Lin Qing in the Nether World.

76
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Wait for him to tell me

77
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,300
that there's more love than anything else in this world.

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
It's great that you can think that way.

79
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,800
In life,

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,300
money and power are all just a passing cloud.

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,300
Once you enter the Nether World,

82
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
everything is empty.

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
But there's only one thing

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
that the Nether World can't take away.

85
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,800
Is it true love?

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,300
Only true love can't be taken away.

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,300
True love is a miracle.

88
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,800
If you have such a miracle,

89
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
you must tell him quickly.

90
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
My miracle?

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
That day, I almost hurt myself

92
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,300
when I fell into the Soul Land.

93
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
The white doctor beside you

94
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
used magic to push me back.

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,300
He cherished protecting you in his arms.

96
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
When he looked at your eyes,

97
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I was already in shock.

98
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Eyes?

99
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
That year, Lin Qing

100
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
looked at me like that.

101
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Miss Tong Feng,

102
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
now that I've told you all this,

103
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
can you find your own miracle?

104
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
My miracle...

105
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
is Xuan Pei.

106
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Tong Feng.

107
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Xuan Pei.

108
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
It's so late. What do you want?

109
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
My magic

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
can only draw out

112
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
this small flame.

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
But I still

114
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
want to give you this starry sky.

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Tong Feng.

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Xuan Pei,

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Xu Jing came to me today

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
and told me a lot of things.

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
He made me understand

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
one thing.

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
What?

122
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,800
He said that a person's life is short.

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
It's a miracle to be able to love someone.

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
To be able to be loved by someone

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
is the best blessing in heaven.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Xuan Pei.

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I've always been

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
immersed in the grace of heaven.

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Since I opened my eyes in Jiuyou

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
3,000 years ago,

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I have a lot of friends who love me.

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Unlike those lonely ghosts in Jiuyou,

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I am very grateful

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
to the grace of heaven.

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Xu Jing made me know

136
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
that I had already

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
obtained my miracle.

138
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
But

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
people are always greedy.

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I want to tell him

141
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
that I have obtained a miracle

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
and ask him for a

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
beautiful blessing.

144
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
You have obtained a miracle?

145
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes.

146
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Xuan Pei, I...

147
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I have always liked you

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
more than I liked the dolls,

149
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
the flowers and the play.

150
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I liked you a lot.

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I didn't understand

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
what love meant.

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
But he said that

154
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
if you love someone,

155
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
you must tell him immediately.

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Because you don't know

157
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
what will happen

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
in the next moment

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
that will ruin your life.

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Xuan Pei, I'll tell you.

161
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I'll tell you all my love.

162
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Will you accept

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
my miracle?

164
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
In the mortal world,

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
the fire and the fire of the moon

166
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
are considered miracles.

167
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
In Jiuyou,

168
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
the stars appear in the sky

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
and are considered miracles.

170
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Now,

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I'll give you

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
my miracle.

173
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
In the mortal world,

174
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
the stars appear in the sky

175
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
and are considered miracles.

176
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Now,

177
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I'll give you

178
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
my miracle.

179
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
The one who loves the most

180
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
in the mortal world

181
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
is the one who loves the most.

182
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
If I'm close to you,

183
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
the one who loves the most

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
is only you.

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
He is the one who loves the most

186
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
I'll do it.

187
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,080
In Jiuyou,

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,560
a star appears in the sky.

189
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,880
It's a miracle.

190
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,320
Now,

191
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll give you my miracle.

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,760
Who is it?

193
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,880
Tong Feng?

194
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,880
There must be something wrong between them.

195
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
What's wrong?

196
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
The ice bowl is too cold.

197
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,480
It's so cold that my finger is cold.

198
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
It hurts.

199
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Really?

200
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm drowning.

201
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Let them go.

202
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,960
Niu Mei, they...

203
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
They...

204
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,400
Slow down.

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,560
What happened?

206
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
Let me take it easy.

207
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Tong Feng finally understands what love is.

208
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Ma Yichun has been teaching him

209
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
all these years.

210
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
It's not in vain.

211
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
What do you mean?

212
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Don't you understand?

213
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Tong Feng understands that

214
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
he likes adults differently.

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Tong Feng and adults are together now.

216
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
You mean Tong Feng and adults?

217
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Really?

218
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Don't you believe it?

219
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Listen,

220
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
you really didn't know

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
what I saw just now.

222
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
The adults were so angry

223
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
that they were beaten twice

224
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
and they didn't shout for a second.

225
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
They just took the ice bowl

226
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
and they were so angry

227
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
that Tong Feng hurt his hand.

228
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Tong Feng put his anger

229
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
on the adults' fingers

230
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
and he was so gentle

231
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
that he was about to drop the water.

232
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
I'm going blind.

233
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
That's a big news.

234
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Where is it? I want to see it.

235
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Over there.

236
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Meng Dihua, you're here too.

237
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I...

238
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
It's good that Tong Feng knows.

239
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Yes, yes.

240
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Come here.

241
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
What are you doing?

242
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't move.

243
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Good, good.

244
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
The small handkerchief of the Lord of Fujun.

245
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
The ice bowl handkerchief

246
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
for the handkerchief.

247
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
It's a special small handkerchief.

248
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
It's a special small handkerchief.

249
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Do you want one?

250
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Boss, here you are.

251
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Take it yourself.

252
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Don't worry.

253
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Come here.

254
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Come here.

255
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Niu Men, Niu Men, Niu Men.

256
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Master Yi.

257
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Why don't you have a mouth to speak?

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
You know that Dihua treats you...

259
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
How do I know Dihua is here?

260
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
She has been here for so many years.

261
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Does she still like you?

262
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Didn't you see the back of her back?

263
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
It's almost raining.

264
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
It seems that you have taken too little.

265
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
One bottle is enough.

266
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
The wine in the shop is quite expensive.

267
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Boss.

268
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Do you like Xuanmei?

269
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Xuanmei.

270
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Do you know that...

271
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Everyone has a regret in their hearts.

272
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
But some things...

273
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Don't need to be followed.

274
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Everyone has a regret in their hearts.

275
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
What about you?

276
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Do you have one too?

277
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
My brother is missing.

278
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I have been looking for my brother...

279
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
For a long time.

280
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
But I can't find his trace.

281
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Someone told me that...

282
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Your brother is gone.

283
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Stop looking for him.

284
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
But I don't believe it.

285
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
My brother treats me very well.

286
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
We have been together since childhood.

287
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I don't believe that...

288
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
He will leave me alone.

289
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Your brother?

290
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
I have never heard of it.

291
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Wanning.

292
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
You have never mentioned...

293
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
About you and Xuanmei.

294
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I know.

295
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
There is only one person who is seriously injured.

296
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Only then...

297
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Can he reveal the deepest feelings in his heart.

298
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
If I don't say it...

299
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm afraid that my heart will be too weak to accept it.

300
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
You like Tong Feng?

301
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
It turns out...

302
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
It's really too late.

303
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
This is not for you.

306
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Then who is it for?

307
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
It's a secret.

308
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
This is for you.

309
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
You can't blame me.

310
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Xuanmei, why are you like this?

311
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
You still don't want to tell me...

312
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Who is it for?

313
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I won't tell you.

314
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Tong Feng, where are you going?

315
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm here to deliver something to Xiao Mengzi.

316
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Did you see her?

317
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Xiao Mengzi?

318
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
In her room.

319
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm leaving then.

320
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Bye.

321
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
So she came to find Meng Dihua.

322
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Xiao Mengzi.

323
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Tong Feng.

324
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
You...

325
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Are you here to deliver food to me?

326
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Look.

327
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
It's my favorite caramel strawberry.

328
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
With your little hand, you can do this?

329
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Xiao Mengzi.

330
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I heard from Ma Yichun that...

331
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
You're not going to tell me?

332
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
I'm not going to tell you.

333
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm not going to tell you.

334
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Ma Yichun said...

335
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
You're...

336
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
You don't have to do this for Xuanpei.

337
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm worried about you.

338
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Tong Feng.

339
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
You've always been very good to Xuanpei.

340
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Very good.

341
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I can't find any reason to destroy you.

342
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,800
If you want to make me feel better because of this,

343
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
that's the saddest thing for me.

344
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
How can I be distant from you?

345
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Tong Feng, listen to me.

346
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
The End
