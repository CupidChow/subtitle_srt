1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
commercial

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Yes.

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,240
Good job, student.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,400
You've made a new student.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
I was a princess of the country.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,760
You must be a princess of the country.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,320
Don't be so cocky.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,560
Don't talk nonsense.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,200
I want to be a half-mother.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,200
I want to be a bride makeup artist.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,840
I...

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
I want to be a private aunt.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,040
What...

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,480
What are you doing?

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,760
Who said I was going to marry him?

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,600
If you don't marry me,

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,640
who will you marry?

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,040
Tong Feng.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,440
What are you doing?

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,520
Don't worry.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,240
I just want to ask him something.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,440
I want to borrow your bride for a while.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you going?

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,240
Tong Feng.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
No matter what,

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,080
I wish you a happy wedding.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,160
You...

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,240
You are Simo, right?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,480
Yes.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,680
When you asked me that day,

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
I was so confused.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,680
After all, I am the Demon Lord of the Demon Realm.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,840
There are many places that I can't do anything about.

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,560
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,960
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,720
No wonder you took me to the Demon Realm.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
You are the Demon Lord of the Demon Realm.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Then why did you

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,960
hide in the Nether World?

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,440
I'm here to find my brother.

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
Four thousand years ago,

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,560
my brother disappeared in the Nether World.

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,920
And the bracelet you're holding

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,600
is exactly the same as my brother's

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,480
weaving technique.

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,640
Who gave it to you?

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,200
This bracelet...

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
was made by Xiaomeng.

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,920
But she is a girl.

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
She can't be your brother.

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
You mean...

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,040
the owner?

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,920
Yes.

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,360
Simo, are you mistaken?

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Maybe I'm mistaken.

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,000
Tong Feng.

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,960
It's the first time I touched the Shadow Stone.

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I have a lot of

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
strange memories in my head.

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
What's going on?

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,640
Stop thinking about it.

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,480
I have a morning class tomorrow.

69
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm so tired.

70
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm going to sleep.

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm going to sleep.

72
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,560
I'm going to sleep.

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm going to sleep.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm going to sleep.

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
Little

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,320
Detective.

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,560
You have to grow up soon.

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,160
Grow up to be a brave lion.

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm a cat.

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,280
I can't grow up to be a lion.

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
I think the little male soul

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,240
is in a hurry.

83
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,640
It's either a tree to lay eggs

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,080
or a river to catch fish.

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Why don't you go out?

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
I'll go out with my body.

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
You'll be ashamed of yourself.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,160
You'll be ashamed of yourself.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
I didn't expect you to go through so much.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
But I have to take

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
what's hidden in the Chifeng Sword.

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,200
The Chifeng Sword carries the memories of the past.

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,760
It's clearly the first time

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
it's been carried.

95
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,920
This is your memory of the past.

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,280
Wake up.

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,960
You've just taken the husband.

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
Mr. Mao,

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
Ziya is brave.

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
You can't waste your energy.

101
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
The next one is algos.

102
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
You can't let me eat them.

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,360
When will Mr. Mao be brave enough

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
to suck me alive?

105
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,520
If the depending on him is true,

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
I don't need to believe the official oynation.

107
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,600
They don't have such an Bei,

108
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
but 제일有能力

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,160
to twist me fortress neil,

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,200
nine stars ר techniques

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,060
никого未能法饭

112
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,520
至此

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
bought you a large portion

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
all the time?

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,280
But I can't do it alone.

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,920
I won't fall again

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,640
Wei, you're so childish.

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,600
Wei?

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
Did you call her Wei?

120
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,400
Call me sister.

121
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
Stupid Wei.

122
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,480
You...

123
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,520
Four names are broken.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,320
Four names are broken.

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
Heaven is like a tear.

126
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
Heaven is like a tear.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,560
The blade of God falls.

128
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,040
The blade of God falls.

129
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm ashamed of myself.

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
I'm ashamed of myself.

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,120
Shen Pei.

132
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
This is the secret skill of the husband.

133
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Only I

134
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
and my next husband

135
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
can learn it.

136
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,880
Wei,

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,400
don't you want to be the husband?

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been a husband for more than ten thousand years.

139
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
I'm a little tired.

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,880
Shen Pei.

141
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,560
You have to grow up soon

142
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,600
and take over my class.

143
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,600
One more time.

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,640
Tan Tan.

145
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
You're so good.

146
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
You've learned how to cook.

147
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,400
Wei,

148
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,280
I'm not good.

149
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
It's really easy to cook.

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
Little kid.

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,240
You can't call me Wei.

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,320
You have to call me sister.

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,520
In your eyes,

154
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,960
can I still

155
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,720
be a little kid?

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,440
I've grown up, sister.

157
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,000
Shen Pei,

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,500
don't you think

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm too lonely?

160
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Life сорs dura

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
doesn't go?

162
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,560
In Jiuyou,

163
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
we stay

164
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,360
forever.

165
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,680
Isn't enough if I keep you company?

166
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,800
But I like to party.

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:57,840
Tomorrow

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
will be a completely different day.

169
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,240
Every time I get together with Lian Hua and Gui Ying,

170
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,800
I feel like we're family.

171
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,240
But we all manage our own lives.

172
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,480
We don't get to meet each other much.

173
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
If you could choose a family,

174
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,360
what kind of family would you choose?

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I think...

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
I want a sister who doesn't like to talk

177
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
but is reliable.

178
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
A brother who likes candy

179
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,120
and pretends to be a grown-up.

180
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,400
And a twin brother.

181
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,120
My brother likes to dress up and be pretty.

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,080
My brother is a technical house and loves to play games.

183
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,840
I see them fighting and hating each other.

184
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,000
But I feel like I'm with them.

185
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
And you.

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,720
I hope you can be with me forever.

187
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,240
You'll get what you want one day.

188
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,480
Wei, Gui Ying is crazy.

189
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
She killed countless souls for the Three Realms.

190
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
She swallowed most of the souls of the mortal world.

191
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,720
Now she has attacked the Heaven Realm and killed countless gods.

192
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
Now Lian Hua can't stop her.

193
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
She can't stop her.

194
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
What?

195
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,800
Why is there no news from Jiuyou?

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
Gui Ying is very cautious.

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,840
She has accumulated enough power to charge to the Heaven Realm.

198
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,720
Lian Hua can't stop her now.

199
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,640
She was under the spell just now.

200
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
Jiuyou got the news.

201
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,480
Those who break the Three Realms will be killed.

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,280
Gui Ying, don't keep making mistakes.

203
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,240
You've killed half of the gods and half of the mortal world.

204
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,920
I want to rule the Three Realms.

205
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
You always look down on me.

206
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Today I'll show you who is the master of the Three Realms.

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
Gui Ying, what are you talking about?

208
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
We grew up together.

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
We are sisters.

210
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
How can we look down on you?

211
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,400
Don't be fooled by the fake image of a moment.

212
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
Sisters?

213
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Sisters?

214
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,360
When did you take me as your brother?

215
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
You only have one brother in your heart.

216
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,480
Now I've absorbed the power of the soul and the magic.

217
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
There is no other opponent in this world.

218
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,640
Now you mention your sister.

219
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
You don't want to die, do you?

220
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,320
Gui Ying.

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
This time, you remember everything.

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
My lord.

223
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,880
You and Tong Feng went to the illusion world.

224
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
I've been secretly investigating the cause of Ma Yichun's death.

225
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
But I didn't expect to have other gains.

226
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,080
These days, there have been some burnt souls in the bamboo soul forest.

227
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,840
I found that the burnt marks on these souls

228
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,800
are very similar to the other marks on Ma Yichun's body.

229
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,880
The blood demon's wounds are the first.

230
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,720
Burnt is the second.

231
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,520
Choose to burn the soul in the bamboo soul forest.

232
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,240
This person must know that these souls are not in the Life and Death Department.

233
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
He must have a reason.

234
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,240
My lord.

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
Could it be the same person?

236
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
That is...

237
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
When my husband woke up,

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
the white bird was in the air, the light was on.

239
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
The red phoenix was in the heart.

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
My husband woke up?

241
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
But my lord, you are not...

242
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm the first husband.

243
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
How long have I been sleeping, detective?

244
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,080
He...

245
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,400
He...

246
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,000
He is called the first husband?

247
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Because he is the first husband.

248
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
You old man.

249
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,360
Wei.

250
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,560
Sister Jiao.

251
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,240
You...

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
You remember everything.

253
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,360
Tong Feng, you are still...

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
My husband.

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Tong Feng, are you still Tong Feng?

256
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
I used to be your husband.

257
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
But now I'm your student, Tong Feng.

258
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,480
Don't follow me.

259
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,640
I haven't settled your case with you yet.

260
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,640
I see you as my apprentice,

261
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,400
but you see me as your wife.

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,200
You...

263
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm Wei.

264
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm Tong Feng.

265
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,960
I remember everything.

266
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
Not like in the script.

267
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,800
I remember the past,

268
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
so I forget the present.

269
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
Master, please accept my respect.

270
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,800
Please make a break.

271
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
We don't care who is your husband,

272
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,640
or your wife.

273
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
I don't want to be your husband,

274
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
but I want you to be my wife.

275
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,000
As long as you like it,

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll agree to anything.

277
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Tian, look at this man.

278
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,760
He is so shameless.

279
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,280
You can call me Tong Feng.

280
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
Tong Feng, I...

281
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,360
You?

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
What did you do

283
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
in the ghost camp?

284
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,760
What did you do

285
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,120
in the ghost camp?

286
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,720
Four thousand years ago,

287
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,680
you and the Heavenly Emperor

288
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,560
killed the ghosts together.

289
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
You and the ghosts

290
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
were both killed in the Three-Dimension River.

291
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
I spent a thousand years

292
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
to restore your soul

293
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
and revive you.

294
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,760
I became Tong Feng.

295
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

296
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,320
You were so happy

297
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
to be alone.

298
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
You've been alone

299
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,280
for tens of thousands of years

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
and you've been with the Nine Ghosts.

301
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
If I hadn't made you Tong Feng,

302
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,280
how could you live the peaceful life

303
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,040
you really want to live?

304
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,840
I mean it.

305
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
But...

306
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
Lian Hua knows it.

307
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
The bastard took advantage of me

308
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
in the Heavenly Realm last time

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,440
and asked me to give him a gift.

310
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
You should be good to him.

311
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
Wait for me in the Nine Ghosts.

312
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
I don't want him to see

313
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,560
how impudent my former disciple

314
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
was in front of me.

315
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
He'll laugh at me.

316
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
The official announcement is over.

317
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,720
It's too late to go back now.

318
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,280
I don't care.

319
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,680
Who are you?

320
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,880
How dare you break into the Heavenly Realm?

321
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,880
The Nine Ghosts.

322
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,080
The Nine Ghosts

323
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,360
Lian Hua.

324
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,000
It's really you.

325
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,320
I've slept for 4,000 years

326
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
and I came to see you as soon as I woke up.

327
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
Am I very nice?

328
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
You came and hit the soldiers in the Heavenly Realm.

329
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,080
You're really something.

330
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,640
You still have the pair of ear rings

331
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,840
I gave you.

332
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Of course.

333
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
How could I take them off

334
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
when you gave them to me?

335
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,160
I was the one who took them last time.

336
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,080
Look.

337
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,160
The light you want to see this time.

338
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
It's on.

339
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,640
Why are you still like this

340
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
after you woke up?

341
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,120
Let me tell you.

342
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,560
I just like the dessert

343
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,520
in the Heavenly Realm.

344
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,200
You're so angry.

345
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,800
It's not just to make up with me, right?

346
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,880
This is...

347
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,680
A love letter.

348
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
I'm going to marry Xuan Pei in three days.

349
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,960
You're really going to marry that little black cat?

350
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I thought you'd regret it after recovering your memory.

351
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,560
It's not a little black cat.

352
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,680
It's Xuan Pei.

353
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,120
Regret?

354
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
Is it my military style?

355
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
It's not that I can't.

356
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
It's just that look.

357
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,320
You're awake now.

358
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,120
Who are you two?

359
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
Who is the Lord of the Manor?

360
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,200
Who is the Lord of the Manor's wife?

361
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
Why do you always ask me such a boring question?

362
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
This question is very realistic.

363
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
Who is the Lord of the Manor?

364
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
How much money did you decide to give me?

365
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,240
We're all immortals.

366
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,240
You're so stingy with your own money.

367
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,600
You're not the head of the family.

368
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,880
You don't know the price of the rice and oil.

369
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,000
Rice and oil are expensive.

370
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
You even signed the Shen Mo Treaty.

371
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
It's a three-dimensional blockade.

372
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,480
You're not afraid of being starved to death?

373
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,680
I knew it.

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
You didn't just invite me to your wedding.

375
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,200
You're thinking about what happened four thousand years ago, right?

376
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,280
