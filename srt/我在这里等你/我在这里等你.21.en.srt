00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How is Ma Yi Chun's body handled?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ma Yi Chun's body has been buried in the remote mountains.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But Niujie and Yi Chun are best friends.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If Yi Chun dies,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we're afraid that Niujie will be in trouble.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Pay more attention to Niubabang's condition.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As for Tong Feng,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we'll follow the order of the Grandmaster

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to hide him.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This isn't a real one.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This isn't a real one.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The mortals died.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Their relatives

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
always burn some paper money.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They want to live a better life in the Nether World.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
After the mortals died,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
they meet again in the Nether World.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But when the mortals die,

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
nothing is left.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The soul is scattered in the world.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's no more ghost.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In the past days,

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you liked sugar the most.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I always didn't let you eat it.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I was afraid that you would get a toothache.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you could come back,

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I would give you all the sugar.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Niujie,

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
what are you talking about?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Who are you going to buy sugar for?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yi Chun is dead.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yi Chun is dead.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What does it mean?

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Does it mean that we won't see him again?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yi Chun is dead.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yi Chun is dead!

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yi Chun is dead.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Xuan Pei,

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yi Chun is dead.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Aren't we souls?

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why are souls dead?

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You get up first.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Your body will be exhausted.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yesterday,

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Ma Yi Chun told me that

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
when Li Da Fu left,

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
he would be with me.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But now,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
he's gone too.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will never see him again.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will never see him again.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yi Chun.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yi Chun.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Boss.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Boss.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Who are you?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm Si Mo.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When you came to Wangchuan Tang Pu for the interview,

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I checked your address.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Xuan Pei told you?

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You used the lantern last night

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to give Tong Feng the cake.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It was still on the table.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is this the way you like Tong Feng?

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why did you kill him?

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The lantern was sent to the cake?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If what happened last night has nothing to do with me,

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
do you believe me?

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I did poison Tong Feng.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But the poison was slowly dissipating.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The lanterns from the stall

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
have been recorded.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you don't believe me,

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you can check if there was a lantern from the stall last night.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,300
I will go to the

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But are you really a demon?

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm leaving.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm going on a trip with my boss.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the Demon Lord of the Demon Realm.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
My brother is the Demon Lord of the previous generation.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I suspect my brother was locked in the Nine-oil Secret Mirror.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But Xuan Pei put a barrier there.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
As long as Tong Feng is extremely weak,

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Xuan Pei will not hesitate to use his cultivation to save him,

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the barrier will be broken.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But when I found

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that I like him,

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I never poisoned him again.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can go.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Boss.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Go now.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I want to see Tong Feng again.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I knew I shouldn't,

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but I still want to see him again.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And you knew you shouldn't,

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
but you waited for so many years.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's up to you.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Xuan Pei,

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
how did Yichun die?

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I just want to know.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I want to know

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
how Yichun died.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't worry about it.

110
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,600
Why?

111
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,280
Ma Yichun is dead.

112
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,040
You can't get her back.

113
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,760
Let's leave the death of the soul-seeker to the soul-seeker.

114
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
Shanpei,

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
what are you talking about?

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
The law of the Nether World.

118
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Ma Yichun's death.

119
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Don't worry about it.

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,360
The law of the Nether World.

121
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,880
The law of the Nether World.

122
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,680
The law of the Nether World again.

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,040
Last time, Wang Ruonian

124
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,640
was killed because of the stupid law of the Nether World.

125
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
After he hurt so many people,

126
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,600
he almost

127
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,720
lived his life without any harm.

128
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,680
Now, it's the law of the Nether World again.

129
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,760
My good friend,

130
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Yichun is dead.

131
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,920
If he's dead,

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,320
can't I just ask him?

133
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Tong Feng,

134
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,080
you're just a regular soul of the Nether World.

135
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,760
Ma Yichun is the second-ranking official of the Nether World.

136
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,640
The death of the subordinate of the Nether World

137
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
is always confidential.

138
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,480
Shanpei,

139
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,160
Ma Yichun is dead.

140
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,760
You're not sad at all.

141
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
The Nether World is always very dangerous.

142
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
Everyone may die at any time.

143
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,760
Not only Ma Yichun,

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm also

145
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,360
the same.

146
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
Everyone may die at any time.

147
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,480
Shanpei,

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,440
I found that I don't know you.

149
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Actually, I know

150
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
that you've hidden a lot from me.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240
I used to think

152
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,640
that the things you hid from me

153
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,720
would never hurt me.

154
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
But now,

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm not so sure.

156
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,080
I must keep this secret.

157
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,560
I've guarded you for four thousand years.

158
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,280
No matter what,

159
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,840
I must keep you safe.

160
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,040
My Lord,

161
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,400
the matter of the blood-stained hair is still urgent.

162
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,960
We need to handle it in time.

163
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,640
Otherwise, the Heavens will be angry at us.

164
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,280
Yes.

165
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,440
I'll go to the capital to find it.

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
I'll go to the capital to find it.

168
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,520
Yes.

169
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,440
I'll go to the capital to find it.

170
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,960
Yes.

171
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll go to the capital to find it.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Yes.

173
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,400
I'll go to the capital to find it.

174
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes.

175
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,280
The Heavens will be angry at us.

176
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,160
But luckily,

177
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,800
the power of the blood-stained hair

178
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,920
in Tong Feng's body has been suppressed temporarily.

179
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,880
A'Ming.

180
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,840
Go to the Hidden Mountain.

181
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
After I cover the traces of the blood-stained hair,

182
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,120
come to me immediately.

183
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,680
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,080
Didn't you say

185
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,760
you would stay with me forever?

186
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,480
I've been cooking the soup for 4,000 years.

187
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,720
I've been suffering from the death of mortals

188
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,520
for 4,000 years.

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
I've been suffering from the death of mortals

190
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
for 4,000 years.

191
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,680
I can't escape from the power of the blood-stained hair

192
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,340
and the

193
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,400
power of the blood-stained hair.

194
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,200
Little Man.

195
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
Although we've been in charge of

196
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,080
the cultivation of mortals for a long time,

197
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,800
we've been living for too long.

198
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,640
We've been living for thousands of years.

199
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
But we've forgotten

200
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
the true meaning of life and death.

201
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,800
Mortals' life

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
is only a few decades away.

203
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
They know better

204
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,280
than us

205
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
about life and death.

206
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,960
That's why they're afraid of death.

207
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,960
They're afraid of the night

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,680
when you have the blood-stained hair.

209
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,400
This is...

210
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,040
This is Ma Yi Chun's

211
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
broken soul.

212
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,200
You've seen Ma Yi Chun's soul?

213
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,040
Then...

214
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,280
Then you...

215
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
Do you know how Ma Yi Chun died?

216
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,920
Xuan Pei gave me this.

217
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
He asked me to give it to you.

218
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,920
Xuan Pei again?

219
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,840
Do you really think

220
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,640
that Xuan Pei is not sad

221
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,840
about Ma Yi Chun's death?

222
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
Every day after Ma Yi Chun left,

223
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,760
Xuan Pei missed him.

224
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,440
But as the husband of Jiuyou,

225
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,680
he has his responsibilities.

226
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,840
Xuan Pei can only

227
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
hide his sadness in his heart.

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,520
But why didn't he let me

229
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,200
investigate the cause of Ma Yi Chun's death?

230
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
Ma Yi Chun and I

231
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,840
have known each other for over a thousand years.

232
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,560
He's like my family.

233
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,680
I read the script in the mortal world.

234
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,360
The family in the mortal world died in the blink of an eye.

235
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,280
They will investigate it to the end.

236
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,440
But we are souls

237
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
who have never died.

238
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,080
Are we

239
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,560
not as good as mortals?

240
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,200
Ma Yi Chun's death,

241
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,080
even if you don't tell me,

242
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,440
I will find out it by myself.

243
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
Tong Feng.

244
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,960
Yi Chun wouldn't want to see you like this.

245
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,360
Xiao Mengzi.

246
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,680
I understand all these.

247
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
But in this world,

248
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,640
we don't know what to do

249
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,160
when we understand the truth.

250
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,960
Xiao Mengzi.

251
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,640
Go back first.

252
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,440
I want to be alone.

253
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,640
Okay.

254
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,520
I'll wait for you in the soup shop.

255
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,680
Okay.

256
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,040
Tong Feng.

257
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,280
Don't be sad.

258
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm the worst at coaxing girls.

259
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,720
I don't want to see girls cry at all.

260
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
You fool.

261
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
When he comes back,

262
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,040
let's beat him up together, okay?

263
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,320
The man who likes to read the script the most

264
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,360
is Little Bear Yuan Bao and his friends.

265
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,040
Are they very childish?

266
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,880
Tong Feng.

267
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,520
Don't cry.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,160
The meaning of farewell

269
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,960
is to meet again.

270
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,880
So don't be sad for the farewell.

271
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,520
You have to be full of expectation

272
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,160
for the reunion.

273
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm leaving.

274
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,200
The world is full of wind and rain

275
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm so desolate that I can't even see you

276
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,440
The golden rain is cold

277
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,280
The light is bright

278
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
The stars are bright

279
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm so desolate that I can't even see you

280
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,840
Then give this to me.

281
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,360
I heard that the master gave you a box of delicious fish soup.

282
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
I want to eat it.

283
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Tong Feng.

284
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,640
I like you so much.

285
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,520
I will always be with Tong Feng.

286
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,680
Bai Chun.

287
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,240
I know

288
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,320
you don't want to see me sad.

289
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,280
I can be not sad.

290
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
But

291
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,800
I can't let you leave without knowing it.

292
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,360
I can't let you leave without knowing it.

293
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
I can't let you leave without knowing it.

294
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,240
I can't let you leave without knowing it.

295
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,080
The night is so cold

296
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,680
The night is so cold

297
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
The night is so cold

298
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,960
The night is so cold

299
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,600
The night is so cold

300
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,600
The night is so cold

301
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,400
The fate is not yet clear

302
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,600
How can I exchange thoughts

303
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,640
The three lives are so bright

304
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,360
The fireworks are so bright

305
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,240
The pursuit is so bright

306
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,800
The three lives are so bright

307
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,920
The pursuit is so bright
