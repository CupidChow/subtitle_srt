00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
Official

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,440
Episode 20

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Give back.

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,700
You want more?

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,560
Wait for me.

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,020
Even if I tell you that Kan Di should never receiveyeah

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,140
and go to this spread about Doki,

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,420
but theцеe here knows less than me.

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,120
Exactly.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Can I continue?

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Please continue.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,120
The Three Realms Competition is held every year for a thousand years.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,120
It's held by the Heaven Realm, the Demon Realm, and the Nine Realms.

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,120
The venue for this year's competition is the Nine Realms.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,120
At that time, both the Demon Realm and the Heaven Realm will send representatives to participate in the competition.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Demon Lord and the Heavenly Emperor will personally participate.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
So loud?

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
But, the Three Realms can't come together, right?

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Why would the Heavenly Emperor and Demon Lord come?

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,120
The Three Realms Competition is a festival that has been held for a thousand years.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Although the three realms are not connected,

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,120
but only in the first and second days of the Three Realms Competition,

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
the three realms can send representatives to communicate with each other.

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
For these two days,

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
the three realms, whether it's gods, demons, or souls,

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,120
have to prepare for a long time.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,120
It's a high and low level with us in the competition.

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Of course, this is not only for the glory of the first season.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
The prizes for the three realms competition

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,120
are also the target of everyone's dreams.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Prizes? What prizes?

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,120
The first prize is the prize for the dream lottery.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,120
The second prize is the prize for the three realms' treasure, the spirit stone.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Dream lottery prize? What does it mean?

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
It means that you can give it to your friends and relatives in the mortal world.

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Tell them the prize number of the next season.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
The prize number of the next season?

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
The prize for the lottery?

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
That will cost a lot of money.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,120
I can use it for my own business.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
What if I have to repair a beggar's coat?

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
You are not allowed to wear a thousand-mile-long-swinging mirror in the next class.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm sorry, Teacher Liu. I was wrong.

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Xuan Pei, I'm not talking to you. I'm in class.

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Your boss said you're getting married soon.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Of course it should be my turn!

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Slap him in the face for saying that.

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Lu底下!

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
The third prize is a trophy.

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
that there are souls missing.

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,640
I wonder who did it.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,680
I've sensed it.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
How many souls are missing?

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,200
Do you have any statistics?

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
There are fifteen souls missing.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,840
I wonder

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
if it's related to the Demon Clan.

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,120
I heard that

59
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,800
the Demon Clan's king isn't in the palace recently.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,680
After the Ghost Camp,

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
the new king is not well-informed.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,360
If the Demon Clan really comes,

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,480
there will be traces.

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,040
Inform Duo Min

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,080
to keep an eye on the formation of the Nine-Your-Oath Defense Formation.

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,080
I understand.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,200
Tong Feng is about to leave the class.

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,120
You may leave now.

69
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes.

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,880
Mr. Liu,

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
I want to participate in the talent competition.

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,720
I want to win the championship.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
What courses do I need to complete?

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,000
You're so educated.

75
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,600
I didn't expect that you've worked hard these days.

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
Do you know the requirements

77
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
for the three talent competitions?

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
I know. I know.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Charm, strength, intelligence,

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,560
and three branches

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,920
all have to reach more than three hundred

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
before they are qualified to participate in the competition.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,320
But if I want to win the championship,

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,440
I'm not sure.

85
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,880
The competition will start in seven days.

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
You still have a branch

87
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,680
with five branches.

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,760
It's still far from the end.

89
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,560
Go to the five-strand teacher's class.

90
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,000
The final project

91
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
is still in the final stage.

92
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
After the first round,

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
you will be selected by the famous person.

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,760
Generally speaking,

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,760
it's very likely that it's a five-strand competition.

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,040
Five-strand?

97
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,640
Why can't I get it?

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
Why do you always disturb me in class?

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,920
Didn't you ask me to do that?

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,240
I didn't ask you to disturb me in class.

101
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,960
You told me that

102
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
as long as I miss you,

103
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
I'll look for you with a thousand-mile telegraph mirror.

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,480
Then you can't

105
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
think of me every moment, right?

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,640
I think of you every moment.

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,520
Just like the light-painting painter in the play.

108
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,480
Wanwan said in the illusionary room

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,520
that I'm a gangster.

110
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,080
Since you called me,

111
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,240
I can't just leave you alone.

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,440
Xuanmei, stop it.

113
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to study hard.

114
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,720
I have a martial arts class tomorrow.

115
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
What? You have a martial arts class?

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm going to participate in the first round of the three-dimensional talent competition.

117
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
I want to win the championship.

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,360
But my martial arts are far from enough.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,240
So starting tomorrow,

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm going to have a seven-day devil training.

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,880
When did you get so involved?

122
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,200
Mr. Liu said that the prize of the championship

123
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,760
can be given to the family of the illusion

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
and tell them the number of the lottery.

125
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
I can keep my own night-time income.

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,200
You are well-prepared.

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,040
You still have two hundred to go.

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,160
In the next seven days,

129
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,200
even if you work harder than ordinary people,

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
you can't make any improvement in such a short time.

131
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,600
I know.

132
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,640
So,

133
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,400
don't bother me in the future.

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
I don't.

135
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,120
Mr. Ma Yichun,

136
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,640
I've made up my mind.

137
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm going to make up for it in the next few days.

138
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,800
I want to increase my martial arts value by two hundred.

139
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,640
Mr. Ma, are you sure?

140
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm sure.

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,280
I'll increase my martial arts value by two hundred in the next seven days.

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,400
You'll have a hard time these days.

143
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,440
I'm not afraid of hard work.

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,680
Mr. Wu Lin, don't worry.

145
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
I can hold on to it.

146
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,240
Very good.

147
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm very happy.

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,360
Go.

149
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Go around the Jiuyou and run five laps.

150
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,760
The whole Jiuyou?

151
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Hurry up.

152
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Or you won't be able to run all day.

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
But the Jiuyou is so big.

154
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,480
Hurry up.

155
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,400
See you later.

156
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,920
A thousand times, a hundred times,

157
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
flowers bloom in the capital.

158
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
The summer is falling,

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,200
but the people are not coming back.

160
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,400
I don't know if I'll be able to fly again.

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,760
So I'm looking forward to attract more big washers.

162
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
But too much Time to be a practical force

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
And where there's not that much hope

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,620
To shift the haphazard

165
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,160
Let me let me be so moved

166
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,760
That I might teachpling

167
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,720
You're my best man

168
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,520
In the hopes

169
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,600
To win, I will hold on long for the victory

170
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,120
All these official times

171
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,840
Are a lost cause

172
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,640
Kijin.

173
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Kijin!

174
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
I have 글 harvest.

175
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Recently, I hadologist in Huarkenah.

176
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,920
I've been studying these days.

177
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,480
I've watched several episodes.

178
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
I'll make up for it tonight.

179
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,760
My legs...

180
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,400
are so comfortable.

181
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,800
Doctor!

182
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
Doctor, why are you here?

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
Tong Feng, where have you been?

184
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
I've been looking for you all day.

185
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
I went to the dance teacher to tutor.

186
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
I haven't been in the villa for a whole day.

187
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,920
What's the matter?

188
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,120
I've been in a bad mood these days.

189
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
I want to talk to you.

190
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,240
It's not convenient.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,480
Can you go to Wangchuan Soup Shop?

192
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,200
Okay.

193
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:15,960
Let's go.

194
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,560
Let's go.

195
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,400
Here are the dishes.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,640
Here.

197
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Xiao Mengzi,

198
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
what's wrong with you today?

199
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,960
You've always been very cold-hearted.

200
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
I'm being cold-hearted to you.

201
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,920
How can I be cold-hearted to you?

202
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,160
Enough, Madam.

203
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,720
I just donated some money to you.

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,520
You're so poor.

205
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,360
Thank you, Mr. Li.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,760
Enjoy your meal.

207
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,960
How much did you donate to him?

208
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,320
Look at him.

209
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,960
It's not much.

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,160
It's just that

211
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
recently,

212
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,840
my family started to do good deeds again.

213
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
The blessings they gave me

214
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,440
are increasing.

215
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,440
Look.

216
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
I drink this good wine every day.

217
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,800
I can't spend all my money

218
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,920
on nothing.

219
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,960
It's so annoying.

220
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,680
You mean...

221
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,440
You mean your family.

222
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,800
So,

223
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,120
you've been in a bad mood these days.

224
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,040
Is it because of this?

225
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,680
Tong Feng,

226
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
my family

227
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,520
has always been

228
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,320
a good family.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,600
The blessings they gave me

230
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
are already enough to end my business.

231
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
I've been in the wine business for three years.

232
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm not the one who can end my business.

233
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
I was thinking of going back to my business.

234
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Maybe I'll get a chance to meet them.

235
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,000
But...

236
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,880
Da Fu,

237
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
don't be sad.

238
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
You mean

239
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,640
you can't end your business now?

240
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,400
Yes.

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,800
When I was working with Ma Yichun,

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:55,240
I went to the

243
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
First time

244
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,640
I saw someone mathematical to the end

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,560
sticking up for the love.

246
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Huh?

247
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,840
Da Fu,

248
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,880
don't worry.

249
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,720
I'll figure it out for you.

250
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Really?

251
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Yes.

252
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,600
Thank you, Tong Feng.

253
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
Eat more.

254
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
I'll treat you more.

255
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,240
Sure.

256
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,760
Myиш'gi couldn't fight with blood for nonprofit.

257
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,080
I want to feel hunger.

258
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
What does it have to do

259
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,200
What's the connection?

260
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,200
He went to find Man Yi Chun.

261
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,560
Zhang Ji Xian.

262
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,080
Yes.

263
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,880
Come here.

264
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,640
Okay.

265
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,360
Man Yi Chun.

266
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Tong Feng, are you here for me?

267
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,080
I want to ask you something.

268
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,640
I see.

269
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,760
Let's go.

270
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Niu Mei,

271
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,040
come and watch me.

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
Come on, next one.

273
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,480
What?

274
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
You mean Li Da Fu can't get a job?

275
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
Yes.

276
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,160
Li Da Fu is in a bad mood recently.

277
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,600
I want to ask you

278
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,200
if you know anything about him.

279
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,080
In the future,

280
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
if you want to know something about him,

281
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,200
bring me two more.

282
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,920
One more

283
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,640
is not enough to make me lose my job.

284
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,400
Man Yi Chun,

285
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,760
just try it.

286
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,880
So,

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
do you know why Li Da Fu

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,720
can't get a job?

289
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,760
He

290
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,560
doesn't have the qualification to get a job.

291
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Why?

292
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,640
Well,

293
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't say it anymore.

294
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,520
If I say it again,

295
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,600
I'll be dragged to the funeral.

296
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,640
But...

297
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Back row. Back row.

298
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,000
Get up.

299
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,200
Why didn't you go to class today?

300
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,880
Man Yi Chun said

301
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,440
I was too frequent these days.

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
I was afraid of hurting my health.

303
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,840
He asked me to take a break today.

304
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,320
I've already worked hard.

305
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
But my martial arts skills

306
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,040
only increased by 20 points.

307
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,280
I can only pass the test

308
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,440
with 170 points left.

309
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,120
The day after tomorrow is the talent competition.

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
I don't think I can make it.

311
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,480
Are you sad?

312
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
It's the first time

313
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,200
I've worked so hard to accomplish one thing.

314
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
But I can't do anything now.

315
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,320
I was too lazy before.

316
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,280
I'll teach you a magic trick.

317
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,240
If you learn it,

318
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,880
you can pass the three talent competitions

319
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,960
and win the competition.

320
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll teach you a magic trick.

321
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,680
It'll be fine.

322
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,840
Xuan Pei, Xuan Pei.

323
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,960
Are you serious?

324
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,840
You have to learn it first.

325
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,920
I'll learn it well.

326
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,880
Well, Xuan Pei.

327
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,600
Before learning the magic trick,

328
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,200
I want to ask you a question.

329
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,440
What?

330
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,120
Do you know

331
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
why Li Da Fu can't quit his job?

332
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,920
Don't worry about him.

333
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,640
Why?

334
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,720
No one can help him

335
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,840
in the whole Jiuyou.

336
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,800
You can't help him either?

337
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,240
Except for himself,

338
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
no one can help him.

339
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,480
Xuan Pei.

340
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,320
You've learned it wrong.

341
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
You can't speak clearly.

342
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
If you don't tell me, it's fine.

343
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,760
I'll investigate it myself.

344
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,560
It's his destiny.

345
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Don't participate.

346
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
Don't say too much or do too much.

347
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,280
But...

348
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,400
Be careful with your words.

349
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,760
I see.

350
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,960
Okay.

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
Aren't you going to learn magic?

352
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,320
Let's go.

353
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
메

354
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,680
Watch carefully.

355
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,560
Four shares of opponents.

356
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Chuun juices in my barren Kaifeng.

357
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,640
names on my blade.

358
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
I'll be ashamed into prueba.

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,600
Do you see it?

360
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,480
Yes.

361
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,600
Xiao Pei,

362
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,400
you're so powerful.

363
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,360
Give me your hand.

364
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,360
Xuan Pei?

365
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,340
Iyer Bamboo

366
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
I've been Residenting your spiritual pulse has been之前.

367
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Now you can try.

368
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Simei Pohai

369
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,580
Save Ophiuchus

370
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,500
Shen Pei.

371
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,580
Let me teach you.

372
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,180
Si Ming,

373
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,780
break the sea.

374
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,940
Si Ming, break the sea.

375
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,420
The sky is full of tears.

376
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,860
The sky is full of tears.

377
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,700
The blade of God, one shot.

378
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,300
The blade of God, one shot.

379
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,700
I'll be ashamed of myself.

380
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,580
I'll be ashamed of myself.

381
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,180
Shen Pei, I've learned it.

382
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,860
Shen Pei.

383
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,300
Your power is qualified.

384
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Shen Pei, your magic is so powerful.

385
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,540
Next, you need to practice more.

386
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,340
Si Ming, break the sea.

387
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,500
The sky is full of tears.

388
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,180
Shen Pei,

389
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,540
the magic is so powerful.

390
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,060
Don't worry.

391
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,180
You're not stable now.

392
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,580
You need to practice more

393
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,940
to be able to use it freely.

394
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,980
Remember,

395
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,820
don't use it in front of strangers.

396
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,660
Why?

397
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,140
Such a powerful magic.

398
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,180
I want to show it to Ma Yi Chen.

399
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Learning magic is for cultivation.

400
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,700
How can you have such a goal?

401
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,220
I know.

402
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,500
But, Shen Pei,

403
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,860
this magic is so powerful.

404
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,780
Will it affect my power?

405
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,940
Since you've learned it,

406
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,220
it won't affect you.

407
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,500
Practice more.

408
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,860

409
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,460
