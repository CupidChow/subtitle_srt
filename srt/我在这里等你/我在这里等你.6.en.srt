00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,300
Ten получ Sword

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,960
Episode envy

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
Episode 16

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,400
So,

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,520
this is for her.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,080
Cheng Lang.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,600
It's going to rain.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,120
Let's hide.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,640
Let's go.

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,760
My master's back.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,840
My siblings have Hin,

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,040
and loudly.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
How about

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,600
I go back late

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,840
and make the horse get angry?

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,040
Goodbye.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,680
Who exactly is she?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,960
He's already fallen.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,100
St不知道

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
born

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,880
Xuan Pei?

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,800
Xuan Pei,

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,000
what happened to your eyes?

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,560
Don't scare me.

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,480
Didn't you say you wanted to be my bride?

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
Now you're my bride,

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
so I'll let you be my bride.

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,280
You were at the door that day?

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
I heard it.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,720
Are you going to be my bride?

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
Xuan Pei.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,400
Didn't you say you wanted to touch my muscles?

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Now I'll let you touch my dog.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
I...

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll stop.

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,600
I...

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Xuan Pei,

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
I think I heard your heartbeat.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,440
Xuan Pei, it hurts.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Xuan Pei.

41
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,920
My lord,

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,760
my lord,

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
I just got the news that

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
there are 20 souls in the Nether World that are disappearing

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,160
and are living in the Soul Forest.

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,160
My lord, are you all right?

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,880
The last time there were three souls disappearing,

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,080
you were out of control.

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,680
Now there are 20 souls disappearing.

50
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
Your body...

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm fine.

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
I'll go back and rest for a night.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
The incense is out.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,480
There are still souls disappearing

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040
and they're living in the Soul Forest.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
It means that

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,840
the dead must be very familiar with the Nether World.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
All souls, take the life.

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,600
Yes, my lord.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
We must investigate this thoroughly

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
and see if there are other souls.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,400
Yes.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,680
Besides,

64
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Tong Feng is injured.

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,640
What happened to Tong Feng?

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
When I was about to leave,

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
I almost lost control

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
and hurt Tong Feng.

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,800
You young people.

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll go and have a look.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,080
Ma Yi Chun,

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I didn't expect that.

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
You're quite good at it.

74
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm just kidding.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,760
Ma Yi Chun is the best warm-up man in the Nether World.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
By the way, Ma Yi Chun.

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
Xuan Pei is not happy recently.

78
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,440
Do you know

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
how to make him happy?

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,680
The old man bit him.

81
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,600
The teeth on his neck can be counted.

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,400
He still knows how old he is.

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,160
By the way,

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
did you embroider a sachet for Si Mo last time?

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Yes.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
He grabbed my little brush

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,760
and insisted on making me embroider it for him.

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
No wonder.

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,040
You're so mean.

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,680
What's wrong with you

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
embroidering a sachet for the old man?

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
You're so petty.

93
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
Look at Jiu Wei.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,840
He never loves any man.

95
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
But...

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,880
But Xuan Pei never wears a sachet.

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,480
I'm talking to you.

98
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,720
Anyway, listen to me.

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,880
If you want to make the old man happy,

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,560
you should embroider a sachet for him.

101
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,640
The old man will be so happy

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,680
that he can't find a man.

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
Then what should I embroider for him?

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,880
The pattern of the sachet.

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,880
Just embroider a mandarin duck.

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
A mandarin duck?

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,160
A mandarin duck.

108
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,840
I'll take this sachet

109
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
for you,

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,480
Demon Lord.

111
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,440
Who are you?

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
What do you want?

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Don't worry, Demon Lord.

114
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
I won't expose you.

115
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
The place you want to go

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,160
is the place I want to go.

117
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
I'll help Demon Lord.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Where do you mean by that place?

119
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,360
It's Mi Jing, of course.

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,400
She's my mother.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,240
It's all up to me to decide where I

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
should go with you.

123
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,040
Da Feng.

124
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,320
Who would learn the words like that?

125
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,520
You'll be einfach if you're hungry.

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Fat.

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
It's a wordplay.

128
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
So boring.

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,680
No.

130
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Li Da Fu.

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Who are you talking about?

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,560
Li Da Fu.

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
When you were in the prison,

134
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
you were twice as fat as now.

135
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,400
I was really fat back then.

136
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,160
But

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,640
my parents fed me.

138
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,960
Da Fu.

139
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,720
There's your shadow in the Three Mountains River?

140
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Why?

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,640
Tong Feng.

142
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,480
Why don't you have a shadow?

143
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,200
Why is it that only the Three Mountains River

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,000
doesn't have my shadow?

145
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,160
Not only me.

146
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,160
Xuan Pei doesn't either.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Why

148
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,920
do I have your shadow?

149
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,760
And

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
your stomach

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,600
will also scream?

152
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
I don't know

153
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,040
why my stomach will scream either.

154
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,280
So

155
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
I can only eat alone.

156
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,600
Now you believe me, right?

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm a demon.

158
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,320
There's demon blood

159
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
running through my body.

160
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,280
Again.

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,720
Tong Feng.

162
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,520
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
I was too emotional to bite you.

164
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,160
I misunderstood you.

165
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,400
No.

166
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,280
I was too emotional to bite you.

167
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
And you're still saying such sweet words.

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Why should she forgive me?

169
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Tong Feng.

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,760
This is the lotus root soup I made.

171
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
You like it the most, right?

172
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
It's so delicious.

173
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,480
How could she accept it?

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Xuan Pei, what are you doing?

175
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
He Huasu.

176
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,360
Why are you here?

177
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,720
Let me tell you, Xuan Pei.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,200
I've found a lot of weird things these days.

179
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,320
Tong Feng.

180
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,480
I was out of control a few days ago.

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,320
I bit you.

182
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
Xuan Pei.

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
It's just a small wound.

184
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
It doesn't hurt at all.

185
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,240
I can bite you ten times.

186
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,840
Here.

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Does it still hurt?

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,720
Xuan Pei.

189
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,440
Xuan Pei.

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,120
I remember you told me

191
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,960
that souls won't starve, right?

192
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,360
But I heard

193
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,000
Li Da Fu's stomach was screaming.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
He would starve.

195
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,880
He was greedy before he died.

196
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,480
He would have a better appetite after he died.

197
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
He would scream sometimes.

198
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,040
And I saw his shadow

199
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
when I was playing with Li Da Fu in the Three-Legend River.

200
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,960
But I didn't.

201
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
But I didn't.

202
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,920
Not only me.

203
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
I remember when I was playing with you in the Three-Legend River,

204
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
I didn't see your shadow.

205
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
What's going on?

206
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Maybe we stayed in the wine garden for a long time.

207
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,520
It disappeared after a long time.

208
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
I see.

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,480
But...

210
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,640
But I think...

211
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,840
Tong Feng.

212
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Do you want to go to the mortal world?

213
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,280
Mortal world?

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
What are you doing?

215
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,520
Brother.

216
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,200
Go away.

217
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
She is my daughter.

218
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,880
Go away.

219
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,160
She is my daughter.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,640
Go away.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,960
What are you doing?

222
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,840
I helped Zhang Ju Qian change his destiny.

223
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,680
Why is he still in such a bad state?

224
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,800
You did a good job.

225
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,880
You are a noble and rich man.

226
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,120
But he didn't drink the soup.

227
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,200
He didn't get rid of it last night.

228
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,200
Even if he changed his destiny,

229
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,280
his fate will not change.

230
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,040
You are right.

231
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,000
His destiny will not change.

232
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,040
Xuan Pei.

233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,640
Do you know

234
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,120
about my change of destiny?

235
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,160
Of course.

236
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,880
Si Mo threatened me to sew a sachet

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,520
when he saw me change my destiny.

238
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
Xuan Pei...

239
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

240
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,880
I think

241
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
you are shining.

242
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,520
What?

243
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,040
Zhang Ju Qian's daughter

244
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,880
is not a big deal.

245
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,520
Beat him to death.

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
You are going to be beaten to death.

247
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,160
Stop it.

248
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,280
Let's go.

249
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,280
Are you okay?

250
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,800
It's all my fault.

251
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,440
I caused a trouble to Miss.

252
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,120
I'll leave now.

253
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,040
I'll leave now.

254
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,920
Wait.

255
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
Are you here to see me off?

256
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,160
What's wrong with her?

257
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,320
She is like my daughter.

258
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,520
How could she do that?

259
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Is the lady of the mansion married?

260
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,640
She is married to a bad man

261
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
and suffered a lot.

262
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,040
She is not as lucky as you

263
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,480
to choose a man who is more capable.

264
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,000
All right.

265
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,080
Daughter.

266
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,480
It's not good to delay the wedding.

267
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,560
Father.

268
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,400
Miss.

269
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Please take this.

270
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,800
This is the dowry I prepared for you.

271
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,560
She is the princess of Hainan.

272
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,600
She is no different from the princess of Hainan.

273
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
She is beautiful and kind.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
She will be as you wish.

275
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
She will be happy and safe.

276
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,200
All right.

277
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Thank you.

278
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,640
I'll go now.

279
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,800
Let's go.

280
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,880
I bow to you, father.

281
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
Hold on.

282
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
It's rather late now.

283
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,520
I was worried you might haven't become arrogant

284
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,280
but I really appreciate your help.

285
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
And my brother Ilong,

286
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I am not afraid of anything.

287
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,160
You are the most handsome man for me.

288
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,880
I will continue to be grateful for your help.

289
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,440
Thank you.

290
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,040
I will continue to look for someone better.

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
How about you answer his question?

292
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Love and hate are both heavy and heavy.

293
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,920
I remember.

294
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,920
But it sounds like

295
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,640
the pain is more painful than the joy.

296
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,760
Do you think Zhang Juxian

297
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,320
is more painful or more joy?

298
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,360
More joy.

299
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,800
Even if his legs are not disabled,

300
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,680
he has no good luck in his life.

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,400
But when he saw his daughter,

302
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,080
he was the happiest man in the world.

303
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,160
I want to know

304
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,800
what Zhang Juxian means by saying

305
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
parents love each other.

306
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,920
Sorry, Tong Feng.

307
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,640
I shouldn't have been angry with you

308
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
because of a misunderstanding.

309
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,360
I almost hurt you.

310
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,480
So,

311
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,320
the real stars

312
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
are like this.

313
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
Are they more beautiful

314
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,960
than the false shadow of that day?

315
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,800
I think

316
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,800
the stars in the Three-Way River

317
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,000
are more beautiful.

318
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,040
How can the stars in the mortal world

319
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,840
compare with the stars in the human world?

320
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,640
How can the stars in the mortal world

321
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,240
compare with the stars in the Three-Way River?

322
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
Because the stars in the Three-Way River

323
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,600
were painted by Xuanpei.

324
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,600
The stars in the mortal world

325
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
really exist.

326
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,240
So,

327
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,160
I think the stars in the Three-Way River

328
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,760
are more beautiful

329
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,160
even if they are fake.

330
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,640
I see.

331
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,680
I see.

332
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,880
I know why Xuanpei is unhappy.

333
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,080
Because

334
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,800
I gave him the silk sachet

335
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
instead of Xuanpei.

336
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,000
Ma Yichun asked me

337
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,280
to embroider a sachet for Xuanpei.

338
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,160
So, Xuanpei can be happy.

339
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,360
But I always think

340
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,760
that the one for Xuanpei

341
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,120
must be different from others.

342
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,320
The pattern on the sachet

343
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,920
is a fake shadow.

344
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,160
I want to give Xuanpei

345
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,600
something real

346
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,920
that appears in his life.

347
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,560
So,

348
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,240
what is this?

349
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,840
Duck.

350
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,360
It's a duck.

351
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,960
The boss of Guiyun Bridge told me

352
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,080
that ducks are made of two pairs.

353
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,680
So, I bought two ducks.

354
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,120
I wanted to give them to Xuanpei

355
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,360
when I went back to Bilo.
