00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Episode 13

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
What do you want?

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Luckily, I found the clothes I wore for you when I was in class.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,800
I made Xuan Pei angry?

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,600
Teacher Jiu Wei taught me a trick.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,600
He said that Xuan Pei won't be angry if he uses this trick.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Which trick is this?

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
I don't know either.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
It's just a twist.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,000
What good things can there be in the class of Jiu Wei?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
I guess,

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,600
he must be very scared.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Legend of Chusen

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Please hit me.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Please hit me.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,000
Who taught you all this?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Teacher Jiu Wei taught me.

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
He said that if you're angry,

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
you'll be able to laugh easily if I use this trick.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Are you still angry?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,600
Angry?

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you know why I'm angry?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why are you angry?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
From now on, you'll be with other strangers.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you still angry?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Remember, if you make other men angry again,

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
you'll never be able to remember.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Also, you're not allowed to give others candy

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
except for the one you bought.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hurry up.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The good show will be over.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Look, the doors are all closed.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,200
What do you want me to look at?

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Can you think about it?

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,400
You said that if you win three times, you'll be better than the president.

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
That's it.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Bai Yi Chuan.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sir.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
You know the rules, right?

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
I know.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
I've been issued the law of the nine-oil prison ten times.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Twenty times.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Twenty times?

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Your Majesty, the person you're looking for

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
is very likely to be locked in this nine-oil secret room.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Only when the nine-oil father is extremely weak,

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
can the door of the secret room be opened.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I wonder what you're calling the nine-oil prison.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,000
We've never called it the charm of Tong Feng.

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I mean,

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
in order for Tong Feng to have a better chance,

55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
this charm should be continued.

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
This...

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,800
If you don't learn charm, Tong Feng will only be able to be a very, very nameless person.

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm sure Tong Feng won't be willing to.

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
I know.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
How did you know?

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
How did you know?

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Listen to me, everyone.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
Look.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,000
This thing on my face is called the devil's mark.

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,200
I won't hide it from you.

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Actually, I'm a demon.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The devil's mark on my face

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
is the blood flowing in my body.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
They laugh and run.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,400
One day, they will swallow me whole.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't understand.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You don't understand.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
Wait until that day.

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I hope you will remember that

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,000
I, Li Da Fu, am the most beautiful man in the nine-oil prison.

76
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Li Da Fu, the real devil's mark will not be stolen.

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Don't shout. Tong Feng, get lost.

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Tong Feng, if you keep doing this, I'll ask the adults to take care of you.

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,600
When you were 25 years old, Li Da Fu...

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Tong Feng, why are you angry?

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Didn't you promise me not to tell anyone about that?

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
But this...

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
Go buy some food.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Buy whatever you want.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Look at you, you've lost weight.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,600
Really?

87
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,600
By the way, Tong Feng, are you going to class?

88
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,400
If I remember correctly, it's the class of the old man in the Liu Tai Palace.

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
Let me tell you, his class is late.

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It's painful to use the ring.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
Right. I'll go to class.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Go.

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Come on, give me a knife.

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,800
Excuse me.

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Take care.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
I finally sent this little ancestor away.

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
When did you pay?

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Trust me, my ancestors.

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Pay.

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on, everyone has it.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Trust me, I'm the devil's master.

102
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,400
Everyone has this.

103
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Everyone has it.

104
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Sir.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Sir.

106
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,000
How's Tong Feng's class going?

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He's been studying very seriously lately.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
He's been studying very seriously lately.

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
But it's still difficult to get a master's degree.

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,000
Did you get the ring from the Liu Tai Palace?

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
Yes.

112
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,400
The Liu Tai Palace said that the father has been in the army for 1560 years.

113
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
He has taught it hundreds of times.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,400
But Tong Feng has been in the army for 1650 years.

115
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
The Liu Tai Palace said that if he can't remember it,

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
he won't take it even if he goes to the Jiuyou Mountain.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
From now on, I'm the mother beast that was suppressed by 1650 years ago.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sir, is this really good?

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's good.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You've lived for so long.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's been 100 years.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What's the difference between 100 years and less?

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
Who's scolding me?

124
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Xuan Pei.

125
00:08:43,200 --> 00:09:10,800
You wish I could teach you the art of

126
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I asked him what a star is.

127
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,080
He said it's something more beautiful

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,520
and brighter than fireflies.

129
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
Do you like stars that much?

130
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,880
Yes.

131
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
Fireflies are already pretty enough.

132
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Stars?

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,680
What should they look like?

134
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Stars are like gems

135
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,880
in the sky.

136
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
They shine.

137
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,840
They will make up

138
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,080
different shapes.

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Forms?

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
What shapes?

141
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
Like giant dragons,

142
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,520
Qilin,

143
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
running bear,

144
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,800
deer,

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,920
and the legendary Niu Lang's niece.

146
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,600
I've seen them many times, but I can't get used to them.

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,720
It sounds so magical.

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
It's a pity

149
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,480
that I can't see them in the Nether World.

150
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
Do you want to see stars yourself?

151
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,120
But I know there are no stars in the Nether World.

152
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,840
So I won't force you.

153
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
Your wish

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
is my wish.

155
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,160
Is this a star?

156
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,440
It's so beautiful.

157
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,280
It's so beautiful.

158
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Stars in the Nether World

159
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,880
are more beautiful than

160
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,480
the stars that are drawn by magic.

161
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
So how beautiful

162
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,880
are real stars?

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
When you go to the Nether World,

164
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
you can see real stars.

165
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
But

166
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,960
I was alone at that time.

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,080
No one was with me.

168
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,600
When that time comes,

169
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
I will become a gust of wind

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
and stay by your side.

171
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,400
Why does the heart beat so fast?

172
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Is it because of the heart disease in the magic?

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,160
The heart is beating fast.

174
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,560
The heart is beating fast.

175
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,360
All of them.

176
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Look.

177
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,680
The fireflies are dancing.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,360
Why do fireflies

179
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,760
dance every night?

180
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
Every night at noon,

181
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
the fireflies will come out to find their companions.

182
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
They will dance together

183
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,880
to find their companions.

184
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,160
It's so beautiful.

185
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
It's so beautiful.

186
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
It's so beautiful.

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,240
When you go to the Nether World,

188
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,160
you can see real stars.

189
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,720
When that time comes,

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,360
I will become a gust of wind

191
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,480
and stay by your side.

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,640
When that time comes,

193
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
I will become a gust of wind

194
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,400
and stay by your side.

195
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,160
The fireflies are dancing.

196
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,480
The fireflies will come out to find their companions.

197
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,320
The fireflies will come out to find their companions.

198
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,280
Your Highness, I finally found you.

199
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Well...

200
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
I didn't see anything.

201
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,560
You guys continue.

202
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,520
You guys continue.

203
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,480
Wait.

204
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,000
What's the matter?

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,920
My lord.

206
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,080
Yuan Cangshan and...

207
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,600
Don't worry.

208
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,280
I'll be right back.

209
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,920
Xuan Pei.

210
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,360
What's wrong with Yuan Cangshan?

211
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,240
It's okay.

212
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,480
I can handle it myself.

213
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,640
I'll send you back to the villa.

214
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,240
Xiao Mengzi.

215
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,240
I haven't heard from you for days.

216
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,040
You didn't reply to my messages.

217
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,640
Don't mention it.

218
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,440
The Yin-Teng formation is very bad these days.

219
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm losing my connection.

220
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,560
When I get back,

221
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,360
I'll tell Duoming

222
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,760
that the Yin-Teng formation is weak here.

223
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Come and fix it.

224
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,800
Where are you?

225
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
The formation is so bad.

226
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,720
Yuan Cangshan.

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Xiao Mengzi.

228
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,480
Leave here now.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,040
Why is the formation suddenly losing its connection?

230
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,600
Xiao Mengzi.

231
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm here.

232
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm here.

233
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm here.

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,640
I'm here.

235
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm here.

236
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,080
Where is the formation?

237
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,680
Xiao Mengzi.

238
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
Xiao Mengzi.

239
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh, no.

240
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
Xiao Mengzi must be in danger.

241
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
Long time no see.

242
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,480
Xiao Mengzi.

243
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,720
You must be okay.

244
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,000
Who are you?

245
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,720
Don't you recognize me?

246
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
We're old friends.

247
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,400
Xiao Mengzi.

248
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,160
I'll save you.

249
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,560
It's you.

250
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,320
You're really a genius.

251
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,920
Shen Pei.

252
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,480
Shen Pei.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,640
Go.

254
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Shen Pei.

255
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,880
Tao Feng.

256
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,800
Are you hurt?

257
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,640
I'm fine.

258
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,880
Your arm seems to be injured.

259
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,640
It's okay.

260
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
It's just a small wound.

261
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,680
Let's go home.

262
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,640
But Xiao Mengzi is injured, too.

263
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
Soul-seeking Soul.

264
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm here.

265
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Send Meng Dihua back to the Hall of Emptiness.

266
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,760
Yes.

267
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
Let's go home.

268
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,160
It's been 3,000 years.

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,640
He hasn't changed at all.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The End

271
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,120
Shen Pei.

272
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,760
Let me see if your wound is better.

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,920
I'm not hurt.

274
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,880
You're lying.

275
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,520
I saw the snake bite your arm.

276
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,880
You go out first.

277
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,040
Let me see your arm.

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm not hurt.

279
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
You go out first.

280
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,760
If you don't let me see,

281
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I'll see it myself.

282
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm taking a bath.

283
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,080
Your arm is not injured.

284
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,680
Did I see it wrong?

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,440
Where did you get hurt by the snake?

286
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,640
Tong Feng.

287
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,600
Tong Feng.

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
I heard you saw Xiang Liu.

289
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,600
Did you get bitten?

290
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,280
Let me see

291
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,600
how the snake bit you.

292
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Tong Feng.

293
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,760
Don't you dare harm me.

294
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,480
You...

295
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,480
Have you скаж scgpin.

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,800
You...

297
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,600
Have you staggering spirit?

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The wind blows, the night is cold.

299
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The night is cold.

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The night is cold.

301
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The night is cold.

302
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The night is cold.

303
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The night is cold.

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The night is cold.

305
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The night is cold.

306
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How can I exchange for thoughts?

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What does three lives mean?

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The fireworks are shining.

309
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I chase after the bright lights.

310
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The Long Ballad
