00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
From the beginning,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you and Xuan Pei are destined to be together.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You didn't know love before,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and missed the right time.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now that you know,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you should cherish your future life.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you still think

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I miss the past,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that's a misjudgment of your good friend.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Little Prince.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Tong Feng,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
do you know

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
what is the most precious thing in the eyes of mortals?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's true love.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Xu Jing has spent his whole life to prove it.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's true love.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But the love between men and women is true love.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The love between friends is also true love.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The meeting between the wind and the dew

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
is not the meeting between men and women

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that can win over countless people.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Not only the meeting between men and women is true love,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
our meeting is also true love.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Silly girl.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In my eyes,

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
you are always more important than Xuan Pei.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Little Prince.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right, all right, all right.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't cry, don't cry.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
See how your strawberry is made for me.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If I knew you were like this,

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I would have told you earlier.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Otherwise, I would have eaten this strawberry long ago.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Look.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It looks good.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It looks good.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How is it?

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
One more.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are quite a man today.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Brother Chun is here.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What can I do for you, sir?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who knows?

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You have been so mysterious recently.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You always show a strange smile.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have not seen a smile

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in your face for thousands of years.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are so scary.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are so scary.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Speaking of this,

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I remember one thing.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Our sir has always been very strong.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He never lost his temper.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That day, I was a little careless.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I mistook a man for a woman.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I was supposed to be beaten.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But sir didn't beat me.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He even asked me if I was tired recently.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The magic on my face

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is the power of fire and dust.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's gentle.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sir, you won't look at me, right?

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are so clever.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sir, you won't look at me, right?

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You should be ashamed.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Duoming, you are so narcissistic.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How did you live for thousands of years

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
without being beaten?

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to invite us to...

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It should be for the Jiuyou Human Resources

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Professional Skills Competition

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
2682th Heaven Realm, Demon Realm

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Earth Specialist Exchange Conference.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's do it.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What is that?

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It might not be.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
After all, I asked you to come.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's not something that's full of wisdom.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Old man, what do you mean?

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't have wisdom.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are here to discuss

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
such a stupid thing.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sir asked us to come today

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
for the sake of Tong Feng.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You don't have to think about it.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are so sincere.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Impossible.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Absolutely impossible.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You are not a man who

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
has no evidence for beauty.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What if I am?

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you are,

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I will go to the mountain area to grow...

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sir.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sir.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sir.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I am that kind of person.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sir, this...

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What do you mean?

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I have a friend

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
who wants to take his beloved girl out for a trip.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But he doesn't know

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
what the women in the stone temple like.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So he came to discuss with you.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sir, the friend you are talking about

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
is not your friend.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The girl in the stone temple likes...

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It depends on

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the period of the girl.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She likes to play the kite and go to the lantern show.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She likes to watch movies.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She likes to watch new things.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Which one do you think

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
my friend's beloved girl likes?

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Chi.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's really Chi.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Madam.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Madam.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Madam.

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Romantic.

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So my subject

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is someone who doesn't know romance.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are a group of single dogs

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
who are here.

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sir, listen to me.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Watch a movie.

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The theater is new.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The girl your friend likes

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
must have never been there.

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The man in the mortal world dates a woman.

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Usually, he will choose a movie

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
called horror movie.

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Under the scary atmosphere,

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the woman will be frightened

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and hide in the man's arms.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then he will take her down.

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The soul of the nine-tailed fox

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
is buried under the group of nine-tailed fox.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As expected, everything has its own reason.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The nine-tailed fox must choose a movie

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
for his friend

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
which is the most scary

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and the most frightening

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
for the woman.

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't want to be a movie star.

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't want to see

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
a man in the theater.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:17,460
You can be a

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ghost.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The theater is new.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I'm not a ghost.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Rice-flour?

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is the legendary rice-flour.

158
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Xuanmei,

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
why do you take a flower?

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
To decorate.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tong Feng,

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
this movie is a horror movie.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you are afraid,

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you can tell me.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's just a horror movie.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's there to be afraid of?

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Aren't we the most frightening

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
souls in the mortal world?

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean if.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No if.

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's started.

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If he doesn't play the normal way,

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
then he will have to

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
wrong your friend.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's okay.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Be good.

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
These are all fake.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's fake.

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be good.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have to cut

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
that scary place.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
My lord,

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you can take

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the pain of the end.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The rain outside is so heavy.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I just came back

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to tell you.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I told you to be careful.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You came back

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to save me?

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I miss you so much.

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But I can't

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
let you go.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't let you go.

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't let you go.

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't let you go.

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But why?

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't ask questions

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
at this time.

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What are they doing?

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You just need to know

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that the rain is not heavy.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But my heart is beating fast.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Tong Feng,

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
don't you think I'm in danger?

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How can you do this?

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Where are you in danger?

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm in danger everywhere.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm in danger.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm in danger.

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm in danger.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm in danger.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm in danger.

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm in danger.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm in danger.

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm in danger.

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm in danger.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm in danger.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm in danger.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm in danger.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm in danger.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm in danger.

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm in danger.

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm in danger.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm in danger.

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm in danger.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm in danger.

229
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm in danger.

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm in danger.

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm in danger.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm in danger.

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm in danger.

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm in danger.

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm in danger.

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm in danger.

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm in danger.

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm in danger.

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm in danger.

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm in danger.

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm in danger.

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm in danger.

243
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm in danger.

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why are you here?

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't ask me this kind of question now.

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,440
But I want to be different from Li Bufu.

247
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
Waking up.

248
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,560
Xuan Pei.

249
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,760
I'll be responsible for you.

250
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
Why don't you stay up for a little longer?

251
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,200
I had morning sickness.

252
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
You were busy at morning applause?

253
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm out my真的是 time.

254
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,080
I missed you so much that night.

255
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,360
I missed you very much.

256
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,560
I missed you too.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm not going.

258
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,240
No.

259
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,320
Today is the class of Mr. Liu Tai Gong.

260
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,040
If I don't go, he'll be angry.

261
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,280
Don't go.

262
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Sleep with me for a while.

263
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,600
How can you sleep?

264
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,120
You hate me for skipping classes and missing classes the most.

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,520
It's okay.

266
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,680
I'll make up for you in these classes.

267
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,320
But today is French class.

268
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
Can you speak French?

269
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Yes.

270
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
I can do anything.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,760
Shen Pei.

272
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,280
Do you remember this ring?

273
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,240
I heard it from Wan Wan when I was in the mortal world.

274
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I heard that people in the mortal world

275
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,760
will exchange rings with each other

276
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,120
for hundreds of years.

277
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,240
We must have rings for thousands of years.

278
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,960
Then you must be responsible for me for thousands of years.

279
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,480
I will be responsible for you.

280
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm not going to be responsible for you.

281
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,160
I will be responsible for you.

282
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,640
Then be responsible for me now.

283
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,600
What is the Three-Divine Competition?

284
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,960
Did Mr. Liu tell you about the Three-Divine Competition?

285
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
The Three-Divine Competition

286
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,320
is the best competition in the three thousand years.

287
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,600
At that time,

288
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
the Celestial Realm, the Celestial Tribe, the Demon Realm, the Demon Tribe,

289
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,560
and the Nine Soul Breaks

290
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,080
will be held together.

291
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,040
Are there many people who want to win the Three-Divine Competition?

292
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
Of course.

293
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
The first place in the Three-Divine Competition

294
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,440
will be awarded with a grand prize.

295
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
A grand prize?

296
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,800
I've decided.

297
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,680
I want to participate in the competition.

298
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I want to be the first.

299
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,680
Your Excellency.

300
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,040
The Jiuyou Human Resources Professional Skills Competition

301
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,720
is held at the site of the 2682th

302
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
Celestial Realm, Demon Realm, and the Specialty Exchange Conference.

303
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
It has been successfully held.

304
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,560
Gao Hui and Duoming did a good job

305
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
to give them a chance to win.

306
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,120
Your Excellency seems to be in a good mood recently.

307
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,840
Really?

308
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,840
Your Excellency,

309
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
you should pay attention to your health.

310
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,800
Don't be obsessed with women.

311
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,560
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

312
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,960
What did you do last night?

313
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,160
You're so sleepy.

314
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,800
Liu Taiguo.

315
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,760
You can leave.

316
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,840
I'll take care of this class.

317
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,320
But...

318
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,600
Why did you make Miss Liu angry again?

319
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,320
I fell asleep by accident.

320
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,400
Xuanpei, what are you doing here?

321
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Didn't we agree to

322
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,080
give you a lesson?

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,520
If Xuanpei gave me a lesson,

324
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,600
I would be awake immediately.

325
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,400
This French is so difficult.

326
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,760
I'll teach you this sentence

327
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
at the end of this lesson.

328
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
What does this sentence mean?

329
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,120
It means

330
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
do you like the food I cook?

331
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,920
What should I say if I like it?

332
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,280
I'll teach you next class.

333
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,480
Come on.

334
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,200
I can't stand this old man.

335
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
If I die one day,

336
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,080
please open my heart.

337
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,560
You'll see the words

338
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
written in gold on it.

339
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,440
I still love you.

340
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,920
Who is this?

341
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
The flowers are from Saspia.

342
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,840
It's too old.

343
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm not good at cooking.

344
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,080
I need to learn from you.

345
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,440
You're so lucky.

346
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,560
Let's go.

347
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,280
Let's go to my room.

348
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,520
I've learned some new cakes recently.

349
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,040
It'll be done in an hour.

350
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,360
You deserve the delivery.

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,640
Here you are.

352
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,600
Xian Pei.

353
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,080
If you miss me,

354
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,160
just use the sound buttsCooling Mirror to find me.

355
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,560
Sound buttsCooling Mirror.

356
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I just learned it.

357
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,760
Are you in class?

358
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,680
Yes.

359
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,360
Today is Teacher Liu Taigong's class.

360
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,840
I don't dare to skip class.

361
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,200
Well,

362
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,760
have a good class.

363
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,160
Bye.

364
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,680
I have to tell you

365
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,200
the three principles of the three-part class.

366
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
The first one is

367
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
the three-part class.

368
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
The second one is

369
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
the three-part class.

370
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
The third one is

371
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
the three-part class.

372
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
The fourth one is

373
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
the three-part class.

374
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I have to tell you

375
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
the first thing in the three-part class.

376
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,400
The fate is uncertain.

377
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,400
How can I exchange my thoughts?

378
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,400
What does the three-part class look like?

379
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,400
The fireworks are blazing.

380
