00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
Yes.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
The third time is gone.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,600
The third time is not enough.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Do you know how hard it is to live a life of 30 years?

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,800
That's why I not only want him to take his memory to reincarnate,

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
I also want to change his fate.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,400
You're not changing his fate.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,400
You're changing my fate.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,200
You're smashing my rice bowl.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
What are you afraid of?

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,600
It's no big deal. You move and I'll split my rice for you.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
We're souls. We only know how to get greedy and not hungry.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,800
It's okay if we don't eat.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm just afraid that there will be no place to live.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
What if the master blames us?

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,800
You have to split my house and I have to provide my daily sugar supply.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
No problem.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's right. We're souls.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
We only know how to get greedy and not hungry.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:39,520
Ini

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,400
It definitely hasn't been enough for you.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,000
You're 소중하�Excuse me.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,600
It's really fine even though I have to fill in the memory.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
We need to maintain social distance to keep you safe.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
For的人類 av zastvara.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,460
Shun Pei.

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,420
Let's get back to business.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,120
I want to ask you something.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,480
As souls we can

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,060
do nothing in life?

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,380
Yes.

35
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,240
Souls don't trapped by virtue

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,840
or regime.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,480
Of course, lay people can't do so.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,780
Super-safe Straight Drink Hangout

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,980
usually offers perfect szangfei

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
instead of those

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,780
who want to forget theirorum.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm not a good cook.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Actually,

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,840
those souls who are so worried

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,960
can't get used to it.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
They sometimes have a meal.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
But you and I

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
don't need to eat at all, right?

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,280
Even if we have to cook,

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
we can use magic.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Then why

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,400
do you have to cook every day?

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,920
Is the plum cake I made today

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,880
delicious?

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,840
Yes, it's delicious.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
It's very delicious.

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
What about the boiled fish

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,120
and the sweet and sour ribs you made yesterday?

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,880
It's great.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Is it delicious?

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Before that,

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
what about the fried chicken

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
and the fried prawns?

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm so bored.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
That's the reason.

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes.

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
Is it because I'm bored?

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,880
We live in the same world every day.

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,960
We forget time after a long time.

70
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
If something different happens every day,

71
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,760
even a meal

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,600
will give us a little hope,

73
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,560
right?

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
It's rare to get off work so early today.

75
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
How about

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
we go to Xiaomengzi's shop

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,880
and have a drink?

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,080
I'll go as soon as you treat us.

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,480
I'll treat you.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
It's the first time

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,920
you've treated us for a thousand years.

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Then let's go.

83
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,400
Go.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,240
Go.

85
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Go.

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,280
I'll go.

87
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Go.

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
Just go to the market.

89
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,880
Leave the 37th jade to me.

90
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
I'm not afraid of the 37th jade.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
It's my memory.

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,640
You don't have to drink the Wanchuan soup.

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,000
But you have to remember

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
that you can't reveal

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,640
anything to the mortal world in the world of Jiuyou.

96
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,520
Thank you, miss.

97
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't be like this.

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,840
Miss.

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
I want to ask you one more question.

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
You told me last time

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,440
that my daughter is safe for the rest of her life.

102
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,520
Is it true?

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,080
Don't you worry about

104
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,200
your own fate at all?

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,360
You used the 7th jade

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
to exchange for another chance to meet again.

107
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,880
In theory,

108
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
you will live a very hard life.

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,840
No matter how hard it is,

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,560
I feel the same.

111
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Actually,

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
I don't quite understand.

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,800
Is this the love

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
in the play?

115
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,080
There are many kinds of love in this world.

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,920
There are fatherly love, motherly love,

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,800
daughterly love,

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
couple's love,

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
and friend's love.

120
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,320
Each kind of love is different.

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
It's so complicated.

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,080
It's not complicated.

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,200
You will feel it slowly.

124
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,600
Because love is different from love.

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,600
I will think about it.

126
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
You should go to the轉世 now.

127
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I think Ma Yichun

128
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,720
can't hold it anymore.

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,400
You should go now.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
856.

131
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,960
856.

132
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,320
Basketball Girl.

133
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,160
Sing you another ten,

134
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:43,720
you'll have something to eat and rest.

135
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm did to Ma Yichun

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
as a friend's love.

137
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
How about Xuan Pei?

138
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,880
Fouai.

139
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,880
You scared me.

140
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,240
You walk without making any sound.

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,000
You're so...

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
You're so focused.

143
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,360
Of course you can't find me.

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Well, I have something to do.

145
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
I'll go now.

146
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,840
As expected,

147
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,000
I and Wang Chuan Tang

148
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
will affect the 37th jade.

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,520
What's going on?

150
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,840
The 66th transformation.

151
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
Zhang Juxian.

152
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,360
Born in Li Dynasty.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,080
18 years.

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
Even Emperor Dong Hua

155
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,640
is naked now.

156
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,080
Award A M Kay.

157
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,120
Anything serious happened to Jiuyou recently?

158
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,000
No.

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,160
She'll chance and win right now.

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,800
Sir,

161
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
what's your business today?

162
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,880
I just remembered that there's something left in the cellar.

163
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Come with me.

164
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,520
The 66th transformation.

165
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
I finally got it.

166
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
The 66th transformation.

167
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,800
You...

168
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
Why is it you again?

169
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
I saw it all.

170
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,600
You caught me again.

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,720
Since I caught you,

172
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,520
do you want me to deal with you?

173
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
How?

174
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,560
I want something.

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,840
Something?

176
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,000
What is it?

177
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
It's too expensive.

178
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
If so,

179
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,560
it will make you feel better.

180
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,400
You...

181
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,400
It's acceptable to be a little expensive.

182
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,560
I want...

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,200
you.

184
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,560
What do you want me to do?

185
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,320
I want you to embroider a sachet for me.

186
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,440
A sachet?

187
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,640
I don't know how to embroider a sachet.

188
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,000
Little Mengzi, please teach me.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,680
I don't know how to embroider a sachet.

190
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,720
Look, my hands are so rusty.

191
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,040
I don't know how to embroider a sachet.

192
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
Go find a soulmate.

193
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
I guess only he can do it.

194
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
Only he can do it?

195
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,840
I can only find him.

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,520
Brother Gouwen, when will you stop?

197
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,320
Look, I embroidered it.

198
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,280
You...

199
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,560
You're a master of drug-reducing.

200
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,240
So annoying.

201
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,440
Why did he have to make me embroider a sachet?

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,760
I should have asked him to do it.

203
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,680
So annoying.

204
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,720
So annoying.

205
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm so annoyed.

206
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm so annoyed.

207
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm so annoyed.

208
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,840
I'm so annoyed.

209
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm so annoyed.

210
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm so annoyed.

211
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
I'm so annoyed.

212
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
I'm so annoyed.

213
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm so annoyed.

214
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm so annoyed.

215
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,200
So annoying.

216
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
So annoying.

217
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,920
There's something more annoying than

218
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
going to a history class.

219
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
So annoying.

220
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,360
Tong Feng, what are you doing?

221
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm embroidering a sachet.

222
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
Why are you embroidering this for me?

223
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
It's so tiring.

224
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
So stupid.

225
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
But I don't wear sachets

226
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,360
as usual.

227
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
I know.

228
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,160
You don't usually wear them.

229
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,640
I can wear this belt.

230
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,280
But the color...

231
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Have some food.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,800
No.

233
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
What pattern are you embroidering?

234
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,880
It's taught by the Soul-saving Princess.

235
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,480
She asked me to embroider a puppy with the embroidery of the dust.

236
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,200
Dog?

237
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,160
This Soul-saving Princess

238
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
will be crazy.

239
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
But I'm still

240
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,360
embroidering the pattern next to it.

241
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,840
Xuan Pei,

242
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,240
which color do you think is better?

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,040
Purple.

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,360
Purple?

245
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,520
Sir,

246
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,120
why did you ask me to come?

247
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,480
I heard Tong Feng

248
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,640
is looking for you to learn embroidery.

249
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,480
Yes.

250
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
That idiot

251
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,520
was forced to learn it

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
after being hit hundreds of times.

253
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,120
He won't give up

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
even if he does this?

255
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,560
I don't know what he's up to.

256
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,480
He insists on embroidering.

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,400
I said he's stupid.

258
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,120
He doesn't know how to do it.

259
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
He's anxious.

260
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
It's so hard to embroider a dog.

261
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,560
He must be having a hard time.

262
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
It's the simplest one.

263
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,960
There's no other one

264
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,920
that's easier than a dog.

265
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,320
Then why don't you embroider a mandarin duck?

266
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,600
A mandarin duck?

267
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
That's the most difficult one.

268
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,920
How can he embroider that?

269
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,040
Embroidery

270
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,800
is not about the form, but the form.

271
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Do you understand?

272
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
Yes.

273
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,960
I understand.

274
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,760
Good.

275
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,920
What do you understand?

276
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,040
I don't understand anything.

277
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,800
It's okay.

278
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,560
You can go back.

279
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,280
Come on.

280
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
I'll go to your rouge shop later.

281
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
Take ten of your lipstick

282
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,040
and send them to the bureau.

283
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,880
Sir,

284
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,480
are you going to fire us?

285
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Before you fire us,

286
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,120
It's just this.

287
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,280
Please take care.

288
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,880
Jingxi.

289
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,520
Jingxi.

290
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,120
Jingxi.

291
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,080
Jingxi.

292
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,600
Jingxi.

293
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Jingxi.

294
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,360
Jingxi.

295
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
Jingxi.

296
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Jingxi.

297
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
Jingxi.

298
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,080
Jingxi.

299
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,200
All right.

301
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,680
In order to thank you for fixing the sachet,

302
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,400
I'll treat you to the most delicious

303
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
of the Seven-Century Soul Land in Guiyun Bridge.

304
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,280
How about it?

305
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,640
You two,

306
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,680
send the things back to the cellar first.

307
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,680
We can tell by the nose that

308
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,040
our clothes are the cheapest.

309
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,080
Sir,

310
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,560
what material do you want?

311
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,320
Glossy silk or water-stained cloth?

312
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,000
We have all kinds of materials here.

313
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,200
It's okay.

314
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
You can match them with your clothes.

315
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,200
Here we are.

316
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,200
Take a look.

317
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,680
Which one do you like?

318
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,200
This one.

319
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,760
This one?

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Boss.

321
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,640
Okay.

322
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,400
Look at you.

323
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
You look like a noble god.

324
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,200
Even if the god sees you,

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,040
he'll still look at you.

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
I've been looking for you for a thousand years.

327
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Sir, have a good day.

328
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,960
So,

329
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,120
it's for her.

330
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,400
Your Highness.

331
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,200
Your Highness.

332
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Your Highness.

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,760

Your Highness.

338

Your Highness.

342
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,880
Your Highness.

343
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,800
