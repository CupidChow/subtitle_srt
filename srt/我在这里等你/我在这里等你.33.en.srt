1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What was the environment we went to before?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It was the script that was already written.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The script was changed to a fantasy.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The life was cut into an illusion.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
After completing the script that was already written, it would return to the Nine Yin Sect.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the truth of the cultivation and the night.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The script that was already written?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just like Lin Qing, her original script was to become a military law.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But she didn't have a choice.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In fact, she could have chosen.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Huang Ruonian, she could have chosen not to hurt Xu Jing.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But she still chose to hurt.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Everyone's life will have countless choices.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And these choices are made based on their own will.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The soul of the Bamboo Soul Forest has already noticed the illusion of cultivation.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She didn't want to enter the fantasy.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So she hid in the Bamboo Soul Forest.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I secretly arranged for Mingxiang to go to the Soul-Gathering Sect

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to protect the soul of the Bamboo Soul Forest.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But who would have thought

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that I would need too much spiritual power to create a fake fantasy?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was still a little lacking.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Xuanbai, how did you come here all these years?

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You've been using the Nine Demons for 100,000 years.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I can't protect the mortal world.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I must protect the Nine Demons.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You told me that you wanted to become a god.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You wanted to live your life like an ordinary person.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You wanted to experience the heavenly and the mortal world.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You said that it doesn't matter if you have more hardships.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Because in life,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the most important thing is to be able to live.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because life is full of hardships.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But now,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
cultivation has already become a fantasy.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know how to face you.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know how to mention it to you.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you thinking about?

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How can I blame you?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Besides, we work together.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We can definitely find a way to restart the mortal world.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Isn't it?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We will definitely restart the mortal world.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're here.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
These dishes were made by Xuanpei and me.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You don't have to be polite. Enjoy it.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're showing off now?

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, Tong Feng.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No matter what, I'm your fantasy lover.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have to be careful.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've come out of the fantasy now.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tong Feng,

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Si Mo and I are going to restart the mortal world today.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I will cooperate with him to manage the mortal world.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Tong Feng, remember what I told you.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The mortal world will always be your home.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I won't see you off then.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We should go back to the heavenly realm.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are your plans?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mingxia,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll leave the matter of the nine-yellow-tree tree to you.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Madam and I are going out for a walk.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,780
We're going to the

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xuanpei, you're really good at playing.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If we don't be husband and wife anymore,

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we can open a hair salon.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
With you,

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you can kill 80% of the hair-raising customers.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How is that possible?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll only chase you for the rest of my life.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Lin Chanshu.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on, come on.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,920
Closer. Closer.

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,680
Yes. Yes.

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,400
Master Liu is so angry.

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,040
He said we are all the masters of Jiuyou.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,640
We can't be so rude.

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,560
Rudeness

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
is a lock given by the world.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
No need to be rude.

87
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,080
Master Liu's soul

88
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,280
is so ancient.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
He has been targeting the Nine Teachers all these years.

90
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
Does he want to target the Nine Teachers

91
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,160
or to attract the attention of the Nine Tail?

92
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,240
I guess he can't tell.

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
Isn't there an electric bulb in this mortal world?

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
Why is there a candlelight dinner?

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,920
Because of this,

96
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,280
we can see each other's faces clearly.

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm so tired.

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,280
This flower is...

99
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,840
It's for you.

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,680
Let's go.

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,240
Aren't we...

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
Not here. We're wrong.

103
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,080
It's this one.

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
I said it's not.

105
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,440
It's not.

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Okay.

107
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,000
It's not.

108
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Didn't we agree to have a day-off together?

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,520
Why are you still sleeping?

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
I don't feel like getting up.

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Xuan Bai.

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,240
Can you adjust the room a little bit

113
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
and let me sleep for a while?

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
You're so silly.

115
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Xuan Bai.

116
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
The scenery today is so beautiful.

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,360
It's good that you like it.

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
When you were a husband,

119
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,160
you got up at 10 a.m. every day.

120
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
But now it's already 4 a.m.

121
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
It's an hour late.

122
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,840
It's two hours.

123
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
My math is not good at all.

124
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
They must know

125
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
that it's because I slept late.

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
It's so embarrassing.

127
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
Why are we so close

128
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,640
when it's embarrassing?

129
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Right.

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,920
We're husband and wife.

131
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,040
Even if they have a problem,

132
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,560
they can't say anything.

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,200
list leaving

134
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,360
Demon Realm!

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,240
The終界的

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,040
Do you guys listen to me?

137
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Xuan Mei and I

138
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
wed off together just like shot.

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
No one can change it.

140
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Not today.

141
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,120
Not in the future.

142
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
Look.

143
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,840
The secret of the long-distance travel between you and Tong Feng.

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,520
Today, I saw the scenery with my husband.

145
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,480
The scenery is so beautiful.

146
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Lian Hua.

147
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
Isn't this the secret of the long-distance travel?

148
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,560
Why are you here?

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
Mengdi Flower.

150
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,920
This is the heaven's land.

151
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,520
You can have everything you want.

152
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
Last time I took a picture with Tong Feng.

153
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,160
It seems to be a long time ago.

154
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,760
Tian Xuan's comment has been deleted by Xuan Pei.

155
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,280
What's so good about it?

156
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
Xuan Pei is so beautiful.

157
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,680
Si Mo's comment has been deleted by Xuan Pei.

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
Xuan Pei.

159
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,160
What do you think is the difference between sunrise and sunset?

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,320
When sunrise, there is no rebirth.

161
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,840
When sunset, there is no end.

162
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,680
When sunrise, there is no end.

163
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Tong Feng.

164
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,640
You know I'm about to die, right?

165
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,680
Yes.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,320
4000 years ago, you were in the deep of the abyss.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
How could I let you go like this?

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
You can change your destiny.

169
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,600
You can change your way of life.

170
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
I just want you to live.

171
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,160
When I learned the magic of longevity,

172
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,920
the price of resurrection is to let me die.

173
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,480
At that moment, I was in a daze.

174
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,120
I was afraid you would hate me.

175
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,480
I couldn't be with you forever.

176
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,040
But I still did it.

177
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
I caught you.

178
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,200
If you don't catch me,

179
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
I won't hate you.

180
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
I will find another black cat

181
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,720
a thousand years ago.

182
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,400
There are not so many black cats in this world.

183
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,640
Only I, the only black cat in this world,

184
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,600
is willing to wait for you forever.

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
My lady.

186
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,960
A mortal can only catch time

187
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,680
for a few decades.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,160
To pursue beauty.

189
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
Why don't we

190
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
catch the last time?

191
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,320
Come on.

192
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,680
Come on.

193
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Why did you say that?

194
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,400
Honestly,

195
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,120
there is no end to me.

196
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,640
Every day,

197
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,880
I have been afraid

198
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
So I secretly arranged a name and a surname

199
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
to help you learn the skills.

200
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Why

201
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
didn't you wake me up?

202
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Because I was afraid

203
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
that four thousand years ago

204
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
that dream

205
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
is still in front of me.

206
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Because I was afraid that you knew that I revived you

207
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
but left without you.

208
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
I was afraid that this was an unchangeable fate.

209
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
I want to be with you

210
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
forever.

211
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
I wanted to be with you

212
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
forever.

213
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
But I couldn't catch the time

214
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
and find the so-called fate.

215
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Time

216
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
is not enough.

217
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Two nights

218
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Two nights

219
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
What's wrong?

220
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Who is this?

221
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Sir

222
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Tai Gu

223
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Senior

224
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Senior

225
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Senior

226
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Senior

227
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
What's wrong with her?

228
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
What should we do?

229
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
We

230
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
What happened to us just now?

231
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Sir

232
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Something happened to you.

233
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Let's go and have a look.

234
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
No

235
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
The smell of the wine is gone.

236
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Something is wrong.

237
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Tai Gu

238
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
This

239
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Why is it open again?

240
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Sir

241
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Sir

242
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Sir

243
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Sir

244
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Sir

245
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Sir
