1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Are you angry because I went to the remote mountains?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Not really.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Not really?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do you know how dangerous the murderer is?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even if I don't have the full confidence to subdue him,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you still go alone.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If I'm late, you...

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I know.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I went because I was worried about Xiao Mengzi.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I know I was wrong.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll do it again.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know. I know.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll listen to you.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But Xuanpei,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I think that murderer seems to know me.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When he saw me, he said,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it's you.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That murderer has been trapped for thousands of years.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He has lost his mind. You don't need to listen to him.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's getting late.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You should go back and rest.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You still have class tomorrow.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're hurt?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tell me.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How did you get hurt?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The perfume came out.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I almost bit myself.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thanks to Tong Feng for blocking me.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It hurts a little?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thanks.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're welcome.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're always fighting with the perfume.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's worth it for a beautiful man like me to apply medicine for you.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's not me fighting.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's Tong Feng.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But talking about Tong Feng,

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
when I was fighting with the perfume today,

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I seemed to see a brilliant gold light in his body.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Gold light?

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tong Feng is just an ordinary person.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why does he have gold light?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I also feel strange.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Maybe I was wrong.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But that perfume is also strange.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He seems to know me.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He knows you?

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He said it's been a long time since we met.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I've never seen him.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm here to leave my schedule for next week.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Stop complaining.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're here to have a good chance.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dongming, what's wrong with you?

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you having fun with those little cats in the illusion?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ma Yi Chun, you're still young.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The children in the illusion never thought that

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the one who is playing games with them now

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is the one who is the nine-spirit, Dongming.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't experience the excitement that this stimulates.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop playing.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There are souls in the mortal world who want to enter the nine-spirit.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You have to bring the soul here.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I haven't seen the soul of the soul-gathering brother and the soul-gathering brother.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is the soul-gathering brother magnificent?

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The soul-gathering brother is fierce.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then, the soul-gathering brother is also fierce.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You said that it's an old trick.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, just use electronic reverse.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, it's all in the nine-spirit.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Xiu Chun.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What else?

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If we go to the illusion with a soul,

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll be like the soul-gathering brother.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now, we don't need to use the five-knife to shoot.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We are civil officials.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I think

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it's better to be more handsome like before.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's handsome.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you crazy?

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are here to pretend to be a god.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sir, is this still a high?

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The skin of the water is tender.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The older the skin, the more delicate the skin.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The god's choice is yours.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Who is this?

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Who is this?

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You don't even know him.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He is the hottest star king in the heaven.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Tian Xuan.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now, he is the main actor

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
in the three-dimensional drama of the Three Kingdoms.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He is the one who plays the role.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I haven't heard of it.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's still not allowed for you to see it.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So many?

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
When can I finish reading it?

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you want to know

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
why you were so excited that night?

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Not thatSecret Sagittarius ะตัะต

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is the one.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This takoyaki is a challenge.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Qingcu.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Load it first.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Chief.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm going to be angry at you.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm going to be angry at you.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You should study the drawing books.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But don't let the master know

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that I'm going to show you this kind of drawing books.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Brother Gong,

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
if the master knows that I'm going to show you this kind of drawing books,

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
my iron rice bowl

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
will probably be broken.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are not Linglong.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why are you exactly like her?

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why are you exactly like her?

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am Linglong.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am really Linglong.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are definitely not Linglong.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can fool my eyes,

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
but you can't fool my heart.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Tingting.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
My heart is not beating.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Only Linglong,

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
only her,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
can change my heart.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you understand?

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The Heavenly Emperor is also more clever.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't talk to me.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't talk to me.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm not clever.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm clever.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I like it.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The Heavenly Emperor likes Linglong.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So he will be happy when he sees Linglong.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He will not be happy when he sees the person who disguises as Linglong.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You like the master.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So you will be happy.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I like Xuan Pei.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But I also like you.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And Niu, Xiao Meng,

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Gouheng, Duoming,

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and Jiuwei and Liu Taigong.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't want to talk to you.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can think about it.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There are still a lot of things to learn.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ma Yichun.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
my heart is beating

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
when I see Xuan Pei?

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Like

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and like

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
are the same.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But they are different.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
My heart

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
is beating so fast.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
My face is so painful.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I seem to

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
dream of Xuan Pei

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
asking me to be his bride.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
how Xuan Pei's muscles

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
will feel

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
when he sees me.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why did I drool?

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Drool?

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My muscles?

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Tong Feng!

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm here to see you, Tong Feng!

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Tong Feng!

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Tong Feng!

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why am I in the Three-Dimension River again?

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why am I in the Three-Dimension River again?

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry. Everyone has it.

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Come on.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A handsome and kind

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
man like me

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
is hard to find.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, a man as confident and confident as you

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
is really hard to find.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tong Feng, come here.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Tong Feng,

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
tell me the truth.

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you learn some super high magic?

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Magic?

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What magic can I learn?

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I went to you a few days ago.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Every time I fell,

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was blown away by a gust of wind.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Didn't you learn some super high magic

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and blow me away?

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It must be Xuan Pei.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Dapu,

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can learn magic without you.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's right.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's wrong with the gust of wind?

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Could it be

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
a ghost?

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a ghost.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, we're in the Netherworld.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It can't be a ghost.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then...

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What about...

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
A human?

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Dapu, you're so smart.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I know.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Dapu,

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Xiao Mengzi asked me to try some new dishes.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go together.

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, okay. I haven't eaten for a day.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's go.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You guys go ahead. I'll go eat.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You...

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I...

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm a demon.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You know demons?

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I have to tell you,

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm born with a demon soul.

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's because

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
there's a demon blood in my body.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The one who's waiting for me

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
will take me back to the Netherworld.

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This feeling of

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
anger,

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
this sense of resonance,

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
are you the one

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
who's living?

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Are you...

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How could this person

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
reveal the identity of the demon

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in broad daylight?

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't say it out.

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is a sin in our destiny.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's a secret that you and I

238
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
have to protect with our lives.

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Do you know me?

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I know.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This is not important.

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's important is that

243
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
this kind of pain in the soul

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
is my kind.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you okay?

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why did you let me carry this?

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Li Da Fu,

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you're really a playboy.

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You scared Simo.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Simo, ignore him. He's not a demon.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He's just a normal soul.

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But, but, but, he has...

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's his drawing.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
His drawing.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Draw?

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He's?

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tong Feng,

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I made some cakes for you in the kitchen.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do you want to eat?

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Cakes? Is it good?

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Very good.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Good, good.

263
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Zhang Ju Qian can be transferred to the city?

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yes, sir. You have to imprison him for three months.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We'll prepare a soul-guarding soup for him

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and serve him every day.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He can be transferred to the city now.

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Arrange him to the city

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
without Tong Feng knowing.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But...

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Zhang Ju Qian wants to use the three-dimensional qi

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to exchange the past memories

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and meet his daughter again.

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Where did Tong Feng go?

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Did you see him?

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I heard that Meng Di Hua asked him to eat some new dishes.

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He went to the soup shop.

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The soup shop?

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, the soup shop.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wow,

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
so cute.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How is it?

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you want to eat?

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Be careful, it's hot.

286
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's delicious.

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is it?

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go out and eat.

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Meng Di made some new dishes.

290
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It must be good with this cake.

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Xuan Pei, why are you here?

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I came to the soup shop.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm here to check the cucumber's food.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But you're holding a radish.

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sir,

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
why are you here?

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Sir said

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
he wanted to see the cucumber's sun.

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Cucumber?

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Sir, why don't you go to the front hall?

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tong Feng is going to try new dishes.

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think the soup shop is doing well today.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tong Feng and I will go now.

304
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Sir,

305
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the day after tomorrow is my death anniversary.

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Congratulations.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You can finally let go of your past.

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Miss Tong Feng,

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I...

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Do you have anything else?

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I heard that there was a soul

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
who exchanged all the energy of the lower three realms

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to make the soup.

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No, no, no.

315
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Liu Tao,

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
you can't do this.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You can't do this.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You can't eat the soup when you're in the lower realms.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No, no, no.

320
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Liu Tao said that

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the soul will be lost.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm willing to exchange all the energy

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to make the soup.

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I just want to see my daughter.

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Please.

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Miss Niu.

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She is so pitiful.

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes.

329
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But we can't control her.

330
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Listen to me.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a big deal to lose the energy of the lower three realms.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The third realm is the most important place.

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Zhang Juqian is not a bad person.

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He can't be punished like this.

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Then I'll go and beg the Xuan Pei.

336
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In order to stop her from being in the Soul Land,

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you've worked hard.

338
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The so-called three months of confinement

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
is also to protect her soul.

340
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You give her soul soup every day.

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Now you've made such a request.

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm afraid...

343
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Absolutely not.

344
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If I don't drink the soup,

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can turn my memory around.

346
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But the 37th month...

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
As long as you don't drink the soul that Wang Chuan Tang transferred,

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
your life will change automatically.

349
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You can't run away for more than 30 months.

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't have a soul that can be transferred

351
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
without drinking the soup.

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Tomorrow night, I'll take Zhang Juqian to the reincarnation room.

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You'll hold Niujing back.

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In this way, Zhang Juqian

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
can stop drinking the soup

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and bring his memory to his daughter.

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you think I'm smart?

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't think so.

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In this way, Zhang Juqian's 37th month

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
will be gone.

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And the master said

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
he didn't agree to transfer his memory.

363
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You insist on him to transfer his memory.

364
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

365
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The 37th month is gone.

366
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The 37th month is not good enough.

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you know how difficult it is to live through the 37th month?

368
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So,

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't just want him to transfer his memory.

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I also want to change his fate.

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
