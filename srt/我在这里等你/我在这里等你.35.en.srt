The Long Ballad

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,400
I will still be with you.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
From now on,

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,600
Chuan Yu is me.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,400
Xia Yang is me.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Qiao Yan is me.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Dong Xue is also me.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,400
I want you.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,000
I only want you, Dong Fang.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
I want you.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,600
That wedding,

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Xiao Mengzi asked me

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,600
when I fell in love with you.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Actually, I don't know.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
But,

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
you are already deep.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,000
But my heart

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,200
can't be broken.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
No.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
No.

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
I will give you my husband's identity.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
From now on,

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
forget me.

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,800
The Long Ballad

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000
With my blood, my life is at risk.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,600
I can only recover after I calm down.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,400
I will give you my life.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
I will give you my life.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I will give you my life.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will give you my life.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will give you my life.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will give you my life.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will give you my life.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will give you my life.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will give you my life.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will give you my life.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,600
No.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Time is like a wind and clouds.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
When the dawn comes, I will be with you.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,400
She is Chunyu.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
She is Xia Yao.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
She is Qiuye.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
The light is bright.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
The stars are bright.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
She is Qiuye.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
She is Dong Xue.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
She is my God of Heaven.

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I will recognize her as my own.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,400
She is the God of everything in the world.

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,800
She is my wife.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
She is Chunyu.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
She is Chunyu.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Time is like a wind and clouds.

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,000
When the dawn comes, I will be with you.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
She is Qiuye.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
She is Dong Xue.

58
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
She is Qiuye.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
She is Dong Xue.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
She is Dong Xue.

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
She is Dong Xue.

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
She is Dong Xue.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
She is Dong Xue.

64
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
She is Dong Xue.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
She is Dong Xue.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
She is Dong Xue.

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
She is Dong Xue.

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
She is Dong Xue.

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
She is Dong Xue.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,400
From now on,

71
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,040
There is no

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,400
Who I am with in the world.

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,600
I wish to be with my husband for always.

74
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,000
Four hundred and forty Exhale

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Only when we are together

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,240
If forgetting

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,040
will ease the pain- wings,

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,840
doesn't God of Love

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,760
tomatoes your thinking?

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,920
How can the prYes memory

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,520
protect him from his fatal nostalgia?

82
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,480
Ming Xiang.

83
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
Why do you got so emotional?

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,760
You must have seen it before.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,520
Or you think you can get him back?

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Youâ€¦

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,240
You don't understand anything.

88
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Yes, yes, yes.

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
We don't understand anything.

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,560
By the way,

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
the lord said that there are some things that are not clear.

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,160
He asked you to fix it.

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,680
He's old.

94
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,880
Xiao'e,

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,680
do you remember when I got this earring?

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
It's the first time I've seen you.

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,160
You've been wearing this pearl earring

99
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
for too long.

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,800
I don't even remember who gave me the earring.

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,240
I only think it's an important person.

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,840
Si Mo,

103
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,240
I made this bracelet myself.

104
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,000
But why do I feel like I gave it to someone else?

105
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,080
But I can't remember who it is.

106
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Did we

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,920
forget something?

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,640
What did we forget?

109
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
I was born to be a lord of the Netherworld.

110
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
I was blessed by the heaven and earth.

111
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
I was loved by mortals

112
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,520
and I was raised by them.

113
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm the most important person

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
in the world.

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm the most important person

116
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
in the world.

117
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,880
In the world.

118
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,640
It's still you.

119
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,220
The

120
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
Grandmother.

121
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,880
I don't know how you guys

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,140
survived for these years.

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,300
Your Excellency,

124
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
I've sorted out the Life and Death Department.

125
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,540
A Min,

126
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,740
I'm always at ease when you're in charge.

127
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,020
Sir,

128
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,540
is there anything wrong?

129
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,420
Everything is fine now.

130
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,820
Everything is normal in the mortal world.

131
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
But I don't know why

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,580
I feel like something is missing.

133
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,980
It's like something has been cut off

134
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,180
but I don't know it.

135
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,100
Being an immortal is like living with the heavens.

136
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,180
But is it really a good thing

137
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,140
to live a long life?

138
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,540
The mortal can all hope for the immortality.

139
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,100
Perhaps it's a good thing

140
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,740
for the mortal.

141
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,260
Having a long life

142
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,580
is like having a long-term loneliness.

143
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,340
We only want to change,

144
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,420
but we've never experienced the abyss.

145
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
I want to go to the illusion

146
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,380
and experience it myself.

147
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,580
Like the mortal,

148
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,900
I want to feel the reunion,

149
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,900
reunion,

150
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,980
farewell

151
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,660
and meet again.

152
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:20,900
Sir,

153
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,740
have you really decided?

154
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,420
I've made up my mind.

155
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,660
I won't do it by myself anymore.

156
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:41,340
Actually,

157
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,260
I've made up my mind.

158
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,140
Based on its post-trauma standards,

159
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,180
the mortal Lunar deveius

160
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,760
received

161
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,500
the Darong Abyss and Vivi Dog Enchantment.

162
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,500
My lord, I hope you can fulfill your wish this time.

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Sisters.

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
My novel

165
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
has reached the top of the sales list.

166
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Really?

167
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Is it that novel, The Nine Devils?

168
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Please come in. Please come in.

169
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
No problem.

170
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Xiaofeng.

171
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
It seems that the counselor

172
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
knows about your book.

173
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
He has been trying his best to get it.

174
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
I think he has a good idea.

175
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
He has posted it in the age group.

176
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
What?

177
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Look.

178
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
What's the big deal?

179
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
The top of the sales list.

180
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
It's a good thing.

181
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Are you stupid?

182
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
It was written by Pei Xuan and he.

183
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Now it's posted in the age group.

184
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Then he has secretly fallen in love with Brother Pei.

185
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Everyone knows about it.

186
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Xiaofeng.

187
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Is Xun Pei Brother Pei?

188
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Is Tong Feng you?

189
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Tong Xiaofeng.

190
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Come to the counselor's office.

191
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I have something to tell you.

192
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
The counselor is looking for me.

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
I heard that the small road behind the counselor's office

194
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
has been broken recently.

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Everyone dares not go there.

196
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Anyway, you must pass the dormitory.

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
What?

198
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
It's really dark.

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
No way.

200
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
No way.

201
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I really met him.

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Brother.

203
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Tong Xiaofeng.

204
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
I was so scared.

205
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
If you don't do anything bad,

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
what are you afraid of?

207
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
I...

208
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I'm just sitting at the end.

209
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I...

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Brother Pei.

211
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
What do you mean?

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
You are Chunyu.

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
You are Xia Yang.

214
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
You are Qiuye.

215
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
You are Dong Xuan.

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
You are my wife.

217
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Xuan Pei.

218
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Do you really take me as Xuan Pei?

219
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
No, no.

220
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You read the novel.

221
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I didn't write that novel.

222
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
You have seen the ending.

223
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Why did you write such a sad ending?

224
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
The editor asked me to write it.

225
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
He said that if there is a bad ending,

226
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
it will be more dramatic.

227
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
You are the one who wrote it.

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Brother Pei.

229
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
You are lying to me.

230
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Am I really like a dream?

231
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Mysterious, elegant, and also a fraud.

232
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Isn't that what I am?

233
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
No.

234
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I was just pretending.

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Then why do you want to be me?

236
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Brother Pei.

237
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
You are lying to me again.

238
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Brother Pei.

239
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
You think I want to kiss you?

240
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
No, no.

241
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
That...

242
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
That...

243
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I...

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I...

245
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I will be wrong.

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
You are not wrong.

247
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,560
How quickly he

248
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,140
How quickly he

249
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,600
Xiaofeng

250
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,600
How are you?

251
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,500
What did the assistant director Holder say?

252
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Are you going to take a long time?

253
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes!

254
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
He wants me to do to the juniors

255
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I met Brother Pei on my way there.

256
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
What?

257
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
He seems to have read my novel.

258
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Did you confess to him?

259
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
He seems to have...

260
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Sister, tell me.

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Sister, you are in a hurry.

262
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
He seems to be not angry at me for writing him into the novel.

263
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
He must not be angry.

264
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,500
He is not happy to have such a beautiful author like her.

265
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,500
But why did he kiss me?

266
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
What? He kissed you?

267
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
It's a big news.

268
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
What did he say after he kissed you?

269
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Nothing.

270
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I...I...I just came back in a hurry.

271
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
He didn't say anything.

272
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
This beast is so rude.

273
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
You are a bastard.

274
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
You are a rogue.

275
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Maybe he said something.

276
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
But I was so panic.

277
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I just came back.

278
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
It's okay. He has a class tomorrow.

279
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
He will come to you after class.

280
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
It seems that the class is very lively today.

281
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Brother Pei, have you read the novel?

282
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
It has nothing to do with the class.

283
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Please wait for him after class.

284
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Please turn to page one.

285
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Today's class is over.

286
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Do you have any questions?

287
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Brother Pei, a classmate said that you confessed to Tong Xiaofeng last night.

288
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Is it true?

289
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
This girl, I will beat her.

290
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
It's none of your business.

291
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I don't know. I don't know.

292
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Yes.

293
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I confessed to her.

294
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Really?

295
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Really?

296
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Good.

297
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Xiaofeng, where are you going?

298
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Great.

299
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Why is he like this?

300
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
In front of so many people.

301
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
No.

302
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
When did he confess to me?

303
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Last night.

304
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Brother Pei.

305
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Classmate, you seem to have a bad memory.

306
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
When did you confess to me?

307
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
How come I don't know?

308
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Don't try to lie to me.

309
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
What should I do?

310
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
My bride doesn't seem to be very smart.

311
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Who is your bride?

312
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
You wrote it in the book.

313
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Did you forget?

314
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I didn't.

315
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm sorry.

346
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500

364
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500

365
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500

I'm sorry.

370
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm sorry.

384
