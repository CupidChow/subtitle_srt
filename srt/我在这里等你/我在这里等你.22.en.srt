00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Inside Man

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,800
Episode 8

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,560
Thank you.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,720
Si Meng.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,840
You're crying.

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,880
Did Xun Bei bully you?

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,120
No.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm going to the Wanchuan Custody.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,920
Will you go with me?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,040
Si Meng, look.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,120
I made you a bracelet.

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,200
You must wear it.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
This bracelet was made by your brother.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,120
No one else can do it.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
Brother, I don't want the bracelet.

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,600
I want the peony.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,440
Take it.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Mo Zun, it's been 4,000 years.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
Some people have already given up their obsession.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,600
Why do you have to be obsessed with the past?

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,640
It's impossible.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,240
It's impossible.

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Is this wine?

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,400
Is it wine that can help you get rid of your worries?

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
I remember when the three-dimensional talent competition was held,

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
you gave me a gift

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
to celebrate.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Don't worry.

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,840
There are nine words in it.

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,840
After I ate a few pieces,

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
I fell asleep.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,920
Then you should be able to sleep well tonight.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,040
Wine can numb the mood.

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
But what should I do

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
when I wake up?

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
We'll talk about it when you wake up.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,960
If you don't drink,

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,480
and disappear,

40
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,060
it must be for someone else.

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I just want to know how Ma Yichuan died.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why didn't he tell me?

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,520
Your Excellency,

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
you must have your reasons.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
My reasons?

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Your Excellency,

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
I know

48
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,440
you've always thought I was stupid.

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
But let me tell you,

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm not stupid at all.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Xuanpei is that idiot!

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm not stupid at all.

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm not stupid at all.

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm not stupid at all.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm not stupid at all.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm not stupid at all.

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
I've always thought

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
there are many things I can't handle.

59
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,640
But I'm already 3000 years old.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,040
I can handle many things by myself.

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
I know

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
you can handle many things by yourself.

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
But I can't bear to make you upset

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,640
for what I can do for you.

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Little Mengzi,

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,440
why do you look like Xuanpei?

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Come home with me.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Home?

69
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Wait.

70
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Little Mengzi,

71
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,440
why do I feel like you've gained weight?

72
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
You've been carrying me around.

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Because I'm not Little Mengzi.

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm Xuanpei.

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
Xuanpei?

76
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Xuanpei is an idiot!

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I am.

78
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,040
Xuanpei is an idiot!

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Yes.

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
I'm a fool.

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
Why did you

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,640
let me wear the death dress?

83
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Because...

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Because

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,440
it's a truth that you can't know.

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,640
Why does Xuanpei like to watch

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
the play of Little Bear...

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,840
The play of Little Bear Yuanbao?

89
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,240
Because when you woke up,

90
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,040
the play of Little Bear Yuanbao was broadcasted on the window.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,240
Xuanpei has many shortcomings.

92
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
He likes to wear white clothes.

93
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,440
He always talks in a secret way.

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,440
He's so mysterious.

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,040
He always has a private life with Mingxiang.

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,040
He has a private life with Mingxiang

97
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
for public affairs.

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
He likes to wear white clothes

99
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,640
because you used to like to wear white clothes.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
He doesn't like to smile.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Am I not funny?

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Xuanpei looks good when he smiles.

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
But he always has a long face.

104
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,440
I like his smile.

105
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
What else do you like except his smile?

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,840
I like...

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,440
I like his smile when he turns into a flower.

108
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
And stars.

109
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
And...

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
And snow.

111
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,040
Snow?

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,440
I watched the play of The Book of Flowers in the mortal world.

113
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
That country

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
always loves snow.

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,640
The male hero walks in the snow.

116
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
The snow

117
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,040
falls on their hair.

118
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
It's like

119
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
snow falling on them.

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Snow.

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,440
But I've never been in the snow.

122
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
So,

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm really a romantic place.

124
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,040
No stars.

125
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,840
No snow.

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,440
But even so,

127
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
as long as I have Xuanpei,

128
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,440
it's the most romantic place in the Three Realms.

129
00:08:49,040 --> 00:09:14,040
The Shangming Chain

130
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,000
The sky is cold and the sky is clear.

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,640
The rain is falling and the trees are withering.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,680
Granduncle Liu, look.

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
It's snowing.

134
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,480
The moon is bright and the flowers are blooming.

135
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
It's snowing.

136
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,680
I haven't seen snow for thousands of years.

137
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,320
Why is it snowing suddenly today?

138
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,400
You're not smart.

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
The weather in Jiuyou

140
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
is different from that of adults.

141
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,360
It must be close to snow in the world

142
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,280
to make it more beautiful.

143
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,000
You're making up these nonsense again.

144
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,080
The rain is falling and the trees are withering.

145
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,040
The years are passing by.

146
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,960
The rain is falling and the flowers are blooming.

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,000
Why can't I catch it?

148
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,440
I hope the snow will bloom and bloom again.

149
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,000
The rain is falling and the trees are withering.

150
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,480
You're with me.

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,960
The night is like a wind.

152
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,800
The night is like a dream.

153
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,640
Your face is like a dream.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,360
The rain is falling and the trees are withering.

155
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
Now the snow is all over the sky.

156
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
It's all under your control.

157
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,240
The road is deep and the sky is clear.

158
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
These flowers

159
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,200
are like the nine-leaf jade jade flowers

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,240
I saw in the Demon Realm.

161
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
Let me tell you.

162
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,800
The nine-leaf jade jade flowers

163
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,080
were made by Xuan Pei.

164
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,640
Although Xuan Pei

165
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,200
is always so shameless

166
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,600
and ungrateful,

167
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
he's like Mr. Liu Tai Gong.

168
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,400
I'm still worried about him.

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
But

170
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,360
I really like him.

171
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,120
I like him.

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,040
I like Xuan Pei.

173
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,640
The rain is falling and the flowers are withering.

174
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,120
The night is like a dream.

175
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,640
I like you so much.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,560
I like you so much, Tong Feng.

177
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Your Majesty, I'm here to report.

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
What's the matter?

179
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,560
Your Majesty,

180
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,040
the nine-leaf jade jade flowers

181
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
are really shameless

182
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,760
and ungrateful.

183
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
They drove me and the Heavenly Army

184
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,000
away in a few words.

185
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
They drove you away?

186
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,560
Xuan Pei is indeed the same.

187
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,960
He's a good man.

188
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,360
He's a good man.

189
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,640
He's a good man.

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,840
He's a good man.

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
He's a good man.

192
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
He's a good man.

193
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,440
He's a good man.

194
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
He's indeed the same.

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Your Majesty, you guessed it right.

196
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,320
The nine-leaf jade jade flower

197
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,320
seems to be covering up the blood demon.

198
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,680
It doesn't matter.

199
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,720
Xuan Pei is a reasonable person.

200
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,560
If it's really the blood demon Su Xi,

201
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,680
he will never do anything wrong.

202
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,560
It's just...

203
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,440
Fine.

204
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,280
It's already 4000 years ago.

205
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,120
Although so,

206
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,000
the nine-leaf jade jade flower

207
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,360
is not as high as the sky.

208
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,160
No matter how powerful the nine-leaf jade flower is,

209
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,520
it's just the new king.

210
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,440
It's only been a few thousand years.

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,160
The Heavenly Emperor has only been in power for more than ten thousand years.

212
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
Enough.

213
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,920
The three realms are at war.

214
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
The nine-leaf jade flower is not as powerful as the local one.

215
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,000
You can't control it.

216
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
I was wronged.

217
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,080
It's just that Xuan Pei drove you back.

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,040
There must be something wrong.

219
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,080
The three realms have been peaceful for too long.

220
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm afraid there will be a storm soon.

221
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,400
I want to catch a duck.

222
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
I want to catch a duck.

223
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,040
A duck.

224
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,080
Actually, it's a duck.

225
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,640
A duck?

226
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
What duck?

227
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,840
I drew 50 beautiful ducks.

228
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,560
In a song that Yichun liked,

229
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,240
I sang a song about a duck.

230
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,120
How did I sing that song?

231
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,640
I sang it in the past.

232
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,880
I sang it in the past.

233
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
How did you sing that song?

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,880
A duck.

235
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,800
A duck.

236
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,520
A duck.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,160
My daughter is beautiful.

238
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,600
Beautiful.

239
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,400
You are always the most beautiful.

240
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,920
Xuan Pei.

241
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,160
Can you draw me a eyebrow?

242
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
In the mortal world,

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
there is a saying called

244
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,640
the dark and the bright.

245
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,680
In the mortal world,

246
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
there are both dark and bright.

247
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
Can you draw me a eyebrow?

248
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,520
The key to the dark and bright is not to draw eyebrows.

249
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,560
I'm not a dark and bright person.

250
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,240
I'm a bright person.

251
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm a bright person.

252
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,720
I'm a bright person.

253
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,200
I'm a bright person.

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm a bright person.

255
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,400
Are you not a bad person?

256
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,720
I will learn it.

257
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,880
You finally have something you can't do.

258
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm so embarrassed.

259
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,120
What should I do?

260
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,480
Xuan Pei, don't leave me.

261
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,240
Look, it's so dark outside.

262
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm so scared alone.

263
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Xuan Pei.

264
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,520
Don't leave me.

265
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,520
All right.

266
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,520
You're drunk.

267
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,200
Let's rest early, okay?

268
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,320
Didn't you say

269
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,120
you would be my little princess forever?

270
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Tong Feng,

271
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,080
don't think about drinking anymore.

272
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,280
How...

273
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,600
How can I say such a harsh word?

274
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,600
Oh, no.

275
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,840
How can I see Xuan Pei in the future?

276
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Why are you here?

277
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Are you hungry?

278
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,160
I...

279
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not hungry.

280
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,560
You were so grumpy and noisy last night.

281
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520
Why are you not hungry this morning?

282
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Oh...

283
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm lost in the world.

284
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh...

285
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,600
I can't forget what I did that night.

286
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
Look, parting is short.

287
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,120
Fate is short.

288
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,360
How can I exchange my thoughts?

289
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,360
What is the world like?

290
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,080
The fireflies are in full bloom.

291
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,960
The sky is so bright.
