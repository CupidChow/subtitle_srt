00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,200
You really don't have any wish?

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
I want

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,400
to let Ma Yichun come back to life.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,700
I have helped your mother.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,100
I have often changed.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,600
This is a very Prelude.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
Just a Chkaotick.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,320
The normal people say

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,040
the cells get altered after death,

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,000
they just can't handle it.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
I'll turn it into a star.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,600
Then which star

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,240
will be Ma Yichun?

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,480
Which one do you like the most?

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Which one

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
will be Ma Yichun?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,640
The pastries you made are really delicious.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,120
Okay.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,080
If you like them,

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,960
you can give them to me next time.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,720
Okay.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,880
Especially the green bean cake.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
Mother.

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,920
I like you.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,920
I don't like you.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,040
From now on,

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,040
you're the one who can take care of me.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,560
Okay, stop.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,360
Come here.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Hurry up.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,080
Turn around.

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,120
Hurry up.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,840
Mr. Li, are you okay?

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Thank you.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,640
Come on.

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,360
Tong Feng.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
You're going to announce the winner tonight, right?

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,440
Are you confident?

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
Of course.

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,920
Then congratulations in advance.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,800
Thank you.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Then I'll go first.

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,080
Let's go.

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,440
Mr. Li, why are you congratulating her?

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
She was so rude to you before.

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
I don't know why.

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,600
I always feel that girl

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
is very familiar

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
and very close to you.

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
Although she is like a fish to me,

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I always feel that

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,240
her inner self is a good child.

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,760
Let's go.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
Five hours left.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,320
It's time for Tong Feng to say goodbye to the champion.

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,880
I've long seen Tong Feng as a bad guy.

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,400
He deserves to be called the one who is behind Li Ying Hong.

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,080
He deserves it.

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
What?

63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,840
Tong Feng is like that?

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm not sure.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
This morning,

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,800
she even voted for the award that the audience loved the most.

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Can you vote for her?

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhu Ben Fang, give her a chance.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm so angry.

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,600
Can Tianquan break up with a woman like her?

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
Yuan Sheng is too much.

72
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,080
I want to scold her in the comments.

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,720
Look.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,960
This video should be in Yuzhi's hands for a long time.

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
She released it now

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
to make you wait.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
There are four hours left before the game.

78
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,800
If we can't win,

79
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
we'll lose the game.

80
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,880
The game is set by the soul-seeking team.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,480
They won't give you a final decision.

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,400
There must be a reason

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,640
why Tong Feng treats Li Xiao like this.

84
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,880
If we want to win,

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,400
we have to find a reason.

86
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
What could be the reason?

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,800
According to the knowledge library of the three-dimensional drawing department,

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,960
the conflict between the two generations

89
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,720
must be related to the previous generation.

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,160
Maybe

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Li Xiao and Tong Feng's mother are enemies.

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Or maybe

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Li Xiao has broken the relationship between Tong Feng and her parents.

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
What kind of plays do you usually watch?

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
I used to play

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
The Trial to Return to the Heaven Realm.

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,200
It seems that the drawing materials of the Heaven Realm

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,280
are also so rare.

99
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
These are all art works.

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
All right.

102
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,240
I think we should

103
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,960
check Tong Feng's parents' names.

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,560
Let's go.

105
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,840
Tencent.

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,060
converter

107
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,760
Xuanyi.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,080
Look.

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Tong Wenqiang and Shen Mei Lan

110
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,840
are taking the first five-year-old girl Xiao influences

111
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,600
in October, 2005.

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,800
Tommy,

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,320
our real love.

114
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
It turns out that Tong Feng was adopted.

115
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,760
Come, come! I have a new discovery!

116
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,980
According to Italman compartilirage department

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,860
Tong Feng was adopted by Te Handeng

118
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,160
Tong Feng must be very ridiculous.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,600
You really love obey-reasoning medical medical affairs?

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
Look around!

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,400
prove from square p annn

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,480
May, 2000.

123
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,960
Li Xiao is Tong Feng's biological mother?

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,560
Tong Feng,

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
send Weibo to prove your birth.

126
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
The public will report you immediately.

127
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Xuanmei.

128
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
Do whatever you want.

129
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm here.

130
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,640
Tong Feng.

131
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
I know you want to find Li Xiao.

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
You want to ask him

133
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
why he left you back then.

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
But you never had the courage.

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
Whether you were married

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
or a human,

137
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,040
you always had to face difficulties.

138
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Miss Tong.

140
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Miss Tong.

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,000
I know why you came to see me today.

142
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,280
I read the hot search this morning.

143
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
But I can't help you.

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,000
Because the words in the video

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,480
were said by you in one word.

146
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,160
Li Xiao.

147
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Do you really know

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,920
why I came to see you?

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
Three hours later,

150
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,840
the most popular actor award

151
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,720
in 2023 will be announced.

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
Because in the morning,

153
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
your vote was behind Yu Zhi.

154
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,040
You want me to help you

155
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,520
because of this?

156
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,640
No.

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,000
I want to ask you

158
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,600
why you left me back then.

159
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
Why?

160
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,400
Why?

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,640
Why?

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,600
Why?

163
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Why did you leave me back then?

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,680
You...

165
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,360
You...

166
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,680
You gave me a name back then.

167
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,800
Li Fei, right?

168
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
How could it be you?

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,080
Why not me?

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,960
You are the queen.

171
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm the future queen.

172
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
No wonder you hate me so much.

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
No wonder.

174
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,760
Why did you

175
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,120
leave me back then?

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,520
When I was 22 years old,

177
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
I was the owner

178
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,720
of the entertainment circle.

179
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Back then,

180
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
I was fighting with a group of actresses

181
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,880
to win the title of queen.

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,240
But I

183
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
had you pregnant.

184
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
If the audience knows

185
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,360
that the owner of the girl is unmarried and pregnant,

186
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,920
the queen will definitely slip away from me.

187
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,640
For the queen,

188
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,320
you lied to the audience and hid my existence.

189
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,320
You only gave up on me

190
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
for the queen.

191
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
The entertainment circle is such a cruel place.

192
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
If the audience knows that I'm unmarried and pregnant,

193
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,920
I'll have a bad dream with your owner.

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,840
My career will be ruined.

195
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
But I love acting.

196
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,720
For my acting and my career,

197
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
I can give up everything

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,400
including you.

199
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,760
All these years,

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,960
have you ever regretted it?

201
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,680
No.

202
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
Compared to loving you,

203
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
I love my career and my audience more.

204
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,360
But you lied to your favorite audience, didn't you?

205
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,800
Lin Xiao,

206
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,520
don't you think

207
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
what you just said is ridiculous?

208
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,520
You don't love your career

209
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,000
or your audience at all.

210
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,600
You don't even respect your career.

211
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Lin Xiao,

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,680
do you think

213
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,720
you hid the fact that you're unmarried and pregnant

214
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,320
for the dream of the queen

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,800
and the owner?

216
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,520
But you left your daughter

217
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,280
and lost the most basic moral values.

218
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,480
How can you let your beloved career

219
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,560
and your audience

220
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,960
accept such a moral person like you?

221
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,680
You used your deception

222
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
to change your career's glory.

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,080
Do you hate being deceived so much?

224
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,520
Maybe

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
you don't love anyone

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
but yourself.

227
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I love you.

228
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,360
The competition is about to end in ten minutes.

229
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,560
Don't you regret it?

230
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
Of course I don't.

231
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
You're the champion of the competition.

232
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
You just let it go so easily.

233
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
I admire your heart.

234
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,240
Tong Feng, Tong Feng,

235
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,080
something bad happened.

236
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,120
Lin Xiao...

237
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,120
In 2000,

238
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,200
I was unmarried and pregnant.

239
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,000
I was in the critical moment of the competition.

240
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I didn't want to let the audience

241
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,760
know about my daughter's owner.

242
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,400
So I gave up my child

243
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,000
and sent her to me.

244
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,840
The child that Tong Feng

245
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,640
gave up on me

246
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,240
knew the child I gave up on.

247
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,520
I didn't know it at first sight.

248
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,960
That's why I was blamed

249
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,640
for my bad behavior.

250
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Because of my reason,

251
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,240
Miss Tong Feng

252
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,240
was exposed to the mass media today.

253
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,280
I was worried about her.

254
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,840
So I told the audience

255
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
that from now on,

256
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
I, Lin Xiao,

257
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
will

258
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,160
announce that I quit the entertainment industry.

259
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,560
The big news.

261
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,280
Tong Feng was actually killed by Ming Chu Han.

262
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,280
Stop talking.

263
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,880
There are only five minutes left before the voting.

264
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,560
Let's go vote.

265
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,880
Tong Feng is so kind.

266
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
She's a little angel.

267
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm sure my sister was wronged.

268
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,880
You passers-by

269
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,080
wronged my sister this morning.

270
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,880
Go vote for my sister tonight.

271
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,120
What's wrong?

272
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,320
Vote.

273
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,480
Look.

274
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,960
I feel

275
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm going to win.

276
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,720
Tong Feng.

277
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
You will win

278
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
this game.

279
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,320
keit temerk

280
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,080
Who won?

281
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,480
Congratulations, Tong Feng.

282
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,200
Congratulations, little Tong Feng.

283
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Mygood friend.

284
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
You know, you have to be careful

285
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,080
when talking in Japan.

286
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,920
I don't care.

287
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Tong Feng is my good friend.

288
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,080
I'll go.

289
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
Miss Tong Feng,

290
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,640
Ziqian is not the strongest

291
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,320
among the students.

292
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
But he won the championship.

293
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,760
Do you have any negative comments?

294
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,800
Miss Tong Feng,

295
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,680
the Three Realms has

296
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
your love story.

297
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,120
What do you think of it?

298
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,680
Some people think

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,800
you're not worthy of the title

300
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,560
of the champion of the Three Realms.

301
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,280
Please make a reply to these disputes.

302
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,040
I didn't expect

303
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,360
I would have to face so many problems

304
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,120
when returning to Jiuyou.

305
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,240
I want them to see

306
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
what professionalism is.

307
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,280
About the first question,

308
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,640
I want to say something.

309
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,720
I've always been

310
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,600
a bad student in Jiuyou.

311
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,440
But what's wrong with being a bad student?

312
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,480
You can have dreams

313
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,920
by being a bad student.

314
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,040
You can not fly like a bird,

315
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,960
but you must try hard.

316
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
About the second question,

317
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I want to say something.

318
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
I want to be a good student.

319
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,160
But I can't be a bad student.

320
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,360
I want to be a good student.

321
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,680
I want to be a good student.

322
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I want to be a good student.

323
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
I want to be a good student.

324
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
I want to be a good student.

325
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
I want to be a good student.

326
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I want to be a good student.

327
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
I want to be a good student.

328
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
I want to be a good student.

329
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
I want to be a good student.

330
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I want to be a good student.

331
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I want to be a good student.

332
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
I want to be a good student.

333
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I want to be a good student.

334
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
I want to be a good student.

335
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
I want to be a good student.

336
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
I want to be a good student.

337
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
I want to be a good student.

338
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
I want to be a good student.

339
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
I swear to my life

340
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
that I'll only love you

341
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,120
for the rest of my life.

342
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
You're willing to marry me?

343
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Die!

344
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Lu tightly Moi

345
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,880
I promise you.

346
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,360
Will you marry me?

347
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,920
Marry him! Marry him!

348
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,960
Marry him! Marry him!

349
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,680
Please give him a moment of silence

350
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,720
Please give him a moment of silence

351
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,720
We are destined to meet

352
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,320
Never forget the day we met

353
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,360
What's the wedding day?

354
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

355
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,800
the marriage of the husband and wife is a great joy.

356
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,720
The sixth day of the next month

357
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,320
is the day of the top selection.

358
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,920
It's a good day.

359
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,920
It's also the day of my marriage

360
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,000
with my wife.

361
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
I don't have a chance now.

362
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm going to the wedding.

363
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
I'm going to the wedding.

364
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm going to the wedding.

365
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
I'm going to the wedding.

366
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I'm going to the wedding.

367
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm going to the wedding.

368
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
I'm going to the wedding.

369
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm going to the wedding.

370
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm going to the wedding.

371
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
I'm going to the wedding.

372
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm going to the wedding.

373
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm going to the wedding.

374
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I'm going to the wedding.

375
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I'm going to the wedding.

376
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm going to the wedding.

377
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
I'm going to the wedding.

378
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
I'm going to the wedding.

379
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
I'm going to the wedding.

380
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
