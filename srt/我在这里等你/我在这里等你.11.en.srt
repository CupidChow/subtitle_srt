00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Where am I?

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Xuan Pei! Xuan Pei, wake up!

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hurry, wake up!

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We seem to be in another world.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Xuan Pei!

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's weird.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There was a sound just now.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Why isn't anyone here?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where are they?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But where did Master Tong Feng go?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Did you find all theæ± ?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes, this is the last one.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If we can't find them,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
they might have fallen into the cultivation well.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They won't be like this, right?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is bad.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If they fall into the illusion,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Master and Tong Feng's powers will be sealed.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They can't return to the Nether World by themselves.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Can we find them?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The illusion has 30 million layers.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If we want to find them,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we must find them.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sister, are you okay?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm fine. I just got a bag.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Luckily, I didn't bleed.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Little sister, who are you?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My name is Wan Wan.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Sister, why do you care so much about this rogue?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's not a rogue.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He... he just ate something wrong.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Little sister,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
do you know where this is?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the illusion room of the White Gate.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Aren't you the sister who dances here?

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It seems that we've fallen into the illusion.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's going on with Master Li's hot spring?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Little sister,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we accidentally broke into this place.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want to ask

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
if you know where we can go out.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We've been chased and killed.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We can't let others see us.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I know.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You and Brother Rogue

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
ran out together.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sister, do you want to wear this brother?

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll carry him.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Luckily, I didn't get wet.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Otherwise, I would definitely be beaten up today.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sister, do you have a place to go?

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He's still unconscious.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wan Wan, do you know

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
if there's a place where there's no one around here?

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sister, why don't you go to Wan Wan's house?

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's my brother who's unconscious.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Uncle Lin taught me

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
not to be irresponsible.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you, Wan Wan.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sister Tong Feng, this is my house.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Your house?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why does your house look like a hotel?

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, this is Uncle Guo's hotel.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Uncle Lin and I are staying here temporarily.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But don't worry,

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Uncle Guo is also a good person.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Uncle Guo, I'm back.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Wan Wan.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wan Wan.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Xuan Mei, you're awake?

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Xuan Mei.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Here is...

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Master Li's mansion.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The magic arts you gave me are also gone?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Xuan Mei,

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Xuan Mei, why are you here?

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I...

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,360
Even your magic is gone.

82
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,000
I thought only mine was left.

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,240
Xuan Pei, what's going on?

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are we in the illusion?

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,440
It should be because of the problem with the hot spring.

86
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,160
The hot spring of Li Dafu is very close to the cultivation well.

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,160
Then we don't have the magic.

88
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,320
Can we not go back to the Nether World?

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
A Min must have found out.

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
He will come back to pick us up soon.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Don't worry.

92
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,640
Xuan Pei,

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,800
did you eat something wrong today?

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,720
It should be a kind of medicine.

95
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,760
The medicine has been used.

96
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,200
Wanwan.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,680
Brother Rascal, you're awake.

98
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,720
Brother Rascal?

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Wanwan.

100
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Sister, there's nothing to eat at home.

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
Uncle Guo and Uncle Lin are not at home.

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,040
This is the bread I stole from the White-Haired Gate just now.

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,280
Wanwan,

104
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,720
there's nothing to eat at home.

105
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,920
Aren't you hungry?

106
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,760
I'm hungry.

107
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,200
But I think Brother Rascal and Sister must be more hungry.

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,160
Uncle Lin must be back.

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,080
I'll open the door.

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,560
Okay.

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,200
Let's go.

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,760
Let's go.

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,640
Wanwan.

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
If you dare to block Mr. Wang's way,

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,320
just wait for death.

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Who is Mr. Wang?

117
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,840
Go after him.

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,080
Xuan Pei.

119
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,680
Brother Rascal, you're so powerful.

120
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,000
Xuan Pei, you're not as powerful as you are.

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
Although I'm not powerful,

122
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm still a little bit powerful.

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,680
Wanwan, were you scared just now?

124
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm not scared.

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Those people must be sent by Wang Ruonian again.

126
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,880
Who is Wang Ruonian?

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,000
Uncle Lin has never been able to get close to him.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
He's just a little bit afraid of him.

129
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,440
But he's not afraid of anyone.

130
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
He's just afraid of me.

131
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
He's afraid of you.

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
He's afraid of you.

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
He's afraid of me.

134
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
He's afraid of you.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
He's afraid of you.

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
He's afraid of you.

137
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
He's not willing to tell me.

138
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,400
But I've already known it.

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
That person is my father.

140
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,640
He's been hunting down Uncle Lin and me.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We can't stay here for long.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's leave first.

143
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,920
No, no.

144
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm afraid they'll bully Uncle Lin.

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
Brother and sister,

146
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,400
let's go find Uncle Lin, okay?

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,480
Let's go, Wanwan.

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
It's so hot.

149
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,880
Look.

150
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
It's so hot.

151
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
It's so hot.

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,160
I've always wanted to come to this kind of lively place.

153
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,080
But Uncle Lin didn't allow me to come.

154
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
It's so lively.

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,560
Xuanpei,

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
is this the time of the Republic of China

157
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,720
that the script department often shows?

158
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,040
Yes.

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,520
It's the 34th year of the Republic of China.

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,000
Although the time of the Republic of China is short,

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,120
it's indeed a very special time in history.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Special?

163
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,040
What's special?

164
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
Light and darkness coexist.

165
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,560
It's a good omen.

166
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
It's a good omen.

167
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,600
Then,

168
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,240
is there a lot of spies and spies in this period?

169
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Usually, these spies and spies

170
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,560
will have a romantic love story

171
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,640
with those enemies.

172
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,120
What have you been reading recently?

173
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,280
I've been reading...

174
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,160
Buns.

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
Hot buns.

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,680
Hey,

177
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,600
buy buns.

178
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Two for me.

179
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,720
Wanwan,

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,920
are you hungry?

181
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,920
Buns.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
We don't have magic now.

183
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,560
We don't have the common currency of the Republic of China.

184
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,760
Let's think of a way first.

185
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,400
They're so famous.

186
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
What are they doing?

187
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,280
Look at that ring.

188
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,320
That's the last emperor of the previous dynasty.

189
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,680
It's named the Nine-Feng Sword.

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
There's a god's name on it.

191
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,200
If you get this ring,

192
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,680
you'll be blessed with a god's name.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,280
You can be a general and an official.

194
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Besides that ring,

195
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,840
there are hundreds of big sheep.

196
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
Who doesn't want to have it?

197
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,920
I can't fight for it.

198
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
If I have the chance,

199
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,560
I'll take it.

200
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,560
Of course.

201
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,800
We'll be able to fight.

202
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,440
Anyone else

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,800
wants to challenge this warrior?

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,040
If no one wants to fight,

205
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,080
the Nine-Feng Sword will be yours.

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,640
Let me.

207
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
I have aiche.

208
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,280
Aiche.

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:23,020
This is Noise god's

210
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,660
Xuanmei.

211
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,820
Xuanmei.

212
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,020
Look at them.

213
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,220
Are they the people who tried to kidnap Wanwan?

214
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,220
Yes.

215
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,100
They've been here for a while.

216
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,820
Let's go.

217
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,660
Over there!

218
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,300
Chase them!

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,100
Stop!

220
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,420
Chase them!

221
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,540
Stop!

222
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,060
Don't run!

223
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,740
Stop!

224
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,660
Stop!

225
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,740
Hurry!

226
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,500
Hurry!

227
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,220
Stop!

228
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,820
Hurry!

229
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,220
Why haven't they come yet?

230
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Don't be angry, Director.

231
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,540
They're newbies.

232
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,300
They don't know the rules.

233
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,940
Why are you here so late?

234
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,100
You even brought a kid.

235
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,140
I didn't know

236
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,780
that you were a couple.

237
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,100
Hurry up and get a car.

238
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,300
Let's find a place to stay.

239
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,980
You're always wasting my time.

240
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,140
I'm not going to let you go.

241
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,980
I'm not going to let you go.

242
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,180
You're always wasting my time.

243
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,860
Xuanmei.

244
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,580
There are many people here.

245
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,300
It's safer.

246
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,180
Let Wanwan hide first.

247
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,980
Wanwan, go hide there.

248
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,060
Let's deal with them.

249
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,900
Hurry up.

250
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,900
You're not a big shot.

251
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,940
Mr. Li.

252
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Would you like to

253
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,180
be a couple with Miss Zhang

254
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
under the witness of God?

255
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,820
From now on to forever.

256
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,460
Wait.

257
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,340
It's nearby.

258
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,660
Go over there.

259
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,740
What are you doing?

260
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,820
Xuanmei, let's go.

261
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,860
We're your grandpa.

262
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,700
Did you see a kid?

263
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,340
What kid?

264
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,100
Get out of here.

265
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,660
We're all working for Young Master Wang.

266
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,700
What are you?

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
How dare you point us out?

268
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,180
Guys,

269
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,380
search for him.

270
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,820
You want to find him?

271
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,220
Why don't you ask around?

272
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,260
Who are you afraid of?

273
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,140
Do you want to try?

274
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,820
Brother,

275
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,580
the boss of Youyou Company

276
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,740
seems to be kind to us.

277
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,220
Why didn't you say so earlier?

278
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,140
It's Youyou Company.

279
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,020
We're not a big shot.

280
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,140
Let's go.

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,980
Go. Hurry up.

282
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,860
Go.

283
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,660
Continue.

284
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,540
Mr. Li,

285
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,620
would you like to

286
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,980
marry Miss Li

287
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,620
under the witness of God?

288
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,300
From now on to forever.

289
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
Whether it's a smooth life or a hard life,

290
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,500
rich or poor,

291
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,340
healthy or ill,

292
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,140
happy or sad,

293
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,300
you will love Miss Zhang forever

294
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,660
until death

295
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,220
separates you.

296
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,380
I do.

297
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,660
Miss Zhang,

298
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,780
would you like to

299
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,300
marry Mr. Li

300
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,100
under the witness of God?

301
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,860
From now on to forever.

302
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,260
Whether it's a smooth life or a hard life,

303
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,220
rich or poor,

304
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,860
healthy or ill,

305
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,860
happy or sad,

306
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,500
you will love Mr. Li forever

307
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,860
until death

308
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,540
separates you.

309
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,860
I do.

310
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,700
Boss.

311
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
It's beautiful.

312
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,100
It's beautiful.

313
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,820
Sister,

314
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,020
were you getting married?

315
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
It's beautiful.

316
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,180
If you were so beautiful,

317
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,780
Wanwan would also want to get married.

318
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,700
We weren't getting married.

319
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,940
We were shooting a movie.

320
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,700
Xiaobai,

321
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,300
is the movie we just shot

322
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,220
the same as the one I saw in Jiuyou?

323
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,820
The movie of this period is black and white.

324
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,380
It's different from Jiuyou's.

325
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,900
I really want to see

326
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,380
what I look like in the movie.

327
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,980
Wanwan.

328
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,260
Uncle Lin.

329
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,820
How could you be with a stranger?

330
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,660
Brother and sister are not strangers.

331
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,140
They are so nice to me.

332
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,740
They even bought me so much food.

333
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,180
I don't know what you two

334
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,940
mean to a child who is eight years old.

335
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,940
You actually tricked her

336
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,740
out of the family.

337
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,660
No, no.

338
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,420
You misunderstood.

339
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,300
We...

340
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:27,900
We...

341
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,580
Uncle Lin, we just...

342
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,460
People of the late years

343
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,500
came to the hotel again.

344
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,300
Brother and sister saved me.

345
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,020
It turns out that you two saved my life.

346
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,500
I'm sorry for all my friends.

347
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,620
I hope you two can forgive me.

348
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,420
It's okay.

349
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,580
Actually, we...

350
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,980
Actually, Wanwan took us in.

351
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,660
In that case,

352
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,100
why don't you two go back to the hotel with me?

353
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,940
There are people who know us.

354
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,180
We can also

355
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
have a place to settle down.

356
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,380
Uncle Lin.

357
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,100
We are not found out.

358
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,180
Do we have to go back?

359
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,060
Don't worry.

360
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,980
Uncle Guo has a place

361
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,020
for us to hide.

362
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,500
We can go back tonight

363
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,460
and have a good sleep.

364
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,860
Soon,

365
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,140
I won't let you

366
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,460
suffer this kind of hardship again.

367
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,820
The hotel business has been booming recently.

368
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,180
There is only one room left.

369
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,820
You don't mind, do you?

370
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,620
We don't...

371
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,420
We don't mind.

372
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,260
We don't mind.

373
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,060
Mr. Lin,

374
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,540
do you have anything to say to us?

375
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,780
Lin Qing.

376
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,740
Is Wang Ruonian

377
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,980
really Wanwan's father?

378
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,780
Why did he kill Wanwan?

379
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,860
Because Wanwan

380
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,020
is his biological father.

381
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Wanwan's father

382
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,260
is the son of Wanwan's father.

383
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,180
Wanwan's father

384
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,460
is the son of Wanwan's father.

385
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,500
Wanwan's father

386
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
is Wanwan's father.

387
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Wanwan's father

388
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,900
killed Wanwan for what?

389
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,500
I shouldn't have

390
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,460
told the others about this.

391
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,420
Wanwan is the daughter of

392
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,500
the most cruel

393
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,740
and arrogant Wang Ruonian.

394
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,660
Wan Ruonian doesn't like Wanwan's birth mother.

395
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,500
She was humiliated

396
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,540
by Wanwan's birth mother.

397
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,900
Wanwan's birth mother

398
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,700
was humiliated

399
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,740
after giving birth to Wanwan.

400
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,060
She committed suicide.

401
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,100
That year when Wanwan was six,

402
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,900
she heard Wang Ruonian's secret.

403
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,860
A six-year-old child

404
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,140
can know

405
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,180
everything.

406
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,060
But she was still

407
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,380
a killer to her child.

408
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,700
I tried my best to take Wanwan

409
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,540
to the mansion.

410
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,300
These years,

411
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,820
I've been taking Wanwan to hide in the west

412
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,700
and hiding until now.

413
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,260
I need to go out for a long time.

414
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,100
The boss of the inn will take care of Wanwan.

415
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,380
If Wang Ruonian comes again,

416
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,060
please protect Wanwan.

417
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,780
Does Wanwan

418
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,500
know

419
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,860
Wang Ruonian's secret?

420
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,140
She insisted on killing him.

421
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,260
This is about the birth mother of the young master.

422
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,220
Lin Qing

423
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,140
can't leave without notice.

424
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,700
Lin Qing.

425
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,940
That's all for the search.

426
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,180
Take Wanwan to the warehouse

427
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,180
and hide.

428
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,060
Mr. Lin,

429
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,180
you must protect Wanwan.

430
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,620
There won't be any danger

431
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,580
between her and me in the room.

432
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,860
Please be more careful,

433
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,580
sir and madam.

434
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,100
Xuanpei,

435
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,860
I feel so uneasy.

436
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,420
Lin Qing must have some secrets

437
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,300
that she didn't tell us.

438
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,020
She and Wanwan are not related.

439
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,340
Why must we help her?

440
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,300
Where are they?

441
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,100
Come out!

442
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,300
Look over there!

443
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,100
Lin Shu,

444
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,700
will sister Tongfang be all right?

445
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,460
Don't worry.

446
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,700
She will be fine.

447
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,500
Open the door!

448
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,100
Open the door!

449
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,940
We'll kill them!

450
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,380
Could it be the hooligans?

451
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,580
What if they come in?

452
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,540
Your Majesty.

453
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,180
