1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Xuanpei, you're back.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Did you make any trouble recently?

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I didn't make any trouble.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I know you're not by my side.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No one is watching me.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So I dare not make any trouble.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Did you have a good training there?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Xuanpei, the fireflies you made for me are so beautiful.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You want to open the topic again?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're not by my side.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How can I have the time to study?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Xuanpei,

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
can you promise me

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that you won't leave me again?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Otherwise, I won't feel like doing anything.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, I promise you.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But Tong Feng, you have to promise me

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that you will train hard next time.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't worry.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're back.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Of course I will train hard.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Xuanpei, what's wrong with you?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm fine.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm fine.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm fine.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm fine.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm fine.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's okay.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You must be hungry.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Go home. I'll cook for you.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I learned from Xiao Mengzi.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Today, I'll make it for Xuanpei.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm fine.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xuanpei, you...

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How was your business trip this month?

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It was good.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The sound and sound effects in the mountain area are not very good.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll try to get more information.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm glad you're back.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nothing.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is the food I made today delicious?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're still so reluctant.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't even praise me.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm satisfied with your food. It's delicious.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Then you eat more.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Eat this.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And this.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is a gift for this meal.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What is this?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A beautiful flower.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Xuanpei is the best.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wait.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ma Yichun.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ma Yichun, do you know what this is?

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Xuanpei suddenly planted a flower pattern like this.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sir, how did he...

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Tell me.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What is this?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is just a normal flower pattern.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Maybe the master thought it was pretty, so he printed it for you.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Jiuyou is popular with flowers lately.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Isn't it?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That scared me.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Xuanpei has been very strange lately.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I thought something big happened.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What big thing?

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Jiuyou has always been very peaceful.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then I'll go first.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bye.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Bye.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go on.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How can the master's body support the flower pattern?

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We can't interfere with the master's business.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sir, how can you do this?

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Sir, don't hide it from us.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ma Yichun and Niu knew it.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You planted a flower pattern for Tong Feng.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So that's why.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sir, your body has recovered a little.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But you can't plant a flower pattern.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The flower pattern is a secret.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You put some spiritual power into Tong Feng's body.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When he gets hurt, the flower pattern will resist his harm.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And your spiritual power will also be damaged.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How can Tong Feng be injured in Jiuyou?

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's impossible for him to fall down.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But he's still running around.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Last time he went to the Demon Realm, he...

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sir, you're going to plant a flower pattern for Tong Feng.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have no right to ask you.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But you're still a little weak.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You'll have a disease after planting the flower pattern.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you know about these diseases?

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Disease?

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Tong Feng's five special feelings will be temporarily accepted by you.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What five special feelings?

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
These special feelings are different.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Feelings, taste, smell, pain, and heart.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You'll feel all of these.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And this?

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a ring.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's probably the hand pattern of Tong Feng.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When your body recovers, the disease will disappear.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why doesn't it hurt?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Liu, didn't you eat?

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It doesn't hurt?

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It really doesn't hurt.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If he can't eat sweet things,

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm afraid he'll be angry and won't eat for a few days.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What time is it?

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Can you eat sweet things all day long?

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was wrong.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Sir, it's just that...

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tong Feng has been having a stomachache lately.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Isn't he in a mess?

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He always eats messy food.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Can he not have a stomachache?

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Even so, it doesn't matter.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't think there's any big problem.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have a father's disease.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I was hurt by a thousand thunders.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was scared to death.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I...

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Amir...

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm leaving.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I...

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm stuck!

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're going so far again!

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know what's going on lately.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My stomach doesn't hurt anymore.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's getting easier.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sir, I think Tong Feng will drink this water while it's hot.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It will help him relieve his pain.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Shouldn't I drink for Tong Feng?

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He'll feel better after drinking it.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Can I be better?

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're right.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Tong Feng, I want to roast chicken wings.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you want to eat it?

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I want to eat it!

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I want to eat double the number of perverts!

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I haven't had any salty eggs lately.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I feel like I've lost my senses.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ma Yiqing!

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ma Yiqing!

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Water...

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Water...

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Water...

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't feel anything.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's too hot.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A row of perverts?

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Stay here.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Xuan Pei, what's wrong?

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You look strange today.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Stay by my side.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm relieved.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Xuan Pei, are you having stomach problems?

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm fine.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Just don't move.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Xuan Pei's stomach is hurting.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It seems to be very similar to my normal body.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Xuan Pei, lie down here.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll be right back.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where are you going?

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hurry up, Xuan Pei.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Drink this while it's hot.

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is...

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm not...

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I understand.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Can't you control your mouth?

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It'll be fine in a few days.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's okay.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Ming,

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
when do you think

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
these feelings will be released?

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When you're well,

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
these five feelings will be eliminated.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You should be recovering now.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
These five feelings will start from the first sense.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
First, the taste, smell, and pain.

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And finally, the heart.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The heart?

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is the heart the change of the same mood?

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If the feelings of the loved ones

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and the loved ones change,

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
can I feel it?

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's go.

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on, Su.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Your food.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Deng Feng.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Come on.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The pastries I made for you

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
are better than the pastries I made for you.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you, Su.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This bad girl.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She usually eats less than you.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The bride is the new bride.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The domineering husband

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
finally has a lover.

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What kind of lover is this?

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He looks familiar.

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why does he suddenly

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
have a heart attack so fast?

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Isn't this the same person as me?

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who is the same person as Xuan Pei?

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
These spies are really, really unreliable.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They always make a mess.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So that's why he has a heart attack.

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is a very specific skill.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think I practiced for 70 years

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
to be able to play the flute.

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is it that difficult?

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Heavenly Emperor, it's not me.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:37,320
It's really not me who made the

235
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Heavenly Princess have a miscarriage.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I only believe that I can see it.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Pass my order.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Put Linglong into the mortal world.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Never make a sound.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Heavenly Emperor, no.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No.

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why is the play so boring lately?

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Crown Prince.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's really the Crown Prince.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
My lord, are you okay?

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A Ming, don't you feel that this lady

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is really making people

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
feel pain in their hearts?

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why am I crying?

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is it the same person again?

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Nonsense.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How could you become so strong?

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're really not afraid of any pain?

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're willing to try that pain?

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Jiuwei, tell me.

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Can you increase your power?

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
My power can't be increased.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've promised the school to train hard.

259
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What should I do?

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't lie to the teacher.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So I looked through all the information

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and found this small shortcut.

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Please come and help me.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And recently, my body is very strong.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Isn't it, Jiuwei?

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So this class,

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
we'll have

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
ancient women's situation

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
As we all know,

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
whether it's an ancient woman or a future woman,

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
their situation

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
will always be much more difficult.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They not only have to face

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
the pain they bring when they're born,

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
but also have to bear the child's burden.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So this class,

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
we'll let you feel it in advance

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the difficulty of women's birth.

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mr. Liang,

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
just come here.

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I want to see

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
how painful this class is.

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't say that.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You'll see later.

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Uncle Jiuyou's latest research

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
automatically shows the pain of birth.

289
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The pain of birth is divided into 12 parts.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And this is the 12th part of the most painful.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There are 12 parts of pain in total.

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But the pain of birth is the most painful.

294
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We'll go up one by one.

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
As long as you can't stand it,

296
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
we'll stop.

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Mr. Liu, you're so mean.

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're so mean.

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't even have a eyebrow.

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why are you so arrogant lately?

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Mr. Liu is right.

302
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Students,

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
when you shout pain,

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
don't blame me for not reminding you.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You two just wait and see.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'll arrange it.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's go.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My lord,

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
after this last bowl of medicine,

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the connection between you and Tong Feng

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
can be broken.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A Ming,

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
thank you.

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is the first level of pain.

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's like being bitten by a mosquito.

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't feel anything when I bite a mosquito.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
How can you feel anything at the beginning?

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's go straight to the sixth level.

319
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's like a stomachache.

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's just a stomachache.

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't feel anything.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why does it hurt suddenly?

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It hurts.

324
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You can resist pain.

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's go straight to the eighth level.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's like a pain.

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You were most afraid of pain.

328
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not a pain.

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What's the point of pain in the wind and rain?

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Add it.

331
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Is Tong Feng taking a dance class?

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Today's class is

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the experience of pain.

334
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Good job, my dear student.

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is the eleventh level.

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's like the pain

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,480
of a man's

338
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,000
pain.

339
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
How can I feel that you don't feel anything?

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Right.

341
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why don't I feel anything?

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Does this machine really work?

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Of course it works.

344
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The last time I experienced the pain of production,

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I was carried out.

346
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go straight to the twelfth level.

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The pain of production.

348
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can't feel anything this time.

349
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Add it.

350
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Right?

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The pain of production is nothing.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
How can this be?

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You're not a ghost, are you?

354
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is it

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the legendary pain-bearer system?

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Tong Feng,

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
there's also the legendary

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
thirteenth level pain.

359
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's several times more painful than the pain of production.

360
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's like the pain of a mortal's

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
three-way mental illness.

362
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you want to try?

363
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Arrange it.

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll be right back.

366
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Time is like a wind and rain

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Even if the dream is gone

369
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Golden rain and cold

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The light is full

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The star will always shine for you

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Ah

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The wind blows the night away

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ah

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The night is long and the spring is hard to forget

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Look, the farewell is short

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The fate is not yet decided

378
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How can I exchange thoughts

379
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The three lives are like the firework

380
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The pursuit is so bright

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ah
