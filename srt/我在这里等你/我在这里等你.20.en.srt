Episode 15

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,160
Wangchuan Cuisine is blessed with a good heart.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,920
Yichun,

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,960
this is the cake Si Mo sent.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,920
We have good food.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
Great. Great.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,480
It's delicious.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
Where am I?

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,080
What's wrong with me?

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm so dizzy.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,240
I can't get lost in the wine.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,920
Let me go.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
Isn't that Lin Xiang?

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,920
Let me go.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Why is there a body

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,160
in his hand?

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,720
No.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,720
This is the bamboo soul forest.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,080
The soul of the bamboo soul forest has been scattered.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,720
It's been four thousand years.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,520
I finally wake up.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,280
I'm so tired.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm so tired.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,040
I'm so tired.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm so tired.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm so tired.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm so tired.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
I'm so tired.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm so tired.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm so tired.

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm so tired.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm so tired.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm so tired.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm so tired.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm so tired.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm so tired.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm so tired.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm so tired.

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm so tired.

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm so tired.

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm so tired.

47
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm so tired.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm so tired.

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm so tired.

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm so tired.

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm so tired.

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm so tired.

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm so tired.

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm so tired.

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm so tired.

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
I'm so tired.

57
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
How is that possible?

58
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,260
There's always life and death in Jiuyou.

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,560
So, you were the one who was reborn.

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
Mingxia,

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
do you have the trust of others?

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,040
Ma Yichun,

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,440
you shouldn't have found out my secret.

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
Once you do,

65
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,560
you'll die.

66
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
The Blood Demon

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
You killed it?

68
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
It's been 4000 years.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
It hasn't smelled of blood.

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,320
You?

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,560
Blood Demon?

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,200
I like the smell of blood.

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,080
You...

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,840
Who are you?

75
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,720
Get out of my body!

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,960
Ma Yichun!

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Tong Feng!

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,440
Yichun!

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,880
My Lord,

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Ma Yichun's wound

81
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,200
was caused by the Blood Demon.

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
It's been 4000 years.

83
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
It's still here.

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
My Lord.

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Go to the hell and listen to my order.

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes, my Lord.

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,200
Take Ma Yichun

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
to the grave.

89
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes, my Lord.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Go.

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
My Lord,

92
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
you want to use your power

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
to suppress the Blood Demon in Tong Feng's body?

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Never.

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,120
Once Ma Yichun dies,

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,720
your soul will be greatly affected.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,640
If you use your power again,

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm afraid you can't hold on.

99
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,040
Even if I use up my power for the last time,

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
I must fight against the Blood Demon.

101
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Shi Rui.

102
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,200
I dare to know the blood demon is awake.

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,640
The blood demon is awake.

104
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,160
There must be chaos in the Three Realms.

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
The blood demon is awake?

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,480
I forgot that

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,560
you young people who are less than 4000 years old

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,400
have never experienced the blood demon.

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,440
If it's a dark and dark day,

110
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,960
the immortal and demon are in danger.

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,880
The blood demon is awake.

112
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
It's hard to protect yourself.

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,880
4000 years ago,

114
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
the blood demon was born in Jiuyou.

115
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,280
It has the power of chaos

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,320
that is strong and terrifying.

117
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
The god of death,

118
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,360
the demon-killer,

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
and the Three Realms

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,720
are all under the shadow of death.

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Even I

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,880
almost died in the hands of the blood demon.

123
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
The blood demon is very rare.

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
You must be careful.

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,800
My Lord.

127
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,200
Is Tong Feng all right?

128
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,880
Tong Feng is fine.

129
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
I've sealed the blood demon

130
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,160
in his body for the time being.

131
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
He will lose

132
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
the memory of becoming a blood demon.

133
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,880
Ming,

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,120
tell him

135
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
that no one is allowed to tell Tong Feng

136
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,320
about Ma Yichun's death.

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,280
One more thing.

138
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,240
When I passed the spiritual power

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
to Tong Feng,

140
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,840
I noticed that he was poisoned.

141
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
The poison

142
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,760
is the key to trigger the blood demon.

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Poison?

144
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,000
Poison is a secret drug of the Demon Realm.

145
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,160
It can make the demon die unknowingly.

146
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,520
But Tong Feng is in Jiuyou.

147
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
He can't be poisoned.

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
He can't be poisoned.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
Tong Feng has been poisoned

150
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
for a while.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,720
Before,

152
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,600
the measure he took was very small.

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,120
It wasn't fatal enough.

154
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,400
But he took the measure

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
that was fatal enough last night.

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,160
I think he

157
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
wanted Tong Feng's life

158
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,760
and triggered the blood demon accidentally.

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,280
I'll check it out right away.

160
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,280
Let's go to the secret mirror.

161
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,960
Xuanpei was hurt this time.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,880
Has the Demon Lord never thought

163
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,800
that the key to the secret mirror

164
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,360
is not with Fujun?

165
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,240
Si Mo,

166
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,960
Tong Feng is hurt.

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,880
I'm going to the villa to see him.

168
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Do you want to go with me?

169
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,600
Tong Feng is hurt?

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
I don't know what happened.

171
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,800
Jiuyou was in a shock last night.

172
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,560
I think

173
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,920
it must have something to do with his injury.

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,760
Madam, you go first.

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
The market will deliver the food later.

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,440
If I'm not here,

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,720
no one will pay the bill.

178
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,360
Okay.

179
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Come here after you pay the bill.

180
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,000
Indeed, the power has become weaker.

181
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,200
I think

182
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,000
the key to the secret mirror

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is with Tong Feng.

184
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,240
But only the breath of Jiuyou Fujun

185
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
has become weaker.

186
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,680
The power of the secret mirror will become weaker.

187
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,040
Tong Feng,

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
who are you?

189
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,000
Astronomy Team

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280
This person

191
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,160
must be very close to Tong Feng.

192
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Let me try it out.

193
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,320
No matter who gets it right,

194
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,320
Iaker determines the bueired 7 stars.

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,280
The counted 6 stars

196
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,280
will tinfoil the Li's Soul.

197
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,920
It seems

198
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,280
somethings is happening.

199
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,280
No.

200
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,520
The tweakks

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
are empty.

202
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
What?

203
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,600
It's其實...

204
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm wrong!

205
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,160
This is the Shadows of着

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Who on Earth are you?

207
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,160
Don't come here.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's you.

209
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
You've been in the Nether World for so long

210
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,720
just to come here.

211
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,000
All right, Xuan Pei.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,600
Where is that person?

213
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
I don't understand

214
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,400
who you're talking about.

215
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,800
Four thousand years ago, you said my brother was a ghost.

216
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
He died in the Nether World.

217
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,920
But after the death of Demon Lord,

218
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
he left a soul.

219
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
This soul

220
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,120
you didn't want to give back to Demon Realm.

221
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,200
So, Xuan Pei,

222
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
are you not willing to give back this soul

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,720
or my brother is not dead?

224
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
You can't get this soul.

225
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Four thousand years ago,

226
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,040
the Ghost Camp tried to swallow the disease and drink the wine.

227
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,120
It united the three realms.

228
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,640
It killed the soul and destroyed the mortal.

229
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,160
It committed a heinous crime.

230
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,680
The previous Lord of the Deceased used his own strength

231
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,600
to kill it in the Three Life Crane.

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Four thousand years ago,

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,080
the Ghost Camp was already...

234
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Xuan Pei!

235
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,640
Don't mention the common sense in history books.

236
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,400
I want the truth.

237
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
No matter how many times you ask me,

238
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,480
I only have one answer.

239
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,840
Four thousand years ago,

240
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,280
the Ghost Camp was already gone.

241
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,800
Xuan Pei,

242
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
since I can break the secret door,

243
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,480
you must be very weak now.

244
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,440
How dare you

245
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,640
fight against me?

246
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
Even if I have only one skill left,

247
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
I can easily suppress Demon Lord.

248
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,440
Xuan Pei,

249
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,320
even you're afraid of losing,

250
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
you have to prove yourself before them.

251
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
If you really가방

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,480
I'll kill you for the door.

253
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,680
Some people have overreacted before.

254
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,240
I'll kill you first before my men are left as켜.

255
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,080
But I'll protect you.

256
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,120
You will all be destroyed some day.

257
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
How do you feel?

258
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Come.

259
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
My head hurts.

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll get you some water.

261
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Who are you?

262
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Drink slowly.

263
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Little Meng.

264
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Why are you here?

265
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Where's Xuan Pei?

266
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Does Xuan Pei have work?

267
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Tong Feng.

268
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Do you remember what happened last night?

269
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Last night?

270
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
I don't remember.

271
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,640
But I have a lot of memories in my head.

272
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I want to grab those fragments.

273
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
But when I think about it,

274
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I...

275
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
My head hurts.

276
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Okay, okay.

277
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
If you can't remember, let's not think about it.

278
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Last night,

279
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
after Ma Yi Chun and I finished our desserts,

280
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
my head was dizzy.

281
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I walked away from Ma Yi Chun.

282
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I fell asleep.

283
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
After that,

284
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I...

285
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Little Meng.

286
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Did something happen yesterday?

287
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Desserts?

288
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Where did you get those desserts?

289
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
That's the one

290
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
that Si Mo gave me with a lantern.

291
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Si Mo?

292
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
It's Si Mo.

293
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Little Meng.

294
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
I have to talk to Si Mo about this.

295
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
He sent you the broken desserts.

296
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
It's broken.

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
No wonder my head hurts.

298
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I wonder how Ma Yi Chun is.

299
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
He ate a lot yesterday.

300
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm fine now.

301
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Xuan Pei isn't here.

302
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Little Meng,

303
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
let's go to the temple.

304
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Okay.

305
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Xuan Pei isn't here.

306
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Little Meng,

307
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
let's go to see Ma Yi Chun.

308
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
He'll be fine by himself.

309
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
You're not even well.

310
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
How can you go to see him?

311
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
But I'm worried that he's sick.

312
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
What should we do?

313
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
How about this?

314
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
You can rest in the bed.

315
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
When Xuan Pei comes back,

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I'll go to see Ma Yi Chun for you.

317
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
The Nine-Demon Lord

318
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
is indeed a good name.

319
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Why did you poison Tong Feng?

320
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Poison?

321
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
What do you mean?

322
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
You're smart.

323
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
You made a very small effort at first.

324
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
But you failed.

325
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
You're so smart.

326
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
You're so smart.

327
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
You're so smart.

328
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
You're so smart.

329
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
You're so smart.

330
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
You made a very small effort at first.

331
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Even I can't tell.

332
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
But last night,

333
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
you wanted to kill Tong Feng

334
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
and made a very small effort.

335
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Last night?

336
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
That's impossible.

337
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
I did want to poison Tong Feng.

338
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
But it wasn't enough to harm his life.

339
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
And I haven't poisoned him for a long time.

340
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
The poison from last night

341
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
wasn't from me.

342
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Except for the small effort from last night,

343
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
the poison from before is slowly disappearing.

344
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
The poison from before is slowly disappearing.

345
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
It's really not like I'm alone.

346
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Last night,

347
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
what happened?

348
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
You should leave.

349
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Leave the Nine-Demon Lord.

350
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Tong Feng is in danger.

351
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Don't bother to worry about it.

352
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Xuan Pei, I'm asking you.

353
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Tong Feng is in danger.

354
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
If you don't want to be struck by lightning

355
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
and be struck by arrows,

356
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
you can leave the Nine-Demon Lord

357
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
without any hesitation.

358
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
You don't want to investigate this matter?

359
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
You're Tong Feng's friend.

360
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
I don't want to hurt Tong Feng.

361
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Xuan Pei,

362
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
I've been looking for my brother for four thousand years.

363
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
If he's really not dead,

364
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
just tell me.

365
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Your Highness,

366
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
four thousand years have passed.

367
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Some people have already given up on their obsession.

368
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Why do you have to be obsessed with the past?

369
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
It seems that the Chifeng Sword

370
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
is not that easy to get.

371
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
From today on,

372
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
we will share the meat and the flesh.

373
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I'm lost in my thoughts.

374
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,640
I can't forget what I missed in the night.

375
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,640
It seems that the parting is short and the bright future is short.

376
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,640
How can I exchange my thoughts?

377
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
What does it matter?

378
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
The fireworks are shining.

379
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
I chase after the bright future.

380
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,640
The End
