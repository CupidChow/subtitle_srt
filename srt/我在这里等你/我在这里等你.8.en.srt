1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Help!

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,700
She's in the Demon Realm.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,700
Oh my god! She went to the Demon Realm?

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
She... She made three mistakes!

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
My lord!

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
My lord, wait!

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to the Demon Realm.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll bring the headdress back.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
My lord, calm down.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
You can't go to the Demon Realm.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Back off!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My lord!

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I told you to back off!

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
My lord, you can't go to the Demon Realm.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Four thousand years ago, after the battle of the Demon Realm,

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
we signed a contract with the Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
to enter the Demon Realm.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
We should be struck by lightning and be struck by lightning.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I just want to bring her back safely.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
No matter what happens,

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'll take the responsibility.

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
My lord, you can leave yourself alone.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
But think about it.

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
If you enter the Demon Realm and cause a war,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
what will you do with the consequences?

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
If the Heaven Realm dares to stop me,

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll go to Heaven.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If the Demon Realm dares to stop me,

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll destroy the Earth.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If anyone dares to hurt her,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll make them die without any soul.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
My lord,

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I've never driven you out of here.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm so dead.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Help!

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who are you? How dare you stop me?

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Deity of the Nine Devils.

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
The Deity of the Nine Devils?

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
The Deity of the Nine Devils also dares to come to the Demon Realm?

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
How dare you be so stubborn?

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Do you know how much you've committed?

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I don't know what I've committed since I was born.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Because I'm the one

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
who's responsible for the world's troubles.

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
How dare you!

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
My lady!

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
My lady!

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
My lady!

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm the Demon Clan's princess.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How dare you hurt me?

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't even care about the death of the Demon Realm.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Not to mention your princess.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You should be glad today

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that you didn't hurt her.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Otherwise,

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll make the whole Demon Clan

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
pay for it.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My lady!

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
My lady!

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My lady!

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My lady!

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My lady!

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My lady!

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
My lady!

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My lady!

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My lady!

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My lady!

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My lady!

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My lady!

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
My lady!

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My lady!

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
You are really a good girl.

75
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
You've made me feel happy.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
You've made me forget about everything.

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm not afraid of you.

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
But I also want to be with you.

79
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Please, my lady.

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Please, my lady.

81
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Please, my lady.

82
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Please, my lady.

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Please, my lady.

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Please, my lady.

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Please, my lady.

86
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Please, my lady.

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,380
I went there.

88
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,220
I don't know why I came to the Demon Realm.

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,420
There must be something wrong

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,300
with the defense formation of the Three-Heaven River.

91
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,540
I'll let Duomi check it when I get back.

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,740
Yes.

93
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,700
There must be something wrong with the defense formation.

94
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,700
It's indeed dangerous.

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Xuanwei,

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,660
have you ever heard of

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,300
the nine-talent Moon Spirit Flower?

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,180
Yes.

99
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,900
What's wrong?

100
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,780
I read it in the book.

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,100
The nine-talent Moon Spirit Flower

102
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,540
blooms once every three thousand years.

103
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,820
Today is the day of the blooming.

104
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,940
How about

105
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,180
we go and have a look?

106
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,460
You

107
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,020
are really...

108
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,540
Xuanwei,

109
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,580
let me tell you.

110
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,340
That evil woman

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,060
hit me and scolded me again.

112
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,420
My legs hurt so much now.

113
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,900
I see.

114
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,780
Then you won't be mad at me anymore.

115
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,140
It's still too late.

116
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,900
I have to wait another three thousand years.

117
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Xuanwei, let's go.

118
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,940
Xuanwei,

119
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,620
did you ask them to reopen it?

120
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,420
Is it beautiful?

121
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,260
Yes.

122
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,940
The flowers are in full bloom.

123
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,700
I'm looking for a new kiss.

124
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,140
I'm reluctant to forget this moment.

125
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,340
Look at that one.

126
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,660
Look at it.

127
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,860
There's another one.

128
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,900
Do you like it?

129
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,580
Yes.

130
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,120
The

131
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,020
Three Thousand Years of the Yixiu Cut

132
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,340
is amazing.

133
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,300
My Lord,

134
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,420
the Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

135
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,020
have already known that you are involved in the Demon Realm.

136
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,700
The Heavenly Emperor and Demon Lord said

137
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,020
they would investigate this matter thoroughly.

138
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,060
They just want to

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
be struck by lightning

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,180
and be struck by arrows.

141
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,500
Let's not talk about this for now.

142
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,820
I suspect that

143
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,220
there are demons

144
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,020
who will take Tong Feng

145
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,660
to the Demon Realm

146
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,460
if he enters the Demon Realm.

147
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,220
I want to see

148
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,260
who is

149
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,700
in this place.

150
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,580
My Lord,

151
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,740
how can you ignore yourself?

152
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,740
If Tong Feng dies in the Demon Realm,

153
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,740
we still have a chance to get the treasure

154
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,700
and Zhou Xuan.

155
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,140
But you went there too.

156
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,260
Isn't this a gift

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,540
for the Demon Realm and the Heaven Realm?

158
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,820
The Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

159
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,380
can't be controlled.

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
The Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

161
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
can't be controlled by you.

162
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,140
But what about Tong Feng?

163
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,860
Tong Feng is going to train in the Transformation.

164
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,420
Once he gets out of the Nether World,

165
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,420
can you keep protecting him?

166
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,620
Call the Fire Tribe.

167
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,220
I want to talk to him first.

168
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,780
Yes.

169
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,620
Xuan Pei, you're here.

170
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,300
Tell me.

171
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,220
Why did you sneak into the Demon Realm?

172
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,220
This has nothing to do with you.

173
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,180
It has nothing to do with me.

174
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,300
The contract signed by the Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

175
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,940
has been in the Demon Realm for a long time.

176
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,020
The one who sneaked into the Demon Realm

177
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,980
will be punished by the punishment of being struck by lightning

178
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,260
and being pierced by a thousand arrows.

179
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,980
There's a little girl

180
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,300
who went with you.

181
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,820
You may be able to take this punishment.

182
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,260
I'm afraid that the little girl

183
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,940
will be in a state of disarray.

184
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,380
If you don't want the whole Demon Realm

185
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,380
to be destroyed,

186
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,820
you can try.

187
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,660
I haven't seen you for so long.

188
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300
You're still so arrogant.

189
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,660
What's the relationship

190
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,020
between you and this little girl?

191
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,580
You're protecting her like this.

192
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,340
If I'm punished,

193
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,020
will this matter be resolved?

194
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,780
Of course.

195
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,740
This is the contract that was signed at that time.

196
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,860
But I want you and that little girl

197
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,980
to be punished together.

198
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,740
You...

199
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,740
Xuan Pei,

200
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,340
there are two people who sneaked into the Demon Realm.

201
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,620
I've suffered the thunder and the arrows

202
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,340
for her.

203
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,380
Good reasoning.

204
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,300
Xuan Pei,

205
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,780
for a woman to do this,

206
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,300
I really look at you in a different way.

207
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,260
Xuan Pei,

208
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,020
the representative of the Demon Realm is here.

209
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,980
Do you have anything to say?

210
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,500
What's going on?

211
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,660
Why is it

212
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,180
so cold here?

213
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,620
Xuan Pei,

214
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,300
this is only the first time.

215
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,620
There's also the first time you've suffered.

216
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,780
Are you sure you can stand it?

217
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm here to protect Xuan Pei,

218
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,540
and the Demon Realm,

219
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,500
and the people.

220
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,740
Xuan Pei!

221
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,900
Xuan Pei!

222
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
Xuan Pei!

223
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,980
Why can't I think about it?

224
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,020
What's left in this life?

225
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,540
The fireworks are shining.

226
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,980
The water is so brilliant.

227
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,260
Why isn't the master back yet?

228
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,620
What on earth does the Demon Realm want?

229
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,260
Who the hell was listening to that?

230
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,540
Look over there.

231
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,300
Tanli Mansion is over there.

232
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,900
and trail it like this.

233
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,420
Why are you injured so badly?

234
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,260
The god of Hell

235
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,720
is so easy going!

236
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,380
Yourда Pink.

237
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,600
Is this injury

238
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,700
quest requests?

239
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,860
This...

240
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,940
How did you lose so much blood?

241
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,160
Bring more information

242
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
to the Tang demon Maths Gang for burial.

243
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,040
Teng Feng,

244
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,740
don't drag us here like this

245
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,920
on purpose.

246
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,200
the more I believe.

247
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
Lian Hua is suspicious.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
From now on,

249
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,440
I will investigate Tong Feng's identity.

250
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,000
My lord,

251
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,520
you were punished for Tong Feng.

252
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,000
You...

253
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,520
How can you be so careless?

254
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,640
You have been so vicious.

255
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
Since the beginning of the world,

256
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
no one has been punished like this.

257
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,400
Don't let Tong Feng know

258
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,320
you and Li Ning�

259
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,960
can see what is really going on.

260
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,520
My lord!

261
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,040
My lord!

262
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,600
My lord!

263
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
기지ев

264
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
действительно, he is the man of Jiuyou

265
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,320
Hi.

266
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,280
Hi,

267
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,560
Si Mo.

268
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
I haven't seen you for days.

269
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,760
How did you come back?

270
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,640
Xuan Pei took me back.

271
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Tong Feng,

272
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,480
why didn't you say

273
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
I took you to the Demon Realm?

274
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,240
Didn't you say

275
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,400
going to the Demon Realm without permission is a crime?

276
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,440
That's why I didn't dare to tell Xuan Pei.

277
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,120
And I have Xuan Pei's protection.

278
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,640
No one dares to punish me.

279
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,400
But you're different.

280
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,680
Someone will definitely punish you.

281
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,320
Tong Feng,

282
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,640
is Xuan Pei

283
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,080
all right?

284
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,160
He's been very busy recently.

285
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,000
He hasn't come back for a month.

286
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,520
But I promise

287
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
if he cycles back again,

288
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
he'll surely very well

289
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
know my influence.

290
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,840
Three ting bil breathing is boring.

291
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,120
There are no fireflies

292
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,920
nor Xuan Pei.

293
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,240
Why ever fireflies

294
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,720
appear at night?

295
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,120
Why isn't

296
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,560
Xuan Pei beside me?

297
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,920
I want to dream with you even if it's a lie

298
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,920
In the cold and cold

299
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,920
The light is so bright

300
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,920
My heart will forever shine for you

301
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,920
The sound of the flute is forgotten in the night

302
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I want to dream with you even if it's a lie

303
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,920
In the cold and cold

304
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,920
The light is so bright

305
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:13,920
My heart will forever shine for you

306
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,920
The sound of the flute is forgotten in the night

307
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,920
I want to dream with you even if it's a lie

308
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,920
The sound of the flute is forgotten in the night
