00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
MUSIC

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,960
Welcome back, Demon Lord.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Yuzhi.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm here.

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,880
Princess Yuzhi

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,760
broke the law of the Demon Realm

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,160
and entered the Netherworld without permission.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,800
She almost got into a big trouble.

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
From now on,

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,640
you are not allowed to leave the mansion

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
until you are caught.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,280
Demon Lord,

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,080
I did it for you.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,400
Yuzhi, let's go.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
Demon Lord.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Demon Lord.

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,080
Why did you let Xuanpei take me away last night?

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,600
You were so drunk last night.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
You were probably going to throw up.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm a little girl.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,120
I can't stand you.

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,160
Are you going to talk about sisterhood?

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,160
Of course I am going to talk about sisterhood.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,040
But you cried and made trouble

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,720
and you are going to go home with that dog man.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,440
If I stop you,

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,000
you will be in trouble.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,320
I didn't cry and make trouble

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,840
and go home with that dog man.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,160
You don't admit it?

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
People always say that women are rich and men are poor.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
You don't admit it when you mention it.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,640
I think you are the rich and the women.

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
You don't admit it when you go home at night.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay, I can't beat you.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,800
Where is Si Mo?

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,280
Si Mo...

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,560
left.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,320
Left?

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,440
Where did he go?

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
He went to the night-hunting party.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
Night-hunting party?

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,880
Why didn't I hear him say that before?

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960
He...

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
Impossible.

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
It's impossible.

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
No wonder.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,600
He ran away in a panic last night.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,640
I'm still wondering

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,760
why he looked so panic.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Panic?

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,760
I guess Si Mo doesn't want you to be sad.

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,320
It's time.

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
He should go home.

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
Although

56
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,720
it's a good thing to go home,

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
but suddenly,

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,920
Li Da Fu left.

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,640
Si Mo went home.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Yichun...

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
In the past three thousand years,

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,440
I've never experienced a farewell.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
But in a short time,

64
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,560
so many people left.

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,520
The fate of the fantasy is up to you.

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Our fate is up to heaven.

67
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
It's time.

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
No one can stop it.

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
I have a question for you.

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,720
Please go ahead.

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Is there any magic

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,040
that can turn a man into a goddess?

73
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
As far as I know,

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,000
the Nine-Demon Lord has the ability to transform.

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,120
If the Nine-Demon Lord does it himself,

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,320
he might turn a man into a goddess.

77
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,840
You may leave.

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Yes.

79
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,680
Fate has made me a man.

81
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,360
Are you the one

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm looking for?

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Yichun...

84
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Yichun...

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,840
Do you feel austerity by death?

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
No...

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
How did I get this sight?

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,600
Could someone have killed Ma Yichun?

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
No...

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,480
The star of death.

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
This scene is so real.

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
That place.

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,280
It's the place where I met Xiang Liu last time.

94
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,640
I support your decision.

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,480
This thing...

96
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,240
It's indeed writing on it.

97
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,600
This is the blood of Ma Yichun.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
You remember?

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Shen Pei, I had a nightmare.

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
I woke up in the middle of the night.

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I didn't know how to wake up.

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
I was so scared.

103
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I was so worried.

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I didn't know how to wake up.

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I had to wake up.

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I was so worried.

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I was so worried.

108
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I was so worried.

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I was so worried.

110
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I was so worried.

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I dreamed that a man in black was chasing a horse.

112
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Then a black cat jumped out and ate his soul.

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,200
But in my dream, I couldn't see the man in black clearly.

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I thought if I was in the scene,

115
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,200
it should not be a dream, but my memory.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:11,200
So I came here and saw Ma Yichun's blood.

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I saw Ma Yichun's blood.

118
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Although I was already alone,

119
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I could feel Ma Yichun's breath.

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
All right, I won't blame you.

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
I will find the real murderer.

122
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
But I don't understand.

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Why didn't I save Ma Yichun on the scene?

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
What happened that night?

125
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Why am I so useless?

126
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Why can't I remember that I am Ma Yichun?

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Why can't I remember that I am Ma Yichun?

128
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I am the only witness of Ma Yichun's death.

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Why can't I remember that?

130
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Why can't I remember that?

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Why can't I remember that?

132
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Xiaomei.

133
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Xiaomei, tell me.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Is the man in black who killed Ma Yichun in my dream?

135
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Is it?

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Is the man in black the same as Ma Yichun?

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Lost King

138
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
The fantastic loot in the blood is faked.

139
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Your Excellency, what's the matter?

140
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Ma Yichun has left.

141
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,800
You seem to be losing your cultivation and

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
your medicine for the past few days.

143
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Your Excellency, I've been with Yichun for 4000 years.

144
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
We've been close like brothers and sisters.

145
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Yichun is not here.

146
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I...

147
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I understand.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I have something important to tell you

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
when I summon you here.

150
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
What is it?

151
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
The person who killed Ma Yichun is not Tong Feng.

152
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I've investigated Ma Yichun's soul.

153
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
The blood on it is not the same as the body.

154
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
The blood on Tong Feng's soul is fake.

155
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Is that true?

156
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Tong Feng saw Ma Yichun's body.

157
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Did Tong Feng see the murderer?

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I sealed the blood on Tong Feng's body.

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
That memory belongs to the blood demon.

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
So it was sealed together.

161
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
He could only see the spiritual star.

162
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
He saw the murderer holding a black cat.

163
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I think the black cat knew the truth.

164
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Black cat?

165
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
There are few people in the three realms

166
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
who can fake the blood demon.

167
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
The power of the person who caused Ma Yichun's fatal injury

168
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
is very powerful.

169
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm afraid...

170
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Your Excellency, you suspect that

171
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
it was your own person?

172
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I believe that it was not us.

173
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,800
But if it was...

174
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Ning Baobao,

175
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
you've been with Ma Yichun for 4000 years.

176
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Only you won't hurt her.

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I'll leave the matter of black cat to you.

178
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Yes, Your Excellency.

179
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Why did Your Excellency

180
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
summon us together again?

181
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Could it be...

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Could it be for the 4685th

183
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Jiuyou Fazhen International Competition?

184
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Old man Chen,

185
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
last time Your Excellency

186
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
summoned us together

187
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
was for the date with Tong Feng.

188
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
This time,

189
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
it's still for Tong Feng.

190
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

191
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
How could Your Excellency be that kind of person?

192
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I'm that kind of person.

193
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Your Excellency.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Your Excellency,

195
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
why did you summon us together today?

196
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Is your friend going on a date again?

197
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
It's Tong Feng's 3000th birthday soon.

198
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Your Excellency, you mean...

199
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I just want to hold a birthday party for Tong Feng.

200
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Birthday party?

201
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Jiuyou has been in a bad mood lately.

202
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
We should hold some celebrations.

203
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Shut up, Chunhuan.

204
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
We shouldn't talk about that.

205
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
There are too many people who left recently.

206
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
We should all gather together and have fun.

207
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Little girl,

208
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
today is my birthday.

209
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
You don't have to give me a gift.

210
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
You even asked me to pick vegetables.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Isn't it meaningful

212
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
to exchange them with you?

213
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You've been picking vegetables for so long.

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
You're already dirty.

215
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
You can't wear dirty clothes on your birthday.

216
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I have clean clothes to change.

217
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Go and change.

218
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Xuanpei?

219
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
What are you doing?

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Didn't you ask me to draw eyebrows for you?

221
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
You don't know how to draw eyebrows.

222
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
I told you I would learn it for you.

223
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
How long have you been learning?

233
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Sir,

234
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I've been learning for a day.

235
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Why can't I see any progress?

236
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Sir,

237
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
you can't draw eyebrows.

238
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Draw it thinner.

239
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Draw it lighter.

240
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Then it will be Tong Feng's face, not a mask.

241
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Five minutes.

242
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Five minutes?

243
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Really?

244
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I learned it after half a year.

245
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
It's not this song.

246
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Happy birthday!

247
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Tong Feng,

248
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Happy birthday!

249
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Happy birthday!

250
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Happy birthday!

251
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
When did you prepare it?

252
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I didn't know.

253
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
You know it's a surprise party?

254
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Go blow out the candles.

255
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Happy birthday!

256
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
A child is not a child when he is 30.

257
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm already 3000 years old.

258
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Why are there so many childish things on it?

259
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
You're really treating yourself like a little adult.

260
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Come on, everyone.

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Bring the gift to Tong Feng.

262
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Tong Feng,

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I gave this to you.

264
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Thank you, Sister Niu.

265
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
This is a lucky charm.

266
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
When I was alive,

267
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
there was an emperor who came to propose to me.

268
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I was a little cold,

269
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
but I didn't agree.

270
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Thank you, Teacher Jiu Wei.

271
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Why are you unhappy?

272
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Happy birthday, Mr. Xue.

273
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Mr. Xue, happy birthday.

274
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
You're a good pen.

275
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
With this pen,

276
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
you can add 100 yuan.

277
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Thank you, Mr. Liu Tai Gong.

278
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Tong Feng,

279
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
all the script and film resources

280
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
are stored in this.

281
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Thank you, Brother Dong Ming.

282
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
520 lipstick gift box.

283
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Thank you, Brother Gong Kun.

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
5,000 yuan plus 100 yuan.

285
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Thank you, Ming Xiang.

286
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Thank you, everyone.

287
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Thank you for the gift.

288
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Let's go and have a look.

289
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Let's go.

290
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Even if the dream and you are forgotten

291
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
In the vastness of the world

292
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
In the vastness of the world

293
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,800
The starry sky will always shine for you

294
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,800
The night is getting dark

295
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
The moon is getting dark

296
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,800
The starry sky will always shine for you

297
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,800
The moon is getting dark

298
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
The moon is getting dark

299
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,800
The starry sky will always shine for you
