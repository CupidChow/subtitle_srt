00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,200
Is this the wild food?

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,000
I saw it in the script play before.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,520
After all, it's not at home.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,600
We can only bring a few dishes.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,080
They're all my favorites.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,800
There's lotus root, ribs,

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,680
mountain-sweeping treasure,

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,840
and five-bone chicken feet.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,560
Xuan Pei,

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,800
why did you prepare these?

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,360
What if I don't win?

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
If you lose,

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
I'll take you out.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,840
You're so good at talking.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,400
You should say,

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
Tong Feng,

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,200
because I have faith in you,

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,560
you can win.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,600
I have faith in Tong Feng

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,920
forever.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,920
Meng Di Hua sent this to Bilo this morning.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,400
She told me to send it to you.

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,840
To congratulate you

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,120
on completing the first round of the three-tier talent competition.

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,480
Meng is the best.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,480
Is it good?

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,280
Yes.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,200
What's wrong?

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,920
Xuan Pei,

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,280
I'm sleepy.

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,560
I want to sleep.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,760
The rose in the cake is made of wine.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,960
You've never drunk wine.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,720
It's your first time.

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,880
You'll feel dizzy.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
Come here.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,320
Lie down for a while.

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
You'll feel better.

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm feeling dizzy.

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
You'll feel drunk.

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,840
Drunk?

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,400
What's drunk?

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,840
Anyway,

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
it's not a good thing.

47
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,640
Stay away from it.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
Stay away from whom?

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
No.

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,280
I want to be with Xuan Pei forever.

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,800
You're drunk after drinking so much.

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,840
It seems that you can't run away from it.

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,840
Who are you?

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm your Xuan Pei.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,840
Xuan Pei?

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
Xuan Pei,

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
what's your favorite food?

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,640
Honeycomb cake.

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,080
What's your favorite book?

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,600
Xiong Yuan Bao and his friends.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,320
It's all the children of Jiuyou who read it.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,840
Because I want to investigate

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,020
the most popular flamespot

64
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,940
in Jiuyou Youth

65
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,840
thatuck opening and closing of the sandwich as a subject.

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,960
Then...

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,760
who

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,400
is your favorite?

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,720
It's always you.

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,520
Hurry up.

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,640
Let's go.

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,960
This is the prize for my dream lottery.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,200
Please keep it for me.

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
I want to use it after I get my job.

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,360
After you get your job?

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,960
What do you mean?

77
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Think about it.

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
What if I become a beggar after I get my job?

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,280
Can you still dream about it?

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,920
I see.

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,400
Feng, you're so smart.

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,560
Fine.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Give me your hair, then.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,840
Why do you want my hair?

85
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,200
Of course, I want to help you dream.

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,320
Dreaming?

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
Open the box

88
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,520
and put in the air of a dreamer.

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Hair, clothes,

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
and memories.

91
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,880
It's all good.

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Think about the name of the dreamer.

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,880
When the box lights up,

94
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
you can enter the dream of the dreamer

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
and meet him.

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll see you when you get your job.

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,840
You mean...

98
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
I can't see him?

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,920
You mean

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
I can dream about the dreamer?

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
Of course.

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,800
If you can't see him,

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,560
how can you tell him about the lottery?

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
I was thinking about going back to the festival.

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,360
Maybe I can meet them.

106
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,320
Yichun,

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
can I give it to someone else?

108
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Who?

109
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
Li Dafu.

110
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,720
Li Dafu always wants to meet his family.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Now he has the chance.

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,840
I think he needs it more than me.

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,480
I can't give it to him.

114
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,240
But you can take him to dream.

115
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,880
You can use his memory.

116
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,240
Yichun,

117
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm going to find Li Dafu.

118
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Yichun, I won't see you off.

119
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,520
Go back by yourself.

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
This woman.

121
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,240
You...

122
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,880
Stop eating.

123
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,480
Who is so unruly?

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,240
Tong Feng.

125
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,520
Stop eating.

126
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,120
I have something to tell you.

127
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,240
Go ahead.

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
I'm dreaming about the lottery.

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
I can help you

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,000
meet your family.

131
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,120
Tong Feng,

132
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
you mean

133
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
you want to give this to me?

134
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Of course.

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
I've asked around.

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,960
It depends on which family you want to meet.

137
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Thank you, Tong Feng.

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,720
I miss my mother so much.

139
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Then go to see your mother.

140
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,760
Wait a minute.

141
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,760
I'll take a picture of your memory.

142
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,960
Okay, let's go.

143
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Go.

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,240
Mother,

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm Dafu.

146
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,360
I'm back to see you.

147
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,360
You're awake.

148
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Dafu.

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
You're awake.

150
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
Mother, it's me.

151
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm Dafu.

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,160
Dafu.

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
You've been in a coma for so long.

154
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,400
This is the first time I've ever dreamed of you.

155
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,520
Mother,

156
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
are you and father

157
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
and your brothers and sisters

158
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
all right?

159
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes.

160
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,080
They're all fine.

161
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
Your sister

162
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,120
gave birth to a big boy.

163
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,840
He loves to smile.

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,640
He often surrounds you by your bedside

165
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
and calls you uncle.

166
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
Uncle.

167
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
By my bedside?

168
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,720
Mother,

169
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,320
it's been so long.

170
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
Haven't I buried yet?

171
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,400
Our family is in the dark.

172
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,280
We're waiting for you to wake up.

173
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
How can we bury you?

174
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
Wake up?

175
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,640
Madam,

176
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,360
why did you say

177
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
Dafu could wake up?

178
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,440
Three years ago,

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
Dafu fell down

180
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
and hit a rock.

181
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,640
He never woke up again.

182
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
The doctor said

183
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
he could save his life for a while.

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,560
But when he woke up,

185
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
he was still unconscious.

186
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
I don't know.

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,600
But no matter what,

188
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,040
it's always good to have a memory.

189
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,000
Mother,

190
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,240
do you mean

191
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,320
I'm not dead yet?

192
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,120
Stop it.

193
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,880
What do you mean by that?

194
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
Your father and I

195
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
go to the Suoluo Heaven every day

196
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,360
to make you medicine.

197
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,760
How can you die?

198
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,200
Mother,

199
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,720
you're awake.

200
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,800
Dafu,

201
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,760
you're not dead.

202
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,560
But

203
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,040
why am I in the Nether World?

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,360
Because you're not dead.

205
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
That's why you're hungry.

206
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
You can't sleep at night.

207
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,480
You won't be hungry.

208
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,080
I was curious

209
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
why you kept calling me hungry.

210
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,840
So,

211
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,280
the coffin is here.

212
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,160
Tong Feng,

213
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
this feeling

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
is so strange.

215
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,080
I can feel my body,

216
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,720
my heart.

217
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,400
My heart

218
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,840
is beating in my chest.

219
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,240
And this warmth.

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,520
It's not what a soul should feel.

221
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,200
Am I

222
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
really not dead?

223
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,480
Xuan Pei.

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,640
Mr. Li,

225
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,560
you're now in the Yang Qi.

226
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
You can go back to the mortal world.

227
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,160
Sir,

228
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,040
am I really not dead?

229
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,440
Yes.

230
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,080
You have a divorce.

231
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
Qu Ti has been in the mortal world

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
for three years.

233
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,640
Your family

234
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,960
is waiting for you

235
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
and waiting for you to go back.

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,480
Xuan Pei,

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,720
why didn't you tell Dafu earlier

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,080
that he wasn't dead?

239
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,080
So,

240
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,360
he could have gone back

241
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,880
earlier.

242
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
There is a fight between souls in the mortal world.

243
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,160
Qu Ti's heart is still not broken

244
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,400
and his breath is still not stopped.

245
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
He will be misunderstood for a long time.

246
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
This type of soul is different

247
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
from ordinary souls.

248
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
It's cold and warm.

249
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,360
It's a warm memory.

250
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,880
The Yang Qi of the soul is in the heart.

251
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,560
If the Yang Qi is lost,

252
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,040
the soul will be transformed

253
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
into the soul.

254
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,120
This type of soul

255
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,280
can't be known by others

256
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,640
that its Yang Qi is still in the body.

257
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,400
Otherwise, the heart will be lost

258
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,880
and the Yang Qi will be empty.

259
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,640
So,

260
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,080
no one can tell Dafu

261
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
that he wasn't dead.

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,720
Otherwise,

263
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
he will die instantly.

264
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
Fortunately,

265
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,640
no one told him before.

266
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,200
Mai Chun asked me to take Dafu to dream.

267
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,200
He knew it long ago.

268
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
He wanted Dafu to find out

269
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,480
that he wasn't dead.

270
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Because of your kindness,

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
you gave the chance to Dafu to dream.

273
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,640
He had the chance

274
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
to return to the Yang Qi.

275
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,520
If the Yang Qi is lost,

276
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,920
the Yin Qi will enter your body.

277
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
After returning,

278
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
it will be infected with a big disease.

279
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
It's okay, Tong Feng.

280
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,160
The Yang Qi is more ancient and permanent.

281
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,120
Maybe my whole life in the mortal world

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,480
is just a short time.

283
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,400
Maybe

284
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,800
I'll be back soon.

285
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,200
I just don't know if I'll be

286
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
the modern Li Dafu

287
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,080
when I return to the Netherworld.

288
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
I don't know if you can recognize me

289
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
and like me.

290
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,240
What are you talking about?

291
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,640
Don't you have any confidence

292
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,080
in your good friend?

293
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,400
I can't get married.

294
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,120
No one is willing to be my relative.

295
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Even if I am,

296
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,720
most of them are

297
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,280
greedy, rich, and ungrateful.

298
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Except for my family,

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,120
you're the only one

300
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,400
who cares about my feelings

301
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,480
and takes care of my mood.

302
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,320
You're always with me

303
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,280
and laugh and scold me.

304
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
You really see me as a friend.

305
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm so grateful

306
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
to you

307
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,160
for this.

308
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,960
Dafu, I...

309
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Tong Feng,

310
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,120
don't cry.

311
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,760
You're a little baby.

312
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,040
How can you cry?

313
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm afraid.

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,720
Trust me.

315
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,720
We'll

316
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
meet again.

317
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,000
If we don't go to the Netherworld

318
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,200
and return to the Netherworld,

319
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
we won't have enough time.

320
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Tong Feng,

321
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,000
I have to go.

322
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,960
I have nothing to leave for you.

323
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,800
This is for you.

324
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
When I leave,

325
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,640
open it.

326
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,920
Dafu,

327
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,120
you must live well.

328
00:13:51,040 --> 00:14:18,520
ified

329
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,780
keep your doctor.

330
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,840
This is Da Fu's savings.

331
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,840
It was better to take還是 before asking about tracker.

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,960
Tong Feng, give me a word!

333
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Hua Buwan, don't come to see me!

334
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,760
Father.

335
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,040
Don't worry.

336
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,040
I'll remember your kindness

337
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,480
for the rest of my life.

338
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,000
All right.

339
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,280
Don't cry.

340
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll always be with you.

341
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,160
Always?

342
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,960
Will you always be with me?

343
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,120
Of course.

344
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,780
Senior Brother,

345
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,360
let's drink!

346
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,000
At your service.

347
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,800
You're so screamsick.

348
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
How are you?

349
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm well.

350
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,840
How about me?

351
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
You?

352
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,720
Think about it.

353
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,760
He can live for another 30 years.

354
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,920
30 years will pass very soon.

355
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,960
I'd rather let Da Fu

356
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,520
live for a while longer.

357
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,440
After all, he's back in Jiuyou.

358
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,640
He has to cultivate.

359
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,840
He's just like me.

360
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,520
He doesn't like studying.

361
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,360
You're so open-minded.

362
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,760
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

363
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
That's why I came to see you.

364
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Yichun,

365
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,280
I have to thank you

366
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,720
for getting Da Fu.

367
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,440
If you hadn't reminded me

368
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,760
to give Da Fu the chance to win the lottery,

369
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
he wouldn't have returned to the capital so soon.

370
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,960
But you're still sad, aren't you?

371
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,240
I used to watch the show of the mortal world.

372
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,920
The mortal's life and death.

373
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,120
But I've never experienced it.

374
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,880
I didn't expect

375
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,920
it would be such a sad thing.

376
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,320
Tong Feng,

377
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,200
you used to give me candy.

378
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,080
I'll give it to you this time.

379
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Don't be sad if you eat my candy.

380
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,360
Take it.

381
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,720
Li Da Fu is a living soul.

382
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,960
He won't stay in Jiuyou forever.

383
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,760
But I'm a rich man.

384
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,520
I have to stay in Jiuyou.

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,240
I'll always be with Tong Feng.

386
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,040
Come on, take this.

387
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,920
He's so kind.

388
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Lady Yu,

389
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,940
the god飯 you told U mijn

390
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,080
about is done.

391
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,620
The cake is sent to the cellar.

392
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,860
Even if in the pen,

393
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,960
all the wolfs,

394
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,260
have been blinded,

395
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,360
the�� the icon ofingyou,

396
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:58,360
Ah, the night is so bright, but I still can't forget you

397
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:06,960
The parting is so long, but my fate is so uncertain

398
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,160
How can I exchange my thoughts for yours

399
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,960
The three lifetimes are so distant, the fireworks are so bright

400
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,360
I chase after the bright moon

401
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,960
The three lifetimes are so distant, the fireworks are so bright

402
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,960
I chase after the bright moon

403
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,960
The three lifetimes are so distant, the fireworks are so bright

404
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I chase after the bright moon

405
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,960
The three lifetimes are so distant, the fireworks are so bright
