The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you thinking about what happened 4000 years ago?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If I'm not wrong,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
your memory should have some shortcomings.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So what?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's already been 4000 years anyway.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When the Heavenly Emperor was first established,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
during the chaos,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you and I were separated.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Heaven Realm and the Nether World were separated.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then there was the Ghost Camp.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Although the Ghost Camp was in chaos,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the Heaven Realm, the Demon Realm and the Nether World were one.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why did you sign the Divine Demonic Law?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Too many people died that year.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The Ghost Camp died.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The Heaven Realm and the Nether World all wanted revenge.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But Yu Ni was still in the chaos.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If the Three Realms were not sealed,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
it would be another chaos.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It would be another chaos.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I didn't expect

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that the battle of the Demon Realm

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
would bring such a serious consequence.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In these 4000 years,

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I always remember the battle between you and the Ghost Camp.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The Ghost Camp absorbed half of the mortal's soul power

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and half of the heavenly realm's power.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you hadn't sent all the forces of the Fu Army

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and finally killed the Ghost Camp,

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid the Three Realms would be destroyed.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Killing the Ghost Camp is that simple?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You, the Fu Army, are dead.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Isn't this price enough?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What about the Three Realms?

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Are there any other changes?

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Demon Lord,

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you are now the brother of the Ghost Camp.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are now the brother of the Ghost Camp.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Fu Army is your little black cat.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm the brother of the Ghost Camp.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm the brother of the Ghost Camp.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What about

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the Three Realms?

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why are you here?

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you remember this?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I made a blue one for Tong Feng.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't make this one.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's because you lost your memory.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Brother,

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I finally found you.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you a fool

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to find me in the Heart-wrenching Peak?

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Look carefully. I'm a woman.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How could I be your brother?

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you the Jiuyou who came here 4000 years ago?

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But you don't have any memory.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So what?

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's because 4000 years ago,

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you were killed by the Fu Army

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in the Three Realms of Jiuyou.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He must have sealed your memory.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Demon Lord,

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
remember this.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wei,

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I can eat by myself.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How many times have I told you

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to call me sister?

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You little devil.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I won't.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I said I won't.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Will you call me sister?

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I won't.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You little devil.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You...

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you doing?

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Xuanpei hurt me.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Guiyang,

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you let the clan kill people.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Xuanpei will not hurt you this time.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Lian Huajin, you...

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wei,

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to hear you say it.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You really let the clan kill people?

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't thank Yuzhu for

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
such a demon lord.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All right,

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Guiyang,

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you have to

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
explain this to Jiuyou.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All right.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait for me.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Jun Wei,

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
now I have absorbed

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
the power of the mortal world

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and the power of the heavenly realm.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now,

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
you can't beat me.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Whether I can beat you

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is not up to you.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Jun Wei,

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you can't beat me.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Jun Wei,

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
no,

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it will break the spirit.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't watch

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,700
為之更加若胎...

110
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,800
Heaven has got an exists-cannons.

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,660
In

112
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,680
style

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,400
I have released all the invaded train

114
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,760
it will not be injured again

115
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,420
Yes.

116
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,380
You don't have to worry about the water and fire.

117
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,900
Leave it to me.

118
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,980
Xun Wei.

119
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,780
Lian Hua,

120
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,220
listen to me.

121
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,860
I'll be the queen's mother soon.

122
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,980
When Xuan Bei wakes up,

123
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,700
I'll be the queen's sister.

124
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,260
You must kill me

125
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,500
with Xuan Bei.

126
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,620
No.

127
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,180
I don't agree.

128
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,420
Only if I can kill the next husband

129
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,140
can I end the last husband's life.

130
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,620
This is the destiny I have to bear.

131
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,780
Why?

132
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,140
Why is it like this?

133
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,780
Why is Heavenly Emperor treating you like this?

134
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,660
Why can only a husband kill his husband?

135
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,460
This is too cruel.

136
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,500
Lian Hua.

137
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,860
Are you going to see me, the second blood demon,

138
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,260
kill all three realms?

139
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,460
Go.

140
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,740
Go.

141
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,460
Go.

142
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,420
Go.

143
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,940
You...

144
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,900
You must kill me with Xuan Bei.

145
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,340
You...

146
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,820
You...

147
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,260
What is this?

148
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,780
Brother.

149
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,380
Is that you?

150
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,180
You're back.

151
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,500
You're back.

152
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,500
But you...

153
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,060
But why are you a girl?

154
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,500
It's the military power.

155
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,980
It's the military power.

156
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,100
What about the mortal world?

157
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,460
What about the mortal world?

158
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,660
The mortal world...

159
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,540
will be ruined

160
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,740
after you become the blood demon.

161
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,380
As expected,

162
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,940
there is no mortal world in the world.

163
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,340
I have said and done.

164
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,180
As long as you complete what I told you to do,

165
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
I will rebuild the mortal world for you.

166
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,140
Really?

167
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,620
Really?

168
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,340
Really?

169
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,260
That's great.

170
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,100
That's great.

171
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,340
That's great.

172
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,780
As long as you enter this formation,

173
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,260
you can be freed.

174
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,900
Is that

175
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,500
really possible?

176
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,500
Of course.

177
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,060
Okay.

178
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,180
Let's rebuild the mortal world together.

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
Leave this hellish place.

180
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,860
Go.

181
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,820
Go.

182
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,460
Let's rebuild the mortal world.

183
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,900
Yes.

184
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,780
Commandant.

185
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,780
We haven't cleared our grudges.

186
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,340
Hurry up.

187
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,180
Prince.

188
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,460
Let bygones be bygones.

189
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,340
Don't go after the past.

190
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,460
He is my brother.

191
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
Guiyang.

192
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,260
I think you have recovered your memory.

193
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,500
You should thank Tong Feng more.

194
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,220
Where is he?

195
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,180
He...

196
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,700
A few souls

197
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,580
want to rebuild the mortal world.

198
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,500
Xuan Pei.

199
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,780
What's wrong with you?

200
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,660
Qianyue.

201
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,860
What's wrong with you?

202
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm fine.

203
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,460
I'm fine.

204
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,220
I'm fine.

205
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm fine.

206
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,860
I'm fine.

207
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,540
What's wrong with you?

208
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,100
It's you.

209
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,580
Dumb woman.

210
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,620
Who are you?

211
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,620
What's wrong with you?

212
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,100
It's Mingxiang.

213
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,100
Mingxiang?

214
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,380
He lied to us.

215
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,100
He said

216
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,380
as long as I helped him lie to you,

217
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,940
he would help us rebuild the mortal world.

218
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,500
My clan

219
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,100
has been destroyed.

220
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,620
I hesitated for a while.

221
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,540
That formation didn't swallow me completely.

222
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,900
I escaped with all my might.

223
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,220
Qianyue.

224
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,260
Your soul

225
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,140
is almost gone.

226
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,780
It's too late.

227
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,220
It won't be long before

228
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,220
I'm going to be gone.

229
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
If you have any wishes,

230
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,740
I'll help you make them come true.

231
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,620
Dumb woman.

232
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,060
Every soul in the Soul-saving Tomb

233
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,020
is the soul of the Life and Death Department.

234
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,460
You don't have to help me.

235
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,220
I can't turn into a human

236
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,220
if I don't join the Life and Death Department.

237
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,140
What's the point of

238
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,460
turning into a human?

239
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,140
I know you're a former husband.

240
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,340
My dear husband,

241
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,940
if you really care about the people and the world,

242
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,980
help all the souls

243
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,380
to get out of the mortal world.

244
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,620
I want to see my mother again in the mortal world.

245
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,980
I want to feel the real sunshine

246
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,340
alone in her room.

247
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,420
folded in herد.

248
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,700
On Itspani�e themselves,

249
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,140
the scent of osmanthus

250
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,740
fluttered all over the city.

251
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,820
I ranisée countrm but

252
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,980
didn't want to go home.

253
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,980
However,

254
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,980
I can't stop it.

255
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
This is the last soul in the bamboo spirit.

256
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,460
We've done a great job.

257
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
You're going to betray Xuan Pei.

258
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,980
I will never betray you.

259
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Then you're going to betray me.

260
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
I'm going to betray you.

261
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
You want to betray Jiuyou?

262
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
As long as I can realize what I want,

263
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
I can betray all three realms,

264
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
no matter what Jiuyou is.

265
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,980
You mean,

266
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
you're loyal to Xuan Pei?

267
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Your Excellency,

268
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
you're the God of everything.

269
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
You're the most noble person in the world.

270
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
You're amazing.

271
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Four thousand years ago,

272
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,980
you gave up your life for the sake of the people,

273
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,980
and even gave up your master.

274
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
But I'm your shadow.

275
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
You're thinking of the people,

276
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
but I was born for the people,

277
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
and died for the people.

278
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Your Excellency,

279
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,980
you've played a great game.

280
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Your Excellency, tell me,

281
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
how did you play this game?

282
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Your game is complicated.

283
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
It's simple.

284
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,980
You collected three thousand souls in the bamboo spirit forest,

285
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,980
to keep Xuan Pei's life.

286
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
How do you know?

287
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,980
Xuan Pei is going to die, right?

288
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,980
Your Excellency,

289
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,980
do you want to see the doctor?

290
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,980
No need.

291
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
My husband is badly injured.

292
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
A lot of spiritual power is gone.

293
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
If we don't get these spiritual power back,

294
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
I'm afraid it's a life-threatening thing.

295
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
You can't know this.

296
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
If you want to know,

297
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
just wait for the spirit to disappear.

298
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
I understand.

299
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,980
Re-repeat the magic of the God's body.

300
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
The body is the grace of God.

301
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
It's not something ordinary can do.

302
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
If you want to create a god,

303
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
you need to use all the power of your husband.

304
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
When you create a god,

305
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,980
you'll have the crisis of three souls.

306
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Did you invest your body

307
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
to separate souls from us?

308
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,980
If you have the crisis of three souls,

309
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
you'll have three thousand souls.

310
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
You'll live for a thousand years.

311
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
I thought

312
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
you divided the souls from us.

313
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
That's why you have three souls.

314
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
But I found out later

315
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
that it's not our fault.

316
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
The god who created people is not us.

317
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
It's you.

318
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Your resurrection caused your death.

319
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
When did you know

320
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
that I'm the husband of the previous person?

321
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
Three thousand years ago,

322
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,980
I felt something wrong when you appeared.

323
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
A normal soul.

324
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Why should you care so much about it?

325
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
He cooked for you,

326
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
he did everything for you,

327
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
he changed the history for you.

328
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,980
But I didn't know you were the husband of the previous person.

329
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,980
I just lived in the bamboo soul forest.

330
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm still alive for you.

331
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
I've been separating souls from you.

332
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
I'll absorb the soul for you.

333
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
As long as I can save you,

334
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,980
I'll kill all the three realms.

335
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
The day Ma Yichun died,

336
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
you were turned into a blood demon.

337
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,980
You were looking at me in the air.

338
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
How terrible you looked.

339
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
I was so excited.

340
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Only the nine-spirit lord can turn me into a blood demon.

341
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,980
I knew you were the previous lord.

342
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,980
You were the one who created the gods.

343
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Yes.

344
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Xuan Pei used the magic of rejuvenation.

345
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
The magic of rejuvenation

346
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
requires all the power of the lord.

347
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
In order to save you,

348
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
you risked your life.

349
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,980
In order to fulfill your wish,

350
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
you have a sister,

351
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
a brother,

352
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
and a twin brother.

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,980
She separated the soul from your father, Ma Yichun.

354
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
She killed the soul-sucking dead.

355
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
In order to take care of you,

356
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
she separated the soul from me

357
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,980
and dealt with the political affairs for her.

358
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
But she didn't know she was dying.

359
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,980
I couldn't watch her die.

360
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
Since I was born for her,

361
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,980
I must wake you up.

362
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
She did so much for you.

363
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Lord,

364
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,980
you can't bear to see her die.

365
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,980
So you woke me up

366
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,980
to let me use the magic of rejuvenation

367
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
to rejuvenate Xuan Pei.

368
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,980
I will always be waiting for you.

369
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,980
The wind blows the forgotten night.

370
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,980
The wind blows the forgotten night.

371
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,980
The parting is short and the bright moon is bright.

372
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,980
How can I exchange my thoughts for yours?

373
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,980
How can I exchange my thoughts for yours?

374
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,980
The fireflies are so bright.

375
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,980
I chase after the bright moon.

376
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,980
The wind blows the forgotten night.

377
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,980
The wind blows the forgotten night.

378
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,980
The wind blows the forgotten night.

379
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,980
