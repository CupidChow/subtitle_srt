00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,140
My dear,

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,340
you don't talk about the dark side.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,620
Since you're so happy,

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,900
I won't hide it from you.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,620
When the blood demon was trying to kill you,

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,180
Mo Jun was still a little kid.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,080
He knew nothing about it.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,560
But we both

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,080
experienced it.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,360
My dear,

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,440
you shouldn't hide it from me.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,680
I didn't hide it from you.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,120
But

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
the blood demon didn't come to us that day.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,240
My dear,

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
blood demon is no small thing.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,000
The lives of three realms

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,480
are in your mind.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
I know

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,440
the blood demon's influence

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
hasn't been eliminated.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,800
But the vibration that day

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,440
was caused by my carelessness.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,840
I opened the door of the secret capital.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,200
If the blood demon is really reborn,

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,560
I think it's already

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,720
a big trouble for the Heaven Realm.

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
How can we two

31
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,840
sit here and enjoy tea without any worries?

32
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,120
My dear,

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,120
don't worry.

34
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
If that's the case,

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,360
is the girl named Tong Feng

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
the one who went to the Demon Realm?

37
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,080
You seem to

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,640
treat her differently.

39
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,240
She's just a normal soul-seeker.

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,500
The festival is coming soon.

41
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,500
Brother,

42
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,060
don't take it to heart.

43
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,580
Did I take it to heart

44
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,980
or did your husband take it to heart?

45
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,820
I didn't take it to heart.

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,340
But she

47
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
is my heart.

48
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,940
Tian Xuan

49
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,980
is the most famous man in the three realms.

50
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,460
He's just a little bit of a playboy.

51
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,460
But you know what?

52
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,700
He's not a god.

53
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,220
Not a god?

54
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,700
What else can he be called?

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,020
Is he really not a god?

56
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,460
Then why should he be a Taizhu?

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,300
That's not true.

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,220
Have you ever seen him use a god?

59
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,860
He's just a god without a god.

60
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,860
He's not even as good as a common mortal.

61
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,820
He's still acting like a big boss in front of us.

62
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,700
If you ask me,

63
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,340
I'll just make him go to the Nether World.

64
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,380
He's the one who's in the Heaven Realm.

65
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,380
Why is your body so itchy?

66
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,020
What's wrong with your face?

67
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,540
You have it on your face too.

68
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,780
Let me see.

69
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,180
It'll start soon.

70
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,540
How can my face be on camera?

71
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,860
I can see how capable you are.

72
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,780
You can't even handle a little magic?

73
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,700
Who are you?

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,900
Did you do the magic on our faces?

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,260
I'm the same as the old and the new.

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,340
I can't change my name or my character.

77
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,980
Why did you do this to us?

78
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,780
Tian Xuan is the Taizhu.

79
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,860
He's got it from acting.

80
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,580
Unlike you,

81
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,420
who can only hide in corners and talk bad about others.

82
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,080
Nonsense.

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,760
Don't you look down on Jiuyou?

84
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,640
This is Jiuyou's magic.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,360
You'll get it in three days.

86
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,080
As for the red pillow on your face,

87
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,600
you'll get it in three days.

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,920
Tian Xuan.

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,520
You...

90
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,320
You...

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,360
Why are you staring at me?

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,680
Why are you staring at me?

93
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,080
Can...

94
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
Can I talk to you?

95
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,800
What?

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,960
Can...

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,840
Wow.

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,520
You were fantastic just now.

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
Sibling

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
can do very much things for you if it wasn't my ability.

101
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,960
You...

102
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,320
Don't you know anything about magic?

103
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,340
God-like?

104
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,380
Does it mean that

105
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,420
there is no power?

106
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,220
It doesn't matter, Tianxue.

107
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,460
I didn't know anything

108
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
a few months ago.

109
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,100
People say that I'm the worst

110
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,700
of the nine demons.

111
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,340
Look at me now.

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,060
I can still be popular in the Heaven Realm.

113
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,340
By the way,

114
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,820
those stars

115
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,660
are all famous

116
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,980
in the Heaven Realm.

117
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,820
You offended them.

118
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,780
You even told them that you were in the Netherworld.

119
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,300
Aren't you afraid that they will come to you?

120
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,780
Tianxuan,

121
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,740
don't you know

122
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,700
that the three realms can't be connected?

123
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,580
Besides, I'm going back to the Netherworld.

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,820
The red spots on their faces

125
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,500
will be recovered for several days.

126
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,700
Tell them to come to me

127
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,540
as soon as they can enter the Netherworld.

128
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,220
Well...

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,260
All...

130
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,140
All you have to do is call me Tong Feng.

131
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,660
This is a rabbit stamp.

132
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
I rarely give others a stamp.

133
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,020
Aكمami.

134
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,820
Why are you here?

135
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,020
What are you doing?

136
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,740
I'm...

137
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,300
Who are you?

138
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,220
Why are you taking away my little copper?

139
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,860
Yours?

140
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,380
Well, Xuan Pei, you misunderstood.

141
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,540
He is Tian Xuan.

142
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,580
I'm here to ask for his autograph.

143
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,220
Look.

144
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,140
What's so precious about his autograph?

145
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,580
Brother,

146
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,260
I'm the first man in the Heaven Realm.

147
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,100
I'm the most famous man in the Heaven Realm,

148
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,260
the most famous man in the Demon Realm.

149
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm also the third-ranked master of Jin Long, Jin Feng, and Jin Xuan Wu.

150
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,940
I'm the best in appearance and strength.

151
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,660
My autograph

152
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,340
is the highest price of a thousand taels of gold.

153
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,420
The first handsome man in the Heaven Realm.

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,380
He's so ordinary.

155
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,540
You...

156
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,380
Go back to Jiuyou with me.

157
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,500
There are all sorts of weird people in the Heaven Realm.

158
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,060
Hey.

159
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,060
I admit that I'm not a god.

160
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,780
But now someone is questioning my face.

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,500
How dare they!

162
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Stay away from the man in the Heaven Realm.

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Are you jealous?

164
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,660
No.

165
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,900
Really?

166
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,060
No.

167
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,020
No.

168
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,980
Then look.

169
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,500
Don't press me.

170
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,380
I'm going to give the autograph to the nine teachers.

171
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,220
You still want to run away?

172
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
I said

173
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,220
I wouldn't forget the name of the master.

174
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,580
Tong Feng, is the master here?

175
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,980
Master, there's an emergency.

176
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,580
Tong Feng, Tong Feng.

177
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,500
Tong Feng.

178
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,340
You're so muddled.

179
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,580
Wait for me.

180
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,660
Don't let me catch you one day.

181
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,220
Don't sleep.

182
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,540
Wake up and wait for me.

183
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,020
I have a problem.

184
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,300
I can't wait for you to come back.

185
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,100
I know.

186
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,460
Of course not.

187
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,820
Why am I in this dream again?

188
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Is this still a dream?

189
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
No.

190
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,500
This is the key to the death of Ma Yichun.

191
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,820
The cat runs too fast.

192
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,380
Why do I feel that

193
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,580
the black cat

194
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,940
was also caught in this forest last time?

195
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
I don't know.

196
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,180
Am I trapped here?

197
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,100
Is there anyone?

198
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
Help!

199
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Help!

200
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Kid!

201
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Kid,

202
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,460
can you help me?

203
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
I'm lost.

204
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,340
Are you big or am I?

205
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,460
How old are you?

206
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,660
You're lost.

207
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I...

208
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm cold and tired.

209
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,980
I can't find the way home.

210
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,100
Can you help me?

211
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,980
You're so troublesome.

212
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Come with me.

213
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,020
I don't know what's going on.

214
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,620
Why is it so...

215
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,820
I can't find the way home.

216
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
Kid,

217
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
thank you.

218
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,340
My name is Jinyu.

219
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Jinyu,

220
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,780
why are you here alone?

221
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,380
This forest

222
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,140
feels scary.

223
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,020
My mother went to the fantasy world.

224
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,700
I don't want to stay here

225
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,580
until the night.

226
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,020
You don't want to stay here until the night?

227
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,900
Why?

228
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,260
Don't you think the fantasy world is bad?

229
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Fantasy?

230
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,900
If you knew my mother's miserable life,

231
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,140
you wouldn't think the fantasy world

232
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
is a good place.

233
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,860
Your mother?

234
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,060
My mother was born in the Qing Dynasty.

235
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,420
She was famous for 26 years.

236
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,180
She was the village girl selling tofu in the village.

237
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
But in the capital,

238
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,980
the young master of the Prime Minister's Mansion

239
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,900
watched her when she was playing in the village.

240
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,740
He insisted on marrying her back home

241
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
to be his wife.

242
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,500
My mother thought it was a good dream.

243
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,060
But she knew it on the first night of the wedding.

244
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,980
It was a nightmare.

245
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,900
Until she gave birth to me,

246
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,780
my mother couldn't bear the humiliation

247
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
and committed suicide.

248
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,260
I was eight years old.

249
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
She didn't like me.

250
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
So the young master

251
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,420
killed me for the person she loved.

252
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,140
Such a fantasy

253
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,420
is not necessary.

254
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,740
Jinyu's life

255
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,500
is almost the same as Wanwan's.

256
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,740
Only Lin Qing's life has changed.

257
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,340
Jinyu,

258
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,620
before you were killed,

259
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,220
was there a man saving you?

260
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,020
My mother's life is hard.

261
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,460
I have nothing to be lucky about.

262
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,820
Of course no one came to save me.

263
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,260
There are so many people in the world.

264
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,860
It's probably a bad luck

265
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,580
to have the same life.

266
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,620
The corn is ready.

267
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,340
Time to eat.

268
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,260
Thank you.

269
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,660
Be careful.

270
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,860
Stupid woman.

271
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,700
I'm older than you.

272
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,860
You're going to call me sister.

273
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,620
Do you know that?

274
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
I'm not as stupid as you.

275
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,340
It's late.

276
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780
Aren't you going home?

277
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,460
I don't know how to go home.

278
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
How did you get in?

279
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,020
I followed a cat.

280
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,820
Cat?

281
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,180
What a stupid woman.

282
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,820
She followed a cat.

283
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,180
Come with me.

284
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,100
I'll take you out.

285
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,660
Come on.

286
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,220
It's ahead.

287
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,300
It's getting late.

288
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,100
Hurry up.

289
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,220
Qingyi, thank you.

290
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,220
Don't tell anyone

291
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,620
about this forest.

292
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,660
Why?

293
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,900
You've repaid me.

294
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,260
Don't tell anyone.

295
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,220
Let's go.

296
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,900
Bye.

297
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,700
No matter how you think about it,

298
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,900
Qingyi's birth

299
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,940
is exactly the same as Xu Jing's.

300
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,660
Qingyi's life and Wanwan's life

301
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
have a variable of Lin Qing.

302
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,660
But Lin Qing changed her fate

303
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,540
and changed her fate.

304
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,940
Maybe

305
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,580
there's someone like Lin Qing

306
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,340
in Jingyu's life.

307
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,540
But Lin Qing

308
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,580
chose to run her own fate

309
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,220
instead of taking care of Jingyu.

310
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,860
It would be great if I could ask Xuanpei.

311
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,340
But if I agree to Jingyu,

312
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,420
I can't tell anyone.

313
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,220
Which kitten is breathing?

314
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,580
Xuanpei, you're cheating.

315
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,460
Are you eating it?

316
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,980
Yes.

317
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,700
Xuanpei, what did you do just now?

318
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,020
Nothing.

319
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,780
I had a fight with some little souls.

320
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,300
They tried to escape, but I was taught a lesson.

321
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,180
I've blocked their way for half a year

322
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,300
to see how they'll do me a favor.

323
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,420
A favor?

324
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,260
Are you full?

325
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
No.

326
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,780
But I'm hungry.

327
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,300
Mingxiao, I've done

328
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,580
what you asked me to do.

329
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,580
Can you let go of my mom?

330
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,060
No hurry.

331
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,780
Your mom is fine.

332
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,300
As long as I can continue

333
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,060
what I asked you to do,

334
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,580
I'll do it well.

335
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,820
Your mom will come back to you

336
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,140
without any harm.

337
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,180
Xuanpei is so annoying.

338
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,180
It's Mr. Liu's lesson again.

339
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,740
Wait a minute.

340
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,500
I have to tell him.

341
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,220
Xuanpei.

342
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,260
You...

343
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,780
You...

344
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
You...

345
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,940
Why do you look at me so surprised?

346
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,100
Are you so shameless?

347
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,140
What are you thinking?

348
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,660
Don't care about that.

349
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
I've never

350
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,420
taken advantage of you.

351
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,460
Anyway, I want to tell you

352
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,540
to stay away from me.

353
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,220
Help!

354
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm old.

355
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,620
I can't stand the shock.

356
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,820
Is today's lesson

357
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,060
the rule of the three-tier talent competition?

358
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,140
Yes.

359
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,660
Tong Feng is the champion of the first round.

360
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,300
So the burden is very important.

361
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I'll teach you today.

362
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,180
Xuanpei will teach me?

363
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,540
That's great.

364
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,740
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,620
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,620
