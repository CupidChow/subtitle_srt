1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:25,900
Well Well

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,420
.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,560
I think I missed one thing.

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,000
It's the

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,760
aura is

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,380
the aura is

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,220
really

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,320
saying

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,640
this three times

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,780
did listen to say

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,060
Happy New Year!

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Li Da Fu.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,980
I don't know how to sing.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,500
Happy New Year!

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,620
Still singing?

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,060
The lanterns are lit up.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,740
The sea is full of flowers.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,500
Who is more beautiful than you?

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,580
The new spring is here.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,980
Remember to pay the bill.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,900
Li Da Fu's inn is open

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,180
on July 6th, 1922.

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,580
Please invite your friends,

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,340
Tong Feng and Lord Fu Jun,

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,340
to come and enjoy the meal

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,380
and the good news

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,220
from Manager Zhang Xian Ban.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
Hot spring?

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,020
Li Da Fu's famous hot spring inn

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,820
is in the north of Jiuyou City, Wangyue Mountain.

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,060
Wangyue Mountain

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,860
has always been the best place

33
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,420
for the view of Jiuyou.

34
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,060
Xia Pei, let's go together.

35
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,380
There's no need to go to Jiuyou.

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,180
It's okay to go alone.

37
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,300
I wonder who Li Da Fu

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,740
has invited besides us.

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,420
How annoying!

40
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,980
I have a guest on July 6th.

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,540
This month,

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,940
in order to be my dog,

43
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,500
I used up all my holiday money.

44
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,660
Otherwise,

45
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,380
I could go to

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,180
soak in the beautiful hot spring.

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,940
Soak in the hot spring?

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,220
I want to go.

49
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,180
Niu, let's go together.

50
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,220
But the holiday is on July 6th.

51
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,380
We need to make up for the last month's holiday.

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,780
Stop thinking about it.

53
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
Although Li Da Fu is a little cold,

54
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,340
he should soak in the morning.

55
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
He's too busy with work.

56
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,180
He's tired.

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,100
He has to go to work on July 6th.

58
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,300
Stupid!

59
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,100
Zimo, Li Da Fu has opened a new inn

60
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,220
and invited us to soak in the hot spring.

61
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,500
Do you want to go?

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,220
What?

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,580
You don't want to do the business?

64
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,940
I can do it on this day.

65
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,300
I can't make enough money.

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,820
Friendship is the most precious thing.

67
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,740
Tong Feng.

68
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,060
Meng, why are you here?

69
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,060
We're giving you the honor of being Li Da Fu.

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,020
Let's take a day off

71
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,380
and take Zimo to the inn.

72
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,060
Madam, you don't spend a penny

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,100
and you're so generous.

74
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,940
Tong Feng, I made it especially for you.

75
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,020
I know you like it.

76
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,900
Thank you.

77
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,500
Rose cake.

78
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,100
It seems that Wangchan's kitchen

79
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,980
has been reduced.

80
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,980
It smells good.

81
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,740
The rose is not salted.

82
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,100
It must be bitter.

83
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,700
Tong Feng, don't eat it.

84
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,900
Your Lordship seems to be very knowledgeable about food.

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm very knowledgeable about everything.

86
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,380
Everyone, I'm here.

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,300
Let's go.

88
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,020
Da Fu.

89
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,660
Ming Xiang.

90
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,180
Why are you here?

91
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,260
Didn't Mr. Li invite me here?

92
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,140
I just want to be polite.

93
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,260
Who would have thought you would take it seriously?

94
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,340
Well...

95
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,980
By the way,

96
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,340
why are you here alone?

97
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,500
I've sent out the invitation.

98
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
Where are Ma Yi Chun and others?

99
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,980
Ma Yi Chun is going to work.

100
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,220
Mr. Qiu Wei has a class today.

101
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,580
It's my fault.

102
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,460
I didn't choose the date.

103
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,900
But it doesn't matter.

104
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,700
We have to continue after the trip.

105
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,340
Come on.

106
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,100
Ready to go to Li Da Fu's

107
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,180
hot spring inn.

108
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,900
Friends, pay attention.

109
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,500
Our team is about to set off.

110
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,780
Please follow me closely.

111
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,700
If you get lost in the middle of the trip,

112
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,380
or get lost,

113
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,180
I won't be responsible for you.

114
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,100
See you.

115
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,260
Why do I regret coming to the inn today?

116
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,660
Who said it's not?

117
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,980
Feng, you and the eldest...

118
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,380
No.

119
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,620
You and Di Hua.

120
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,180
Well...

121
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,620
Si Meng, you and the eldest.

122
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,900
Come on.

123
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,460
Come on.

124
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,140
Well, Ming Xia.

125
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,500
Do you want to live with me?

126
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,260
No, Da Fu.

127
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,540
You're the first one to get married.

128
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,020
You're so stingy to separate rooms.

129
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,700
It's not my fault.

130
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,660
Look at my inn.

131
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,580
It's so luxurious.

132
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,980
The business is so good.

133
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,500
Now there are only three rooms left.

134
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,460
I have no choice, right?

135
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,580
Si Meng.

136
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,660
I feel wronged to live with Ming Xiang.

137
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,780
What's wrong with you and the eldest?

138
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,540
Li Da Fu.

139
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm a long-time friend.

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,620
How can I live with the present?

141
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
If the room is good,

142
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,180
I can live with you.

143
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,380
Mr. Li and Si Meng can live together.

144
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,780
I think this is good.

145
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,420
Change the room.

146
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,940
Come on.

147
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,260
You can live anywhere.

148
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,060
I can't wait.

149
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,620
Let's go.

150
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,220
Go clean up.

151
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Sir, let's go.

152
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,380
Go.

153
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,940
Si Meng, hurry up.

154
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,980
I'll go to the kitchen to have a look.

155
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,020
I'll take a bath later.

156
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,420
You're just in time.

157
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,460
Listen.

158
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,980
You have to pay me first.

159
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,420
The one with gold pattern

160
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,380
is the nine-spirited honey soup for Lord Fu Jun.

161
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,740
This is specially arranged by Ming Xiang

162
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,500
for Lord Fu Jun to replenish his body.

163
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,100
The owner of this soup

164
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,220
also gave a lot of money.

165
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,060
The name of this soup is

166
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,180
the blood-sucking tea.

167
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,060
Anyway, it's very important.

168
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,620
You should cheer up.

169
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,780
Boil the soup well.

170
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,340
Do you hear me?

171
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,620
Okay. Don't worry.

172
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,940
Xiao Meng.

173
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,700
The hot spring inn in Li's mansion

174
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,820
is quite nice.

175
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,100
I'm going to make a body-sucking soup later.

176
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,420
Tong Feng.

177
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,020
I heard that the hot springs in his inn

178
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,380
are all small.

179
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,460
Yes.

180
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,740
So, Xiao Meng.

181
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,340
Do you want to make soup with me later?

182
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,940
Ming Xiang and the Lord are in the same room.

183
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,100
We'll make the same soup later.

184
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,540
I guess the nine-spirited honey soup

185
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,980
will be worth a fortune.

186
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,700
Xiao Meng.

187
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,340
The nine-spirited honey soup is not worth a fortune.

188
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,620
Have you forgotten?

189
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,860
Last time, they wrote about

190
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,780
the matter of the Soul-gathering Brother and the Life-sucking Brother.

191
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,140
That's right.

192
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,060
Okay. Let's go change.

193
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,140
We'll go to the hot spring later.

194
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,140
How about going to have a look?

195
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,820
Let's go.

196
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,500
Si Mo.

197
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,620
You still don't know how to react.

198
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,340
Why are you here?

199
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,420
I killed a soul

200
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,660
and used his identity.

201
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
What did you say?

202
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,620
You killed a soul while drinking.

203
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,580
What a big crime!

204
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,420
Don't worry.

205
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,540
I killed the soul

206
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,340
at the border of the nine-spirit and the Demon Realm.

207
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,980
The Lord of the Nine-Spirit will not notice it.

208
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,020
You entered the nine-spirit and killed the soul.

209
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,740
If the Lord of the Nine-Spirit finds out,

210
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,060
you'll be punished by the Ten Thousand Thunder Body

211
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,180
and the Ten Thousand Sword.

212
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,020
The Lord of the Nine-Spirit

213
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,860
was just awakened a while ago.

214
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,700
He shouldn't be fully recovered yet.

215
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,060
Who do you think Xuan Pei is?

216
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,060
He's the Lord of the Nine-Spirit.

217
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,980
It's not as simple as you think.

218
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,780
But Si Mo,

219
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,860
the main task

220
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,620
for you is to make the Lord of the Nine-Spirit weak

221
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,500
and find him

222
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
while he's in the nine-spirit.

223
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,980
Is this your mission?

224
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,660
Have you forgotten it?

225
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,580
Of course not.

226
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,700
Xuan Pei is more powerful than we thought.

227
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,380
I didn't expect him to be so powerful

228
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,620
that the seal of the secret mirror didn't break.

229
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,340
What about Tong Feng?

230
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,980
What do you mean?

231
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,580
I'm going to the palace.

232
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,340
I'll be back soon.

233
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,860
I'll be back soon.

234
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,420
I'll be back soon.

235
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,020
Tong Feng,

236
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,700
why haven't you changed your clothes yet?

237
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,700
Xiao Meng,

238
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,500
I suddenly have a stomachache.

239
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,980
Why don't you go first?

240
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,460
Are you okay?

241
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,460
I'm fine.

242
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,380
I'll go to you later.

243
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,620
Okay.

244
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,380
Hurry up.

245
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,900
Tong Feng is just an ordinary soul.

246
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,820
His power is shallow.

247
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,380
Anyone can tell.

248
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,980
Besides, he's still a part of the Lord of the Nine-Spirit.

249
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,100
If you kill him,

250
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,340
it will definitely have a great impact on the Lord of the Nine-Spirit.

251
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,820
Why don't you kill him?

252
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,660
He has the seal planted by Xuan Pei.

253
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,660
The seal?

254
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,180
What's the seal?

255
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,420
The seal will protect Tong Feng

256
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,220
with the spell on behalf of Xuan Pei.

257
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,700
Once Tong Feng is hurt,

258
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,780
the seal will automatically protect him.

259
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,300
The Lord of the Nine-Spirit

260
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,500
really likes this dead duck.

261
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,100
Enough.

262
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,260
Zi Mo.

263
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,500
Let's go.

264
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,180
Zi Mo.

265
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,100
Mom, watch out.

266
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,940
Okay.

267
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Come here.

268
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,780
This is delicious.

269
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,420
Try it.

270
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,220
You two, come here and help.

271
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,140
Coming.

272
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,060
Let's go.

273
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,260
Be careful.

274
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,820
Okay.

275
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,780
Wang Er.

276
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,660
The table over there is waiting.

277
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,220
Take it over.

278
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,860
Okay.

279
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,300
Be careful.

280
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,860
Okay.

281
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,980
Sir, your soup is ready.

282
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,620
Please enjoy.

283
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,660
Sir.

284
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,940
This is the kitchen of the guest house.

285
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,300
The soup made by the Lord of the Nine-Spirit.

286
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,860
Ming.

287
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,700
I'm recovered.

288
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
I don't need these things.

289
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,900
Sir.

290
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,940
Since the soup is ready,

291
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,180
let's drink it.

292
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,460
iniz.

293
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,580
Ming.

294
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:07,140
Today the porridge of the Nine-Spirit

295
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,380
becomes hot.

296
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,660
Let's cook it later.

297
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,140
Yes.

298
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,940
I have to go and see how Mingxiao and Xuanbei made soup.

299
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Si Mo, I'm here to soak the dates with you.

300
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
They're too slow.

301
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
How is it?

302
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Our Mingxing soup

303
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,940
is our main hot spring.

304
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940
It has the effect of calming the mind and calming the spirit.

305
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Soak it for ten years.

306
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Mao Wen?

307
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
He's here.

308
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
He's here.

309
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,940
Mao Wen?

310
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
You...

311
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,940
You're so good, Si Mo.

312
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Li Da Fu.

313
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,940
You actually learned how to draw me?

314
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Don't say it.

315
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,940
You're pretty good at drawing Mao Wen.

316
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,940
You're really good.

317
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
You're very good at it.

318
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
Si Mo, let me see.

319
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,940
You're really good at drawing Mao Wen.

320
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Teach me.

321
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,940
I'm going to take a bath.

322
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Why is Li Da Fu's inn so big?

323
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
There are so many hot springs.

324
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Xuanbei should be around here.

325
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,940
This Mao Wen is so powerful.

326
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,940
And I won't allow you to kill her.

327
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Why?

328
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Do you really like that girl?

329
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,940
Yuchi, I'm the king of the demon clan.

330
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,940
You don't understand what you should say and what you shouldn't say.

331
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Why is there only one statue?

332
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Is it Xuanbei?

333
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Xuanbei?

334
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
Xuanbei?

335
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,940
What were you doing?

336
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I...

337
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,940
I was just going to look for you.

338
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Do you know that men and women are different?

339
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,940
If you want to know, go to my room.

340
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,940
Why did you come to the hot spring?

341
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
I didn't think too much.

342
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,940
I can't tell you that I came to look for you.

343
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
You're still out there in this dress.

344
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,940
Xuanbei, why is your face so red?

345
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
You're so hot, Xuanbei.

346
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Ming, why does the Jiu Ling honeycomb smell like blood today?

347
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Go and look for Mingxiang.

348
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
I have a problem with her soup bowl today.

349
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Tell her to come and see me.

350
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
She must be able to handle it.

351
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Okay, I'll go find her.

352
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
I'll go find her.

353
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
I'm telling you,

354
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
hurry and gather all the debris from the inn.

355
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
Check every hot spring and don't leave anyone behind.

356
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
This is not a small matter.

357
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Okay, Manager.

358
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Si Meng.

359
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,940
Thank goodness you came out.

360
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
I was able to find the wrong route in the inn.

361
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,940
I've linked the hot spring with the Xiuwei well.

362
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
What?

363
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,940
The sky is dark, the palace is full of troubles.

364
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,940
The blackboard is beside me.

365
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,940
The heart is like the wind, the clouds are like the stars.

366
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,940
Your face is so soft.

367
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,940
The fish are in a trance, their hands are holding each other.

368
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,940
The steps are so deep, the sky is so bright.

369
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,940
The ice is frozen, the rain is falling.

370
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,940
The trees are falling.

371
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,940
The world is like a cycle of wind and rain.

372
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

373
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

374
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

375
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

376
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

377
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

378
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

379
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,940
The time is like a cycle of wind and rain.

380
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Ah...

381
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,020
The

382
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,940

385
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
I can't forget the spring under the bright moon.

386
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Ah...

387
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,940
It's hard to say goodbye.

388
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,940
The fate is uncertain.

389
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,940
How can I exchange for a second thought?

390
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,940
The three lifetimes are like the fireflies.

391
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:09,940
The end is so bright.

392
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:19,940
Ah...
