00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
This matter has finally come to an end.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
I didn't think that mortals are so afraid of ghosts.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,640
You always lie.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,880
You always tell the truth when you see a ghost.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
There are thousands of people in this world.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,320
The number of people who have seen ghosts is very few.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,800
You can see that

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
it's a cold, greedy heart.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
That's what's more scary than ghosts.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,760
Do you know that

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,360
mortals will be punished after they return to the Nether World?

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
Actually, I can't protect them.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,240
This is the law of the Nether World.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,560
No one can change it.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,480
I know.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,920
When I promised Lin Qing,

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,880
I've already thought about it.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,600
No matter what kind of punishment I'll be punished,

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,520
I'll do what I should do.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
Even if my soul is scattered,

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
I won't regret

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
making this decision.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,280
You haven't changed at all.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
Move aside!

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,680
Move aside!

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,560
Move aside!

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,640
Move aside!

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,600
Move aside!

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,080
Get up!

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,840
Move aside!

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,920
Let's go! Let's go!

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,640
Let's go!

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,320
Go to hell!

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,840
Let's go!

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,600
Bastard!

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,440
Lin Qing, Wang Ruonian is in prison.

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
Why don't you look happy?

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm not unhappy.

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
I'm just thinking that

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
if Young Mistress is still here,

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
seeing Wang Ruonian finally having a good life,

44
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,120
I wonder how happy she'll be.

45
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
She'll know.

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,920
Lin Qing,

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,760
you and Wanwan are safe now.

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
No one will bother you anymore.

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,520
Thank you for your help.

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
This matter is over.

51
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,360
When I arrange to take care of Wanwan,

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,720
I'll be able to rest in peace

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
in the netherworld.

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,800
Wanwan,

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
thank the two benefactors.

56
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,280
No need.

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,920
We'll definitely thank them in the netherworld.

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,440
Sister,

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
this is from my brother.

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
Wanwan has been wearing it for a few days.

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
I think it suits you better.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
I heard from Uncle Lin last night

63
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,120
that you and your brother are leaving soon.

64
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
Wanwan gave this beautiful ring to you.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Sister, don't forget Wanwan.

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,560
When you see this ring,

67
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,840
you must think of Wanwan.

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Wanwan,

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
I won't forget you.

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,160
Since Wang Ruonian is gone,

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
we should go back.

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Sister, you must take care of yourself.

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,080
Let's go.

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,240
Let's go.

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,520
Wait!

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,000
Tong Feng, you're late.

77
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
She's become a ghost now.

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Forget it, Tong Feng.

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,520
It's too late.

80
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,480
Brother Kouheng,

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Brother Dongming,

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
can I say a few words to her?

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,760
Okay.

84
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,280
But you must be careful.

85
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,600
Xu Jing,

86
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Xu Jing,

87
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
do you remember me?

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Xu Jing,

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,160
do you remember this vase?

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Do you remember

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,040
the words

92
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,760
engraved on this vase?

93
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
The plum blossoms are snowing.

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
The pear blossoms are full of moon.

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,360
I miss you all the time.

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
I miss you all the time.

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,280
Xu Jing,

98
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,400
do you know what Lin Qing did for you?

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,720
She's still alive.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
She was just eight years old.

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
She was so adorable.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
She would hold my arm

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,040
and call me sister.

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,040
Lin Qing said

105
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,560
she liked you a lot.

106
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
Although I don't know

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
what love is,

108
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,400
someone once told me

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,040
there are many kinds of love in the world.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,880
Parents love,

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
couples love,

112
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,960
children love,

113
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,720
and so on.

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,280
I know

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,560
she doesn't like you.

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,520
She loves you.

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,280
Do you understand?

118
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,880
She used her whole life to love you

119
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
and sacrificed the most precious life.

120
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,520
You accepted all her love.

121
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
The plum blossoms are snowing.

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,200
The pear blossoms are full of moon.

123
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,360
I miss you all the time.

124
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,280
Her anger is dissipating.

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,080
Xu Jing,

126
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,880
I know why you have so much resentment.

127
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Because you think no one loves you in this world.

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
But do you know

129
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
Lin Qing's original intention

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
was to leave the mansion

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,400
and join the army.

132
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
When she was 30 years old,

133
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,760
she was destined to be the governor.

134
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,160
For the freedom of our country,

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,040
we will fight!

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,960
We will serve our country and our people!

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,160
We will serve our country and our people!

138
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,280
She changed her destiny for you.

139
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,200
After she left the mansion,

140
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
she didn't join the army.

141
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,040
She chose to take care of your daughter, Wanwan.

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,400
She even wanted to avenge you.

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,080
Her love for you

144
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
changed the most unchangeable destiny

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,200
in the world.

146
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,560
Her love for you

147
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
changed the will of God.

148
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Her love for you

149
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,240
is the most powerful and terrifying love in the world.

150
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,480
Do you think no one loves you in this world

151
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,040
but the most vicious grudge

152
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
of the nine demons?

153
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,040
Xu Jing!

154
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,320
Xu Jing!

155
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Xu Jing!

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,280
Lin Qing excels in martial art.

157
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,320
As a martial artist,

158
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,640
her teh linked techniques

159
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
are limited.

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,560
Can you stop crying?

161
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
But Lin Qing,

162
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
what was the reason he stayed there for?

163
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,640
YourÙ‘ Malise has gone?

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,040
Lin Qing...

165
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,640
He is a fool.

166
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
He should have told me.

167
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Why didn't he tell me?

168
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
He is a fool.

169
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Why didn't he tell me?

170
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Shanpei,

171
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
will Xu Jing fall into the Soul Land?

172
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Don't worry.

173
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
He has already broken his promise.

174
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,640
He won't fall into the Soul Land again.

175
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Niu Mei,

176
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
are you really going to punish Tong Feng?

177
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Even you can't protect Tong Feng?

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
There's no other way.

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Tong Feng really made a big mistake this time.

180
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
He used magic to hurt mortals.

181
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
If you protect him,

182
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
you will be punished unfairly.

183
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,640
You can't do that.

184
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Your Excellency,

185
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Tong Feng used magic to hurt mortals.

186
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
He broke the Nine-Demon Law.

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
He must be punished.

188
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't worry.

189
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm not going to protect him.

190
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Please seal the name tag on Tong Feng.

191
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
A Ming.

192
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Your Excellency,

193
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Tong Feng made a mistake.

194
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
You can't punish him.

195
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
If you insist on not sealing it,

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
I'll seal it.

197
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Enough.

198
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
I'll do it myself.

199
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
It's okay, Xuan Pei.

200
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I should be punished

201
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
for making a mistake.

202
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
How can I punish you?

203
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:16,600
You've been through the

204
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Heaven's Fire.

205
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,560
The punishment for the

206
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Hellfire is to punish the evil spirits.

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
The Nine-Demon Soul broke Tong Feng

208
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
and hurt mortals.

209
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
The Nine-Demon Law

210
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
caused the Hellfire.

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Do you admit your crime?

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I admit my crime.

213
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
But I don't.

214
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
The Mortals King Ruonian is heartless.

215
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
He almost killed the mortals

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
and fell into the evil soul path.

217
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
If he didn't suffer the Heaven's Fire,

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
it would be a crime.

219
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
The Nine-Demon Law

220
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
is the law of the soul.

221
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
But there's always a law

222
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
that can't be taken care of.

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
The mortals' lives are like the candle in the wind.

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
When they are attacked,

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
they will only pray to the Heaven

226
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
to punish the evil spirits.

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
If everything is according to the Nine-Demon Law,

228
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
what's the use of the God's Qi

229
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
and the Heaven's Fire?

230
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
You're so stubborn.

231
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
You're so stubborn.

232
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,240
The

233
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,600
Soul-seeking Soul will take your life.

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Tong Feng.

235
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
It's okay.

236
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Soul-seeking Soul,

237
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
the Soul-seeking Soul,

238
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
you can punish me

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
however you want.

240
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
When I was in the Illusion Realm,

241
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I was prepared.

242
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Spirit Fire!

243
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Spirit Fire!

244
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Spirit Fire!

245
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Spirit Fire!

246
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
The stars are all changed.

247
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
A cloud of regret

248
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
is gone.

249
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Tong Feng.

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm fine.

251
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I can still hold on.

252
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Next Star Punishment!

253
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
A cloud of regret

254
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
blooms and falls.

255
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
The stars are all changed.

256
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
The stars are all changed.

257
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
The stars are all changed.

258
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
The stars are all changed.

259
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
The Nine-Demon Law!

260
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
The moon is sleepless.

261
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
The phoenix is flying.

262
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
The sky is full of stars.

263
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I can't forget

264
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
the promise I made.

265
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,600
My love is shattered.

266
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
The wine and the light are gone.

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
How can I drink with you

268
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,600
and follow you around?

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
A cloud of regret

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
blooms and falls.

271
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
The stars are all changed.

272
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Tong Feng.

273
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
The stars are all changed.

274
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
The stars are all changed.

275
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
The moon is sleepless.

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,600
The flowers are blooming and falling.

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
The moon is sleepless.

278
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Tong Feng, are you okay?

279
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Master won't let anything happen to Tong Feng.

280
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Master.

281
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Is Tong Feng okay?

282
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
He's recovered.

283
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
He'll recover in a few days.

284
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm glad Tong Feng is alive.

285
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Tong Feng, you're awake.

286
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Tong Feng.

287
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Tong Feng.

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Xuan Pei.

289
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Let's go out.

290
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Let's go.

291
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Let's go.

292
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Are you in pain?

293
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
You're injured and you're injured.

294
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Do you know that the punishment

295
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,060
for the

296
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,600
evil spirit of the evil

297
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
is to punish the evil spirit?

298
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Aren't you afraid that your soul will be scattered?

299
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Because I know

300
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Xuan Pei won't let me die.

301
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Didn't you promise me

302
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
you won't hurt yourself?

303
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm not afraid of you.

304
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I'm not afraid of you.

305
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm not afraid of you.

306
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm not afraid of you.

307
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm not afraid of you.

308
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Xuan Pei,

309
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
are you going to punish me again?

310
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Punish you?

311
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
You're really

312
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
useless.

313
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Tong Feng.

314
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Tong Feng, are you okay?

315
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Look.

316
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
What can I do?

317
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I just got burned.

318
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Don't worry.

319
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
How can I not worry?

320
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Why are you being so tough?

321
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Can you stand

322
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
the heat and cold?

323
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
It's okay.

324
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It's just a small injury.

325
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Are you really okay?

326
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm really okay.

327
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
And

328
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Xuan Pei lost a lot of spiritual power to me.

329
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
In a few days,

330
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I can be alive and kicking.

331
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
You've recovered almost.

332
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
You'll recover in a few days.

333
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
So Tong Feng,

334
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
why did you get punished?

335
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Tong Feng,

336
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
why did you get punished?

337
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Did no one protect you?

338
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
I was hallucinating.

339
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I used magic

340
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
to hurt a mortal.

341
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
You can't

342
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
hurt a mortal with nothing.

343
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Tong Feng,

344
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
what happened?

345
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
A mortal

346
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
almost killed a kind soul

347
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
and broke into the Soul Land.

348
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
If it weren't for Tian Qian,

349
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,780
the

350
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
long-lost snow and the

351
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
cold and cold

352
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
will all be buried in pain.

353
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Isn't this a good deed?

354
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Why did you get punished?

355
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
My dear husband,

356
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
if you can't take care of Tong Feng,

357
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
let him move to the soup shop.

358
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I'll take care of him.

359
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
The Bi Luo Courtyard is big.

360
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
I don't need you to

361
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
teach me how to paint.

362
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Si Mo,

363
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
it's my fault.

364
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
The old rule

365
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
doesn't allow you to use magic

366
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
to hurt a mortal.

367
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Since I've broken the rule,

368
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I should be punished.

369
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
That's reasonable, right?

370
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Such a useless wine,

371
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
are you still willing to take it?

372
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
If you don't want to take it,

373
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I think you're a friend of Tong Feng's

374
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
and I'll take it from you.

375
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
If you insist

376
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
on taking it,

377
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I'll use my power

378
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
to take it.

379
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Of course I want to stay in the wine house.

380
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
There are so many good friends here.

381
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
And

382
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
it's a warm place.

383
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
