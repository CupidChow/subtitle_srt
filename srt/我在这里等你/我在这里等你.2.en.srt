00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tong Feng.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What are you doing?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
From today,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to study hard.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to send all the things

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that affect my study away.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I didn't hear wrong.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Life is full of ups and downs.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Not bad, Tong Feng.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It seems that you are going to study hard this time.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are willing to give up your study.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tong Feng, this is my favorite candy.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a reward for you.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where is Tong Feng?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Where did Tong Feng go?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh no, something happened.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go find him.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll go tell the Lord.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You...

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Who are you?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why did you bring me here?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't come over.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm telling you.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
My recent martial arts...

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The level of difficulty has increased.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ah!

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Little dog!

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who are you?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Aren't you afraid that your soul will be scattered?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Lord.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm Zhang Fei.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm the son of Zhang Fei.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm your son.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Lord.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My name is Zhang Juqian.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm the son of Zhang Fei.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's your real name?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was born in a court.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I only have one daughter.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have many enemies.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I never thought that

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
when I grew up,

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I fell in love with a sinister and cunning person.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My daughter died.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As a father,

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I couldn't bear to see her sad.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I agreed to this matter.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I wanted to make the person who was the vicious one

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
be honest with me.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I married my daughter

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
just to get my property.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't care about her at all.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In the end,

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
she pushed my daughter down the cliff.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She fell and broke her bones.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to take my daughter back to the court.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She broke my bones.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She was beaten to death.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Father.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let me stay in the cultivation.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Protect my daughter from the consequences.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't want to see that bastard again.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Zhang Juqian.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You've been in the prison for 100 years.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you don't turn back,

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you will be in a state of disarray.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not happy with that.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As long as my daughter is safe and happy.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Xuanbai.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You must know where that person is, right?

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Tell him.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He has passed away.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How is that possible?

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've been in the cultivation for 100 years.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How could I miss him?

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How could there be such a bad person?

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He has received his punishment.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What punishment?

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A warrior falls into the abyss of life.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He is not allowed to be a human.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Revenge.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Revenge.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Although you kidnapped someone else today,

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it's not because of you.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But there are rules in the prison.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will sentence you to three months' imprisonment.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
After three months, you will be transferred to the prison.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you, father.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why are there so many people in the prison?

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's complicated.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's better for us to be the ghosts.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But where is his daughter now?

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
His daughter has died long ago.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She has been transferred to the prison.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Zhang Juchen has a deep grudge after his death.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He doesn't want to be transferred.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He has been suffering for a long time.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He wants to avenge his death.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I feel that the mortal world is so bitter.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The mortal world is bitter and happy.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Only after you experience it,

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
can you know the feeling of it.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm afraid that

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
my past life is like that man.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is a cruel person.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How can I repay this debt?

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't think so.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Maybe you don't owe the debt.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe someone owes you a debt

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and has been waiting for you in the mortal world.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you don't go,

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
he will regret it forever.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Xiaobai, I understand.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We are ghosts.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We can't owe others.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But we can't let others owe us.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My lord. My lord.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Tong Feng is missing.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've been looking for you all afternoon.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why are you here?

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Maichen.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tong Feng.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Tong Feng, you...

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You just...

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
My lord.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ma Yichun, the second-rank official of Jiuhou.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll give you ten times to copy the law of Jiuhou.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Copy again?

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I understand.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My lord.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The light is so bright.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How's the arrangement for Tong Feng's night?

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My lord, you seem to be looking for me

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
for Tong Feng.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm just worried that you may lose your position.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ming, you're depressed.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The Tong Feng thing

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is arranged according to your order.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll wait for you to see it.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It seems that the time is coming.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Xuanpei.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Mingxuan, you're here too?

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Miss Tong Feng.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's late. What's up?

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I...

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll comb hair for Xuanpei.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Miss Tong Feng.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I won't bother you with this kind of thing.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll comb for you.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want a comb.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come on.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why are you so diligent?

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Xuanpei.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You look like a comb.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You mean

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I look like a comb?

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's not what I mean.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's the mark on your forehead.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's similar to the mark on this comb.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're here today

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
not just to comb my hair, right?

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Xuanpei.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I found that my recent charm

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and wisdom

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
have improved.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But my martial arts

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
can't be improved.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If I'm in danger next time,

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you can't save me.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What should I do?

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I won't allow

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
this time to come.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I want a good opportunity.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It takes a lot of strength to make a good opportunity.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Next time, when you go to the martial arts class,

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
learn from the teacher.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is there a time

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
when you can learn

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the way to improve your martial arts

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
in a moment?

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If I go to the mortal world,

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you won't be by my side.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I should...

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're too greedy.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm not greedy.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Xuanpei.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Your hair smells good.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You say.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Xuanpei.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What happened?

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Nothing.

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sir.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Brother Genghuan.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Brother Tongping.

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's wrong?

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Nothing.

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We're here to send you

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the punishment of Ma Yichun.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Tongfang.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Go to class.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Today's first class is Liu Taigong's class.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't be late.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's Liu Taigong's class again.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm always in his class.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm so stupid.

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What happened?

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sir.

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:56,540
The

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Is this your class?

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The next class is the cooking class.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No one can eat

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
except me.

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This class is so good.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Meng.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm telling you.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think I'm very talented

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
in cooking.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What do you say?

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Get him.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Meng.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This Wangchuan soup is so good.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Of course.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This Wangchuan soup

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is my specialty.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Lihua.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're so good today.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't even get through

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
with Niu Mei.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm so tired.

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Tongfang.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why are you here?

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm here to attend the cooking class.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Tongfang.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think you're so pretty.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think I'm pretty too.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Tongfang.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I like you so much.

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Thank you.

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I like myself too.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Tongfang.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't you really know

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
what I'm doing?

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you doing?

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I heard that

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the Lord gave you a delicious soup.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I want to eat it.

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So you're the one who's a little greedy.

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mai Yichun.

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Father.

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're eating again?

260
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You have a tooth.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What's wrong with my tooth?

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm a thousand years old.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But it's still a little big.

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's not always visible.

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I've asked the doctor.

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I just have to eat the soup.

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then you eat the soup

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and go to the dishes, okay?

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Be careful of customers complaining about you.

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So annoying.

272
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why is the business so good today?

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Little girl.

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I remember your business

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
was pretty bad before.

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why are you so busy today?

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He recently hired a beautiful guy

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to welcome guests in the hall.

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You see.

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The girl who is not good at cooking

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is not worth the investment.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Only this bowl of lotus soup

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
in my hand is good enough

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
for you to be like the moonlight.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So handsome.

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Enjoy your meal.

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They're all here.

289
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Come on.

290
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.

291
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is the four-leaf steamed rice

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I made carefully.

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Only the most elegant food

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
can be compared with your temperament.

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Sister.

296
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why are there still

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so many customers' dishes?

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Go, go, go.

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Brother Chun went out to pick up the dishes.

300
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Be careful of customers complaining about you.

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Boss Meng won't buy you sugar.

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I know, I know.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're taking money to help people.

304
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Tong Feng.

305
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This is Si Mo who just came.

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He will try Wangchuan Soup Shop from now on.

307
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hello, Si Mo.

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay, Tong Feng.

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This class ends here.

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The grass in Wangchuan Soup Shop is almost gone.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I have to go to the grass in Yuancang Mountain.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can only come back in a few days.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're leaving now?

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You're in such a hurry.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If it weren't for the class,

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I would have left a long time ago.

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Since you're busy,

318
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll stay and help.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay.

320
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm leaving then.

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Tong Feng.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're so pretty.

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Tong Feng.

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think you're so pretty.

325
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thank you.

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I also think I'm pretty.

327
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I like you.

328
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you.

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I also like myself.

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you really know what I'm doing?

331
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Or are you playing hard to get?

332
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I know.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I won't let you...

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Be careful.

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's hot.

336
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not cooked yet.

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Xuankai.

338
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're so pretty.

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What are you talking about?

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Xuankai.

341
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I really like you.

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What are you talking about?

343
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Xuankai.

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me taste the osmanthus cake, okay?

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Xuankai.

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why are you so hot?

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's...

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a little hot.

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's...

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hot?

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You want to eat a cake?

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Ma Yi Chuan came to me today

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and tricked me into eating the candy in my pocket.

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And a new friend

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
used the same method

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and took the candy you gave me.

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to use this method

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to trick Xuankai

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
into giving me the osmanthus cake.

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Wangchuan Cuisine

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
is very thoughtful.

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Remember to give me a gift.

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Xiao Mengzi is not here.

364
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Who gave this to you?

365
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So this is from Si Mo.

367
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Xuankai.

368
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Who is Si Mo?

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Si Mo is

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
a pretty young man

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that Xiao Mengzi hired.

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He is the friend you just met?

373
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So he is the one who asked you

374
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
for the candy?

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

376
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You ate his cake.

377
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't eat mine.

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Xuankai.

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you angry?

380
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

381
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No?

382
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No.

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In the future,

384
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
when you are angry with the adults,

385
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you can use the practice of calligraphy to coax him.

386
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No matter how angry he is,

387
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
he will be angry instantly.

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I dream of you even if I'm lost.

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In the misty rain,

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the light is bright.

391
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
My heart will forever shine for you.

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh.

393
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
In the misty rain,

394
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the light is bright.

395
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh.

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
In the night,

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I look forward to the spring.

398
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It is hard to say goodbye.

399
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Fate is uncertain.

400
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
How can I exchange my thoughts?

401
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The sound of the flute is echoing.

402
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The fireworks are shining.

403
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I am looking forward to it.

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The Long Ballad

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
