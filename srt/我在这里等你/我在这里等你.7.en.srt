1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Jingbao.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Jiuyou Quan Gui is meeting his family in the middle of the night.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Quan Gui has long legs.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Guess who he is.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Man Can.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
What are you looking at?

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,640
The river is close, the bird is far away.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
The fox is in the river, the bird is far away.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
The two birds are in the same boat.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
What do you mean?

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
I told you not to look.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
You still insist on looking.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
You can't understand.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Go.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,640
In short, someone may have a relationship.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,640
And this figure is like a statue.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
He has a crush on someone.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
How do you recognize him?

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Look at this figure.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Can't see clearly.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
But the shoulder is long and the legs are long.

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Look.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
There are two fat ducks in his arms.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
The taste is special.

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
It must be a statue.

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
The shape of the body is like a statue.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
The shape of the body is like a statue.

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
The taste is special.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
It must be a statue.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
But the legs of the statue are not so long.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Then who else can it be?

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Think about it.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
I feel like I can think about it.

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Where have I seen it?

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Who is it?

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Tong Feng.

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
What are you doing there?

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Come in and have a lesson.

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh.

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
After the battle of the gods and demons 4000 years ago,

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,640
the nine demons, the heaven and the devil, signed a contract.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Where have I seen it?

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
That duck.

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
It must have seen it.

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
I have thought about it.

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
The duck's wings.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
The shadow of the gods.

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
It's a circle.

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:30,280
It's a

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
circle.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Why are you here?

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Xuan Pei.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Jiuyou Xiaobao.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
You dress so neatly.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Where are you going?

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I always dress like this.

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Are you going out tonight?

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,280
Why?

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,080
I don't go out at night.

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,760
Yes, it's quite long.

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,480
Is there anything dirty behind me?

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,120
No, I'm sleepy.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm going to bed. Good night.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,400
My lord,

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,400
why do you look at the wine and the newspaper?

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I heard that the newspaper

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,400
is the best selling one.

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,400
I want to read it.

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
The newspaper seems to be

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,920
a secret letter from the Prime Minister.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,080
Don't blame him.

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,240
He probably doesn't want to be

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
known as a secret.

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,080
It's all because of these

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,920
useless internal affairs.

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,280
Does the hair style think of the Prime Minister as me?

79
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,240
My lord.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,040
My lord,

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
although the Prime Minister is caught in love,

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
he is not guilty of love

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
even if he talks about love.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,240
Talk about love?

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,320
The secret meeting of the Prime Minister

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,920
has spread to the whole Jiuyou.

88
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,840
It seems that we can only think of another way

89
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,000
to explain to Tong Feng.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
We will check all the news

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
of Jiuyou.

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,360
Immediately.

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,920
Tong Feng.

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,600
You scared me.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
Why are you so sneaky?

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Hush.

97
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm following the candidate.

98
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm with you.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,120
Let's go.

100
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,520
Mr. Lei, slow down.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
He can easily get lost.

102
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,920
Luckily, I caught up.

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,880
It's all your fault.

104
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,680
I almost got lost.

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
Didn't you get lost?

106
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,240
What are you afraid of?

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,280
Tong Feng.

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
You are so gossipy.

109
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
You are really suitable to join the Jiuyou newspaper.

110
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
The Jiuyou newspaper was blocked.

111
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,880
Do you know that?

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
Don't talk too much.

114
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,520
Don't be discovered.

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,560
Tong Feng.

116
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,280
Tong Feng.

117
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,920
Tong Feng.

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Tong Feng.

119
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,440
Tong Feng.

120
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,240
Tong Feng.

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
I...

122
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,040
This idiot.

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,680
He still got lost.

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
What are you going to do today?

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,720
Why did you call us all here?

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,240
You are the one who handles the affairs

127
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
of the Jiuyou newspaper.

128
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm the only one who has a name and a title.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm the only one who has a name and a title.

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm the only one who has a name and a title.

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,320
You are the only one who has a name and a title.

132
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,240
Who said that?

133
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
I'm not good at beauty.

134
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm going to get wrinkles on my face.

135
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,280
Are you going to help Mingxiang to save face?

136
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,320
That's why you called us here

137
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
to figure out a way together.

138
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,880
Mingxiang?

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,320
What's wrong with Mingxiang?

140
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,640
Mingxiang doesn't work for the newspaper?

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Let me tell you.

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Mingxiang and a mysterious person

143
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
were caught by the Jiuyou newspaper.

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
Today, the whole Jiuyou newspaper

145
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
is discussing this matter.

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,360
Yes.

147
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
That's what happened.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
Why are you looking at me like that?

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,920
Don't be so self-righteous.

150
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,960
You don't have long legs.

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Even the little cat doesn't like you.

152
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
Your legs are not long.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
I always live with my body.

154
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,960
Why is the suspense card missing?

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,080
It's all your fault.

156
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,280
You've been discussing gossip with me.

157
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,480
I lost the suspense card.

158
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
How can I be blamed?

159
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,440
What about me?

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,720
When you were talking about gossip,

161
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
you were happy, too.

162
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,640
You insisted on asking me

163
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,320
who is the most handsome man with long legs in Jiuyou.

164
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,640
I don't think it's Mingxiang.

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,760
Tong Feng.

166
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
You mean

167
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,040
you know longer legs?

168
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,120
I...

169
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,920
I don't know him.

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,400
Forget it.

171
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
Isn't this the Mingxiang Mansion?

172
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,800
Hey.

173
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,120
Isn't this the Mingxiang Mansion?

174
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,040
I know this place.

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
He must have been there.

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,120
Fu.

177
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Follow me.

178
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,400
Let's go inside and have a look.

179
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay.

180
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,560
Let's go.

181
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,080
Why did you suddenly ask us to leave?

182
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,840
It's getting late.

183
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,840
It's so weird.

184
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
You're really not in the mood today.

185
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
You may think

186
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,040
it's not good to discuss private matters with Mingxiang in public.

187
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,400
You want to save him some face.

188
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,520
You're really a lowly man.

189
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,960
You scared me.

190
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,000
I almost fell down.

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
Can you get up from my arms before you talk?

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,640
You're so smelly. You think I'm a man?

193
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,240
The one who brushed his eyebrows just now

194
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,320
seems to be the owner of Jiuyou.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Why did he

196
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,440
take photos of Brother Gouhun and Brother Duoming?

197
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,520
Listen to me.

198
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,320
Now the spy is really in the wrong.

199
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,080
He's trying to get the life.

200
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,800
They want to take photos of him.

201
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,320
I guess

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,600
the headline tomorrow

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,040
must be Gouhun getting the life.

204
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,880
Sir.

205
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,400
The information is recorded.

206
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,960
The headline of Gouhun and Sir Duoming

207
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,640
will be released within three days.

208
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,120
Three days?

209
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,920
No.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Tomorrow.

211
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,280
The headline will be released tomorrow.

212
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,080
Tomorrow.

213
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
The headline will be released normally.

214
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,480
Thank you, sir.

215
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,200
Thank you, sir.

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,280
He should know that

217
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,640
the spy is just a fake.

218
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,920
He's making a fool of himself.

219
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,040
Gouyao Lingyun

220
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,040
was a saintess of the Demon Clan.

221
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,440
Born in the holy place of the Demon Clan,

222
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,640
the night of the release of the Moon Flower of Jiutan.

223
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,400
The Moon Flower of Jiutan was born after three thousand years.

224
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,760
It bloomed in the purple night.

225
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,760
When it bloomed,

226
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,840
the flowers were fragrant.

227
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,000
The birds were dancing.

228
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,400
The stars were in the sky.

229
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,520
The Phoenix was in the sky.

230
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,320
The Moon Flower of Jiutan

231
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,920
is so beautiful.

232
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,520
The Moon Flower of Jiutan.

233
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,720
Read it first.

234
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,040
Why are you here again?

235
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,080
I came here long ago.

236
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,120
You didn't notice me.

237
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,440
You've been out of your mind all day.

238
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,400
I can see you everywhere.

239
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Tell me.

240
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,760
Do you want to see the Moon Flower of Jiutan?

241
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,800
The Moon Flower of Jiutan was bloomed once in three thousand years.

242
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,880
Gouyao Lingyun was born in the spring of the Demon Clan.

243
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,920
The ninth day of the ninth month.

244
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
The Demon Clan was born in the spring of the ninth month.

245
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
This year is the spring.

246
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,880
The ninth day of the ninth month.

247
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,400
That means the day after tomorrow.

248
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,760
So...

249
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
So the day after tomorrow

250
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,120
is the day the Moon Flower of Jiutan blooms.

251
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,640
But the Moon Flower of Jiutan is in the Demon Realm.

252
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,480
We can't go there in private.

253
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,680
If you want to go,

254
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
I'll take you there.

255
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Really?

256
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,440
Of course.

257
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,400
You can come to me at three o'clock the day after tomorrow.

258
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,360
But remember.

259
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,560
Don't tell anyone

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,760
that I'm taking you to the Demon Realm.

261
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,040
Why?

262
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,720
The Demon Realm is a criminal.

263
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,240
You don't want us to be punished together, do you?

264
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,280
Okay.

265
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,880
I'll teach you a lesson.

266
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,000
Sorry for the wait.

267
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,040
Sorry for the wait.

268
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,080
You're here.

269
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,600
Did anyone follow you?

270
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,480
No.

271
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,520
No.

272
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,440
I'll do it.

273
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,320
Don't worry.

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm not worried about you.

275
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,360
Here.

276
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,080
Eat this.

277
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,080
It can hide the smell of your wine.

278
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,120
It's delicious.

279
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
Is there anything else?

280
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,280
Let's go.

281
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,160
Let's go.

282
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,560
This is the Demon Realm.

283
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,360
It's amazing.

284
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,920
So this is the Demon Realm.

285
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,800
Yes.

286
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,960
This is the biggest Chixia Demon Realm.

287
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,880
Although there are also market places in Jiuyou,

288
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
the scenery of these two places

289
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,600
is different.

290
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,800
It's much more lively here than Jiuyou.

291
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,760
Right?

292
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,360
Today,

293
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,480
it's the 3000-year-old

294
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Jiutan Moon Flower Festival.

295
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,400
Demon Realm is celebrating its birthday.

296
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,520
So it's more lively than usual.

297
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,640
What's that?

298
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,200
Two guests, please have a bowl.

299
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,760
This is the most famous snack here.

300
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,960
Gulin Tangyuan.

301
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,240
Gulin Tangyuan?

302
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,920
Do you want to eat?

303
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,600
Have a bowl.

304
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,080
Okay.

305
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
Have a bowl.

306
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,160
Have a bite.

307
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,120
Have a bite.

308
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,000
It's delicious.

309
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,280
There's Tangyuan over there.

310
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,000
Go and have a look.

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,720
Tangyuan?

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Come on, girl.

313
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,160
See if there's anything you like.

314
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
This is nice.

315
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,800
Do you like it?

316
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,080
Do you like it?

317
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,560
I like it.

318
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,760
Your Highness.

319
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,360
Look who's that.

320
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,080
Si Mo.

321
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,240
Who's that girl?

322
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,640
Your Highness, it's just a show.

323
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,120
She's not as beautiful as you.

324
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,560
It's been 4,000 years.

325
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,040
Since that girl disappeared,

326
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,360
Si Mo hasn't laughed like that again.

327
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,920
It's just a show.

328
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,640
I'm afraid you can't even fool yourself.

329
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,160
Your Highness,

330
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
you're so noble.

331
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,960
Why are you afraid of that

332
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,560
wild girl who doesn't know where she is?

333
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,960
I can feel it.

334
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,240
That person is not a demon.

335
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,080
What's the smell?

336
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,800
This one.

337
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,160
Who are you?

338
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm Princess Yuzhi of the Demon Clan.

339
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
Princess Yuzhi?

340
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Why are you helping me?

341
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Yuzhi.

342
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,400
What?

343
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,280
Yuzhi.

344
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,400
What?

345
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,760
You're so rude.

346
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,720
You little girl.

347
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,280
Princess Yuzhi,

348
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
don't be mad.

349
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,080
You're here to help me, right?

350
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
You didn't achieve your goal.

351
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,680
You cut me off.

352
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm sorry.

354
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm such a big deal.

357
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,120
Tell me.

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,120
What's your relationship with Si Mo?

359
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,600
I...

360
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
The Demon Realm is a criminal.

361
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,880
You don't want us to be punished together, right?

362
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,560
I don't know Si Mo.

363
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,640
You took the Yan Demon Pill.

364
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,280
Although it covers your smell of deep sorrow,

365
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,360
it also seals your power.

366
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,400
If you're a real person,

367
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,760
you should tell the truth.

368
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,720
Princess Yuzhi,

369
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,800
I really don't know Si Mo.

370
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,280
I don't have any impression of him.

371
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,200
I'll give you one last chance.

372
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,400
What's the relationship between you and Si Mo?

373
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,680
I hate you so much.

374
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,080
Sir, we didn't find Tong Feng.

375
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,000
Tong Feng isn't in the cellar.

376
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,040
He's not in the cellar?

377
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,240
But Uncle didn't come today.

378
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Where can he go?

379
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,920
Right.

380
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,320
I didn't see Tong Feng this morning.

381
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,400
Tong Feng's breath is not in the cellar.

382
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,240
Do you think you're a soul?

383
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
This fire can't hurt me.

384
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Listen,

385
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,840
this fire is the fire that I use to bind the magic power.

386
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,280
Once it burns,

387
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,800
you'll be in a state of soul destruction.

388
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
You can't turn back forever.

389
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,360
Help.

390
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,040
Help.

391
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
He's in the Demon Realm.

392
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,640
Please tell me if this fire is a skill of yours,

393
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,920
Traveler and the Black commanders are no match for each other.

394
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,240
They are surrounded by

395
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,660
all kinds of evil beings.

396
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,000
I would like to find Alliance Please work at yourrasimha

397
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,540
to save Immortal Plans.

398
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,800
Okay.

399
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,720
Thank you, Great Han!

400
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,460
Thank you, Great Han!

401
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,600
That's not a result.
