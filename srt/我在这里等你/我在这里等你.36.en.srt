00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The Taoism Grandmaster...

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sister, you met a scoundrel.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I also think he doesn't look like a good person.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He's so annoying.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He didn't confess his feelings to you last night,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but he said he did.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He wanted you to think that you two are in a relationship,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and he wanted to take you down.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He's such a bastard.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He's so annoying.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to beat him up.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who are you going to beat?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What's the time now?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But you can post a post online

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
saying that the Crown Prince of Pei Group is having an affair.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Xiaofeng, I don't think Pei Xuan is a good person.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If he had liked you long ago,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
why didn't he contact you?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In my opinion, if he's a cunning black cat,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you're a stupid fat fish.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or else, let's just forget it.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Fat fish?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Can't I be a beautiful fish?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go together.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Kiss me again.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Kiss me again.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
One, two, one.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
One, two, one.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiaofeng, you...

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You run faster.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you don't run faster, you'll be in trouble.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can't run anymore.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You won't pass the test.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't stand it anymore.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why don't you go first?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll come to you later.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Go to sleep.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you doing?

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why are you hiding from me?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I...

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to leave here.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll wait for you at the end.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's going on?

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's going on?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Pei Xuan, even if you're really a black cat,

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll show you that

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not a bully.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Boss, one

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Boss, give me one.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why did you buy two tickets today?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm so unlucky recently.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Even if I meet a scumbag,

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm still embarrassing myself in front of my classmates.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm so lucky to buy two tickets.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, okay.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, let's go.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hold it.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Boss, two.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Boss, give me one.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why are you so bad?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, Sister Lianhua, I'm in a hurry.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me...

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How can that be?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We've been here for so long.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Forget it.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let him buy it first.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Anyway, the money is used to buy tickets.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know when to buy it.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Boss, I think I won a prize.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
First prize.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's really a first prize.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Young man, you're so lucky.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's really a first prize.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
First prize.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
First prize.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you, beautiful sisters.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you, beautiful sisters.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I won a prize.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Look at her.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She's so lucky.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That ticket...

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It should be mine.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay, okay.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hello, beautiful sisters.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm Tong Xiaofeng.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hello, Senior.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I've seen your show,

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and I'm your fan.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Senior, is the heroine

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
playing the role of Brother Pei?

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You and Brother Pei...

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You and Brother Pei...

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How can they be like reporters?

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Senior Pei.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Senior Pei.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Senior Pei.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Senior Pei.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So beautiful.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So beautiful.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So beautiful.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss,

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you should wear your crystal shoes.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go on.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Senior Pei.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Senior Pei.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Can Tong Xiaofeng

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
tell us

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
about her understanding of Xuan Pei?

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
How can she

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
be so stubborn?

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Either she's a top-notch

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
or she's a silly girl

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
who really likes her.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course, it's the second kind.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Xuan Pei's origin

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is a cat.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a cat

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that will have a nervous system

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and become a pet.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But it's a qualified husband

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
who has the heart to pretend to be a human.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I like the role of Xuan Pei.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Since it's a sharing party,

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'd like to share

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
my favorite lines.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Is it the line that

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Master Pei asked him to recite?

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's great.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a public trip.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm getting a heart attack.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The clouds in the mountains float.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The moon in the sky is always round.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The clouds in the mountains

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
chase the moon in the sky.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There are various

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
clever arrangements in the world.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The arrangements are wrong

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
every second.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All the coincidences

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
are a fact.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I haven't written this line.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Senior Pei.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
About the novel,

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I admit

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I wrote it with you as the original.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But when I first started writing it,

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't know

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that it would be on the sales list.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't know

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that it would be on the school's school list.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
were talking to me

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because of the novel,

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
then

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I shouldn't have taken you as the original.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I shouldn't have liked you.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There are 28 stars in the sky.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
One is called the body,

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and the other is called the soul.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
People say that

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the body and the soul are inseparable.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But I

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
have to wait for the miracle.

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What do you mean?

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I mean

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:20,020
the

179
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
next week,

180
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
my teaching will be over.

181
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
You...

182
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
You're leaving?

183
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,980
Tong Xiaofeng,

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,220
if you're not feeling well,

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
then

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,020
I will

187
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
reach out to

188
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,320
you.

189
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,020
When Erstwhile went to China,

190
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,200
he promised me

191
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,260
that I should

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
be strong

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,680
Come on.

194
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,400
Honey.

195
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,200
Honey.

196
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,520
Get up.

197
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,040
Xiaochun should go to school.

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Let her go alone.

199
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
You're still a human being.

200
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
She's only eight.

201
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,960
You let her go to school alone.

202
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,920
Yuping.

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,600
I believe in him.

204
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,920
As long as I can rest assured,

205
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,320
nobody will wear your clothes.

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,320
They don't work.

207
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,760
Dad, mom.

208
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,480
Dad, mom.

209
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
Why hasn't he got up yet?

210
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
Dad, he...

211
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,640
I can't send you to school today.

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,720
Pei Xuan, what's wrong with you?

213
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,360
How can you treat your own son like this?

214
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,640
Mom, dad won't send me again.

215
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
My classmates all think

216
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,320
my parents are divorced.

217
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,440
Xiaochun, you're really my little secreto.

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Let's go.

219
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,920
Son,

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
have you remembered

221
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,720
the lipstick I put on you?

222
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,520
Yes.

223
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,400
I went to English class today.

224
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,840
I didn't go to the amusement park to eat ice cream.

225
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,120
You're really my good son.

226
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
You two.

227
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,360
Mom.

228
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,520
Honey, listen to me.

229
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,640
It's all my son's.

230
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
Mom,

231
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,080
dad insisted on taking me there.

232
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Honey.

233
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
Here, here, here.

234
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,960
Honey, honey, listen to me.

235
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm not...

236
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
Easy, easy, easy.

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,440
Today,

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
your college friends are coming to see you?

239
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Yes.

240
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,960
They brought their families.

241
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,480
Honey,

242
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,880
help me clean up the table later.

243
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
Okay.

244
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm a high-ranking wife.

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
Dad, mom,

246
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,320
don't show your affection.

247
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm so hungry.

248
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Then you're hungry.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,120
Is it your birthday?

250
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Go and clean up.

251
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,640
Got it.

252
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll eat it later.

253
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,480
They're here.

254
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,720
They're here.

255
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Got it.

256
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,520
Surprise.

257
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Welcome.

258
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,000
This is Professor Liu.

259
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
Professor Liu, my boyfriend.

260
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Hello, Tong Xiaofeng.

261
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
Actually, I'm here now.

262
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Leave him alone.

263
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,160
Take care of your sister.

264
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm so tired.

265
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Come in and sit.

266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
Hi, Pei.

267
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,440
Xiaohuang, long time no see.

268
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,880
Long time no see.

269
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,720
Tong Xiaofeng, right?

270
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,960
My sister said

271
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,360
you're the most beautiful girl in this neighborhood.

272
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
This is...

273
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
My brother.

274
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Hello, brother.

275
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
It's a pity.

276
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,480
You look so beautiful.

277
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,320
You're already married.

278
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Enough.

279
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,480
Sit down.

280
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm starving.

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Did you buy the ingredients yesterday?

282
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
Mom.

283
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
Auntie Niu is here.

284
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,800
Xiaochun,

285
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
it's been a long time since we met.

286
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,640
Do you miss your aunt?

287
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,160
No.

288
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,000
This kid

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,160
is the same aunt.

290
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,720
He buys the same toy every time.

291
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
Why does he like Niu so much?

292
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Maybe it's fate.

293
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,560
Sit down.

294
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,080
Okay.

295
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,080
Pei.

296
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,720
Hi, Pei.

297
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,000
Long time no see.

298
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,640
Honey, are you ready?

299
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,400
Come up.

300
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,160
Tongtong is ready.

301
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,320
Thank you, Xiaofeng.

302
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,600
Thank you, Tong.

303
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,560
Enjoy your meal.

304
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,320
You're welcome.

305
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay.

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm so full.

307
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,360
Son, I'll go get you some food.

308
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
Xiaofeng.

309
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,960
Isn't this the play

310
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,760
that Tianxuan played recently?

311
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,000
You fell in love with me.

312
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Your brother is so handsome. I love him.

313
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,840
Take a break.

314
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Niu is angry.

315
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,320
Why would he be angry?

316
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,600
He's no match for Tianxuan.

317
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,800
Your words

318
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,120
are so low-key

319
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
and very attractive.

320
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
As men,

321
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,800
we should

322
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,680
look at our character

323
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,600
and our knowledge.

324
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,480
You're so naughty.

325
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
You only know these two things.

326
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,880
Let's toast to everyone.

327
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,520
Here.

328
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
Here.

329
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,960
Thank you.

330
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,840
Thank you.

331
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,600
It tastes like

332
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
the one in Shanghai.

333
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
This is delicious.

334
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,480
Come on.

335
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,960
Add some more.

336
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,600
Thank you.

337
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,240
Let's just

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,160
keep being happy.

339
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,640
Tong Xiaofeng and Pei Xue,

340
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,080
in the 21st century,

341
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,040
have the cutest child,

342
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
the most precious friend,

343
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,920
and the most sincere love.

344
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,320
This is the happy life.

345
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,960
Here.

346
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,440
Have some more.

347
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,160
Thank you.

348
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,200
Your Excellency,

349
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,080
it's almost time.

350
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,640
Would you like to go back to the prison?

351
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
I've got what I want.

352
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,560
I don't want to go back.

353
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,680
Ming,

354
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,080
I'm relieved to have you.

355
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,240
The illusion can only last for a few decades.

356
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,680
Are you really going to give up your position

357
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
and keep the illusion?

358
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,240
But only in this way

359
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
can I keep it.

360
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,160
Now the Your Excellency is missing.

361
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,080
Honey,

362
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
why did you wake up?

363
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,960
I had a dream.

364
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,720
I remember there's a man in a suit

365
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,520
who said he'd take me somewhere.

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
That man.

367
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,800
Where is he going to take my husband?

368
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,840
You can't go anywhere without me.

369
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
Honey.

370
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
If there's really a next life,

371
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
what do you want to do?

372
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,680
If there's a next life,

373
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,940
I'll go wash your eyes.

374
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,320
It's done.

375
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,400
Very good.

376
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,860
Remember photos.

377
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
I'm not afraid of death

378
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
I'm not afraid of death

379
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
I'm not afraid of death

380
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,860
I'm not afraid of death

381
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,860
I'm not afraid of death

382
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
I'm not afraid of death

383
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
I'm not afraid of death

384
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
I'm not afraid of death

385
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
