1
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:04,129
This is yassa spicy

2
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:05,344
"Yassa?"

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,217
Dan, what does "yassa" mean?

4
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:09,367
Do you want me to look it up?

5
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:10,367
No!

6
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:15,586
Ya...

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,328
Yas! It's hot

8
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,646
Oh, "yas"

9
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:22,505
By the way,

10
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:25,365
why did you take Dan's phone?

11
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:28,092
Oh, that's because...

12
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,803
You shouldn't use your phone
when you eat

13
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:34,982
That's totally against table manners
You know it, right?

14
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:36,420
You know it, right?

15
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,688
You were more of a Confucian boy
than I thought

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,063
I get it, but can you
return my phone?

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,755
(What is this revolutionary peach juice?)

18
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:03,778
(It's so good)

19
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,661
You have to eat Level 5 for Yupdduk

20
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:09,838
I agree

21
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,768
(South Korean high school students
are more potent than expected)

22
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:17,738
(Input complete)

23
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,318
Ah!

24
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,118
Are you an idiot?

25
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:43,024
Give it to me

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,584
You always spill it on the same spot

27
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,817
- I'm a consistent person
- Ugh

28
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,834
Stay still for a bit

29
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:01,886
Oh?

30
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,777
It's my teacher from Hanawon

31
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:12,341
Yes

32
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,313
Oh, I'm doing fine

33
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:18,038
How have you been?

34
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,907
Of course, I'm Kang Yuhyeok

35
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:25,854
I'm sticking to your words and having
a good relationship with my friends

36
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:29,184
Ah...

37
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:34,015
No one knows I'm a
North Korean defector yet

38
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:36,179
I'm planning to tell them
when the time comes

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,374
Yes, then I'll come and see you

40
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:40,827
Yes

41
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:55,707
Hello! I'm not two or three
but only one, Hana

42
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:58,808
Today's content is a Vlog
on my school life

43
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:02,474
But before we get started, please like,
subscribe, and set notifications

44
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:05,330
There she goes again
early in the morning

45
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,064
First, let me introduce my friends

46
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,190
This is my bosom frien...

47
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,991
I mean, my best friend, Jo Dan

48
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,890
Please say hello!

49
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,421
What? I have to study

50
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:25,455
My friend is studying hard every day
to go to a prestigious university

51
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,392
Oh, and I made a new friend

52
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,038
Ta-da!

53
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,812
Please introduce yourself

54
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:35,202
Hello, I'm Kang Yuhyeok

55
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:38,719
We became BFFs just two days
after we met, right?

56
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:40,091
BFFs?

57
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,185
BFFs

58
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,225
(She said "BFF")

59
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:49,776
(Back at home, we call it "close friends")

60
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:53,508
That's right! We're close frien...
I mean, we're BFFs!

61
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:56,027
We're BFFs! Yeah!

62
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,852
Can you keep it down?

63
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,434
- I'm sorry
- Sorry

64
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,819
(He's exactly how I visioned
a handsome South Korean guy)

65
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,585
(I'm not sure if it's okay for me to look
at such a handsome face for free)

66
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,425
Yuhyeok

67
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,262
Come out for a second

68
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:32,951
Okay

69
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:51,124
You know what?

70
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:56,003
I have a crush on someone

71
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,847
And

72
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,206
that person is...

73
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:01,790
(Wait)

74
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,594
(Don't tell me it's me?)

75
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,282
Hana

76
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:07,891
It's only been two days since
I transferred schools...

77
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,891
I like Dan

78
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,259
Huh?

79
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,414
I like Jo Dan

80
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,238
Oh, I thought...
You scared me

81
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:24,009
Then you can confess to him

82
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,994
Do you want me to break my two-year
friendship with Dan and distance him?

83
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,458
So...

84
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,002
Can you help me?

85
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,754
Me? How?

86
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:39,754
There's nothing much

87
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,796
Discretely change seats for me
so I can sit next to Dan

88
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:42,930
And it'll be nice if you could make
his hands brush past me

89
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,564
Oh! Compliment me
from time to time

90
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,972
Tell him that you think Hana is
pretty, cute, and charming

91
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,225
I think that's quite a lot

92
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,772
So you won't?

93
00:05:58,815 --> 00:05:59,943
Fine

94
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,965
It'll help me get
closer to Dan as well

95
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,824
I knew it!
You're my BFF!

96
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,240
Would you let go?

97
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:12,099
I feel much lighter
after talking to you

98
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,232
Do you also have a secret?

99
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:16,269
Tell me
I'll listen to it all

100
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,089
A secret?

101
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,214
I don't have any

102
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
For real?

103
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,318
Yes

104
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,594
(Should I try telling Hana?)

105
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,531
(No, no)

106
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,063
(What if we drift apart?)

107
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,037
My seat happens to be right in front
of the A/C and it's freezing

108
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,114
The A/C doesn't reach me, do you want
to change seats? I don't get cold easily

109
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,841
Really?

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,075
Yuhyeok, you're so considerate
Thanks!

111
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:01,880
Wear this if you're cold

112
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:05,406
I'll ask them to turn off the A/C

113
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,859
Huh?

114
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,721
Oh... Thanks

115
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:31,326
It's so difficult to focus
on studying today

116
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,537
Should the three of us do
a high-five for energy?

117
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:37,251
Wow! That's a great idea!

118
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,321
Can I join in?

119
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:39,618
You stay out of it

120
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:40,650
This!

121
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:43,630
Drinking this will give you energy

122
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:46,009
Thanks

123
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:49,135
Thanks a lot

124
00:07:57,206 --> 00:08:00,129
Don't you think Hana is really kind?

125
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:05,069
Even if she's the class president,
looking after a transfer student isn't easy

126
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,319
She has a bright personality
and she looks cute

127
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,600
I think Hana is really charming...

128
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,407
Kang Yuhyeok

129
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,110
I guess you don't know
much about me yet

130
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,992
But I don't have a good temper

131
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,570
I don't like it when
people provoke me

132
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:29,765
Or bother me

133
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:32,429
Moreover, I hate

134
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:34,802
getting something
taken away from me

135
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,394
So

136
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,581
don't cross the line

137
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:47,909
Because I know it all
