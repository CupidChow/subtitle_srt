1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,361
(Since when did he know?)

2
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:04,031
(Just when?)

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,547
(That's it)

4
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,500
(I'll be honest at least with Hana)

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,610
(Hana will)

6
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,641
(understand me for sure)

7
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,672
Look at the chalkboard as if it were BTS

8
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:17,766
and the textbook as if it were aespa

9
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,269
That's it for today's class

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,010
- Hana
- Yes

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,450
Can I talk to you for a second?

12
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:34,661
You can talk to me for longer

13
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,976
So you're eventually crossing the line

14
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:57,266
[Unarmed Romance]

15
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,560
(Pluck up courage, Kang Yuhyeok)

16
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,155
What is it?
Why are you so serious?

17
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:05,967
Don't tell me you're asking me out

18
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:06,967
Hana

19
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:11,837
I'm from North Korea

20
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:17,755
Is that so?

21
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,079
I'm from Jeju-do

22
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,517
I'm not kidding

23
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,221
Neither am I

24
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,058
I'm sorry for not telling you

25
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,497
I couldn't tell you that I was from
the North from the start

26
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:45,756
You are surprised, aren't you?

27
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:48,111
What do you mean?

28
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,068
If you say

29
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:52,959
you're from outer space,

30
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:54,855
I'll be surprised then

31
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:59,284
But I'm kind of disappointed

32
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,585
I told you that I had a crush on Dan

33
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:08,851
Why did you worry about it on your own?

34
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,487
Weren't we BFFs?

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,244
What kind of BFFs is like this?

36
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,853
I plucked up my courage
because we're BFFs

37
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,518
I thought you'd understand

38
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:25,354
Okie, I accept

39
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:27,397
But...

40
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:30,979
You'd better tell me first when
you have a secret from now on

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
All right

42
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:36,837
Then since we both have a secret

43
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,869
we're really BFFs now

44
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,252
What do you call BFFs in North Korea?

45
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:45,991
We call it "Close friends"

46
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,459
"Close friends?"

47
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,921
I look forward to getting along with you,
"Close friend"

48
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,160
Yeah

49
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:54,395
I'll go inside after going to the bathroom
You get going first

50
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:14,577
Follow me to the auditorium

51
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:26,873
- Did you confess?
- How did you know?

52
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:30,755
I told you

53
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:33,851
I know it all

54
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,625
Actually, I meant to tell you as well

55
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:40,789
From the start,

56
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,838
I didn't like you

57
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,089
Beat it when I'm being nice

58
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,577
This is the last warning

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
(Beat it?)

60
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,826
(I tried so hard to become an average
high schooler in South Korea)

61
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:03,548
(Is he telling me to transfer schools?)

62
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:05,648
I can't do that

63
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:07,501
No, I won't

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
You won't?

65
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,425
Do I look like a pushover?

66
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,417
Huh?

67
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:21,480
I'm sorry for not telling you

68
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:24,576
How can I tell you I'm from the North
on the first day of school?

69
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:28,130
What do you mean?

70
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:30,083
You're from the North?

71
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,334
Huh?

72
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,078
Then are you a North Korean defector?

73
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,086
Didn't you know?

74
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,611
I mean, how can you... Huh?

75
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,854
How can you misunderstand
that I have a crush on Hana?

76
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,809
I only did that because Hana asked me
to set her up with you

77
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,290
And I also have something called
an ideal type, and Hana is just...

78
00:04:58,762 --> 00:04:59,997
She's not my type

79
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,755
Of course, Kim Hana...

80
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,773
...can't be your type

81
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,288
Also,

82
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:13,039
I'm not into cliche love stories
engaging a transfer student

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,697
You know, like in dramas

84
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,323
I dream of falling in love

85
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,723
through a coincidental encounter

86
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,448
All right

87
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:26,854
Anyway

88
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,073
I'm sorry I misunderstood you

89
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:33,917
It's fine

90
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,571
I didn't say it first, either

91
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:41,062
You must've suffered as much as I did

92
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,682
I guess so

93
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,863
So when are you going to ask her out?

94
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:55,347
Are you okay?

95
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,583
Ask her out?

96
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,651
Yeah, ask her out...

97
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:05,576
How do I do that?

98
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:06,577
Eh?

99
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,842
Were you forever alone?

100
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,991
I've flirted

101
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:16,296
But that doesn't count as dating

102
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:18,702
How can you be forever alone
with this face?

103
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,191
Don't spread the word
I mean it

104
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:34,673
As some with experience,
should I give you some tips?

105
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,493
Forget it

106
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,213
I'll take care of it myself

107
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,134
It's no big deal once you say it

108
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,948
So muster your courage like me!

109
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,090
I knew it

110
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,403
He's not setting the mood to
ask her out, and just walking

111
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:57,696
He's driving me nuts

112
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,545
Why did you call me over?

113
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,897
If you have nothing to say,
I'll head back inside

114
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,266
Well...

115
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:25,226
I like you

116
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,001
What did you just...

117
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,003
I said I like you

118
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,542
There you go!
That's it!

119
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:57,326
You know what?

120
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,521
Let's stop being friends

121
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:09,304
Instead of just friends,

122
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,150
let's be girlfriend and boyfriend

123
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,457
Idiot, this is how you confess

124
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:27,848
Hana

125
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,224
Can I cross the line?

126
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,108
Huh?

127
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,250
I thought Jo Dan was forever alone

128
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,032
Or is he gifted?

129
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,347
I'm jealous

130
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,558
(Only one)
Dan, Hana

131
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,519
Even their names make them
a perfect couple

132
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,114
I'm jealous

133
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:06,357
My lonely life

134
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:16,336
(I'm not into cliche love stories
engaging a transfer student)

135
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,227
(You know, like in dramas)

136
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,342
(Falling in love through
a coincidental encounter)
