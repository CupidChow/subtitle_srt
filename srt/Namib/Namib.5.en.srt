00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,840
Look at A!

182
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,690
What are you looking at? It's C, C.

183
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,960
Okay.

184
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,130
B, B, B!

185
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,630
D, D!

186
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,010
That's right.

187
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,290
A, E, I,

188
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,080
The basics of vocals are about breathing.

189
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,610
E, I,

190
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,990
- O, U.
- Louder!

191
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,490
Open your shoulders more.

192
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,680
Keep your posture. That's right.

193
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,880
Make sure to breathe out evenly.

194
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,730
You're almost there. Fighting!

195
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,450
Keep at it!

196
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,630
Ji Young, are you okay?

197
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,050
You need to win this audition program! Let's go!

198
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,360
Look at the camera. The camera. Nice.

199
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,240
Ji Young, nice! Nice!

200
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,060
Nice, nice, with control!

201
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,990
Just a moment.

202
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,480
Let's take a break.

203
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,820
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

204
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,580
Just take a quick break.

205
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,750
- Drink some water.
- Thank you.

206
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,250
- Water.
- Thank you.

207
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,450
- Jin Woo.
- Yes.

208
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,630
Look at the video.

209
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,090
<i>These are our company's new products.</i>

210
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,830
- You see how you keep lowering your head?
- Yes.

211
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,580
- Look straight ahead.
- Okay.

212
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,820
Even if you're rushed to do the moves, you have to look straight ahead.

213
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,270
We don't want to see the top of your head.

214
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,310
All right. It's a fun singing time.

215
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,060
- Pardon?
- Ms. Hong.

216
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,030
Can't we rest for a little longer? Please...

217
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,040
Okay. Just 10 minutes.

218
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,470
When will the results be announced?

219
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,820
In two days.

220
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,350
They should announce it sooner. The kids are waiting.

221
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,560
How do you feel about it?

222
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,870
I think we'll have good results.

223
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,120
I don't really know.

224
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,220
You feel like you did well but also screwed it up, right?

225
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,050
Yes.

226
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,430
You're curious as to whether you performed well,

227
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,220
or not, right?

228
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,710
- Yes.
- Right, this is it.

229
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,040
That was the thing I found strange about Yoo Jin Woo as well.

230
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,110
I've known Yoo Jin Woo for so long,

231
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,480
but it's the first time I've seen him curious about anything.

232
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,780
He was always ambivalent and apathetic to everything.

233
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,190
What do you think it means to be curious about something?

234
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,420
Think about it.

235
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,560
Jin Woo, let's go out.

236
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,150
- Where?
- I've reserved a good place.

237
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,300
We don't have many customers today.

238
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,240
This is the type of business I want to set up.

239
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,630
It's not a dark, shady bar

240
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,980
nor is it a squalid restaurant?

241
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,950
A refined and nice place like this.

242
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,950
Eat up.

243
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,880
It sounds cool.

244
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,700
But Hyung...

245
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,440
I have something to tell you.

246
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,300
Okay. You should speak your mind.

247
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,040
I'll pay you whatever you want for your salary.

248
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,140
It's not that.

249
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,770
I think my audition results will come out soon.

250
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,790
- Audition?
- Yeah.

251
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,480
Jin Woo.

252
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,450
You promised to run a business with me.

253
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,670
You'll be graduating next year. You should come to your senses.

254
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,370
You don't have your hopes up about being successful on the audition, are you?

255
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,990
Okay.

256
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,630
Let's say you get good results by some miracle.

257
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,610
You think you'll win or something?

258
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,180
You think you'll become a star or a celebrity, huh?

259
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,340
Jin Woo, I saw what happens

260
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,120
when someone keeps dreaming about what they can't achieve.

261
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,900
They die.

262
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,310
They die!

263
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,200
You think I'm lying?

264
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,450
Let's wrap everything up by tomorrow.

265
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,850
That woman will abandon you anyway.

266
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,500
So...

267
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,030
leave her before you get kicked out.

268
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,210
Hyung.

269
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,240
Was a name decided for your group?

270
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,610
No.

271
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,580
But my stage name was decided.

272
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,240
- You know what it is?
- What is it?

273
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,980
Chris.

274
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,090
Do you think it's tacky?

275
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,090
I think it's so cool.

276
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,970
Did you come up with it?

277
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,170
I heard CEO Kang Su Hyeon came up with it.

278
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,050
Jin Woo.

279
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm going to try really hard.

280
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,990
I won't...

281
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,530
ever...

282
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,900
end up like that.

283
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,920
This is my last chance.

284
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm sorry, but your debut has been pushed back.

285
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,130
Pardon?

286
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,480
To when?

287
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,650
- Indefinitely.
- Indefinitely?

288
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,510
Why? I... Why...

289
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,700
Why are you doing that?

290
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,820
It's the company's situation. That's all you need to know.

291
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,210
Does CEO Kang know about this, too?

292
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,990
She's the one who made the decision.

293
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,550
Deputy, Deputy!

294
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,120
What will happen to me, then?

295
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,710
What can we do? Just keep training.

296
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,380
What more must I do from here?

297
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,240
Deputy, if this team is broken up,

298
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,030
I have to leave this company.

299
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,230
That's your problem.

300
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,530
What's wrong with this?

301
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,050
I just fixed you. How could you break down already?

302
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,780
Gosh, the smell.

303
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,600
My car's broken down.

304
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,530
Just go around me.

305
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,170
Man, I said my car's broken down.

306
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,670
Hey. Can't you see that my car's broken down?

307
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,660
I heard the news.

308
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,940
I heard you invested a lot into Pandora.

309
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,550
Yeah, that's right.

310
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,230
That's right...

311
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,290
Why do you speak casually to me? You're younger than me.

312
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,610
Then, do the same to me.

313
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,830
Did you think you'd live comfortably

314
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,120
after driving a stake through my heart?

315
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,500
A-A stake? Me?

316
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,680
You came in between Kang Su Hyeon and me

317
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,300
- and stole her from me!
- What?

318
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,240
<i>- Wasn't he your secretary?
- No.</i>

319
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,560
My wife never considered you seriously.

320
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,350
She was already dating me back then!

321
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,300
Again, again, again! You're hurting me again.

322
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,620
Wait.

323
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,880
So, did you plot all this because Kang Su Hyeon married me instead of you?

324
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,250
Even acquiring the company and kicking my wife out?

325
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,660
Gosh, this crazy bastard-

326
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,670
Kang Su Hyeon should have chosen me.

327
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,780
She's suffering because she chose you.

328
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,730
- What suffering?
- Insults, shame.

329
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,590
All sorts of hardships she doesn't need to suffer.

330
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,070
Give me a break. Who do you think is actually suffering because of that marriage?

331
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,520
Oh?

332
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,370
Sounds like you're saying you're suffering more.

333
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,440
That's right. Honestly, I'm the one who's suffering.

334
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,510
- Why?
- What?

335
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,500
You were the ones in love who gave me your wedding invitation.

336
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,180
And now, you say you're suffering because of that marriage?

337
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,370
I looked into it and found out you don't really do much.

338
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,050
I mean, well...

339
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,700
- What?
- I heard you raise your kid and do the housekeeping.

340
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,400
Oh, that's why you said you're the one suffering.

341
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,240
Because you feel it's so unfair.

342
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,710
I'm not a housekeeper!

343
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,680
Then, what do you do?

344
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,560
I'm also training a trainee.

345
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,900
- You do? Who?
- Yoo Jin Woo!

346
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,030
Okay, do your best.

347
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,900
You're Mr. Mom, and I bought her company.

348
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,400
An alpha male's spectacular life versus a beta male's pathetic life.

349
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,080
Gosh, so pathetic.

350
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,970
Yoo Jin Woo. Yoo Jin Woo!

351
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,670
We'll start your special training today.

352
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,870
Where did he go?

353
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,480
He went to Jung Hwa's restaurant to practice.

354
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,690
I'm going to do it properly this time.

355
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,730
- Dinner?
- Not food. Is that all I do?

356
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,660
I'll make Yoo Jin Woo a success.

357
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,610
But let's make this clear.

358
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,200
I'm not doing this for you.

Reporter Seo-

537
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,030
Who was it?

538
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,270
Is there a problem?

539
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,870
You guys should go home first.

540
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,990
- All right.
- Okay.

541
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,040
What kind of statement does she expect from you?

542
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,370
You're not a celebrity. Why write such a story?

543
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,820
It'll be a story since she threw her weight around against RAID.

544
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,170
We ultimately need the original video.

545
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,870
We can prove it was fake with the original video.

546
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,490
To obtain the original video,

547
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,470
we should find the person who took the video.

548
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,750
They're probably still at Pandora.

549
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,550
They probably benefited from getting you kicked out.

550
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,640
There's no way Hyeon Cheol took it himself.

551
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,320
Someone from the inside probably sent it to him.

552
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,390
If this story is released,

553
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,730
they'll say, CEO Kang, who got kicked out for power-tripping against RAID,

554
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,320
is trying to make a comeback with Yoo Jin Woo.

555
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,930
That will be the end of the audition, then.

Us, too!

559

Who is it?

560
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,730
That video.

561
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,120
The edited video that took me down.

562
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,280
Who recorded it?

563
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,910
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

564
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,990
You guys and I were in it.

565
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,560
Yet neither of us knows? How strange.

566
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,400
I said I don't know!

567
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,450
I have nothing to say. Leave!

568
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,210
You know that I don't speak like that.

569
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,050
The power-tripping and verbal abuse coming from me is ridiculous.

570
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,700
They said not to talk to you.

571
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,190
So please leave!

572
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,030
Just tell me who recorded it. I won't let it hurt you.

573
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,470
They coaxed you. It's not like we're enemies.

574
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,870
They told me not to talk to you.

575
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,590
Not a word.

576
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,600
If you don't leave, I'll leave.

577
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,640

578
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,340
Wow...

579
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,970
Hey.

580
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,350
What brings you here at this hour?

581
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,750
You know the video of Su Hyeon power-tripping?

582
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,850
The one that surfaced when she got kicked out.

583
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,740
Yes.

584
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,660
Tomorrow morning, Xpatch will release that video.

585
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,170
- Pardon?
- I need to send the original footage to stop them.

586
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,120
Can I check the company's CCTV footage?

587
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,500
Well, I need the CEO's permission to check the CCTV footage.

588
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,890
There's CEO Kim. Ask him.

589
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:54,010
He's currently on a business trip overseas.

590
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,560
Right now?

591
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,710
Hyeon Cheol would never show it.

592
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,480
- What should I do?
- What is this about?

593
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,950
Hey! Isn't Xpatch going too far?

594
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,700
Are you trying to destroy her or something?

595
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,930
- What?
- Kicking her out was enough.

596
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,410
That wasn't enough, so you'd disclose the video?

597
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,990
The video you guys edited?

598
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:24,190
So, you're saying Xpatch will release the video of Kang Su Hyeon?

599
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,210
That shouldn't be released to the public.

600
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,380
Who's going around saying such a dangerous thing?

601
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,100
Why are you acting as if you're clueless?

602
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Jang Hyeon Cheol turned that video over to them!

603
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,010
Jang Hyeon Cheol did that?

604
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,770
Without even telling me?

605
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,590
Is that it?

606
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:21,240
I mean, I don't know how things ended up like this,

607
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,710
but I don't want this exposed, either.

608
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,140
So I'm helping you just this once.

609
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,840
No, just show it to them.

610
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:36,060
You owe me one.

611
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,560
I found it.

612
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:59,920
The attire of the RAID members is the same as those in the video.

613

<i>Do you think that talented kid is truly on your side?</i>

614
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,670

615
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,280
Today...

616
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,430
will be the last.

Hyung.

620
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,430
I have something to tell you.

621
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,050
What is it?

622
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,720
I passed the first round.

623
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,400
- And?
- Honestly, I didn't think I'd make it.

624
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,870
But sometimes,

625
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,600
I wondered if it was possible.

626
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,100
So, I was really curious whether I'd make it or not.

627
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,570
And through that, I learned what it means

628
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,980
to be curious about something.

629
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,030
I think I like it.

630
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,250
I think I still like singing

631
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,400
and performing on stage

632
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,670
so much.

633
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,470
I guess that's why I was so curious about that.

634
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,720
So?

635
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,280
Hyung.

636
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,820
I'm sorry.

637
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,390
Jin Woo.

638
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,040
What are you doing tomorrow?

639
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,160
Go on a drive with me.

640
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,600
Hyung, I'm really sorry.

641
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,290
Or should we get something tasty together? That place we went to last time?

642
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,940
No...

643
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,710
I'm sorry, Hyung.

644
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,400
They're just playing around with you. Stop this and come back.

645
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,040
No.

646
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,320
I'll never come back here.

647
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,030
I told you that's a different world.

648
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,150
It's not a place for people like us to go.

649
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,290
Even if I regret it later, I want to try believing it. I want to...

650
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,200
at least try believing it.

651
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,410
But it's too bad.

652
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,080
Even if you go to Kang Su Hyeon,

653
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,830
she will turn her back on you.

654
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,730
- What do you mean?
- Don't you remember?

655
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,430
The video? The video you secretly took of Kang Su Hyeon.

656
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,070
The video I paid you 50,000 won to take.

657
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,830
She got fired because of that.

658
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,440
What are you talking about, Hyung?

659
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,260
Didn't you say you'd give me pocket money if I took some pictures of RAID?

660
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,940
Yeah, that's right.

661
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,410
The pictures and videos you took

662
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:47,100
were used to get her fired.

663
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,700
I heard Xpatch will expose that tomorrow.

664
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,580
Then, she'll find out it was you who filmed her.

665
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,230
I wonder...

666
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,870
how she'll look at you, then.

667
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,340
You were the start of her misfortunes.

668
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,350
Will she just sit back?

669
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,640
Jin Woo,

670
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,430
that woman will abandon you now.

671
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,180
What you said to me...

672
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,690
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

673
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,300
Come out of that house. Put it all behind you.

674
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,970
Yoo Jin Woo, lift your head.

675
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,000
Take your hand off of him. Do you know how much he's worth?

676
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,580
Why?

677
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,900
But why? Because of him, you-

678
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,100
That's right.

679
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,550
Because of him, I got fired from the company I spent my whole life building

680
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,460
and my family was put in a difficult situation.

681
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,440
My time, efforts, and relationships were ruined.

682
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,350
But you know,

683

00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,240
<i>CEO, thank you.</i>

712
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,010
<i>Don't cause any trouble while inside.</i>

713
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,450
<i>The second round mission is a duet mission.</i>

714
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,780
<i>Aren't you going to sell Yoo Jin Woo once he becomes successful?</i>

715
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,970
<i>CEO, you can't call me to places like this.</i>

716
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,390
<i>You know the thing you do best. Editing.</i>

717
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,810
<i>Drop him.</i>

718
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,540
<i>What did you do to Su Hyeon this time?</i>

719
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,530
<i>Will he be okay? Your son.</i>

720
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,970
<i>What is it? Is something wrong?</i>

721
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,760
<i>These were found at the Gyoyeon Intersection accident.</i>

722
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,580
<i>If there's no one to punish you, I'll have to do it myself.</i>

723
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,050
<i>Why so serious?</i>

724
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,470
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

725
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,840
<i>What's with you?</i>

726
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,950
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

727
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,860
<i>Yoo Jin Woo, my son's future is in your hands.</i>
