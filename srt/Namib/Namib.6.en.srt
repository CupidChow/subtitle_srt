00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:50,129
Keep breathing naturally.

190
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,699
Stretch the other side of your neck this time.

191
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,799
- Jin Woo. - Yes.

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,029
The thing you do...

193
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,570
Self...

194
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:02,909
Gosh.

195
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,409
- Correct your posture. - Okay.

196
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,950
- Jin Woo. - Yes.

199
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,289
Are you confident?

200
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,559
- Yes. - Jin Woo.

201
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:29,929
What is it?

202
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:33,769
What are you doing?

203
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,610
- You hurt yourself on purpose. - No, I didn't.

204
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,850
Jin Woo.

205
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,519
I'm not that kind of person. I'm really not.

206
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,190
When did you start doing it?

207
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,399
I got these when I fell as a child.

208
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,370
Right.

209
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,809
These are the scars I got from falling when I was little.

210
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,350
Okay.

211
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,120
- I got it. - I'm really fine.

212
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,190
Nothing happened.

213
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,860
I'm really not that kind of person.

214
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,349
I got it.

215
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,950
From now on,

216
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,089
nothing will happen.

(Award Certificate)

218
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,769
Hi.

219
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,008
It's such a nice day.

220
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,268
I know. It's a beautiful day.

221
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,980
- Yes. I'll do a good job. - Yes.

222
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,480
Beat them all.

223
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,180
Good luck.

224
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,118
Yoo Jin Woo, my husband prepared these.

225
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,490
They're the stories of some audition winners.

226
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,430
Get into the habit of only looking at things that inspire you.

227
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:03,829
Okay?

228
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,470
- Go on in. - Okay.

229
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,339
Ms. Kang.

230
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,250
Thank you.

231
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,779
- Go on in. - Okay.

232
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,519
Don't cause trouble, okay?

233
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,220
We'll meet again after you win.

234
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,690
Got it.

(Realtor)

236
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,719
- Hello? - Ms. Kang, how have you been?

237
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,149
I'm calling because I read a news article...

238
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,990
about you leaving the company.

239
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,989
You know the remaining balance...

240
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,729
for the factory is due in a few months, right?

241
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,160
- Yes, of course. Don't worry. - Really?

242
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,358
Will you really be all right?

243
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,960
Of course. You have nothing to worry about.

244
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,730
All right, then.

245
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,009
Congratulations on making it to the show.

246
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,720
You'll stay together, and the entire process will be filmed.

247
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,490
You'll be on camera at all times,

248
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,190
so please watch what you say and how you behave.

249
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,359
To ensure the fairness of this competition,

250
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,789
be sure to always follow the rules.

251
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,569
And especially if...

252
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:46,099
you leave the dorm without permission,

253
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,869
you will automatically be disqualified.

Why do you look so serious?

257
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,288
- This is hard. - What's hard?

258
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,660
Understanding what kids these days like.

259
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,190
Do you like this?

260
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,499
It doesn't matter whether I like it or not.

261
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,599
That's what young people these days like, so just accept it.

262
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,899
I'm having such a hard time figuring out what kids these days like.

263
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,169
- Then go and find out. - Go where?

264
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,609
- Where you can find young people. - Where I can find young people?

265
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,599
Oh, my.

266
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:01,779
My gosh.

267
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,089
Nice.

268
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,969
Excuse me. What's most popular here?

269
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,130
Our bonbon latte.

270
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,538
I see. It has bonbon cream on top.

271
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,068
You drink it with the coffee under it.

272
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,109
Hurry up and order, will you?

273
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,339
I'm sorry...

274
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,848
- What is this? - It's me! Bong Gyu.

275
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:40,920
I know that.

276
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,589
Why are you here? This place doesn't suit you.

277
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,920
- What are you doing here? - Hello, sir.

278
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,359
I invested in this cafe.

279
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,798
Look, they named this after me.

280
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,299
Bong Gyu latte. In short, bonbon latte.

281
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,700
I'll have one bonbon latte.

282
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,140
Make it two.

283
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,879
Why, you...

284
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,980
You're sitting on a table.

285
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,390
Darn it.

286
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,759
I heard Yoo Jin Woo made it.

287
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,230
Of course. You know who trained him.

288
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,759
Isn't Kang Soo Hyun producing him?

289
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,829
I told you I was doing it with her.

290
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,470
Is she the type to partner with someone to do what she wants?

291
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:34,970
I doubt that.

292
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,710
- What? - If Yoo Jin Woo does well,

293
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,740
will she sell him off or something?

294
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,149
With kids like him,

295
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,219
you should cash out and let him go as soon as he makes it.

296
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,119
- Well, I'd do the same. - No.

297
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,750
I'm going to train him well...

298
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,189
so both he and I can become successful.

299
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,130
That's the difference between you and me.

300
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,799
And Kang Soo Hyun is like me.

301
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,930
Jin Woo is important to me because he'll help me go back to work.

302
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,170
- I can't let him go easily. - Go back where?

303
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,970
You mean, back to being a producer?

304
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,679
At your age? Do you think it makes sense?

305
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,979
Is old age a crime?

306
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,779
Yes. It is, in some industries.

307
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,019
Darn it.

308
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,160
Hey.

309
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:29,558

And since you helped us find the original video,

311
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
let me give you a piece of advice.

312
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,329
About Jang Hyun Chul. Don't fully trust him.

313
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,799
He may be seeking vengeance,

314
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,099
but you can't control him with money.

315
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,640
You got that?

316
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,269

Mr. Jang.

320
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,089
You shouldn't call me here.

321
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,259
You say I shouldn't call you here, but you came right away.

322
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,799
What's it about?

323
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,069
This could be uncomfortable for both of us,

324
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,740
so read it now and leave it here.

325
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,380
I can't believe this.

326
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,049
I won't ask you to make her the winner.

327
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,848
Just help her rank high.

328
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,949
These days, we don't have control over these things.

329
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,220
Nonsense.

330
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,859
You can easily make someone a superstar or ruin them.

331
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,559
You can do whatever you want.

332
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,630
I can't help you with this.

333
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,529
Do not contact me, and don't call me here again.

334
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,309
Right now, I'm not doing anything other than calling you here.

335
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,980
But what do you think will happen later on?

336

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,400

Ms. Kang Soo Hyun is his agent.

354
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,569
He was a trainee here, right?

355

Why did you call him here?

364

To discuss this and that.

365
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,650
Something important? Then you should've told me.

366
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,079
Why?

367
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,618
I mean, our trainees are participating in that audition.

368
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,288

going in and out of our office?

371
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,960
Hey, Jang Hyun Chul! What's your deal?

372
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,599
Why are you doing this?

373
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,839
Aren't I allowed to call someone to the company as the CEO?

374
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,710
Just like you and Kang Soo Hyun used to do.

375
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:44,979
- What? - Those scumbags...

376
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,480
who wanted to check out the trainees using the investment as an excuse.

377
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,920
You two called them here.

378
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,059
That time...

379
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,220
- We had a situation. - A situation?

380
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,460
Fine. I have a situation too.

381
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,339
The people who caused my sister's death and changed my life.

382
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,569
I must get back at them. That's my situation.

383
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,609
If they used money, I'll do the same.

384
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,140
The same goes for drugs. That's what they'll get.

385
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:16,410
If they try to run away, I will teach them a lesson.

386
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,980
That includes Kang Soo Hyun.

387
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,750
Soo Hyun?

388
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,319
What did you do to Soo Hyun this time?

389
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,789
What are you cooking up now?

390
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,960
Well, I stomped on her once, but she won't give up.

391
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,660
But you.

392
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,730
You can't really afford to worry about that woman now.

393
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,369
- Will you be all right? - What?

394
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,839
Your son.

395
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,769
I told you. I'll do exactly what you did.

396
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,839
Just like how you brought END Holdings to Yoon Hee,

397
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,809
I brought some good friends over to your son.

398
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,690
Darn it, that jerk...

399
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,829
(Son)

400
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,809
Why isn't he picking up?

401
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,109
- Gum. - M?

402
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,250
- Mob. - Bag.

403
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Go?

404
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,150
Go?

405
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,289
- Go-stop. - Patio.

406
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,519
Patio?

407
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,200
Mom.

408
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,028
How about we do something else now?

409
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,230
I should get going now.

410
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,200
I should go home.

411
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:50,970
Mom, do you like that house that much?

412
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:52,880
That house? Yes.

413
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,509
The house with the patio.

414
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,980
We got kicked out, you know.

415
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,579
I remember nothing about that house.

416
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,319
What do you mean we got kicked out? It's our house.

417
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,019
I need to make dinner.

418
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,930
There you are.

419
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,690
Soo Hyun.

420
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,759
Let's go home.

421
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,069
Let's go.

422
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
Soo Hyun.

423
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,109
I guess Mom still wants to go back to that house.

424
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:32,249
Her husband cheated and kicked her out of the house with her two kids.

425
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,380
Why does she like that house so much?

426
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,519
She struggled all her life.

427
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,220
She should hate and resent that place, if anything.

428
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,089
Honey.

429
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,359
It's me. I'm here.

430
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,259
Open the door.

431
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,130
But you know,

432
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,400
Mom looks happy.

433
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,339
Every time she goes back to that house in her imagination,

434
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,609
she looks so happy.

435
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,849
Hey, I'm asking just in case.

436
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,750
What do you think of him taking Mom?

437
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,579
I mean,

438
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,219
he wants to take care of her.

439
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,320
And Mom talks about that house every day.

440
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,158
Hey, when he kicked out Mom and the two of us,

441
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,099
I was 15, and you were only 10.

442
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,529
After living with his mistress for years,

443
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,130
he now wants to see Mom. You want him to take care of her?

444
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,639
Stop being so ridiculous.

445
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,599
But...

446
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,639
Mom wants to go with him.

447
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,579
The patio is a mess.

448
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,360
(Sewoon High School)

449
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:23,058
As for the long passages, you don't need to write down everything.

450
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,429
Just tell me later.

451
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,530
Okay, got it.

452
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,729
As for your pay, I'll e-transfer you.

453
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,760
Sure.

454
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,469
One moment.

455
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,139
I'll do it too.

456
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,078
- Do what? - What do you think?

457
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,479
This. Taking notes for you.

458
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,809
You'll pay me for the job, right?

459
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,909
First, I'll have to check your work.

460
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,780
If I like it, I'll pay you.

461
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:47,780
Not everyone gets paid.

462
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,719
Okay.

463
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,960
I will now announce your mission for Round Two.

464
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:04,829
Your mission is singing a duet.

465
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,039
A duet?

466
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,940
A duet?

467
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,539
We'll do a random draw to team you guys up.

468
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:18,509
All right. Those who picked the same number...

469
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,749
can go ahead and choose a song from the list...

470
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,420
and practice however you want.

471
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,980
Didn't you pick the same number?

472
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,079
Yes.

473
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,719
Did you pick number three?

474
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,820
How old are you?

475
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm in 12th grade.

476
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,119
I'm a year younger then.

477
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,789
Speak casually.

478
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,900
Do you have an agent?

479
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,530
It's not a big company.

480
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,400
An agent I personally know is helping me out.

481
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,940
Me too. I'm with a small company too.

482
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:17,869
I see.

483
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,340
What are you good at? Let's make this fun.

484
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,579
Is there a song you want to sing?

485
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,280
What about you?

486
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,619
("Red Flavour" by Red Velvet, "Sorry, Sorry" by Super Junior)

487
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,159
You told them your story in the first round.

488
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,590
If you get a chance to make a choice in the next round,

489
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,300
pick a catchy song.

490
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43,130
That way, you'll make them remember you early on.

491
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,538
What about this song?

492
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:49,539
("Sorry, Sorry" by Super Junior)

493
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,670
I don't know if I can sing it well.

494
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:53,409
What about this?

495
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,409
("Cheers to Youth" by SEVENTEEN)

496
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:57,809
I don't really know the song.

497
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,619
I didn't do too well in the first round.

498
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,119
Can't you help me out?

499
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,019
All right.

500
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,630
Okay.

501
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:39,920
You can play the guitar so well.

502
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,590
- Do you want the guitar parts? - What?

503
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,059
Then I'll take the main vocal parts...

504
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,829
since you'll play the guitar.

505
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,469
(Somehow, today is the first day)

506
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,659
We're good, right?

507
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,739
My eyes hurt.

508
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:40,480
Send the money.

509
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:49,059
These are your notes, aren't they?

510
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,529
- It's your handwriting. - Forget it.

511
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,328
I can't. Why didn't you tell me?

512
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,799
That he took your notes to give me.

513
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,968
What if I told you? What would you do?

514
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:00,099
Would you fight them and give me the money?

515
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,809
What do you think you can do?

516
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,780
I won't do this anymore. Find someone else.

517
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,320
Honey.

518
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:22,659
Darling.

519
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,599
Where did she go? Did you find her?

520
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,129
She's not here.

521
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,169
- She's not? - No.

522
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,969
- Where is she? - Where did she go?

523
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,650
Mom!

524
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:52,119
Mom!

525
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,920
Mom!

526
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,389
Mom!

527
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,900
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

528
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,299
"Star Rise!" Let's begin!

529
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,638
The winner works with a top producer...

530
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,769
and releases an album worldwide.

531
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,679
An audition you've never seen before.

532
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,639
- It's time to unearth a music... - Hi.

533
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,649
Soo Hyun, I have bad news.

534
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,980
It's Mom. She's missing.

535
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,719
It's time to rise up!

536
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,788
It begins now.

537
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,260
("Star Rise" begins now!)

538
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,659
- Did you enjoy the meal? - Yes.

539
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,169
Excuse me. Did you see a woman in her 70s...

540
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,598
with a green flowery top about this tall?

541
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,369
- No. - Thanks anyway.

542
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,820
Did Mom come here?

543
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,760
What?

544
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Hey.

545
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,570
Soo Hyun.

546
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:24,710
The audition. It begins now.

547
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,280
(Soo Hyun)

548
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,559
The show is starting. Where are you?

549
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,630
What is it?

550
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,190
Is something wrong?

551
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,329
- I'm sorry. - What?

552
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,969
My mom... She...

553
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:51,908
Mom!

554
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:54,909
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

555
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,110
Where are you?

556
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,349
I'll search the market entrance.

557
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,920
You search the other end.

558
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,209
It's easy money.

559
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,238
Hey, look.

560
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,379
Use your brain.

561
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,549
That's how you work less and earn more.

562
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,880
Hey, Sim Jin Woo's here.

563
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,789
Hi, there. You're here.

564
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,659
Is he our boss now that he pays us?

565
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,129
Hey. Boss.

566
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,429
We'll do the hard work. You just pay us on time.

567
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:53,268
- Give it back. - Give what back?

568
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:55,170
You didn't do the work. You took it.

569
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,369
So what?

570
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,780
- What? - Why do you care?

571
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,150
Whether we actually take notes, take someone else's,

572
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,348
or find them in the street,

573
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,789
you don't have to care.

574
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,590
You just pay on time, okay?

575
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,360
- No. - What?

576
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,030
I won't pay you.

577
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,868
Hey, you could get in trouble.

578
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,570
There's a legal term for that.

579
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,940
Return the money you took from my friends.

580
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,880
- I don't want to. - Return it!

581
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,480
Hey, kid. Go on home before worse happens.

582
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,480
No way!

583
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,578
Isn't this unbelievable?

584
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,820
- What? - What is?

585
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,058
- He can't hear. - Right.

586
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,018
But we're having a conversation.

587
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,130
My hair's on end.

588
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,889
He can read lips.

589
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,599
Exactly!

590
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,429
That's what I find hard to believe.

591
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,300
Hey. Do you hear me now?

592
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,670
Do you hear me?

593
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:08,009
- Return the money. - "Return the money."

594
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,880
- Stop it. - "Stop it!"

595
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,860
- Yoo Jin Woo. - Yes?

596
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,899
- I hope you last long. - What?

597
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,170
I've been watching you.

598
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,730
You're pretty good.

599
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,340
Where have you been hiding?

600
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,969
I'd feel bad if you went home too early.

601
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:38,539
Good luck.

602
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,440
(Yoo Jin Woo)

603
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,319
Your phone time is over.

604
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,750
Hand them in.

605
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,650
- Yoo Jin Woo, your phone. - Just a moment.

606
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,650
(CEO Kang Soo Hyun)

607
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,469
(Producer Sim Jun Seok)

608
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:52,579
If you turned in your phones, head that way.

609
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:04,889
Hey, Yoo...

610
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,829
Yoo Jin Woo. Hey.

611
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,869
What's he doing?

612
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,679
- I'm looking. - What?

613
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,150
I'm looking hard so I can remember...

614
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:04,090
what trash you are.

615
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:09,360
You're really helpless, Jin Woo.

616
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,928
What's this? How did you find us here?

617
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,699
We're telepathic.

618
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,249
That hurt bad. I need time out.

619
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,579
- It's you again? - Yes, it's me.

620
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,159
- No, stop. - Darn it.

621
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,360
- Don't. Stop it. - You...

622
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:50,969
Darn him!

623
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,299
- You punks. - Cool it.

624
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,670
Let it go.

625
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,170
Are you okay? That was hard work.

626
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,309
Those morons.

627
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,449
Here.

628
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,260
I'm exhausted.

629
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,859
- What's going on? - What do you mean?

630
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,899
Why are you here? Won't you get dropped if you leave?

631
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,130
Yes.

632
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,469
What on earth am I doing here?

633
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,840
However important that contract may be.

634
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,940
Is the show on TV right now?

635
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,779
It should be.

636
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,779
What am I to do now?

637
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,320
I'm done for.

638
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,960
Darn it.

639
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,059
Hey.

640
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,800
- Did you find her? - No.

641
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,840
- I'll look this way. - I'll go that way.

642
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:08,279
- Excuse me. - Yes?

643
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,848
I'm looking for a woman in her 70s wearing a green flowery blouse.

644
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:14,219
She has hair that's this long. Did you see her?

645
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,190
I think I saw her in there.

646
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,018
- In there? - Yes.

647
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,320
Thank you.

648
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,099
Welcome.

649
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,269
I apologize.

650
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,619
Mother. It's me.

651
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,129
Mister. Help me find my daughter.

652
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,269
My daughter.

653
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,070
Kang Soo Hyun.

654
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,868
She's in the second year at Hanguk Girls' High School.

655
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:13,380
She's top of her year despite never taking extra classes.

656
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:17,250
She's helping her younger sister through school,

657
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,250
and she cooks and cleans.

658
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,750
She does all the housework.

659
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,190
And she still doesn't complain even once...

660
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,389
to me, her own mom.

661
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:34,260
She takes care of everything on her own.

662
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,869
She's so mature, and I'm proud of her.

663
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:48,039
Mother.

664
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,050
Why did you do that to her?

665
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,949
- What? - She must've needed...

666
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,949
a mother too.

667
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,659
She's the same even now.

668
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,530
She does everything on her own.

669
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,869
You're so sweet.

670
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:21,610
I hope Soo Hyun marries a man like you.

671
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,349
Mom!

672
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,519
I'm sorry, Jun Seok.

673
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,659
Hi. Your mother's okay.

674
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,900
What are you doing here?

675
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:50,809
It's me.

676
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,079
Yes.

677
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,079
- Who is it? - Yoo Jin Woo.

678
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:57,510
- Yes. - Yoo Jin Woo?

679
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,250
Yoo Jin Woo.

680
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,250
What happened?

681
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,690
What? Oh, no.

682
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,190
Shoot.

683
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:06,760
Yoo Jin Woo.

684
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,619
Why are you on the phone?

685
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,789
- Look behind you. - Behind me?

686
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,209
What are you two doing here?

687
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,380
What happened to you?

688
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,710
My gosh. Jin Woo, you...

689
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:33,448
I'll explain. What happened was...

690
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,518
Honey. Where's your car?

691
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:37,150
- Next to the market. - Next to the market?

692
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,389
Joo Hyun, watch your mom!

693
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:41,920
- Let's go, now. Hurry. - Soo Hyun.

694
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,960
- We have to go! Run! - Okay, I'm coming.

695
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,299
Yoo Jin Woo. I don't know why you're here,

696
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,099
but this is a disaster, you punk!

697
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,269
(Hong Jung Hwa)

698
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:56,199
- What? - Did you see the show?

699
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:58,308
We have other problems. Talk later!

700
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,869
- What happened was... - Be quiet.

701
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,979
Is this like 20 years ago when Jung Hwa...

702
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,448
got drunk and missed a live show...

703
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,709
and we had to beg the TV chief for forgiveness?

704
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,848
It looks like it.

705
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:07,919
We'll be there soon.

706
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,549
We need to come up with a speech, no, an excuse by then!

707
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,359
- Mom, Dad. I was... - He could be in real trouble!

708
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,360
We'll beg, but we still need logic.

709
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,488
Shall we say he needed to cool down?

710
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,359
What kid wants to cool down?

711
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,828
He needed musical inspiration?

712
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:24,198
That's stupid.

713
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:26,099
They all sound silly.

714
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:27,799
What?

715
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,038
Yoo Jin Woo is...

716
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,469
I know Yoo Jin Woo is in big trouble. Hang up now!

717
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,840
- Think of something, guys. - Okay.

718
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,809
Let's do this, then.

719
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,050
Look at me! We'll say...

720
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:44,388
- I died. - Dad, no.

721
00:54:44,389 --> 00:54:45,549
That's a great idea.

722
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:46,690
- What? - It is.

723
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,460
- Not me. - Right.

724
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,989
This is madness.

725
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,530
My gosh...

726
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,039
We're here.

727
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:05,710
What now?

728
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,510
We got here before I could think of an excuse.

729
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,349
Let's get out of the car first.

730
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,619
What should I say? What can I say?

731
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,590
Yoo Jin Woo's here.

732
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,719
Wait!

733
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,929
What on earth happened?

734
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,400
Where were you at?

735
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,130
Hear me out first.

736
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,569
I have a serious illness.

737
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,399
What is happening?

738
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,669
- Listen and I'll explain! - You can't explain!

739
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,280
Yoo Jin Woo. We looked for him everywhere.

740
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:42,440
My gosh...

741
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:45,650
Yoo Jin Woo.

742
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,320
What is happening?

743
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,690
Did something happen to him?

744
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:56,159
- What happened? - You didn't see the show?

745
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,459
Everyone's losing their mind.

746
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,198
The first episode was all about him.

747
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:02,699
What? Me?

748
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:05,199
See for yourself.

749
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:08,638
("Star Rise")

750
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:09,800
(New message)

751
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,409
No way.

752
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,010
(Manager Kim Ho Seob: Yoo Jin Woo? Where did you find him?)

753
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,049
Ms. Park, get an interview.

754
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,079
- Okay. Come with me, Jin Woo. - Okay.

755
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,289
Wait. Give me just a moment.

756
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,860
We can't...

757
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,929
Yoo Jin Woo. My son's future depends on you.

758
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,460
Keep your wits about you.

759
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,800
And think only about yourself.

760
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,840
If I'd thought only about myself,

761
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:44,139
he could've gotten in real danger today.

762
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,409
That hurts.

763
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,109
Get the cameras rolling. Hurry.

764
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,309
There he is.

765
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,920
Yoo Jin Woo. Hurry up.

766
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:14,440
Ms. Kang. You should thank me.

767
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:22,739
Shut your mouth.

768
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,619
Let's go, Jin Woo.

769
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:33,780
(Namib)

770
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,218
Yoo Jin Woo. I like him.

771
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:37,618
Does it still stand?

772
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,650
Your plan to sell the kid.

773
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,059
Do as you're told and cut him out.

774
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:44,059
The editing's off.

775
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,098
Yoo Jin Woo and Chris are close.

776
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,460
How can he be trusted?

777
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,400
You know who my son is, don't you?

778
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,969
That punk Jang Hyun Chul set it up.

779
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:54,840
Watch and see.

780
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:57,340
Ms. Kang. Can I trust you?

781
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,579
The contestant to reach the live show is...
