Gosh, talk about extreme.

Is Jin Woo only his son?

194
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,190
He's not thinking about your wounds at all!

195
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,110
At least, he gets to blame you. You don't get to blame anyone!

196
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,110
I mean, I was to blame.

197

I made him like that.

200

Hey, please don't live like that, as if you're a sinner.

201
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,430
You tried everything after Jin Woo got hurt.

202
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,910
You even went to the U.S. for it.

203
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,290
You spent so much money on his treatments already.

204
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,290
Don't even think about the divorce,

205
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,280

- Yes, I attended sometimes-
- Of course, you didn't.

How could someone like him act as his class helper?

226
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,620
He's good at listening and taking notes.

227
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,340
Besides, having someone like him next to him is the most effective solution.

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,490
You'll try hard now, right?

362
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,690
I just need to do what his mom tells me to do.

363
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,630
I heard you guys live together. Can I come over and hang out?

364
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,110
Could you speak a bit slower?

365
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,760
She's not able to speak slowly.

366
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,420
It's her illness.

367
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,040
Hey, Yoo Jin Woo!

368
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,770
Oh, it's Shim Jin Woo.

369
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,760
- Where?
- But he has friends now?

370
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:31,590

378

Finding the radius of the circumcircle of BC...

380
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,550

381
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,200
What is it?

382
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,000
[Math: Class started! Wow, that's crazy. Class ended.]

383
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,750
What is this?

384
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,470
I wrote down what I heard.

385
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,260
Do it properly.

386
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,180
Do it again.

387
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,060
Then, why don't you record the class and listen-

388
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,880
Hey.

389
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,620
You like this group?

390
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,010
Yeah.

391
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,540
Wow, you even stream their song?

392
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,450
- Hey!
- Wait...

393
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,950
Here you go.

394
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,170
Great work.

395
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,770
- Here.
- Thanks.

396
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,600
- Here.
- Great work.

397
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,160
Thanks.

398
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,240
Happy? I wouldn't know anything written there, so just take it.

399
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,110
From now on, look at me when you speak.

400
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,460
- You can't hear me, though.
- I do.

401
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,780
By your lip movements and your expression,

402
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,430
I can hear it all.

403
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,650
So look at me while you speak.

404
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,380
Okay.

405
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,180
- Where are you going?
- Practice-

406
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,420
- To the practice room.
- School's not over yet, though.

407
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,640
- She says to come.
- Who?

408
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,820
Your mom.

409
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,700
Vocal training?

410
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,310
You did the vocal training for RAID, too.

411
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,580
Yoo Jin Woo needs you, too.

412
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,320
Shim Jun Seok!

413
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,440
How could you do that to Su Hyeon-

414
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,270
- You came.
- Yeah.

415
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,150
To return this.

416
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,650
You watched it?

417
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,420
What? You'll do it, too?

418
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,350
No, I'm not interested.

419
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,180
I see. You set everything up properly.

420
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,130
You know Hong Jung Hwa, right?

421
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,690
She'll be your vocal trainer from now on.

422
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,530
And this is Shim Jun Seok, who used to be a producer at Pandora.

423
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,680
Oh, okay.

424
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,330
You should say thank you.

425
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,480
Thank you.

426
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,830
We don't have time. Let's get right into it.

427
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,780
First, let's hear you sing.

428
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,170
Sing?

440
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,030
I just sang it.

441
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,090

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,210
I can see why you brought him.

What about you, Produce Shim?

463
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,000
- No.
- Why not?

464
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,300
He doesn't shine.

Let's talk.

00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,060
About what?

469
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,460
The divorce. Is it true?

470
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,290
It worked out that way.

471
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,420
They talk the same way.

472
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,310
Producer Shim, stop torturing Su Hyeon.

473
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:11,730
Can't you see she's withering away alone, trying to take responsibility for her son?

474
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,040
She doesn't share it with me.

475
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,220
What?

476
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,330
Whether it be the guilt or the solution,

477
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,380
she doesn't share it with me.

478
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,590
Bearing her pain by herself is her choice, so fine.

479
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,850
But...

480
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,960
she chose the solution by herself

481
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,100
and placed her life on the line for it.

482
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,290
After she placed our entire fortunes and future on the line,

483
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,910
she chases after it alone without looking around her.

484
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,610
I'm not the one torturing Kang Su Hyeon.

485
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,090
It's herself.

486
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,780
She's doing it to herself.

487
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,210
Hey, Shim!

488
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,800
Why did you complicate things by telling our homeroom teacher?

489
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,870
You brought a strange friend.

490
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,880
- Did your mom get him for you?
- Hey.

491
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,660
Do you have anything today?

492
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,120

493
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,050

00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,190
Gosh, I'm so hungry as is. Shoo.

495
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,760
Shoo, go back to your seats.

496
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,300
Mind your own business. I have something to say to him.

497
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,680
No, you don't.

498
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,300
Even if you do, don't. Just go.

499
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,190
- What did you say?
- Can't hear?

500
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,200
Should I write it down for you?

501
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,420
What's with him?

502
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,630
Stay away.

503
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,250
Seriously, this bastard!

504
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,060
Are you crazy?

505
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,470
Aigoo is so cute. Look at you, blink!

506
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,040
Aigoo, so cute.

507
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,900
What's with you? Who do you think you are?

508
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,370
What, you bastard? Just go.

509
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,440
Hey, you better watch out.

510
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,290
Look away!

511
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,530
What's going on? Did you cause trouble as soon as you came to school?

512
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,370
Oh, I'm sorry.

513
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,130
Guys, I'm going to record a challenge, so help me.

514
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,030
I'm sorry. I have something to do.

515
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,460
What do you have to do?

516
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,970
Well, it's...

I heard you were fired from Pandora.

520
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,740
I wasn't fired. I left.

521
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,140
I heard rumors that a thug took over your company.

522
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,850
CEO Kim is taking good care of it.

523
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,290
Pandora is your company, CEO Kang.

524
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,880
Does CEO Kim do anything?

525
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,870
So, why did you throw your weight around?

526
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,660
Enough of that.

527
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,650
I have this kid...

528
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,710
- No, no, I won't listen.
- Wait. Just give me a chance.

529
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,450
Just hear me out. Just listen.

530
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,650
I'll get in big trouble if I do something like this.

531
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,290
This kid has a story.

532
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,090
He's got a backstory and character.

533
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,230
It's what you guys like.

534
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,570
You can get a lot of content from him.

535
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,150
- I didn't hear this.
- Of course.

536
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,580
I'm only talking to myself. By myself.

537
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,310
He's got a good story.

538
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,570
His talent is even better.

539
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,490
Where's his mom?

540
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,500
We don't know yet.

541
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
- Do you know what she does for a living?
- I've met with her.

542
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,920
- Can you have her appear with him?
- Huh?

543
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,570
His mom. Can you bring her so she can appear on camera?

544
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,740
Not his mom.

545
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,500
His mom needs to appear on camera

546
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,280
for him to have a complete story.

547
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,600
You scared me!

548
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,730
Dad, happy birthday!

549
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,670
Thanks. You almost made my birthday my funeral.

550
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,610
Ahjussi, happy birthday!

551
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,740
Thanks. But who are you?

552
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,890
Happy birthday.

553
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,480
All right, thanks, but can you tell me who she is?

554
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,890
- She's a friend.
- A friend?

555
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,460
Why would your friend be here at this time?

556
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,930
Why would you ask why?

557
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,880
It's your birthday.

558
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,090
I see.

559
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,800
Carry this.

560
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:42,470
All right. We will now start Shim Jun Seok ahjussi's birthday party!

561
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,760
Everyone, start singing the song. Ready, go.

562
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,680
♫ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♫

563
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,860
♫ <i>- Happy birthday to our dear ahjussi</i> ♫
♫ <i>- Happy birthday to my dear dad</i> ♫

564
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,790
♫ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♫

565
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,500
Blow out the candles, Ahjussi.

566
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,190
Wow! Everyone, applause!

567
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,900
Yes. Yoo Jin Woo, go and get the food.

568
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,130
Okay.

569
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,520
What did you order?

570
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,710
Fried chicken! You can't have a birthday without fried chicken.

571
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,230
You guys have an audition program ahead of you-

572
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,110
Ahjussi, Jin Woo and I have trained for a long time.

573
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,670
Weight and diet management.

574
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,900
We've done it for 10 years, so this is not a problem.

575
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,020
Wow, it smells good.

576
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,490
Wow...

577
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,600
Hey, this is an old-fashioned fried chicken.

578
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,350
Don't you think eating it will be okay for just today?

579
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,260
Wow, it's so good.

580
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,850
Yoo Jin Woo,

581
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,300
you'd be in trouble if you eat all that by yourself.

582
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,350
Eat this drumstick.

583
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,120
Thanks.

584
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,740
This is a limited edition.

585
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,160
This is CEO Kang Su Hyeon's, right?

586
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,330
I bought it.

587
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,300
I should listen to it.

588
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,840
You do Bling?

589
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,760
The idol messaging app.

590
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,880
I do it.

591
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,320
Why would you do something like that, Ahjussi?

592
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,220
That used to be my job.

593
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,210
Making songs and putting out albums...

594
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,780
That used to be my job.

595
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,800
Wait, then this...

596
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,550
Is this yours, Ahjussi?

597
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,080
- Yeah.
- Please play us something.

598
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,600
Gosh, it's been a while since I played it.

599
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,450
Come on, how long could it have been?

600
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,870
Around 10 years?

601
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,950
That's why you should try playing it today.

602
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,370
No, my fingers lost their callouses, so it'll hurt too much.

603
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,790
Come on, don't be like that, Ahjussi!

604
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,720
No, I can't.

605
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,820
Just once.

606
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,070
My fingers hurt too much.

607
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,790
Just once.

608
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,070
[Yoo Jin Woo]

609
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,800
<i>Gather all the files on Yoo Jin Woo for me</i>

610
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,500
<i>including every little detail.</i>

611
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,000
[I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.]

612
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,340
What is this?

613
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,270
[I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.]

614
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,580
- Let's record a challenge since we're together.
- What?

615
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,650
I said, let's record a challenge together.

616
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,470
I told you.

617
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,800
She's unable to speak slowly.

618
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,660
Yoo Jin Woo!

619
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,510
Are my lips weird?

620
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,250
Since we're together, let's record a challenge.

621
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,630
Will this work?

622
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,620
You understand Yoo Jin Woo's words right away.

623
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,730
Why can't you understand mine?

624
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,650
Some people have lip shapes like that,

625
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,550
where it's easy to read their lips.

626
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,710
Are you saying the shape of my lips is the problem?

627
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,120
So he knows how to laugh.

628
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,760
What?

629
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,730
An apology letter?

630
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,600
Yeah, okay.

631
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,000
- You're Yoo Jin Woo's aunt, right?
- Yes.

632
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,120
I'm sorry to come at such a late hour.

633
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:39,230
I'm Kang Su Hyeon, the former CEO of Pandora Entertainment.

634
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,190
I'm starting a new company after taking Jin Woo with me.

635
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,820
I met with Jin Woo's mom,

636
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,830
and JIn Woo himself agreed to it as well.

637
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:58,800
I heard that you two were his actual guardians after he came to Seoul.

638
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,680
Yes. On days like weekends when he couldn't stay at the dorms,

639
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,120
he stayed at our house.

640
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,930
I thought it was only right to visit you and explain everything in person.

641
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:17,760
I also wanted to learn more about Jin Woo as well.

642
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,590
What do you mean by that?

643
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,620
I want to know what kind of kid Yoo Jin Woo is.

644
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,880
I'm sincerely hoping Jin Woo will be successful.

645
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,300
I will make him successful.

646
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,850
In order to do so, I need to know more about what kind of guy he is.

647
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:37,310
Such as a part of his situation or personality I may not know about-

648
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:41,060
You say you will make Jin Woo successful?

649
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,700
Yes. I'll make him like that.

650
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,100
Could a kid like him be successful, too?

651
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,180
- Pardon?
- I'm asking

652
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,670
<i>if a kid like him can become a star.</i>

653
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,340
♫ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♫

654
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,450
You're curious about what kind of kid Jin Woo is?

655
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:20,810
Can you promise me that nothing bad will happen to Jin Woo

656
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,920
even after finding out what kind of kid he is?

657
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,000
I'll take responsibility since it's a matter of importance to me, too.

658
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,250
Jin Woo is...

659
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,760
Ahjussi, I had a great time today.

660
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,600
- I can come by again, right?
- Again?

661
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,080
Okay, thank you. I'll come by often!

662
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,000
I'll be back after I walk her home.

663
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,880
- Hey-
- Yoo Jin Woo.

664
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,700
Throw out the trash on your way out.

665
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,800
- See you.
- Bye.

666
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,990
You know, Yoo Jin Woo.

667
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:14,780
He had a different vibe today when I saw him at home.

668
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,210
He does seem okay.

669
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,770
We've got a bit of a problem.

670
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,360
- A problem?
- I just heard...

671
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,870
what kind of kid Yoo Jin Woo is.

672
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,710
Hyung.

673
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,220
Why are you late?

674
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,780
I'm sorry.

675
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,000
I'm going to ask you to run an errand.

676
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,620
You can do it, right?

677
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,480
What is it?

678
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,410
You have a driver's license, right?

679
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,920
I'm not drunk!

680
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,600
We're almost there.

681
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,910
He's the fourth generation of Minwoong Corporation.

682
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:25,100
And that's the great-grandson of Sanho Group.

683
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,160
And he's the leader of RAID.

684
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,500
You know him, right?

685
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,090
He's a famous influencer, and he's a streamer.

686
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,840
- Shit!
- He's being so fussy.

687
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,690
Park Yoon, the heir to the Eunsang Group.

688
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,330
He was arrested on drug charges,

689
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,710
and he's fooling around here after leaving the courtroom.

690
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,180
- I see.
- Hey!

691
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,100
Get out of the way.

692
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,190
You'll drive the car he's in.

693
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,430
What?

694
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,140
All you have to do is get to the destination.

695
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,400
The address is saved on the GPS navigator.

696
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,580
Don't look at his face.

697
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,410
And don't make eye contact, either.

698
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,660
Just...

699
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,390
drive and come back.

700
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,940
Whether he throws a tantrum or kills someone or whatever crazy stunt he pulls,

701
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,360
you just need to drive and come back.

702
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,040
Okay?

703
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,730
Jin Woo, you're able to do this well.

704
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,560
Yeah, it's in front of you, Hyung.

705
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,400
I said, bring me the money, you bastard.

706
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,210
Hey, who told you to get in this car?

707
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,850
Hey, get out. You get out and sit in the front, Jin Hee.

708
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,870
- Jin Hee, come to the front!
- What's wrong?

709
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,510
<i>Whether he throws a tantrum or kills someone or whatever crazy stunt he pulls,</i>

710
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,910
<i>you just need to drive and come back.</i>

711
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,670
Gosh, what's wrong with you! Stop it!

712
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,350
