181
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,010
I need to call Su Hyeon, though.

182
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,130
Unni will come really soon, Mom.

183
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,810

184
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,930

185
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,100
She'll come soon.

186
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,700
There's nothing wrong

187
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,540
with Su Hyeon, right?

188
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,250
- Yeah?
- CEO.

189
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,500
CEO Kim asked if you met with Yoo Jin Woo yet.

190
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,440
When did Yoo Jin Woo come to Pandora again?

191
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,670
It was when you went to the States and weren't at the company.

192
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,520
<i>He had low assessment scores and didn't really stand out.</i>

193
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,480
He was a potential debut member briefly.

194
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,930
- A potential debut member?
<i>- It was just for a few days.</i>

195
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,900
After the potential debut members were announced, he suddenly disappeared,

196
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,640
so he was disqualified.

197
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,310
Could you find out what happened in those few days?

198
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,460
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

199
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,920
Do you have any other info on him?

200
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,830
<i>Well... Yoo Jin Woo's mom...</i>

201
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,380
- His mom?
<i>- She came by the company often to borrow money</i>

202
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,760
<i>while you were in the US.</i>

203
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,290
Gather all the files on Yoo Jin Woo for me, including every little detail.

204
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,200
And could you let him know that I want to see him again?

205
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,380
How did it go? Did she want to sign you?

206
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,890
She was looking for someone who would win Star Rise.

207
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,350
Star Rise? Daebak!

208
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,520
Each agency can only send one or two trainees for that.

209
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,750
- What about that?
- If you win first place there,

210
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,790
you'll debut in South Korea, the US, and Japan simultaneously!

211
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,100
But, too bad, Yoo Jin Woo.

212
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,260
I'm going to win first place.

213
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,850
Exactly.

214
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,610
What should I do?

215
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,210
Hey, you think you'll make it?

216
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,880
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

217
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,920
I could win.

218
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,780
The winners are already decided.

219
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,820
Younger trainees with rich families and don't cause any trouble

220
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,660
end up becoming the stars.

221
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,990
An audition is different!

222
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,700
Audition programs are the same!

223
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,770
Our faces give it away

224
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,190
that we grew up unloved by our parents, that we're poor,

225
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,130
and we couldn't debut despite our age because we missed our chance.

226
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,800
You think people won't know that?

227
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,850
Then, how about...

228
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,060
we go to a hospital and completely change our faces?

229
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,980
You're so ridiculous.

230
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,630
But...

231
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,730
I'm already screwed.

Why?

233
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,710
I brought up her son,

234
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,630
and she totally cussed me out with her eyes.

235
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,750
- Really?
- Yeah.

I heard you're interested in investing in Pandora Entertainment.

247

Yes, I sincerely do.

248

Someone who makes a good decision like you must be a good person, right?

249
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,870
I'd like to revisit and adjust the terms of the equity acquisition.

250
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,130
Okay, adjust it...

No.

I heard you had something you had to tell me in person.

257
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,850
Yes.

258
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,750
I thought I should tell you this clearly in person.

259
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,350
I will decline your investment offer.

260
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,890
I'm hesitant to accept an investment that includes equity acquisition.

261
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,560
By chance, is it because of our future together?

262

No. Don't think that I'd remember such trivial things.

What's your relationship with Jang Hyeon Cheol?

He visited me, asking if I wanted to acquire Pandora.

289
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,240
He was smart.

290
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,400
He recognized who the true owner was.

291
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,020
So, I provided him with some support.

<i>- Why?
- She's meeting my mom.</i>

533
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,320
<i>She's not just letting it pass.</i>

534
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,190
<i>Persuade her.</i>

535
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,900
<i>It won't work.</i>

536
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,140
<i>She's looking at me like I'm trash.</i>

537

- Let's eat.
- Okay.

545
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,500
It's unfortunate.

546
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,860
- What do you mean?
- That I can't sign with you, CEO.

547
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,650
You're not going to sign me.

548
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,810
Why do you think that?

549
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,040
You don't like me.

550
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,490
That's not true.

551
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,400
- Then, are you signing me?
- No.

552
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,760
Can someone like me be successful, too?

553
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,440
I'm asking if someone like me can be successful, too.

554
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,590
Who are you to seek a guarantee from me?

555
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,580
Then, why did you think about signing me?

556
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,360
You do have talent.

557
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,880
But does everyone who has talent succeed?

558
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,500
You think the world is that easy?

559
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,510
Do you know how hard it is to be loved?

560
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,660
What's important is that you do it well.

561
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,790
Then, why did she do that to me?

562
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,660
Is it true that everything goes well if I do a good job?

563
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,280
She abandoned me because I was good.

564
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,570
Is that why you half-assed it?

565
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,430
Yes. So I won't be kicked out

566

Yes, my own circumstances.

576

Can I meet with her first?

577
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,650
I didn't do that intentionally.

578

- You know.
- Okay.

579
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,740
Yes, that's right.

580
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,230
I'm not saying I won't pay you back.

581
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,770
I'll pay you back next week.

582

Yes, next week, next week, next week.

583

Are you debuting?

584
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,770
- What?
- People at the company were looking for me.

585
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,960
I worked so hard to raise you,

586
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,880
and now I'm finally reaping the benefits.

587
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,610
You got paid more as a signing bonus, right? How much?

588
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,240
Mom, that's not it. Actually-

589
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,870
I was in need of money. This is such good news.

590
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,310
My contract was terminated.

591
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,690
What?

592
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,750
Pandora told me...

593
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,030
to pay all the money you borrowed.

594
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:43,090
You bastard. Did you want to meet me to get money from me?

595
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,970

I met someone, and if you just pay that money back-

598
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,430
If only you hadn't been born, I wouldn't be living like this!

Go with your mom, too.

600

If only you weren't born, I wouldn't have married her.

601
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,890
You should think about making money now.

602
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,890
Mom, someone tells me to go on an audition program.

603
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,200
All I've learned and done up to now is this.

606
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,760
How did you manage to get scores that were enough

607
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,100
not to stand out or get kicked out from Pandora?

608

Who are you?

609
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,280
So I can stay with the company.

610
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,990
So, how did you manage that?

611
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,600
It's obvious.

612
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,690
I can see what the trainers are looking for.

613
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,520
You were able to see that?

614
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,730
Yes, I could see it all, so I got decent scores even if I half-assed it.

615
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,890
From now on, Yoo Jin Woo is mine.

Who are you to say that?

Hey!

622
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,300
Did you say she abandoned you, though you did well?

623
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,700
Don't you think that depends on your standard of doing well?

624
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,930
To talk about the potential debut group,

625
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:57,050
if you were disqualified due to lobbying from families of other members,

626
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,870
shouldn't you have held on even more fiercely?

627
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,290
Since you don't have parents like that.

628
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,670
No, you should have done extremely well that

629
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,020
they couldn't cut you from the group.

630
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,920
But you were nicer than I thought.

631
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,310
- Pardon?
- You know, at the cafe.

632
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,610

From now on, don't adjust yourself to please others.

635
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:49,470
- Pardon?
- You need to focus on only yourself.

636
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,560
Set a goal, and focus on that goal.

637
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,470
Once you define your artistic world that shows who you are and what music you make,

you will have people who like you.

And...

712
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,010
that kid...

713
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,560
I decided to sign him on.

714
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,540
Even though he's a bit unpolished, I see potential in him.

715
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,380
Tell me.

716
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,360
If I polish him up and enter him in the audition, he'll rise in value.

717
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,050
After he garners public attention and his value rises,

718
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,200
I'll transfer his rights to a major agency.

If I succeed in this plan, I can buy our son Jin Woo a factory.

725
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:14,960
you'll sell someone else's son to buy our son's future?

726
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,610
Why would you say it like that?
