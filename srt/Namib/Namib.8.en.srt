00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,760
<i>If he's eliminated from the first round of live stages,</i>

176
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,340
<i>it won't be easy to convince my employees.</i>

177
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,680
So, what is your conclusion?

178
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,710
For now, it will be put on hold.

179
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,310
<i>I'll still keep watching him.</i>

180
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,610
<i>This is TA Entertainment CEO Lee.</i>

181
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,500
<i>Let's meet up sometime.</i>

182
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,110
<i>TA Entertainment wants to scout him.</i>

183
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,680
[TA Entertainment]

184
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,970
It's as I've told you.

185
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,860
We will scout Yoo Jin Woo.

186
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,650
Well, could you explain your reason?

187
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,740
He was so good that he showed his talent,

188
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,960
his charm, and he also gained a fandom.

189
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,930
And most importantly, seeing how you're thinking of selling a kid like that,

190
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,440
there's no reason not to buy him.

191
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,300
So, what are your conditions?

192
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,540
CEO Kang, just take care of that issue for me.

193
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,440
Fix the relationship between him and the broadcasting company of Star Rise.

194
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,050
They're probably very angry right now.

195
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,100
It would be problematic for both sides if they were to blacklist him.

196
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,770
Let's go.

197
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,040
What are you doing?

198
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,960
Why did you sit in the passenger seat?

199
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,910
How do I look?

200
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,050
You look the same.

201
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,410
Look while you can.

202
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,120
It may be difficult to see me often in the future.

203
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,100
It's fascinating, right?

204
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,990
I haven't changed,

205
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,950
but people have become nicer to me.

206
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,420
Nobody looks down on me,

207
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,350
and nobody criticizes me for being bad.

208
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,020
Han Young.

209
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,540
I want you to be like that, too.

210
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,910
What do you mean?

211
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,830
This feeling...

212
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,460
I'd like for you to experience it, too.

213
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,400
When I quit my work and open my business-

214
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,210
Not stuff like that.

215
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,670
What you're planning to do is just another Muse.

216
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,530
Who are you to say stuff about someone else's career?

217
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,530
If you really like that work, keep doing it.

218
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,560
If you're happy, keep doing it.

219
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,870
But if that's not the case, let's try doing something together.

220
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,890
I'll help you.

221
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,710
Congratulations.

222
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,010
I'll be returning to training camp tomorrow.

223
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,690
I came to say bye before I did.

224
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,960
I thought you were good ever since I saw you,

225
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,790
but I didn't know you were this good.

226
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,280
Though Star Rise is in a frenzy because of Yoo Jin Woo.

227
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,830
It's okay since my goal is to win.

228
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,290
I'm looking down the line.

229
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,970
I don't just want to become the focus of attention right now.

230
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,580
I want to become a real singer.

231
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,040
We'll help you as well.

232
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,850
CEO Jang also personally met with Star Rise Producer Park Jae Cheol-

233
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,460
Producer Park came here?

234
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,200
Oh, the thing is...

235
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,040
That's not so strange.

236
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,340
It's not strange for a producer to come to an entertainment agency.

237
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,330
It is a strange thing.

238
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,830
Do you know how careful the producer of an audition program is?

239
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,700
♫ <i>Your sigh</i> ♫

240
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,310
♫ <i>Though I can't truly understand its depth</i> ♫

241
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,950
I'm sorry.

242
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,180
I should have done better.

243
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, at least you got some recognition from this opportunity.

244
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,880
You should prepare for the next audition program.

245
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,120
Pardon?

246
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,160
There is an audition program at the end of this year, open to anyone.

247
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,510
There's another audition program next year that's open for trainees.

248
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,120
You want me to enter another audition program?

249
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,100
Another? Shouldn't you keep trying until you succeed?

250
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,450
Our company isn't planning to debut a girl group any time soon.

251
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,690
Okay.

252
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,480
But you... gosh, what do we do about this?

253
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,040
Pardon?

254
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,330
What do you mean?

255
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,220
You're so middle-of-the-road.

256
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,020
Your audition results were mediocre

257
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,770
and your grades at our company are also mediocre.

258
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,700
You didn't appear on Star Rise representing our company

259
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,450
because you were the best-performing trainee.

260
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,800
Didn't you know that when the new CEO picked that girl Ha Na,

261
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,330
other girls turned it down because they didn't want to be her supporting cast?

262
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,400
Oh, you didn't know.

263
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,510
In any case, how about you take this opportunity to change?

264
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,900
You should think about it.

265
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,280
Instead of staying mediocre like this.

266
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,840
Hey, I met with a lawyer, and-

267
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

268
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,220
What about Producer Park?

269
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,730
He's at the filming set.

270
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,940
And he is pretty mad.

271
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,780
How's the atmosphere at the broadcasting company?

272
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,660
In any case, he did sing a song

273
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,740
and completed his performance, so it wasn't a broadcasting accident.

274
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,900
They concluded that he sang the wrong song due to a misunderstanding.

275
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,330
And personally,

276
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,560
I'm on Jin Woo's side.

277
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,150
As soon as I saw him, I felt like he'd succeed.

278
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,130
So, I want to make an offer.

279
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,090
This is new and doesn't have anything to do with the audition program.

280
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,080
I'm thinking of starting a YouTube show with Yoo Jin Woo as the main cast.

281
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,540
YouTube?

282
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,400
That's a bit...

283
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,050
Could you tell me more in detail?

284
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,960
I personally proposed it to my superiors.

285
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,280
Based on the reactions to Jin Woo from the audition program,

286
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,170
so many people were curious about where he came from

287
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,600
and if he had a sad backstory.

288
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,320
We'll use it to show them what he usually does, what his history is,

289
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,440
and how he practices.

290
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,810
Then we'll accept-

291
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,390
It's dangerous.

292
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,240
Many unfiltered moments will be aired.

293
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
That's what people want.

294
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,510
Public attention? Fandom? How long do you think that will last?

295
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,620
One month? Two months?

296
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,600
According to the lawyer,

297
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,140
it would be difficult to avoid punishment if there were drugs in the car.

298
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,140
We need to resolve that first before we agree to the YouTube show

299
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,320
or sell him.

300
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,470
Let me out.

301
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,060
Yoo Jin Woo.

302
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,030
Aren't you going to help me?

303
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,490
Okay.

304
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,680
What should I do?

305
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,610
Here.

306
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,660
Look at you.

307
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,140
You've improved.

308
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,720
I learned it well when I did.

309
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,130
<i>If there were drugs,</i>

310
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,140
<i>he can't avoid punishment, even if he didn't know.</i>

311
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,310
Is cooking fun?

312
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,380
It just...

313
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,540
makes me feel good.

314
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,850
Cooking makes you feel good?

315
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,550
I never felt that way, even after cooking for 20 years.

316
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,860
I can always restart it even if I screw it up.

317
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,310
I'll be able to do that, too, right?

318
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,100
Of course.

319
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,970
Don't worry.

320
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,230
Gosh, seriously!

321
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,520
I said, let go of me!

322
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,700
I'll take care of it!

323
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,560
How long have you been like this?

324
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,000
What's the matter? I'm perfectly fine.

325
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,970
I'll handle it myself.

326
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,530
Well...

327
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,560
CEO, I'm sorry.

328
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,410
While Jaesung was playing at the nightclub-

329
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,530
CEO Jang.

330
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,080
Sorry.

331
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,710
I had a few photos taken of me while I was resting.

332
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,970
You know how CEO Jang is going to take care of it all.

333
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,570
There's nothing to worry about.

334
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,460
Right?

335
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,270
- Where?
- It was at B Club in Gangnam.

336
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,370
But I received a call from Xpatch, saying they've acquired the photos.

337
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,990
Yes, Reporter Seo.

338
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,500
I heard you have the photos of Jaesung from my company.

339
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,680
But we have something even bigger.

340
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,760
<i>After Jaesung left B Club, an ambulance came.</i>

341
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,370
<i>A female college student was unconscious.</i>

342
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,210
Supposedly, he gave her a drugged water bottle in the VIP room.

343
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,160
<i>We also have something to ask Jaesung.</i>

344
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,380
Who else was there at B Club besides you?

345
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,070
That's not my business.

346
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,180
Who else was there at B Club besides you, you bastard?

347
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,270
I don't know. I don't remember.

348
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,630
Gosh, that hurts.

349
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,940
Go to B Club immediately.

350
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,100
Go and see if he's there.

351
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,570
[B Club]

So, my conclusion is that you don't want Yoo Jin Woo to get hurt.

- No.

Please don't contact Mom anymore.

528
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,590

Why? I can't see your mom or your unni?

536

I have no memory of you

537
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,650
because I was too young when you abandoned your family.

538
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,160
But that's not the case for Unni.

539
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,120
While she was going through puberty, she saw

540
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,200
how you left us and abandoned our mother.

541
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,400
As soon as she went to college, she worked to feed our family.

542
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,780
To Unni, you are the start of her misfortunes and her life's enemy, so-

543
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,100
don't contact Unni.

544
