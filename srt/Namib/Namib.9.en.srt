Mom's kind of weird like that.

192
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,610
I didn't know either.

193

- Yes. - I read the news.

Will he really debut now?

206
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,149
He could've said goodbye, at least.

207
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,658

00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,929
Up until the other day,

342
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,759
you practically starved yourself to prepare for the audition.

343

358
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,339
Yes. Even yesterday, he took his profile photos and had a recording.

359
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,609
I read the article too. So, his debut is coming up.

360

Does he answer your calls?

361
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,650
Is he upset with me or something?

362
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,990
No, it's because of Ms. Kang.

363
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,289
My mom? Why? What happened?

364
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,598
You know, for trainees,

365
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:41,259
it can be very stressful. Moving agencies.

366
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,930
But my mom said it was a good thing for him.

367
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,599
But it wasn't something he wanted.

368

00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,110
- We have to check. - Yes.

549
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,449
- I'll contact you later. - Yes.

550
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,949
- It's a rumour. - Please don't go back.

551
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,389
I said it's a rumour.

("Star Rise" performance suspected of vocal editing)

554
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,799
(The audition show on the news report is "Star Rise.")

555
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,868
(Which trainees do you think "entertained" the producer?)

556
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,569
(I knew the editing was weird somehow.)

557
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,170
(I think "P" Entertainment is related to the controversy.)

558
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,368
(I found out which participants are from Pandora Entertainment.)

559
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:44,369
(Yoon Ji Young, Yoo Jin Woo, and Ha Na)

560
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,709
(Pandora is known for manipulation. I can tell which ones are favoured.)

561
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,739
Is that true?

562
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:51,449
The company has no reason to support Jin Woo.

563
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,280
But he's still from Pandora.

564
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,149
If Pandora had lobbied,

565
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,718
Yoo Jin Woo would've indirectly benefitted...

566
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,920
I said that's not true.

567
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,159
- He was kicked out. - He was kicked out?

568
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,460
- Yoo Jin Woo? - I mean...

569
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,299
I took him...

570
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,968
when I was kicked out.

571
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,570
How about Yoon Ji Young?

572
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,940
She was eliminated soon.

573
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,469
There's no evidence that she received special treatment.

574
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,110
So Ha Na...

575
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,480
has nothing to do with you, right?

576
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:21,409
We don't know much about her.

577
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,550
I did some investigating separately.

578
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,749
After Ms. Kang left Pandora Entertainment,

579
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,780
Jang Hyun Chul became the new CEO, right?

580
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:28,949
Yes.

581
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,888
It was confirmed...

582
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,518
that Ha Na became a trainee of Pandora Entertainment...

583
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,158
as Jang Hyun Chul became the CEO.

584
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,288
That's something we can't verify...

585
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:38,859
There were three celebrities signed with Pandora Entertainment.

586
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,099
You said Jin Woo and Ji Young had nothing to do with the deal.

587
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:46,239
Then Ha Na is left. She's the only one.

588
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,868
Does it mean Ha Na is the participant...

589
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,909
who benefitted from the deal?

590
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:52,979
- What? - Ms. Kang.

591
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,138
If you verify this,

592
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,448
I can immediately release an article...

593
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,809
stating that he didn't receive any special treatment.

(that Yoo Jin Woo isn't involved and suggested that Ha Na might be.)

Kang Soo Hyun, this woman...

600
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,280
Let me talk...

601
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,880
with the reporter who wrote this immediately.

602
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,380
Yes, sir.

603
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,130
Did you write an article based on Kang Soo Hyun's false statement?

604
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,690
It made sense. Please explain if that's not true.

605
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:49,329
(Park Ji Cheol, Producer of "Star Rise")

606

608

- Hello. - Hey.

609
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,340
- We did nothing. Got it? - What?

610
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,679
The final stage is postponed.

611
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,249
Even if she performs on stage again,

612
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,348
I'm going to eliminate her...

613
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,559
even if it means I should force her to make a mistake.

614
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,118
If you don't want to see that happen,

615
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,489
you'd better make her withdraw.

616
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,860
You can't do this to me.

617
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,199
Do you want to ruin your life by becoming a drug offender?

618
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,670
What are you talking about?

619
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,170
We exchanged nothing from the beginning.

620
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,079
Did you say you would make her win by doing this?

621
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,849
Ha Na will win the show no matter what.

622
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,750
Producer Park will have to listen to me.

623
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:48,159
Stop whining and just wait.

624
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:49,829

629
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,619

It's something you don't know about him.

640
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,968
Are you admitting that you asked the main producer of "Star Rise..."

641
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:17,170
to manipulate the show?

642
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,710
What should I do...

643

to make you remove negative articles about Ha Na?

644
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,280
Why should I remove them?

645
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,348
Tell me if that's not true.

646

Who gained attention the most?

653
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,809
It's Yoo Jin Woo.

654

A trainee who was kicked out.

655
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,309
A child who grew up without the help from his parents.

656
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,649
He was eliminated from the last round...

657
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,880
by singing a different song, which was unexpected.

658
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,118
He has a positive image as well.

659
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,719
He already filmed many commercials.

660
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,420
But...

661
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,489
what if that's not who he is?

662
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:16,158
- If not? - What if he's not an upright boy...

663
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,670

but someone who used to go to adult entertainment place...

665
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,309
will make an interesting story?

666
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:25,269

667
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,880
It's not easy to take down articles on Ha Na, right?

668
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,579
I know that.

669
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,449

00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:18,679
How about the adult entertainment place?

728
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,550

A guy I knew was working there.

730
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:24,750
So I stayed with him just for a while.

I had nowhere else to go at that time.

732
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,920

- Please. - What can you do?

737
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,179
Do you think people will believe you?

738
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,880
Do you think this industry is that easy?

739
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:54,449
Gosh, what should I do about the penalty fee for the commercials?

740
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,018
- That's what I'm saying. - I didn't know.

We really didn't know.

742
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,959
The official statement will be...

743
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,598

00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,400
- Yes. - Okay.

749
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,768
- Is that true? - Hello.

- Yes. - Yes.

752
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,879
