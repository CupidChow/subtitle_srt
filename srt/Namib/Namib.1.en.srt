00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,780
<i>- Yes.
- Don't trust her too much.</i>

712
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,560
<i>She's a terrible person who uses people and then casts them away.</i>

713
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,460
<i>I need to make 1 billion won by the end of this year.</i>

714
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,990
<i>It's my son's future and a promise I must keep.</i>

715
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,540
<i>So, you'll sell someone else's son to buy our son's future?</i>

716
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,960
<i>Please come to your senses!</i>

717
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,320
<i>I said I'll fix everything!</i>

718
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,920
<i>If he's 19, isn't his ceiling pretty clear already?</i>

719
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,030
<i>Something about him is unique.</i>

720
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,200
<i>The problem is his mom.</i>

721
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,210
<i>I'm screwed. She's meeting my mom.</i>

722
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,880
<i>Only if you weren't born, I wouldn't be living like this.</i>

723
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,290
<i>I'll become successful and make money!!</i>

724
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,890
<i>Can someone like me be successful, too?</i>

725
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:29,990
<i>Yoo Jin Woo, I'll make you like that.</i>

726
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,290
♫ <i>Pretending to be proud</i> ♫

727
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:35,580
♫ <i>Loneliness that I've ignored</i> ♫
