Thinking about what happened yesterday,

149
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,360
he might be putting on a show.

What do you mean?

151
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,330

People are criticizing the entire company...

158
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,779

159
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,649
And this is what you want to do?

160
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,360
Is that right?

161
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,230
- Did you come to make fun of me? - No, it's not like that.

162
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't have another intention.

163
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,500

164
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,370
What?

165
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,508
Don't you have to ask if the company is okay...

166
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,470
before asking about him?

167
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,138
People are criticizing all of us because of him.

168
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,408
It's because you were sitting on your hands.

169
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,409
What did you say?

170
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,548
Did you handle the controversy...

171
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,879
over him appropriately?

172
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,518
Just like people on the Internet, didn't you believe all the rumours,

173
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,850
force him to take responsibility,

174
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,659
and tell him to beg and apologize no matter what?

175
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,460
How dare you blame us when you're the one at fault?

176
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,659
And who are you to say something like this to me?

177
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,329
You're Kang Soo Hyun's husband, nothing more.

178
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,898

180
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,840
Do you understand?

181
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,309
If you're not going to give me a refund, get out.

182
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,379
Get out.

183
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,288
I can't reach Ha Na. She hasn't come to practice either.

184
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,320

185
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,599
Ha Na.

186
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,680

What the reporters are saying is nonsense.

188
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,990
Don't listen to them.

189
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,359
Did you not believe in me?

190
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,029
Did you think I wasn't good enough?

191
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Hang in there.

192
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,099
Hang in there just for a moment. It's going to be over.

193
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,410
Ha Na.

194
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,480
Okay. This is the first term. And this is the last term.

195
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,380
It's multiplied by the number of terms.

196
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:58,348
The one before this asks for the middle term...

197
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:01,250
between the 1st term and the 19th term, right?

198
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,589
Then what goes in the middle term?

199
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,518
It should be "a ten."

200
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,489
Eight multiplied by nineteen...

201
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,900
Eighty plus seventy-two...

202
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,499
is 152. That's the answer.

203
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,140
Did you get it right?

204
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,200
Don't forget to review it.

205
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,740
- Thank you. - All right.

206
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,339
Hey.

207
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,289
Oh, yes.

208
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:43,390
- You don't have to give it to me. - Why not?

209
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,099
It's from Yoo Jin Woo.

210
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,960
He's a little weird.

211
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,769
- What's weird about him? - I saw it on the Internet.

212
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,500
There were many controversies over him.

213
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,970
What controversies?

214
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,210
Manipulation. His personality.

215
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,609
And he's a bully.

216
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,839
What did you see?

217
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,579
- What? - You observed him closely.

218
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,220
You were in the same class as him.

219
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:10,190
- And you did this with him. - We're not close.

220
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,960
Hey, even if you're not close,

221
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,660
even though you're not close,

222
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,889
why do you believe people who don't know about him...

223
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,029
instead of what you saw and experienced?

224
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,569
Jin Woo. Can we talk for a moment?

225
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,750
I feel sorry for Yoo Jin Woo.

226
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,549
He created the class assistance system.

227
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,619
I thought he was different from others.

228
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,049
Do you also believe them?

229
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,589
Do you think what they say about him is all true?

230
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,990
No.

231
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,829
But people don't care, you know.

232
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,599
When something comes up, they gather around, gossip, and destroy you.

233
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,430
They don't even care to know what the fact is.

234
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,500
He was just unlucky.

235
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,210
Well, the truth is...

236
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,779
A little while ago...

237
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,450
We lost!

238
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,250
- Is it that hard? - I'm sorry.

239
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,420
Do it properly.

240
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,890
- Hey. - What? What is it?

241
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,630
Yoo Jin Woo from "Star Rise."

242
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,230
What? Yoo Jin Woo?

243
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,669
You mean, the Yoo Jin Woo we know?

244
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,769
He used to go to an adult entertainment place.

245
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,069
"Yoo Jin Woo..."

246
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,239
"has a nasty personality."

247
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,539
"He used to hit kids at school."

248
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,279
Hey, is it okay to write it?

249
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,410
Why?

250
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,380
It's not a lie.

251
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,779
You guys!

252
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,980
- Hey! - Hey!

253
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,450
- This is good. - Can I try it?

254
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,119
Hey, Jin Woo. Don't.

255
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,130
Hey.

256
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,999
What if they deny it? Then what will you do?

257
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,299
- Come on. - Me?

258
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,599
Here.

259
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,268
- Hey. - Oh, nice!

260
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,069
- Hey, well done. - My gosh.

261
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,639
- Come on. - Hey, open your mouth.

262
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
- Let me try once more. - All right.

263
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,779
Mom, I found out who posted the stuff about Jin Woo being a bully.

264
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,390
Those guys at the anti-bullying committee hearing.

265
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:22,650
It was them.

266
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,359
Mom.

267
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,788
We have a witness too. Jae Hyun said...

268
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,059
That company will handle everything related to Yoo Jin Woo from now on.

269
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,230
"That company?"

270
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,529
There is nothing I can do now.

271
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,609
Because you sold him?

272
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,809
Be honest with me.

273
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,349
The factory...

274
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,779
Didn't you buy it with the money from selling him?

275
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
That's right.

276
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,660
Did you think it'd make me happy?

277
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,629
Earning a future by selling a friend.

278
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,700
Did you actually think it'd make me happy?

279
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,230
Jin Woo.

280
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,869
I couldn't see that far.

281
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,710
I've seen it so many times.

282
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,809
Kids who have no future fall apart so quickly.

283
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,750
But I destroyed your future with my own hands,

284
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:25,219
so I wanted to do whatever it took to create a future for you.

285
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,420
That was all it was about.

286
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,759
"Future?"

287
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,318
So, you sold my friend to create a future for me?

288
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,359
Yes.

289
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,899
I didn't even do it on my own. You built that so-called future for me.

290
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,930
That's right!

291
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,029
Sir.

292
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,799
I need to talk to you about something.

293
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
What is it?

294
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,410
I'd like to settle my account.

295
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,709
Bill me for the breach of contract penalty for the ad too.

296
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,509
- What? - I'm sorry.

297
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,880
I'll take responsibility for the situation and leave.

298
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,920
Well, I was going to give you this anyway.

299
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,089
Why should we take care of this for you?

300
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,029
You'll have to cough up a lot of money.

301
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,059
I know.

302
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,269
Hey.

303
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,839
No funny business...

304
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,039
until your contract is terminated.

305
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,740
A suicide attempt, for example.

306
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,250
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

307
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,819
I wanted to live.

308
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,890
That's why I did it.

309
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,390
What are you doing?

310
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:52,829
There's food in the fridge, and your medicine is in the cupboard.

311
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,569
You know, I never asked them to rig the results on "Star Rise."

312
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,609
Mr. Jang just went ahead and did it.

313
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,709
I've booked a practice room for you at Pandora.

314
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,939
Rest up today, and start practising again tomorrow.

315
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm doomed anyway.

316
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,410
It's all over now.

317
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,049
The final round has been postponed anyway.

318
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,589
It's a good thing.

319
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,069
You said you'd die if you lost.

320
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,869
You didn't lose yet, so why do you look like you're dying?

321
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,150
Keep your promise.

322
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,250
You can think about it once you lose.

323
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,759
(Yoo Jin Woo)

324
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,829
(CEO Kang Soo Hyun, Pandora Entertainment)

325
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,180
Hide me.

326
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,990
(CEO Sim Jin Woo)

327
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,319
Mom.

328
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,119
What are you doing here?

329
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,960
I can't sleep.

330
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,690
What?

331
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:50,930
It's weird. I didn't drink any coffee.

332
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,699
You're probably just tired.

333
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,670
It happens.

334
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,039
No. I didn't get any sleep last night either.

335
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
What?

336
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,579
Mom, I can't stop thinking about it.

337
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,079
About what?

338
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,180
That day, Jin Woo...

339
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,650
While you were coming to me,

340
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,720
I went to Jin Woo.

341
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,960
I opened the bathroom door,

342
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,799
and he was sitting on the floor.

343
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,400
He was bleeding from his wrist.

344
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,869
That moment, Jin Woo asked me...

345
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,309
to cover him.

346
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,079
So, I...

347
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,779
I covered him,

348
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,250
but people suddenly showed up and...

349
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:55,630
It's okay.

350
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,559
He will be okay.

351
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,480
Tomorrow is a new day.

352
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,119
It'll be a new day.

353
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Have a good day.

354
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,299
(Flavia)

355
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,279
(Reject)

356
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,960
- How are things at the agency? - How's the factory?

357
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,630
You look tired.

358
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,299
Come on. Look who's talking.

359
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,569
What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at school?

360
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,869
What about you?

361
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,140
What's that bag for?

362
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,719
You said you were used to being abandoned.

363
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,519
That was a lie, wasn't it?

364
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,670
Yes.

365
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,670
I lied.

366
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,070
What's with your face?

367
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,599
- I'm sleep-deprived. - You too?

368
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,039
Yes.

370
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,610
Oh, boy.

371
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,110
What are you guys going to do?

372
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,590
Send her away.

373
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,489
What do you mean?

374
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,260
I'm talking about Soo Hyun.

375
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,719
Send her on a trip or something.

376
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,860
She always comes here and watches videos of the sea.

377
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,559
Why don't you give her a vacation?

378
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,199
Vacation?

379

380
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,989
Tell Ha Na to withdraw voluntarily.

381
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,719
Don't make things get out of control.

382
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,860
No, she can't withdraw.

383
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,300
The company's image is being destroyed as we speak!

384
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,260
Will you let the controversy get out of hand?

385
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,300
When I kicked out Kang Soo Hyun...

386
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,269
and appointed you as the new CEO of the company,

387
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,639
I took into consideration that you were harbouring a grudge against her.

388
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,440
I don't know why you two had a falling-out,

389
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,079
but I needed that grudge.

390
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,078
In the beginning, you didn't seem...

391
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,750
to hesitate when you had to fire people.

392
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:26,860
Do you think you'd never end up like Kang Soo Hyun?

393
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:40,440
I bet everything about this company looked promising at first.

394
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,670
You thought...

395
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,940
you'd make a lot of money if you kicked out Kang Soo Hyun...

396
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,480
and replaced her with an obedient CEO.

397
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:49,849
- What? - I'm sorry to disappoint you,

398
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,250
but I put poison in this company.

399
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,519
If you drink that poison, we'll both die.

400
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,900
It all comes down to money, right?

401
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,369

403
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,269
I'll make them look really good so you can just wash your hands of it,

404
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:18,610
so just...

405
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,579
watch what I do.

406
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,349
How will you do that in this situation?

407
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,519
I'll get Yoo Jin Woo back.

408
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,630
Yoo Jin Woo?

409
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,829
People are drawn to stories like this.

410
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,069
A story of someone who comes from nothing...

411
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,110
working himself to the bone to move up in the world and succeed.

412
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,340
Do you know what people like even more?

413
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,079
Seeing someone successful like that hit rock bottom from the top...

414
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,589
and roll down an endless slope...

415
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,219
because of one mistake.

416
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,920
In this world, there are people who enjoy that.

418
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,759
He lost everything because of a scandal.

419
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,929
Do you know what he does as a streamer these days?

420
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,428
He dances, sings,

421
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,599
and puts on a show for money.

422
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,039
There's a ridiculous amount of money in that industry.

423
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,409
Are you saying you'll get Yoo Jin Woo...

424
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:32,980
and make him do stuff like that?

425
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,550
You see,

426
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,889
I know that industry.

427
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,328
Everyone who was rooting for Yoo Jin Woo...

428
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,489
will come and hurl stones at him.

429
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,800
And every single one of those stones is money.

430
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,570
This way, you can recover your investment,

431
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:55,170
and I can destroy what Kang Soo Hyun created...

432
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,440
and what she'll go on to make.

433
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,979
- You know what I mean. - Right.

434
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,519
- It's not that it didn't go well. - I was just kidding.

435
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,250
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,130
she'd like to meet them.

550
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,539
Hyun Bin, you slow down a bit at the bridge.

551
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,610
Can you keep with the beat?

552
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,009
You're doing well.

553
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,109
You nailed the tone and melody,

554
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,679
so let's work on the time and details and try again.

555
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,320
He's getting better and better with your feedback.

556
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:34,579
Thanks.

557
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:36,320
Let's try again.

558
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,260
I want to meet them one day.

559
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:44,960
In my lifetime.

560
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:46,860
The best...

561
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:50,800
The best kid.

562
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,079
Mother. I'll visit you again.

563
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:03,809
Okay. Let's meet often.

564
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,780
Sure.

565
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,469
I'm Reporter Han from Joypic.

566
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:28,499
I couldn't reach Ms. Kang, so I called you.

567
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,940
You know Yoo Jin Woo's press conference is up soon, right?

568
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:43,719
(My Family Care Home)

569
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,860
The call cannot be connected.

570
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:03,710
Tell the reporters yourself.

571
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,679
(My Family Care Home)

572
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,780
Taxi!

573
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,750
Incheon Airport, please, and fast.

574
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,090
I shouldn't have told her to ignore her phone.

575
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,059
- Hey. - Are you ready?

576
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,170
What will he say?

577
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,569
I don't know. We'll see.

578
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,570
(Republic of Korea)

579
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:51,150
(Information)

580
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:55,659
Kang Soo Hyun!

581
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,159
What's going on?

582
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,800
What will you do about Yoo Jin Woo?

583
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,299
"What will I do?"

584
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,768
To sell him to buy our son a factory.

585
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:12,969
- It was your idea. - Right.

586
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,539
You made that decision because you thought...

587
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,179
Yoo Jin Woo was worth it.

588
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,920
- Yes. - There's something...

589
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:22,280
I really want to ask you.

590
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,190
Yoo Jin Woo.

591
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,760
What is he to you?

592
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,889
What if...

593
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,929
that accident hadn't happened?

594
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:37,230
If our son hadn't gotten hurt.

595
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:40,670
If you never dreamed of buying a factory.

596
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,110
If you hadn't been replaced as Pandora's CEO.

597
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,480
If you were an ordinary producer.

598
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,349
If I hadn't...

599
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,110
nagged and tormented you.

600
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,050
If you had no burdens...

601
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,250
or guilt to live through.

602
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:07,429
If you didn't have a husband like me who bothered you.

603
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,329
What if that were the life you had...

604
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,199
and you met Yoo Jin Woo?

605
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:34,158
Mom, can we check that out too?

606
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,259
Hang on.

607
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,360
Mom's a bit busy. Give me a moment.

608
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:51,070
- Mom. Let's go over there. - What?

609
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,510
- Shall we? - Honey!

610
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:57,209
The restaurant crowded, and we have to wait.

611
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,510
Let's eat somewhere else.

612
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,079
- I thought that was a hammer. - No.

613
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,360
If that hadn't happened...

614
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,199
He'd be the best kid of my life.

615
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,469
Let's go to Yoo Jin Woo.

616
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,469
Yoo Jin Woo's here.

617
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,380
Read word for word. It's all on you.

618
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,058
(It stemmed from my past mistakes.)

619
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,459
(It happened before I joined TA Entertainment.)

620
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,729
(I was deprived when I grew up.)

621
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,968
(I had depression for a long time, )

622
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,199
(and I started to self-harm when I was young.)

623
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,209
The issues we know of so far...

624
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,868
is that "Star Rise" was rigged, you worked at a club,

625
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,439
and you were a bully when you attended Sewoon High.

626
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,650
We'd like to know what's true and what isn't.

627
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,518
Your being seen at the club.

628
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,389
Is it related to the producer of "Star Rise" who was bribed?

629
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,819
Witness accounts of your bullying days...

630
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,089
are surfacing online.

631
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,159
Is that true?

632
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,969
Yoo Jin Woo. Will you apologize?

633
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,379
(I hung out with people I shouldn't have, )

634
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,678
(and disappointed fans with my actions.)

635
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,049
(I take full responsibility and will leave the boy group.)

636
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,289
(I apologize sincerely to all who believed in me.)

637
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,170
Yoo Jin Woo.

638
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,670
Look up.

639
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,119
Sit up straight.

640
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,259
I'll answer all the questions.

641
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,860
Don't you say a word, okay?

642
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:04,530
I'm Kang Soo Hyun. Direct your questions to me.

643
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,569
How much of the issues are true...

644
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,399
and how much is false?

645
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,570
They're nothing but groundless rumours.

646
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,408
Is it a groundless rumour that he was at a club?

647
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,448
A close friend Yoo Jin Woo met...

648
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:20,279
when he was a trainee currently works at a club.

649
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,280
That's all.

650
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:23,750
There's talk that he bullied students at school.

651
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,219
That's...

652
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,759
My son was involved in a bullying incident.

653
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,629
Yoo Jin Woo helped my son who was a victim.

654
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,658
That's all.

655
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,729
Would he consider apologizing?

656
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,730
No.

657
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:43,808
Making vague apologies...

658
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:46,369
about unclear rumours just to move on.

659
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,780
I think that's the worst you can do to deceive fans.

660
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,849
We won't apologize at this moment.

661
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,518
Yoo Jin Woo. You did nothing wrong.

662
00:56:58,519 --> 00:56:59,590
Look up and come with me.

663
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:06,760
What's your plan, Ms. Kang?

664
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:08,828
Do you deny all the suspicions?

665
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,768
- What about the bullying... - Is this it?

666
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:12,670
- Comment on that, please. - Look over here!

667
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,768
Tell us the truth.

668
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,738
- Why won't you answer? - What are you thinking?

669
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:17,869
(To press conference)

670
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,309
Wouldn't it have been nice...

671
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,579
if you'd held Yoon Hee's hand like that too?

672
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,760
Yoo Jin Woo.

673
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,199
I'll take him.

674
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,340
Yoo Jin Woo. Do you think you deserve to be in the light?

675
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,409
I'll take you.

676
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,949
To a world that suits you.

677
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,099
(Namib)

678
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,959
You all but ruined an agency...

679
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,368
and will take just the kid?

680
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:53,069
I'll hand him over to whoever brings the money first.

681
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,399
Mom will sell the place to get you back.

682
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,439
Half the price?

683
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,339
Help us out. We're a bit short.

684
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,038
Pandora will get him. It has been decided.

685
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:03,439
You'll just abandon them. Now you say this?

686
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,279
I get the feel I can never come back if I leave now.

687
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,050
I'm at the police station.

688
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,948
Our story is that Yoo Jin Woo did it all.

689
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:12,788
I can't sing anymore.

690
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:14,888
I'm of no use if I can't sing, right?

691
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:16,519
You don't need me anymore.
