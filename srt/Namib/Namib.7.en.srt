88
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:27,930
Sorry.

89
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:33,809
I cannot understand the depth

90
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,708
But it's okay

91
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,180

Oh, no.

93

94

No.

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,730
A two-shot. Got it.

99
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,458
It's for an insert.

100

101
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,659
Okay, got it.

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,329
- We were. - You're the same age?

103
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:02,069
You're not together. You're real friends.

104
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,370
Hey.

105
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,970
You became trainees around the same time,

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,369
but neither of you got noticed.

107
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,970
That's how you got close.

108
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,078
And it's possible you both almost got axed.

109
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,310
Do you read fortunes too?

110
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,920
The look in your eyes when you see him...

111
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,290
is half envy because he's doing well,

112
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,759
and half worry about yourself.

113
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,758
You're wrong. I'm 100 percent happy for him.

114
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,389
Why do you keep messing up, then?

115
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,329
Come with me.

116
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,039
Pull yourself together. The show's not far off.

117
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,578
Don't you feel uneasy or anxious?

118
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:47,680
Why would I?

119
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,180
That won't win me any more points.

120
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,089
Oh, I misunderstood the question.

121
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,588
"Why are you still trying at your age?"

122
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,629
"Don't you worry about the rest of your life?"

123
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,959
- Is that what you want to ask? - No.

124
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,660
It's not,

125
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,930
but it's something like that.

126
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,269
I have belief and trust.

127
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,910
In what?

128
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
In myself.

129
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,110
Even if things don't always work out,

130
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,310
my life right now isn't too bad.

131
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,680
What about you?

132
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,489
Does this suit you?

133
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,920
Is it comfy like a tailored suit?

134
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,920
Think about it this way.

135
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,729
"If I don't do this, I'll die."

136
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
What?

137
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,059
That simplifies everything...

138
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,399
and puts you at ease.

139
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,899
Let's go inside.

140
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:44,799
Be careful with that.

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,898
- Okay. - That's it.

142
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,938
Pull that end tight now.

143
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,939
(Let's win "Star Rise!")

144
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,139
Pull it way tighter.

145
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,910
A bit more. Okay, that's fine.

146
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,550
Let's create a profile.

147
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,279
We must make him known while people are interested.

148
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,350
Okay. Let's do that.

149
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,819
But who will do it?

150
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

151
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,629
I have to make it?

152
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,970
I do all the tedious stuff.

153
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,439
Now I'll describe Yoo Jin Woo the brand.

154
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,040
Okay.

155
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,449
- Yoo Jin Woo. - Yoo Jin Woo.

156
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,779
He's like the sea.

157
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,750
He's like the sea.

158
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,490
In the beginning, he fell like a raindrop.

159
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,590
With no one to hold his hand, he rolled and flowed.

160
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,389
From stream to river.

161
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,429
He got pushed and shoved.

162
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,799
He could've vanished or given up, but he didn't.

163
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,639
And now...

164
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,809
he's about to reach the sea.

165
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,080
That's a powerful story.

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,379
It could be an intriguing brand, don't you think?

Delete this and stick this to this.

172
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Like this?

173
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,940
No, delete that.

174
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:25,599
Delete everything.

175
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
- Everything? - Just move.

176
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,349
Don't we have a nicer photo?

177
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,479
He looks better in real life.

178
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
We have lots of photos and videos.

179
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,120
Do we?

180
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,589
When the audition's done,

181
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,590
we should buy him some clothes.

182

00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,839
With our voices

188
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,499
Let's sing wherever we are

189
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,340
The ode to youth

190
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,308
I become afraid when my phone rings

191
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,779
My heart jumps with surprise first

192
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,219
I want to spend time alone

193
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,518
But I don't want to be alone

194
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,719
I don't even know myself

195
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,359
Where on earth is my happiness?

196
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,869
No one can answer that for me

197
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,768
I look at my reflection on my phone that I turned off

198
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,179
And I will say to myself

199
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:17,079
On the way home I'll say I did a good job

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,319
That though it wasn't easy I didn't do too bad

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,288
In this suffocating world

202
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,989
I managed to smile about something small

203
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,499
It so happens

204
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,428
That today is a first

205
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:42,009
Even if a scathing comment makes me hate myself

206
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,538

210
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,850
It's mine

211
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,289
It's mine

212
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,029
A cosy blanket envelopes me

213
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,459
In this small warmth

214
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,168
I'll look forward to tomorrow

215
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:12,269
And fall asleep

216
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,109
The noisy alarm will ring tomorrow morning

217
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,249
I hope I hate it a bit less than today

218
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,179
In this suffocating world

219
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,018
I like all this because I'm me

220
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,418
It so happens

221
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,459
That tomorrow will be a first

222
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,428
Even if a scathing comment

223
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:41,970
Makes me hate myself

The ode to youth

228
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,308
He did well in the first round, and he's still good.

229
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,648
Right? He'll go a long way, don't you think?

230
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,450
- You think so? - He's really good.

231
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,759
Him. Is he through?

232
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,100
- Water. - What?

233
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,809
I need water. I feel croaky.

234
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,309
Here you go.

235
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,320
Drink some water then.

236
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,129
No.

237
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Something else. A different bottle.

238
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,870
Can the next duo come on stage?

239
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,388
Take a deep breath

240
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:20,529
Until your sides feel cramped

241
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,840
Until you feel a little pain

242
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,839
Exhale all the way

243
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,709
Until you feel like

244
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,649
There's nothing left in you

245
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,720
If you feel out of breath

246
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,460
That's still okay

247
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,470
No one will blame you

248
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,099
You can make mistakes sometimes

249
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,969
Everyone does

250
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,580

253
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,288
That heavy breath

254
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,199
How could I ever

255
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,600
Fathom the depth?

256

Your sigh

257
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:38,979
I cannot understand the depth

258

But it's okay

259
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:46,220
I will give you a hug

260
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,460
You really did

261
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,289
So well

262
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,230
Do you have cigarettes?

263
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,428
I'm still in high school.

264
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,100
And you don't have cigarettes?

265
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,599
You talked about a well-tailored suit.

266
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,830
Why do you want a cigarette?

267
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,169
You're too young to know.

268
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,269
So it's about age, is it?

269
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,679
I guess this outfit doesn't suit me.

272
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,960
- How is it going? - Hello.

273
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,969
Fathom the depth?

274
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,440
- The part where Ha Na messes up. - Yes.

275

Cut it out.

276
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,578
- What? - It's just a wrong note.

277
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,279
It doesn't go with the flow.

278
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,008
What do you mean it doesn't go with the flow?

279
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,880
Cut it out, okay?

280
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,489
- Then it'll... - Do as you're told and cut it out.

281
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,049
Just cut it out!

282
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,960
I'll take responsibility, okay?

283
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,130
What's up with him?

It's not that, but...

299
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,828
I feel bad and embarrassed too.

300
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,558
One of the employees said...

301
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,828
this looked nice and suggested we make just 100 of them.

302
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,169
I should've gotten your permission,

303

I'm sorry to meet you in these circumstances.

323
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,140
Not long ago, in an alley near the school,

324
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,609
there was an assault... Some students got into a fight.

325
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,779
The assailants were Park Si Hoon, Lee Jong Won, Mun Jae Sik.

326
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,410
Three students.

327
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,449
The victim was Sim Jin Woo.

328
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,480
Excuse me.

329
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,589
I don't agree that the incident falls under "violence at school."

330
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,519
The person who urged the kids to fight...

331
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,160
is here. Am I wrong?

332
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,690
Ms. Kang, be honest with us.

333
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,960
You caused the kids to fight, didn't you?

334
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,869
- Me? - Yoo Jin Woo.

335
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,739
You hired that weird boy.

336
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,139
He intimidated the other kids as if he was a bodyguard or something.

337
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,869
He even threw bread at my kid.

338
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,539
You put him up to it, didn't you?

339
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,679
So, wasn't it only natural that they ended up fighting?

340
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,750
Don't you agree, teacher?

341
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,480
- You're right, but... - Yes, exactly.

342
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,890
So, this isn't about the kids getting into a fight.

343
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,720
Jin Woo's mother made them fight. Am I wrong?

344
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,490
- What are you saying... - That is not true.

345
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,599
What is not true?

346
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,269
Who are you? What's your kid's name?

347
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,799
- Jae Sik. - Jae Sik's mother.

348
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:09,268
- Is Jae Sik a fool? - What did you say?

349
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,169
He kept hitting him and bugging him in the classroom.

350
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,338
He even told him to bring money.

351
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,240
And you say she put Jae Sik up to it?

352
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,308
Mr. Sim, please calm down.

353
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,309
What? He threw bread at him?

354
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,119
Is that why they beat him up in that alley at night?

355
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,889
And what? It doesn't fall under "violence at school?"

356
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,049
Does that make sense to you?

357
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,259
Don't you understand, as parents?

358
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,960
Our son has a disability, so we just wanted to help him.

359
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,500
Right, I admit that what Jin Woo's mom did isn't something...

360
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,799
that can be widely understood.

361
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,828
Even so, how could you say he deserved...

362
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,400
to get beaten up because of what his mom did?

363
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,809
How could you say that when you're all raising your children too?

364
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,680
Don't say such a thing!

365
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,079
What will you do about that kid?

366
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,618
That trashy kid who is always with your son.

367
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,289
What? "Trashy?"

368
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,759
Yoo Jin Woo is not like that.

369
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:05,959

372
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,399

00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,670
Watch what you say.

553
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,199
There are many eyes watching.

554
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,809
Don't drag him down.

555
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,880
I will figure it out.

556
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:49,289
All right.

557
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,019
You say you'll figure it out, so...

558
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,139
- Take a deep breath - All right, here.

559
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,419
Until your sides feel cramped

560
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,479
("Sigh" by Ha Na and Yoon Ji Young)

561
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,489
Until you feel a little pain

562
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,590
Exhale all the way

563
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:34,629
Until you feel like

564
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,500
There's nothing left in you

565
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,039
- Your sigh - Your sigh

566
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,280
- I cannot understand the depth - The editing's off.

567
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,308
They're not showing the whole performance.

568
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,380
I feel like the way it was edited...

569
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,679
showcases Ji Young's mistakes.

570
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,619
The other girl sang slightly out of tune too.

571
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:03,788
That tomorrow will be a first

572
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,828
Even if a scathing comment

573
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:10,329
Makes me hate myself

574
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,839
Let's not mind it

575
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,169
With our voices

576
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,768
Let's sing wherever we are

577
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,638
The ode to youth

578
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,780
("Cheers to Youth" by Yoo Jin Woo and Kim Yi Jun)

579
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,449
He did well in the first round, and he's still good.

580
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,678
Isn't he so good?

581
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,480
He'll go a long way, don't you think?

582
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,449
Is there a song you want to sing?

583
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,289
I don't know if I can sing it well.

584
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:34,659
What about this?

585
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,689
(Yoo Jin Woo keeps rejecting his suggestions.)

586
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,929
(Nervous)

587
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,659
- What is this? - What about this song?

588
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,698
Can't you help me out?

589
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:41,760
(They keep wasting time butting heads.)

590
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:49,269
Shoot. People are posting mean things about Jin Woo.

591
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,439
No one is saying anything nice about their performance.

592
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,779
Everyone is criticizing his personality.

593
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,679
There is only a week left before the live show.

594
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,408
We'll tally up the judges' scores...

595
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,419
and the viewers' votes to decide...

596
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,448
who can move on to the finals.

597
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,149
"Star Rise."

598
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,518
The finalists will be announced online...

599
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,928
before the live show next week.

600
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,158
You can vote...

601
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,260
until the day before the live show.

602
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,429
Vote for your star!

603
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,869
The thing is,

604
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,069
Mr. Kim stopped by in the morning...

605
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,739
and told me something about Yoo Jin Woo.

606
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,780
There was a car accident at Muse a few days ago.

607
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,980
The person who drove that car...

608
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,019
was Yoo Jin Woo.

609
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,750
And...

610
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,960
the man in the car was...

611
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,829
Yoo Jin Woo. Call me as soon as you see this.

612
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,300
Go somewhere quiet and call me.

613
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,510
You can vote until the day before the live show.

614
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,908
Vote for your star!

615
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:02,949
Hey.

616
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,919
Our performance looked amazing, right?

617
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,820
My gosh. That looked awesome.

618
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:27,868
All right. The finalists will be announced online...

619
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:30,509
three hours before the live show.

620
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,238
Go ahead and tell me the song you'd want to perform...

621
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,340
if you were to move on to the finals.

622
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,610
What song would you want to sing?

623
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,419
Oh, I'd like to sing "Peak" by Runz.

624
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,150
"Peak" by Runz? Okay.

625
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,619
- I haven't decided yet. - You don't know yet? Okay.

626
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,159
"Peak" will be so cool.

627
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,360
Can you do it alone though?

628
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,860
Hey, let's talk.

629
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,269
If you have something to say to me, just say it.

630
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,010
Okay, someone asked me to pass along this message.

631
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,510
Who?

632
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,280
You know Chris, right?

633
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,110
He said you two used to work together at Muse,

634
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,479
but you betrayed him and left.

635
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,949
He told me to tell you this.

636
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,750
"Get disqualified..."

637
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,659
"on the live show."

638
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,260
And how am I supposed to trust you?

639
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,559
He mentioned a car accident.

640
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,959
He found something at the scene of the accident.

641
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,599
Someone's business card, I heard.

642
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,130
If you don't want to see the owner of the business card get hurt,

643
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:34,969
you should withdraw from the show.

644
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,039
I definitely delivered his message.

645
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,550
Why are you doing this?

646
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,909
- Doing what? - Why...

647
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,920
Why are you doing something like this?

648
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,860
I have to step on you for me to succeed.

649
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,400
(Kang Soo Hyun)

650
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,110
- What's the reason? - Oh, my gosh.

651
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,150
What are you talking about?

652
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,948
I know you like making someone look like a fool,

653
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,789
but why does it have to be Yoo Jin Woo of all people?

654
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,320
I really don't know what you're talking about.

655
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,630
Stop talking nonsense and please just go.

656
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,500
I guess you guys are manipulating the show.

657
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:35,460
My gosh.

658
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,000
- Please be quiet. - Yoo Jin Woo.

659
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,439
Give him an opportunity.

660
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,670
Just give him a fair chance to fight.

661
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,440
Can't you even do that? Why not?

662
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,309
My goodness.

663
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,949
I don't know.

664
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Yes, Ms. Kang.

665
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,880
Did Mr. Jang tell you to do something...

666
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,150
regarding "Star Rise?"

667
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
Well...

668
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,989
Park Ji Cheol, the producer of "Star Rise," came to the office.

669
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,289
Producer Park?

670
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,690
- Why? - I don't know why.

671
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,829
He talked with Mr. Jang in his office for a long time.

672
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,030
Then he stumbled out.

673
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,699
It did look a little strange.

674
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,170
Okay.

675
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,679
(Jin Woo's Dad)

676
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,079
Hello. This is me.

677
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,979
Hyun Chul called Producer Park...

678
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,889
to the office a while ago.

679
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,050
- I'm going now. - No.

680
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,719
Don't go. Let me meet him.

681
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,268
(Project Plan)

682
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:21,769
- What brought you here? - I heard there was...

683
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,138
a car accident in Muse.

684
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:26,379
(CEO Jang Hyun Chul, Pandora Entertainment)

685
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,510
Are you a detective?

686
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,550
I did hear that you're a homemaker.

687
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,909
Hold on.

688
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,118
How did you know?

689
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,619
I heard it from Mr. Kim's son.

690
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,949
Jin Hyun? He's a regular at my store.

691
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,690
I know the feelings you have toward us.

692
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,559
It's a problem between us.

693
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,760
Please leave the guys alone.

694
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,400
Both Mr. Kim's son...

695
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,328
and Yoo Jin Woo.

696
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,569
My Yoon Hee was younger...

697
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,809
than Mr. Kim's son and Yoo Jin Woo.

698
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:01,110
Soo Hyun coaxed her by saying she would take responsibility.

699
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,980
And she pressured her until the day before she died.

700
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,480
"If you were an investor, would you invest in yourself?"

701
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,750
"Do whatever it takes if you can show what you're capable of."

702
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:12,119
She said things like that.

703
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,960
Do you know...

704
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:18,460
Yoon Hee was alive after the accident?

705
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,559
I foolishly called Kang Soo Hyun in the meantime.

706
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,869
That woman didn't pick up.

707
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,448
She put it so simply.

708
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:37,980
She said Yoon Hee might've volunteered to go.

709
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,480
Did Soo Hyun say that?

710
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,150
She could say that as a CEO.

711
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,590
She should cover it up and sort it out.

712
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,360
And I can do it too.

713
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,960
Because I'm her family.

714
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,829
Don't you think...

715
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,030
I can take my revenge and punish her?

716
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,670
Hyun Chul.

717
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:05,769
What happened to Yoon Hee is our fault and mistake.

718
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,409
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:18,250
Are you saying...

720
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,960
that it's your fault and mistake only now?

721
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,889
But please don't take Jin Woo's future away...

722
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,299
because of our fault.

723
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,030
"Don't take his future away?"

724
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,769
You took someone's life away.

725
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,809
Watch...

726
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,510
what I'm going to do.

727
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,190
Excuse me.

728
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,730
I'm sorry. You know me, right?

729
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,960
- Yes. - Can I meet Yoo Jin Woo just once?

730
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,829
Ms. Kang, you can't do this. Please go back.

731
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:03,929
Well...

732
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,639
Ms. Kang.

733
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,609
Let me check. Give me a moment.

734
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,639
Sure.

735
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:28,190
It won't take long. Ten minutes? No, five minutes.

736
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,130
Ms. Kang. Well...

737
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:34,559
Jin Woo doesn't want to meet you.

738
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:06,730
Do you know Yoon Hee was alive after the accident?

739
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,070
I foolishly called Kang Soo Hyun in the meantime.

740
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,400
That woman didn't pick up.

741
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,209
(Pandora Entertainment, Team Manager Jang Hyun Chul)

742
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,139
(Operating Room)

743
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,920
Who are the guys from END Holdings?

744
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:31,619
You guys let them in for investment.

745
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:35,690
Hyun Chul. Let's make it clear.

746
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,190
It has nothing to do with the company.

747
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,099
She might've volunteered to go.

748
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,469
She put it so simply.

749
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:48,440
She said Yoon Hee might've volunteered to go.

750
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,439
Did Soo Hyun say that?

751
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,010
Don't you think...

752
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,980
I can take my revenge and punish her?

753
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,210
(Chris)

754
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,889
(Yoo Jin Woo)

755
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,738
The person you reached is unavailable.

756
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:30,340
Please leave a message after the tone.

757
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,880
(Yoo Jin Woo)

758
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:16,889
Jin Woo.

759
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,389
I went to see you earlier. Why did you not come out?

760
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,929
- Just because. - What?

761
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,389
I didn't go out just because I felt like it.

762
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,860
Do the production team keep asking you to do something?

763
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,429
I said they don't. Why do you keep asking me?

764
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,440
Did you hear something from Chris or Jang Hyun Chul?

765
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,519
I'll take care of it myself.

766
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:24,190
We will now begin the live online broadcast...

767
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,489
announcing the "Star Rise" live show participants.

768
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,730
By combining the viewer vote scores tallied until yesterday...

769
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:34,960
and the judge scores...

770
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,630
based on their performances on stage so far,

771
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,268
a total of 8 participants, from 1st to 8th place,

772
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,809
will advance to the live show.

773
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,079
The total number of viewer votes...

774
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,780
is 5,120,394 in total.

775
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,980
We'd like to thank the viewers.

776
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,250
The participant who will advance to the main round live show is...

777
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,559
Park Hyun.

778
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,559
Me?

779
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,729
The next participant who passed the audition is Seo Hwan Hee.

780
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,329
(Announcement of 8 finalists)

781
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,170

782
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Thank you.

00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,110

785
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,908
And the next participant who passed the audition is Kim Yi Jun.

786
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:23,909
Yes!

787
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,489
The seventh finalist is...

788
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:36,929
He told me to tell you this.

789
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,730
"Get disqualified on the live show."

790
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,969
Yoo Jin Woo.

791
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,369
(Yoo Jin Woo)

792
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,139
(Yoo Jin Woo)

793
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,550
The last finalist is...

794
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,789
Ha Na.

795
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,769
- Let's go. - Yes.

796
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:25,670
(The top 8 have been confirmed.)

797
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:31,979
Please get ready for the live show immediately.

798
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,549
Those who were eliminated, please come this way.

799

Those who passed, please move to the other side.

800
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,349
Jin Woo. Well done.

801
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
What?

802
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,090
What do I do?

803
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,900
- Jin Woo. - Please move.

804
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,070
Jin Woo. Please move.

805
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:57,210
Jin Woo. Hey.

806
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,760
(Yoo Jin Woo)

807
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,699
Where did Jin Woo go?

808
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:07,780
(Yoo Jin Woo)

809
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,050
Jin Woo.

810
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:22,019
Why do you not listen to me again?

811
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,230
- Please take a look. - Okay.

812
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,349
(Yoon Ji Young)

813
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:50,389
- Mr. Sim. - Yes, Ji Young. You worked hard.

814
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,519
- By the way... - Something seems off about Jin Woo.

815
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,420
He didn't look happy when they announced the finalists.

816
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,929
He left after saying, "What do I do?"

817
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,079
(Waiting Room for Dancers)

818
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:28,090
I'm sorry.

819
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,030
(Alice)

820
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:35,860
Yes, I checked it.

821
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,510
It's in front of the camera.

822
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,980
Numbers 2 and 3...

823
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,380
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,900
(Yoo Jin Woo)

825
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Hold on.

826
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,070
What is wrong with him?

827
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:54,800
Hold on. Please wait.

828
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:58,539
Jin Woo.

829
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,780
Jin Woo.

830
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,440
Ms. Kang.

831
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,739
Can I trust you?

832
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,949
(Namib)

833
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,980
What's wrong with him?

834
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,348
- Hey, Yoo Jin Woo! - You should've ignored him.

835
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,788
You should've performed even if he had threatened to kill you.

836
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:23,619
Xpatch contacted us that they got the photos.

837
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,460
The lawyer said it'd be impossible to avoid punishment.

838
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,598
I'm very confident I'll do well this time.

839
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:29,629
It's dangerous.

840
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,429
They will show a lot of your uncontrolled behaviour.

841
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:34,800
They gave her a water bottle laced with drugs in the VIP room.

842
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,500
What happened yesterday?

843
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:39,039
If you promise to keep your mouth closed,

844
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,539
we can cover it up.
