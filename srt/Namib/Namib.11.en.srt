00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,220
We've had much internal discussion about

180
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,430
whether it was good to even film the finals.

181
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,000
We should wrap things up with the finals stage for the sake

182
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,860
of the contestants who've participated. Right?

183
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,350
All right, we've got one week left.

184
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,950
Please do your best until then.

185
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,020
<i>Okay.</i>

186
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,720
Yes?

187
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm at the police station right now.

188
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,740
I told them

189
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,680
what happened at Muse.

190
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,720
- What?
<i>- I passed out,</i>

191
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,420
and when I woke up, police detectives were around me.

192
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,830
<i>Damn it, I had no choice.</i>

193
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,200
I told them everything.

194
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,750
<i>You know, the police...</i>

195
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,660
will soon come to you.

196
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,630
This is the factory.

197
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,470
Let's go.

198
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,060
Mom says she'll sell this place to bring you back.

199
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,440
She was in such a frenzy to buy this place for my sake, and now...

200
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,880
she's in a frenzy to sell it for your sake.

201
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,540
Your mom told me to just think about myself,

202
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,360
but she doesn't think about herself at all.

203
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,730
Hey, I'm so sorry about this.

204
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,080
We aren't selling this factory for you.

205
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,120
It's for my mom.

206
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,750
For the CEO?

207
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,210
Yeah.

208
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,860
If I end up working here,

209
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,120
my mom can't become happy...

210
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,010
since it will only confirm that I got hurt because of her.

211
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,970
I want to set her free

212
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,990
from thinking that she needs to take responsibility for my life.

213
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,600
And...

214
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
I will go down my own path.

215
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,450
You'll really do something else besides running a factory?

216
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah.

217
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,220
You should also work hard and help my mom live comfortably.

218
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,640
If you don't become successful,

219
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,890
she'll chase you around forever to take care of you this time.

220
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,740
That's really tiresome, you know.

221
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,350
I'm going to the academy.

222
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,000
- Go on home first.
- Hey, Jin Woo.

223
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,990
I also have something to tell you.

224
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,150
To be honest,

225
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,310
I tried to use you at first,

226
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,750
so I can sign a contract with the CEO.

227
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,910
Ji Young told me you were being bullied,

228
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,380
so I told her I'll protect you if she takes me.

229
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,730
You were carrying that in your heart all this time?

230
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,310
Yoo Jin Woo, you should be level-headed.

231
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,530
Shim Jin Woo.

232
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,370
Did you have a good talk with him?

233
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah.

234
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,310
You did well. I'm sure it wasn't easy.

235
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,850
I also did it.

236
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,550
I told the company I was quitting as a trainee and left.

237
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,840
After everything, I'm right back where I started.

238
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,730
I did it for eight years,

239
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,380
and there was nothing for me in the end.

240
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,190
Contestant Yoon Ji Young who made it to the main rounds at Star Rise.

241
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,980
- What?
- You've got that.

242
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
An experience of trying your best.

243
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,070
You got to experience that.

244
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,660
How many people our age have been a trainee,

245
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,910
entered an audition program, and made it to the main rounds?

246
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,720
This is my final product.

247
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,390
I'll give it to you.

248
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,680
What should we do now?

249
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,640
What else? We're students, so we should study.

250
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,990
Studying doesn't suit me.

251
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,300
You're supposed to study even if it doesn't suit you.

252
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,230
I don't want to. Isn't there something else?

253
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,910
- Something else?
- Yeah.

254
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,990
Then read.

255
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,920
[Mode Real Estate Agency]

256
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,360
Thank you.

257
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,570
It's been a while.

258
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,140
I was shocked when I heard you were selling it again.

259
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,100
Something came up.

260
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,000
But I'm glad to hear someone is interested despite abruptly letting you know.

261
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,760
When the CEO said she was buying this factory,

262
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,520
there was actually someone else who wanted to buy it.

263
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,140
Oh, that's good.

264
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,490
But that person wanted it at a certain price.

265
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,770
It is a bit...

266
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,820
What was the price?

267
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,260
It was at half price.

268
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,410
Half price?

269
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,100
Yes.

270
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,650
He said he'd buy it if it was half the price that you two bought it for.

271
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,670
As you probably know, a factory like this doesn't have a market value.

272
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,730
At least he said that he can make the payment right away.

273
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,760
You should take that into account.

274
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,210
We've got three days left.

275
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,710
Hey! Bong Gyu!

276
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,380
Here, here, here.

277
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,810
Hey, why are you suddenly acting like we're buddies?

278
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,180
- Why did you ask to see me?
- Hey, your coffee is so tasty.

279
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,280
What's this?

280
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,940
Wow, I kept thinking about this taste.

281
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,950
Gosh, what did you put in this coffee?

282
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,070
- Hey.
- What?

283
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,330
- Bong Gyu.
- What?

284
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,190
Do you have money?

285
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,550
What?

286
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,470
I asked if you have some money?

287
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,460
Am I getting mugged? In my own cafe?

288
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,530
I'm not mugging you.

289
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,030
Please help me out.

290
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,940
We're trying to bring Yoo Jin Woo back,

291
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,680
but we're lacking a bit of money.

292
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,920
I hear you invest in various places, right?

293
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,810
You should invest in us. How about it?

294
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,610
Well, please invest in us.

295
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,620
Why would I?

296
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,550
You're right. Why would you invest in me when all I did was housework?

297
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,050
I don't even expect that of you.

298
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,590
But you should consider my wife, CEO Kang Su Hyeon.

299
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,790
You've heard from people at Pandora, right?

300
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,350
CEO Kang looks at the trainees' eyes to almost an excessive level.

301
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,660
Do you know why she does that?

302
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,610
I heard she's looking to see if they're a sociopath.

303
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,150
That's not it. It's not.

304
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,620
She did that even when I was at the company.

305
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,890
CEO Kang wants to see into the future of the trainees.

306
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,730
Rather than someone who can be profitable right away,

307
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,930
she chooses trainees who can sustain themselves after becoming adults.

308
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,360
She knows how to look that far ahead.

309
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,980
Even if we can't earn you a lot of money right away,

310
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,110
you won't regret it.

311
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,970
I'm telling you, you won't regret it.

312
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,700
Hey,

313
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,770
you know that Jang Hyeon Cheol is trying to take Yoo Jin Woo, too, right?

314
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,550
Do you know why?

315
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,440
He's determined that Yoo Jin Woo is profitable even though he's down and out.

316
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,750
He's an expert in that field.

317
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,180
He knows what happens at the bottom of the

318
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,330
entertainment world and where the money flows.

319
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,120
Though your offer seems interesting,

320
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,220
it doesn't seem like it'll be profitable right away.

321
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,550
Jang Hyeon Cheol's offer

322
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,380
seems risky but profitable immediately.

323
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,880
Bong Gyu...

324
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,480
Damn it.

325
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,090
Hello.

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,390
[Executive Producer: Kang Su Hyeon, Record Producer: Shim Jun Seok]

328
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,260
- Are you going to buy it?
- Geez, scared me!

329
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,470
- Will you buy that?
- Who are you?

330
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,400
Were you watching me here like this?

331
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,410
I was watching to see if anyone was buying my album.

332
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,850
I see that you're a big fan of mine.

333
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,250
Geez, it's not like that.

334
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,010
I really thought both my album and I would

335
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,360
be forgotten in a corner forever like this.

336
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,480
Let me ask you one thing.

337
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,900
- Why was it Kang Su Hyeon?
- Huh?

338
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,610
Did Kang Su Hyeon pay you more than other companies?

339
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,270
Were her conditions better?

340
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,370
What was your reason?

341
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,920
Because I liked her.

342
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,980
Gosh, that's it?

343
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,250
That's your reason?

344
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,760
You did business with her because you liked her?

345
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,120
This isn't business.

346
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,600
Then, what is it?

347
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,650
It's my life.

348
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,940
Su Hyeon was the only one who asked about my dream.

349
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,020
Being an executive producer is that kind of work.

350
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,610
Making someone's small, trivial

351
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,270
and unrealistic imagination a reality.

352
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,380
Even if money is important,

353
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,340
someone dreams a dream

354
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,690
and another makes that a reality.

355
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,700

If you, Park Yoon, and I all testify the same thing,

533
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,400
the police would have no choice but to investigate Yoo Jin Woo.

534
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,000
The moment he is investigated for drugs, Yoo Jin Woo and Kang Su Hyeon are finished.

535
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,510
Why didn't you tell me?

536
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,840
That the car accident was caused by Yoo Jin Woo.

537
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,100
Han Young.

538
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,350
What's left for you?

539
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,110
Money?

540
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,680
People?

541
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,620
If you care for Yoo Jin Woo,

542
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,320
do you think he'd take care of you for life?

543
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,480
Will an aspiring celebrity

544
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,060
take care of a friend going to jail for dealing drugs at a nightclub?

545
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:01,320
Bring me the CCTV files.

546
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,520
Got it.

547
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,200
- Follow him.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,410
Hyungnim.

549
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,800
Give me the CCTV files. The CEO is asking for them.

550
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,500
Get him!

551
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,180
Stop right there!

552
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,550
Hey!

553
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,950
Hey!

554
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,350
Damn it!

555
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,260
- Chase him.
- Okay.

556
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,410
Get him and bring him to me now!

557
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,730
Star Rise Producer Park was arrested.

558
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,860
He probably mentioned Jang Hyeon Cheol.

559
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,490

560
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,550
Yoo Jin Woo's car accident that you covered up?

561
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,140
What will you do now?

562
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,070
I will protect Jin Woo since he's my younger brother.

563
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,750
I don't abandon people like you-know-who.

564
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,300
No matter how CEO Jang tries to insist that it was Jin Woo's doing,

565
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,970
Park Yoon is a druggie, and CEO Jang is the suspect.

566
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,900
As long as I disappear, the police won't believe him.

567
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,270
Isn't this what you wanted to hear?

568
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,180
You only care about Yoo Jin Woo.

569
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,980
I'll disappear for a few years,

570
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,540
so don't worry.

571
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,590
You're wrong. I didn't come to hear this.

572
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,060
Didn't you come for Jin Woo?

573
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,480
I came for you.

574
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,340
Will you run away like this?

575
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,800
Jang Hyeon Cheol could frame you for it.

576
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,980
Things won't end by running away.

577
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,910
For me, Yoon Hee was like that.

578
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,360
It always haunts you if you don't face it properly.

579
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,070
- Turn yourself in.
- What?

580
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,990
I'll help you. With an attorney or anything else.

581
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,860
You want me to turn myself in?

582
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,880
After I was released at 19, do you...

583
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,750
do you know what I went through?

584
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,940
Like an abandoned dog...

585
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,730
I wandered near the company countless times, hoping they would take me back.

586
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,290
Since I didn't know how to do anything,

587
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,900
I endured curses and humiliation

588
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,750
to finally rise to be a manager at the bar. And now what?

589
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,440
Turn myself in?

590
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,430
Damn it.

591
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,270

592
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,350
All right.

593
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,030
I was wrong.

594
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,000
Sending you out into society when you hadn't even reached 20...

595

I will make things right now.

603
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,960

Jun Ho went to the military as soon as he was released.

He recently went on a military show.

656

He was a hit with people saying he was handsome.

So, he started his own YouTube channel.

658

And Sang Hyeok used to get in trouble all the time for not maintaining his diet.

659
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,560
Maybe he was obsessed with food because of that.

660
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,400
