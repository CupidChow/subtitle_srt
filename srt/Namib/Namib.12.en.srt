00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,060
My mom said you should go to school today.

185
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,490
Change into your uniform.

186
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,700
- What?
- Your uniform.

187
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,430
Yeah.

188
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,580

189
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,950

191
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,230
What are you doing?

192
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,380
- I'm studying.
- Studying what?

193
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,780
Yoo Jin Woo, there's a world that only students know that celebrities are unaware of.

194
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,180
Let's go.

195
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,130

Congratulations!

202
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,640
Let's take a picture together.

203
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
Come to the center!

204
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,980
Hurry up and get in!

205
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,800
Okay, okay! We're taking the picture!

206
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,420

207
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,100

Congratulations!

211
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,640
Oh, you're here, Yoo Jin Woo.

212
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,520
Shall we get started?

213
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,880
Yes.

214
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,760
Yoo Jin Woo, people are very curious about your song.

215
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,850
We are, too.

216
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,330
Let's do it.

217
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,380
Well, CEO Kim said he would resign.

218
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,150
Gosh, Kang Su Hyeon got kicked out, Jang Hyeon Cheol got fired,

219
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,770
and CEO Kim resigned.

220
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,780
Gosh, who should I hire as CEO for this company?

221
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,550
Chairman, how about you personally-

222
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,660
What, what? Are you crazy? Personally, do what?

223
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,300
Trying to make me experience disaster, too?

224
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,200
If things keep going like this, it will become a worthless burden.

225
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,540
I have to bring the trajectory upward somehow.

226
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,380
Well, do you have any candidates in mind?

227
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,210
Him.

228
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,810

229
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,220
Him!

230
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,140
We're not so close that we'd have chicken and beer together.

231
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,860
Is this your restaurant, too?

232
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,750
Yeah.

233
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,020
- Really?
- Obviously not.

234
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,620
It has good food. I'm a regular here.

235
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,650
Try it. It's good.

236
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,380
Wow, this is so good!

237
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,370
- Take some to go.
- I'll take three chickens to go, please.

238
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,980
Okay.

239
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,640
There are two boys living in my house.

240
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,790
Thanks.

241
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,990
For firing Hyeon Cheol.

242
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,130
I didn't do it for your benefit.

Hey, though I'm not interested, I have someone to recommend.

260
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,370
- Who is it?
- She's worked in the field for a long time

261
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,800
and she's well-known for producing results.

262
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,680
She's got charisma, so she can bring order to a chaotic company.

263
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,610
Who is it?

264
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,300
Kang Su Hyeon.

265
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,280
Bringing Kang Su Hyeon back to Pandora is the best solution.

266
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,860
Kang Su Hyeon...

267
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,710
just doesn't listen.

268
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,290
- You're right.
- She does whatever, and she's stubborn.

269
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,940
- Very accurate.
- She's a very burdensome CEO for investors.

270
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,090
Sometimes, I find her burdensome as well.

271
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,940
If I were to make Kang Su Hyeon the CEO,

272
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,370
someone will need to keep her in check next to her.

273
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,700
She can't be CEO by herself. We'll need at least a co-CEO.

274
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,760
Co-CEO?

275
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,880
Who would do it? Who?

276
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,390
Someone who will keep Kang Su Hyeon in check

277
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,300
and let the board of directors and me know about Kang Su Hyeon's actions.

278
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,990
Oh, you mean a puppet CEO who acts like a treacherous minister?

279

You think such a person exists? Goodness.

280
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,080
He does exist.

281
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,510
You. How about you become co-CEO with her

282
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,340
and report everything Kang Su Hyeon does?

283
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,260
Are you telling me to become a spy monitoring my own wife or what?

- You're perfect.
- I won't do it!

The song is being released at 6, right?

320
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,450
What rank does the song need to be considered a success?

321
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,200
It will be a big success if the song is anywhere near the top 100.

322
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,030
If it lands in the top 10,

323

then he'll get casting request calls from all over.

324
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,570
He can even potentially get first place on a music show.

366
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,590

What's this!

395
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,050
This song only hit 173rd place?

396
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,370
Was the song not good?

397
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,220
No, I think I just didn't sing it well.

398
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,940
173rd place isn't bad.

399
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,550
It's not bad?

400
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,630
Did you think you'd get first place?

00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,240
Okay.

She says it's not bad. By next week,

404
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,440
- it'll probably make it into the top 100.
- Okay.

405
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,500
Your song "Smile Again" is so good.

406
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,370
Please introduce the song to us.

407
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,150
"Smile Again" is a song with a positive message to many people,

408
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,010
saying that we can smile again

409
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,240
even if we are facing hardships and difficulties.

410
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,410
Yoo Jin Woo, you probably faced hardships and difficulties as well.

411
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,810
How did you overcome them?

412
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,480
I have people who place a lot of faith in me.

413
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,150
And when I look into their eyes,

414
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,990
I was able to cheer up and sing again.

415
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,580
Star Rise received a lot of love from the public.

416
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,090
Among all the contestants, I liked you the most, Jin Woo.

417
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,300
Jin Woo, when did you start dreaming of becoming a singer?

418
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,790
I think...

419
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,400
it happened quite naturally for me.

420
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,200
For me...

421
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,770
I am the happiest when I sing.

422
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,570
That's great. With that happiness in mind,

Of course!

It's so good. I listened to it all day yesterday.

00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,420
Oh, I guess you're right.

473
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,810
He's only getting started.

474
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,790
I've seen how you've developed Yoo Jin Woo, CEO.

475
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,450
How you left Pandora together

476
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,360
and you sold him to TA but then brought him back.

477
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,240
You made a big sacrifice to do so.

478
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,370
I can't imagine why you would do so.

479
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,540
Why would you make such a decision despite facing losses?

480
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,140
It's not possible to explain it

481
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,440
if you think about losses.

482
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,340
I'll ask you one more time.

483
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,040
Does your offer to me still stand?

484
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,800
Your offer to sell Yoo Jin Woo to me.

485
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,040
- Yes.
- After releasing Yoo Jin Woo's song,

486
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,640
what is your plan going forward?

487

I will send him to the best company in our nation.

488
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,140
You will send him away?

489
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,590
Great.

490
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,210
The potential he's shown in the audition process,

491
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,720
and how he's produced results despite hitting rock bottom...

492
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,640

[Party B will hand over all rights and receive 0 won as compensation.]

499
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,920
If I receive money, your company will feel pressure

500
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,740
to recoup the investment and the burden of having paid a large sum.

501
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,830
I will hand over Yoo Jin Woo to Mega Entertainment for no compensation.

502
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,970
The money you would've given me, give it to Yoo Jin Woo in the form of time.

Even if he loses his way for a bit,

504
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,950
give him time and wait for him.

505
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,190

You distributed 1,000 mg of opioids, right?

509
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,920
This pertains to the possession, trafficking, and facilitation of drugs,

510
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,870
as well as aiding and abetting drug use.

511

Do you know that?

512
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,060
We have evidence and the victim's testimony, so there's no point in denying it.

513
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,440
Yes, I did it.

514
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,540

You know this man, right?

518
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,660
Is he also claiming to be a victim as well?

519
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,320
- No.
- At B Club in Cheongdam-dong,

520
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,450
a female college student lost consciousness.

521
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,620
You won't be able to catch him.

522
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,150
Even if he kills someone,

523
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,260
even if he's found with drugs all over his body,

524
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,670
he always gets away.

525
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,810
Things will be different this time.

526
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,150
The victim is a former trainee from Mega Entertainment.

527
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,670
The CEOs of entertainment agencies made this incident public

528
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,490
and requested prosecutors to investigate it.

529
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,450
CEO Kang Su Hyeon, in particular, led this effort.

530
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,300
She told me to meet with you,

531
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,020
saying ten years ago,

532
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,100
you lost a family member from the same method.

533
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,930
I heard she told your attorney that she's requesting an investigation.

534
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,990
I guess you didn't hear about it.

535
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,490
Please tell me...

536
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,340

Unni, you're here?

713
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:55,780
The music teacher is here.

714
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,630
Aigoo, her boyfriend is also here.

715
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,010
Hey, we'll need to bring two more glasses!

716
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,580
You're here to eat this time, right?

717
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,380
Yes, I'll be eating.

718
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,710
- I also brought a guest.
- What?

719
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,410
Merry Christmas!

720
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,510
Yoo Jin Woo!

721
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,190
Hey, Yoo Jin Woo!

722
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,790
Hey, your face is just shining nowadays.

723
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,620
- Hello.
- Hey, go and ask him about his contract.

724
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,730
Shut up.

725
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,550
Hey, you bought our presents, right?

726
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,370
Hey, you look more fit!

727
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,510
- Come on. Hello, hello.
- When did you get back?

728
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,910
- Hey, what's this?
- How are you?

729
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,740
His face has gotten so much more handsome

730
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,940
- after going overseas.
- How did you come here?

731
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,630
Oh, it's snowing!

732
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,800
How did you come today?

733
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,380
My schedule got canceled, so I came back early.

734
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,790
You sure it wasn't because you missed us?

735
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,170
A little?

736
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,500
But where's the CEO?

737
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,600
Wasn't she supposed to come back for this Christmas?

738
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, I came here to see the CEO, too.

739
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,050
I don't know, either.

740
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,400
- You don't know?
- But I guess she is alive at least.

741
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,540
She calls me sometimes.

742
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,530
Not too long ago, she said she was in Southeast Asia.

743
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,850
What are you saying?

744
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,940
Not too long ago, she said she was at Mt. Everest.

745
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,590
- What!
- That's weird.

746
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,900
She said she was studying in a library when I talked to her recently.

747
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,540
What is she really up to?

748
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,830
I'm the only one she didn't call...

749
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,810
I'm sure you'll hear from her at some point.

750
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:27,960
Let's have a drink.

751
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,160
Yeah, let's have a drink.

752
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,550
All right, let's drink!

753
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,140
These guys are drinking it up.

754
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,580
You two should get married already.

755
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,730
You guys look good together.

756
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:44,820
What are you saying!

757
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,310
Today is the last supper, the last supper!

758
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,520
Let's just eat, drink, and forget about the rest.

762
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:06,040
<i>Is it because you were an idol trainee?</i>

763
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,130
We have a special guest, Yoo Jin Woo, on set with me today.

764
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,550
We've discussed how his ten years as a trainee,

765
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,570
his audition program appearance, and his debut.

766
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,390
This is the final question.

767
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:28,510
What is one thing you heard that encouraged you the most to reach this point?

768
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:36,430
I think hearing that I was her best protege

769
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,210
encouraged me the most.

770
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:43,120
Who are you referring to by "her"?
