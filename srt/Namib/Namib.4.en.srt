00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,870
it's not that I don't understand why my mom is trying to buy me a factory.

Still, I don't want it.

- What?
- What do you want to do?

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,030
Gosh, I guess your family is really rich.

To buy you a factory just because she wants to.

192
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,850
We're not rich. We're probably broke since we spent so much money on my treatment.

193
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,480
Then, how would she afford a factory?

It looks like your family has a lot to worry about.

Where do you go in the evenings?

There's a place called Muse. It's a nightclub.

Why would you go there?

200
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,980
To earn some money.

201
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,670
Since your mom could abandon me, too.

00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,970
Abandon you?

203
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,970
It's pretty common in our field.

204
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,140
And I'm pretty used to being abandoned, anyway.

205
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,450
You see, I have a debt of 200 million to my name,

206
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,600
and your mom took over that debt.

207
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,170
But if your mom abandons me, that debt will come back to me again.

208
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,620
that debt will come back to me again.

Oh, that?

Well, about that... So...

213

In the process of negotiation, many words were exchanged, and...

219
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,950
I'm sure it's pretty obvious,

220
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,350
but singing is the most important thing at an audition.

221
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,840
But, even while singing, what the audience responds to the most is the high notes.

222
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,400
Singing high notes stably is about your breathing.

223
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,850
You have to keep your breathing very low.

224
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:28,560
So, the song you will sing with stable high notes through ordered breathing is...

But he says he feels better when he harms himself.

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,090
He feels better?

341
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,790
He says he needs to cause himself pain

to grow calmer and be able to breathe.

343
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,010
He knows he shouldn't do that.

344
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,840
So he tries to hold himself back as much as he can,

345
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,090
and when he can't hold back any longer,

346
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,320
he starts doing weird things.

Could I do that?

You improve much faster when you practice with others.

360
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,510
Okay.

<i>There's nothing like performing for an audience to make up for lack of experience.</i>

The pitch is important,

365
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,950
but the story in the song is also very important.

You have to always sing with sincerity.

Only then will the audience open their hearts to you.

372
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,260
All right. Close your eyes now.

373

I've made up my mind.

There are words that come to mind when I look at Yoo Jin Woo.

There's a song with those words as its title.

We need to start the negotiations for RAID's contract renewal.

Regarding RAID,

425
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,380
increase their overseas tour so they bring in

426
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,590
more profit before their contract expires.

427
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,640
I'll personally handle their contract renewal meeting.

428

For something as important as contract renewal, I should-

429
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,060
All enterprises that don't net a profit will be eliminated.

430
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,280
We will depart from former CEO Kang Su Hyeon's dogmatic decisions and judgments.

431
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,450
We'll activate the company's system

432
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:41,310

438
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,650

I mean...

441
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
don't get the wrong idea.

442
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,050
I didn't look into it because I'm interested in Kang Su Hyeon.

443
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,730
Just take that into consideration.

444
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,960
Yoo Jin Woo?

445
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,590

446
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,080
Y-Yes, that's right.

447
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,230
She took a mediocre kid who was here for 10 years?

448
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,500
