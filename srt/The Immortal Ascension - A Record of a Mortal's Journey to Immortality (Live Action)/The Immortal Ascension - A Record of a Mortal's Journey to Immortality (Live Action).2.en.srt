Isn't it odd?

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,810
We've been living with Master all this while

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,300
and we never knew he knew martial arts.

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,730
Everyone has their secrets.

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,050
We didn't tell him

30
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,580
about the Green Vial either.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,810
He treats you like his own son.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,210
Why are you doubting him?

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,770
I've been practicing

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,740

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,490
I was punched. I was in pain.

36
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,850
And I never complain.

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,530
That's different.

38
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,130
He killed someone.

Wu Yan was in the Wild Wolves Gang.

40
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,410
He betrayed Seven Mysteries Sect.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,130
He deserves death.

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,900
Besides, Master did it to save you.

43
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,050
That doesn't even make sense.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,500
Am I that important?

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,900
Of course.

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,730
Master has reserved the best for you.

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,860

Are you leaving the mountain for real?

55
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,690
Your lack of progress

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,620
is tied to the herb's inefficiency.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,380
I have thought about it

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,410
and decided to find better herbs for you.

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,620
But are you sure you're well enough to do this?

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,490

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,130
Your condition puzzles me.

83
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,610
I can only seal your pressure points

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,660
with my needles for the moment.

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,690
Did you ingest any herbs previously?

86

This?

88

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,130
But the caveat

100
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,500
is that it costs your life

101
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,660
and comes with detrimental side effects.

102
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,730
You should stop taking these pills.

103

If you continue,

104
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,610
you'll have at most ten years left to live.

105
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,140

I won't tell anyone.

136
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,700

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,490

We'll meet here.

141

142
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,170
It's a promise.

Why are you sweating so much?

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,490
I ran back for the food.

The food is ready.

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,340

You're awake.

159
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,370
You sat here for one whole day.

160
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,060
Did you know that?

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,180
You've been sitting here since last morning

162
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,890
when I left to gather wood.

163
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,220
When I came back for lunch,

I slept.

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,300
And when I woke up, you were still here.

167
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,530
You were like a statue.

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,650
If I hadn't checked your breathing,

169
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,370
I would have thought you were dead.

170
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,100
That long?

171
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,180
I reheated

172
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,890
the food several times.

173
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,300
I don't lie.

174
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,530
Time flies.

175
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,460
I merely had a dream.

176
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,100
I think Master is back.

177
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,100
Let me see.

180
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,980
Why am I not hungry?

181
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,130
Is it because of the mantra?

182
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,940
They say only immortals don't get hungry.

Quick.

190
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,650
I can't heal.

191
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,340

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,220
Master!

194
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,130
Master!

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,770
Hurry up!

196
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,460
Han Li!

197
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,890
Quick!

198
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,370
Get me some water.

199
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,940
Master.

200
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,610
Caihuai,

201
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,250
is that you?

202
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,010
Master,

203
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,530
it's me.

204
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,530
I'm Han Li.

205
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,460
You'll be fine.

206
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,220
You'll be fine.

207
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,700
I...

208
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,300
You just have to take some medicine.

209
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,060
I...

210
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,580
Master.

211
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Han Li.

212
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,940
I'm here.

213
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,820
- Han Li. - I'm here.

214
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,770
I'm here.

215
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,060
Master,

216
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,940
you're hurting me.

217
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,340
Oh, my.

218
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,420
You have ascended to Tier 3 of the Longevity Art.

219
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,120
[Longevity Art, Tier 3]

220
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,980
I didn't know that.

221
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,340
When I was training,

222
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,420
something got into me.

223
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,460
I had a dream.

224
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,940
In that dream,

225
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,250
there was a vortex on my tummy

226
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,460
that could absorb spiritual aura from my surroundings.

227
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,370
That's

228
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,490
Tier 3?

229
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,180
My child,

230
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,610
that is not a dream.

231
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,660
Zhang Tie!

232
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,130
Go

233
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,300
to the herb cabinet.

234
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,250
Third row,

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,100
second column from the left.

236
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,130
There's a white vial inside a small box.

237
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,100
Bring it to me.

238
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,340
Yes!

239
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,940
That's not a dream.

240
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,130
That's not a dream.

241
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,100
My child,

242
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,890
the day has come.

243
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,250
I'm so happy.

244
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,700
That's meditation.

245
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,130
That's inner eye.

246
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,820
My hard work has paid off.

247
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,610
The day has...

248
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,610
Great.

249
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,890
Bone Agony Pill?

250
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,100
Even Li Feiyu knows

251
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,610
how detrimental it can be.

252
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,610
Surely Master knows too.

253
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,250
Master.

254
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,820
My disciple.

255
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,940
My beloved disciple.

256
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,460
Han Li.

257
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,010
My hard work has paid off.

258
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,100
It has paid off.

259
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,650
The greed in his eyes

260
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,940
is unsettling.

261
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,340
It's as if

262
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,010
he's not looking at a human being,

263
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,220
but an object.

264
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,420
You sure are punctual, Han Li.

265
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,100
The hour of Wu three days later.

266
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,130
It is precisely the hour of Wu now.

267
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,340
This will last for a month.

268
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,220
That's all?

269
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,680
I

270
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,180
have run out of herbs.

271
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,890
I need time to gather the rest.

272
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,940
So be it.

273
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,010
Thank you, Han Li.

274
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,940
What is the meaning of this?

275
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,700
This concoction

276
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,980
uses rhinoceros horns as base.

277
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,700
I won't count the other costs.

278
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,460
Just give me two taels.

279
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,300
Can I pay you next month?

280
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,980
If you don't have money,

281
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,250
you can give me something else.

282
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,130
You do

283
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,700
have a fancy blade.

284
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,980
Not this blade.

285
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,730
What about a favor then?

286
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,890
A favor again.

287
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,730
If you need help, come to me.

288
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,890
I'll

289
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,820
help you.

290
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,220
Why

291
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,650
are you taking the pills?

292
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,610
You need an edge if you want a place

293
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,180
in the martial arts world.

294
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,060
I used to think that life is short.

295
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,060
I would rather fight for the present and not for a legacy.

296
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,010
The pills can give me what I want.

297
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,220
My health is a worthy sacrifice.

298
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,890
But now, I...

299
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,250
Well, forget it.

300
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,770
Thank you for the concoction.

301
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,610
See you next month.

302
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,530
Fight for the present

303
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,730
and not for a legacy.

304
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,770
What does Master want then?

305
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,890
Master!

306
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,490
The pot is here.

307
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,100
Master,

308
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,730
I spent the whole afternoon

309
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,130
looking for a pot.

310
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,890
They said no need to return it to them this soon.

311
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,220
Just return it to them once we're done.

312
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:01,980
Master,

313
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,820
let me cook

314
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,130
some of your favorite tofus.

315
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,250
Sure.

316
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,370
You're so thoughtful, Zhang Tie.

317
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,180
Why don't the three of us

318
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,890
have a toast together?

319
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,220
Sure.

320
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,220
Master,

321
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,340
take care of your health.

322
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,530
Just one sip.

323
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,890
It won't kill me.

324
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,610
Let me fill the bowl for Master.

325
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,010
Then, for Han Li.

326
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,180
I'll have one too.

327
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,580
On behalf of Zhang Tie and me,

328
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,820
we raise our bowls

329
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,650
to wish Master a life of longevity.

330
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,580
May you live

331
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,980
to one hundred years old.

332
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,420
One hundred years old?

333
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,700
I'm happy to see another day.

334
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,250
Master.

335
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,530
Come.

336
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,820
Master.

337
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,100
Allow me to say a toast.

338
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,490
It's my fourth year here in the valley.

339
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,010
You taught me Mammoth Skin

340
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,980
and many things.

341
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,060
You even allowed me to clear my debt.

342
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,010
I...

343
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,100
I'm not good with words.

344
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,850
Let this toast speak for itself.

345
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,250
Why do I feel dizzy?

346
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,890
Master.

347
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,010
Excuse him.

348
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,180
Bring him back.

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm sick of coddling him

350
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,980
like a child.

351
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,050
Let's go.

352
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,860
Master,

353
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,490
I'll be back soon.

354
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,380
Where is Master?

355
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,010
Master.

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,770
If you don't see me

357
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,220
tomorrow morning,

358
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,940
[If you don't see me...]
leave the mountain at once.

359
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,530
Do not return.

360
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,420
Zhang Tie.

361
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,810
Zhang Tie.

362
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,980
Master.

363
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,620
Today,

364
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,380
you

365
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,700
will read my pulse.

366
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,810
Your pulse is disorderly,

367
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,140
as if there are two qis circulating in your body.

368
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,660
Wherever they go,

369
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,730
they damage your Meridian system.

370
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,420
If I may comment,

371
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,570
based on your pulse,

372
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,810
you...

373
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,380
My days are numbered

374
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,660
unless I find a cure.

375
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,810
I know

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,220
better than you

377
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,860
how fragile my health is.

378
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,290
Come, my child.

379
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,290
On this special occasion,

380
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,490
I am delighted to know

381
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,330
that you've made progress.

382
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,140
Hence,

383
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,460
I

384
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,140
would like

385
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,810
to be honest with you.

386
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,940
Time waits for no one.

387
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,980
Black hair can turn into white in an instant.

388
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,010
Guess how old I am.

389
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,490
Around

390
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,980
sixty

391
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,010
or seventy years old.

392
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,820
[Thirty]

393
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,940
[Thirty Seven]

394
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,810
37 after the new year.

395
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,050
You don't trust me?

396
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,050
Well,

397
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,660
you can ask the third uncle

398
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,660
of that outer disciple of Seven Mysteries Sect.

399
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,380
He must have heard

400
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,490
of Wondrous Hands,

401
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,700
Mo Juren of Lanzhou.

402
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,940
I am

403
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,180
Mo Juren.

404
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,730
Back then,

405
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,660
I was as young as you.

406
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,620
There was no ailment

407
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,340
I couldn't cure

408
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,770
and no toxin I couldn't remove.

409
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,860
Alas,

410
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,810
I can save everyone else

411
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,620
but me.

412
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,420
I was hurt by despicable beings.

413
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,460
My knowledge

414
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,330
keeps me alive.

415
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,530
But this broken body

416
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,330
can never recover!

417
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,660
Master,

418
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,770
you need to stop taking Bone Agony Pills.

419
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,250
It makes you feel better immediately

420
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,490
but it can never cure your condition.

421
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,810
If you continue taking it,

422
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,620
you...

423
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,090
I know.

424
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,460
The pills

425
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,730
can only give me one more year.

426
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,090
But the heavens are on my side.

427
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,490
I have found

428
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,010
a cure.

429
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,530
Which is?

430
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,090
You.

431
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,220
Me?

432
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,730
Only you

433
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,660
can save me.

434
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,460
I've raised you for so long.

435
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,220
It's time for you to return the favor!

436
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,570
Calm down.

437
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,530
Calm down.

438
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,250
Calm down.

439
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,860
Han Li.

440
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,010
You've been asking me

441
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,700
what the purpose of the mantra is.

442
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,980
I'll give you the answer now.

443
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,770
In effect,

444
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,940
I need

445
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,570
the qi of a Tier 4 cultivator

446
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,460
using that mantra

447
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,860
to stimulate my hidden pressure points.

448
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,980
That

449
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,420
will cure my condition.

450
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,980
Not only will it remove the toxin in me,

451
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,380
it also

452
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,220
restores my youth.

453
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,330
That's why you picked me.

454
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,700
Is that so?

455
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,770
Not me.

456
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,380
That mantra picked you.

457
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,730
Only the fated ones

458
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,730
can cultivate the mantra.

459
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,730
Even I cannot.

460
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,530
Before you came,

461
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,420
I had tens of disciples.

462
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,290
None of them was as fortunate as you.

463
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,220
Had you not appeared,

464
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,900
I would have

465
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,700
accepted my demise.

466
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,290
Everyone dies eventually.

467
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,770
But we crossed paths.

468
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,090
I will seize

469
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,290
this second chance at life.

470
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,180
Anyone else would have done the same.

471
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,050
So,

472
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,490
cure my condition

473
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,090
and you

474
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,460
can have everything in this valley.

475
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,900
What is it?

476
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,140
You agreed to everything when you asked to be my disciple.

477
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,530
You're regretting it now?

478
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,460
I will not

479
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,250
lie or betray you.

480
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,010
But why

481
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,460
have you never told me about this?

482
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,010
You have read many scrolls in the past.

483
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,980
Let me teach you

484
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,900
a few more.

485
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,140
Hide cleverness with clumsiness.

486
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,940
Do good with discretion.

487
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,700
Stay pure in this world of darkness.

488
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,700
Treat concession as a way to advance.

489
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,980
That's my motto.

490
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,460
There are certain things

491
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,940
that if I

492
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,730
tell you upfront,

493
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,900
you won't stay here loyally like you do now.

494
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,530
And if I fail to ascend to Tier 4?

495
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,330
You know how hard

496
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,570
it is to cultivate.

497
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,460
It took me two years to get

498
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,660
from Tier 2 to Tier 3.

499
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,730
And I'm stagnating now.

500
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,490
Getting to Tier 4 in a year is harder

501
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,010
than being an immortal.

502
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,980
Enough.

503
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,140
Do you think we're negotiating now?

504
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,530
Continue cultivating as usual.

505
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,810
I'll find those precious herbs for you.

506
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,980
And don't mention

507
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,570
this again.

508
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,940
Like I said,

509
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,330
get to Tier 4

510
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,570
within a year.

511
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,290
Hide cleverness with clumsiness.

512
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,420
Do good with discretion.

513
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,050
Stay pure in this world of darkness.

514
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,250
Treat concession as a way to advance.

515
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,940
That's my motto.

516
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,380
Zhang Tie.

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,180
- Wake up. - The dumpling is delicious.

518
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,730
That's all

519
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,250
you ever think of.

520
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,050
I finally

521
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,660
have the full picture now.

522
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm thinking

523
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,810
that after I get

524
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,490
to Tier 4 next year,

525
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,180
I'll cure Master's condition.

526
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,180
Then, we leave Shenshou Valley

527
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,700
and open an apothecary.

528
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,290
We'll live

529
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,380
a comfortable life.

530
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,860
Right?

531
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,900
He has grown wary.

532
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,010
It took me a while to reassure him last night.

533
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,770
It's over

534
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,420
if he runs away.

535
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,900
Let me

536
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,730
take over his body

537
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,250
right away.

538
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,330
No!

539
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,180
Why not?

540
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,940
He's not strong enough for you to take over yet.

541
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,220
Do you want to be like me?

542
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,700
Formless?

543
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,700
You don't have time to find another disciple

544
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,250
who can practice the Longevity Art.

545
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,700
So we wait?

546
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,290
You can feel

547
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,730
that this body has run its course.

548
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,140
You can't carry on?

549
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,900
But carry on you must.

550
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,810
I am an Immortal disciple.

551
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,620
Do you expect me

552
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,420
to die

553
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,180
with a mortal like you?

554
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,250
So we wait

555
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,140
for a year maximum.

556
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,490
I will take him, whether he has reached

557
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,290
Tier 4 or not.

558
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,530
Who's there?

559
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,220
Zhang Tie.

560
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,290
Zhang Tie!

561
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,420
Master.

562
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,140
Come in.

563
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,730
Master,

564
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,980
where is Zhang Tie?

565
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,530
Zhang Tie?

566
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,330
He didn't tell you he left the mountain?

567
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,570
He left the mountain?

568
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,330
He asked ten taels from me and said

569
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,180
that he would leave the mountain for a while.

570
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,900
Impossible.

571
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,290
He always lets me know where he goes.

572
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,860
I came clean to you just now.

573
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,530
Why would I lie to you?

574
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,620
Zhang Tie never leaves without a word.

575
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,380
And if he truly has left the mountain,

576
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,420
surely you know

577
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,460
where he is going.

578
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,460
If you won't tell me,

579
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,290
I'll find him myself.

580
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,420
As expected from a Tier 3 cultivator.

581
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,730
You sensed my actions.

582
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,290
My herbs have not gone to waste.

583
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,460
I just want

584
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,050
to read your pulse.

585
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,380
Come,

586
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,780
my dear disciple.

587
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,010
I want

588
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,740
to speak with you.

589
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,940
Okay?

590
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,340
You

591
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,780
have been here for a while.

592
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,490
Do you miss home?

593
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,570
You once told me that you missed your sister

594
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,820
from Qingniu Town.

595
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,300
Master,

596
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,690
let's not beat around the bush.

597
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,490
Just say

598
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,940
that you

599
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,490
need my help.

600
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,050
That's all.

601
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,210
I can't do many things,

602
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,900
but I know to be grateful.

603
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,820
Why are you doing this to me?

604
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,210
You are smart,

605
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,940
prudent,

606
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,690
and can't be controlled.

607
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,170
But you care too much.

608
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,210
And that

609
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,570
is the greatest weakness we share.

610
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,940
This is precisely why I don't want you

611
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,860
to see Zhang Tie.

612
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,300
Like I said,

613
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,940
if you can save me,

614
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,210
I'll promise you a life of riches.

615
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,090
Let's have a wager.

616
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,490
Let's see who dies first.

617
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,340
Me,

618
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,610
you,

619
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,170
or the ones you hold dear?

620
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,490
Fine.

621
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,740
I'll reach Tier 4 in a year

622
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,260
and cure you.

623
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,420
Then, you tell me where Zhang Tie is.

624
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,610
Also,

625
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,090
the herbs you bring back are running out.

626
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,610
I need more.

627

Focus on your cultivating.

628
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,130
I'll handle

629
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,300
the herbs for you.

630
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,380
Halt!

631
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,050
Take this.

632
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,340
Won't you ask what it is?

633
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,490
Why should I?

634
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,170
Remember

635
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,570
what you promised me today next year.

636
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,260
As expected,

whatever bond between us

638
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,860
disappears after that day.

639
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,570
It can never turn back to the way it was.

640
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,340
And now,

641
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,010
Physician Mo has dropped all pretense.

642
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,130
He often left to gather herbs.

643
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,610
And when he returned,

644
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,860
he looked weaker than before.

645
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,650
How did it become like this?

646
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,460
Or perhaps,

647
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,740
it has always been like this.

648
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,380
Those carefree years in the past

649
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,260
seemed like an illusion.

650
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,690
I've tried many ways

651
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,570
but I failed to remove toxin he laid.

652
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,610
It seems like I'll just have to attain Tier 4.

653
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,130
But

654
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,340
this is a tall order.

655

00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,090
I will find you

drink it?

664
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,900
Oh, no.

677
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,900
Is it because of the liquid?

If the diluted solution

679
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,460
has this effect,

680
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,340
let's try the undiluted solution.

681
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,380
This...

This liquid

686
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,780
must have something to do with those mutations.

687
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,170
Animals can't take it.

688
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,740
But it can be used on herbs to speed up

their growth.

690
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,170
However, there isn't a lot of liquid.

00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,420
I can dilute it with water like

to around three hundred years old should be enough.

709
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,460
If I follow the pill recipes in the book and make them into pills,

00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,130
doesn't mean it's easy.

773
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,900
It took me five years

774
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,170
to master it roughly.

775
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:29,940
I don't have much time,

776
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,980
but I'm willing to learn from you.

777
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,420
It seems like I have to demonstrate a few tricks myself

778
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,210
to convince you otherwise.

779
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,420
Look carefully.

780
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:12,940
At this point,

781
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,010
I am not gullible enough to believe

782
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:16,610
that Physician Mo will spare me

783
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,900
once I attain Tier 4

784
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,340
and cure him.

785
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,570
I need a way

786
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,690
to defend myself should the situation call for it.
