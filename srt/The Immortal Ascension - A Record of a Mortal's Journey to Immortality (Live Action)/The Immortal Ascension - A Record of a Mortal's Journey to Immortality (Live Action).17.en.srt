25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,310
Something's wrong!

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,050
Han!

27
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,100
Miss Mo!

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,420
What happened?

29
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,370
We need to get out of the city.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,580
Someone's after us.

31
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,650
I know an old waterway that leads outside.

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,690
I'll take you there.

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,690
It's this way.

34
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,260
Han...

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,650
Why did it suddenly get so dark?

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,580
Han.

37
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,050
This path

38
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,650
was something

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,300
a patient once told me about.

40
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,620
It leads right out of the city.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,540
Why's it a dead end?

42
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:57,980
Step back!

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,820
Don't get hurt!

44
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,180
I'm Dong Xuan'er.

45
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,980
What's your name?

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,980
Mo Caihuan.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm a friend of Han Li's.

48
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,020
A friend?

49
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,490
When did you two become friends?

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,380
A long time ago.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,130
No wonder he never mentioned you.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,740
We haven't seen each other in years.

53
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,820
I just ran into him.

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,330
I wish I had someone to watch fireworks with too.

55
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,460
Move on!

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,330
They're catching up!

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,260
There's light up ahead!

58
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,980
Sirs,

59
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,780
you must've heard by now

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,260
the fall

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,220
of Jiang and Cheqi Kingdoms.

62
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,220
The demonic sects have been quiet for years.

63
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,060
But this time,

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,380
they're really here.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,260
I heard

66
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,070
those royal families

67
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,610
were secretly learning cultivation,

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,730
trying to become cultivators.

69
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,410
They broke the rule barring royals from cultivation.

70
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,850
The demonic sects acted,

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,890
and maybe they had a reason.

72
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,410
What's the point

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,690
of fighting over scraps?

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,850
Righteous or demonic,

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,690
why should our Seven Sects

76
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,260
get dragged into this mess?

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,850
If we provoke the demonic sects,

78
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,610
they may come after us next.

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,850
Exactly.

80
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,980
Everyone,

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,380
since we

82
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,940
were all invited here by Hongfu,

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,890
let's hear what she has to say.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,220
I heard a Nascent Soul cultivator

85
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,010
is involved in this fight.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,730
Yes,

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,940
someone from the Joyful Union Sect,

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,940
Grandmaster Yunlu.

89
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,450
Grandmaster Yunlu?

90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,820
You old geezers, what's that look for?

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,220
Talk business if you must,

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,730
but keep your eyes off my senior!

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,890
All of you,

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,660
I didn't call

95
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,340
this meeting.

96
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,570
Nangong Wan from Moonshadow Sect did.

97
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,690
What?

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,850
Yan Clan Stronghold sided with the enemy?

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,170
I saw it with my own eyes!

100
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,780
Inside Yan Clan Stronghold,

101
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,410
they activated two grand arrays.

102
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,130
Not just to block detection,

103
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,290
they were meant to trap

104
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,690
every Seven Sect disciple

105
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,220
attending the wedding inside the city.

106
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,060
On the surface, it was a wedding feast.

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,130
But in truth,

108
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,450
Yan Clan worked with the demon sects

109
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,410
to set us up.

110
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,290
This...

111
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,290
this can't be true.

112
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,450
I didn't dare delay.

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,410
As soon as I realized it,

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,890
I rushed back to report.

115
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,050
I should've seen it coming.

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,410
Yan Clan Stronghold is right on the border,

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,290
next to the Jiang Kingdom.

118
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,050
Yan Ruyan's wedding,

119
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,490
and what happened to Qing...

120
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,410
With so many red flags,

121
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,980
how did I miss them?

122
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,120
You've been more than cautious, Grandmaster.

123
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,720
If you hadn't warned me

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
to keep an eye on the demonic sects,

125
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,740
I wouldn't have gone

126
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,350
to investigate Yan Clan Stronghold.

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,490
The Seven Sects are still in the dark.

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:19,980
Come.

129
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,980
We're going to Yellow Maple Valley.

130
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,580
Yellow Maple Valley?

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,100
They're holding a meeting there now.

132
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,930
I want you to tell them everything you know,

133
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,930
start to finish,

134
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,250
every last detail.

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,490
Let's move.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,410
Han!

137
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,460
My powers are back!

138
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,460
We must be outside the array now.

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,100
Move on!

140
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,570
He's on us!

141
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,780
You two, leave!

142
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,140
We're surrounded by open land.

143
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,020
We won't outrun him.

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,340
Miss Mo, you leave first!

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,730
Han and I will hold him off!

146
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,020
Then you two...

147
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,780
Go! Now!

148
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,850
Hurry!

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,930
Stay safe!

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,580
Junior,

151
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,850
we meet again!

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,460
You fiend!

153
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,610
Why do you keep coming after me?

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,900
Boy from Yellow Maple Valley,

155
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,780
I underestimated you before.

156
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,930
State your identity!

157
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,170
I don't kill nobodies!

158
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,730
Li Feiyu,

159
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,700
disciple of Yellow Maple Valley.

160
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,220
Nothing worth bragging about.

161
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,900
Li Feiyu?

162
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,020
You keep ruining my plans!

163
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,250
Looks like you're a standout

164
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,290
from that shabby sect after all?

165
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,220
With how clueless you are,

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,850
you dare speak like a real master?

167
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,660
Let me set you straight.

168
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,140
In Yellow Maple Valley, Core cultivators are common,

169
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,460
and Foundation cultivators are everywhere.

170
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,610
I'm just a nobody myself.

171
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,250
But taking you down?

172
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,100
A piece of cake!

173
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,930
Nice.

174
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,930
This blood mist can regenerate!

175
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,730
Run!

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,050
Die!

177
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,140
Fly up!

178
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,580
No one's getting away!

179
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,420
Head back!

180
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,530
We need to escape before the array seals off!

181
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,850
Still trying to run?

182
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,610
The flying talismans burn out fast!

183
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,890
I can't hold on much longer!

184
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,730
I've got one talisman left.

185
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll send you out!

186
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,100
What about you?

187
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,460
I'll figure something out!

188
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,850
At least she's safe.

189
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,660
If my elders ask,

190
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,180
I'll have an answer.

191
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,970
Don't die!

192
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,490
You have to come back alive!

193
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,290
All right then,

194
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,060
I'll keep you company for a bit.

195
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,260
So tell me,

196
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,970
how do you want to die?

197
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,410
Running into you today,

198
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,730
looks like I've lost this round.

199
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,330
What happened in the Bloody Trial Ground

200
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,290
was your doing too, right?

201
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,650
Recruiting spies from the Seven Sects,

202
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,690
and stealing from Yan Clan Stronghold,

203
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,500
you've got quite the operation going.

204
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,500
What's your next move?

205
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,610
At least let me die knowing the plan.

206
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,940
Cut the crap.

207
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,730
You think I don't see through you?

208
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,780
You're just buying time for those two women

209
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,860
to get away.

210
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,290
You think I'm an idiot?

211
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,820
Wow, you're real clever.

212
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,250
Kid,

213
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,220
time to die!

214
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,940
Seriously?

215
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,090
You need this much firepower for one guy?

216
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,850
Luckily,

217
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,020
he's huge,

218
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,900
but clumsy.

219
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,900
I can still take him.

220
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,410
My Cyan Mirror...

221
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh no!

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,410
It can't hold on!

223
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,340
You came loaded with artifacts!

224
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,460
Azure Drake Banner!

225
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,340
Go!

226
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,030
Cyan Sword Technique!

227
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,340
His cultivation's above mine.

228
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,340
I can't go head-to-head!

229
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,500
What is this?

230
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,780
So flashy and useless.

231
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,340
Get over here!

232
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,570
Blood Spirit Spell, Form Ten...

233
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,180
Blood Burst!

234
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,340
Too bad!

235
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,810
Got you at last!

236
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,940
Now die!

237
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,660
No,

238
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,980
this smoke is toxic...

239
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,250
That Azure Smoke

240
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,890
is made from Blackflood Drake venom.

241
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,810
I earned it

242
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,770
back in the Bloody Trial Ground!

243
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,210
You really have

244
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,300
no shame!

245
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,660
With someone like you,

246
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,770
any method is fair game.

247
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,570
You're...

248
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,010
you're even more demonic than I am!

249
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,890
Well played, Li Feiyu...

250
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,690
I won't forget this!

251
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,620
I finally drove him off.

252
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,810
Any longer,

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,660
I'd be in trouble too.

254
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,450
This is a Core elder discussion.

255
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,620
You brought a Foundation disciple here?

256
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,890
Is that really appropriate?

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,300
This is Xuan Yue,

258
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,940
my disciple.

259
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,770
He's been handling our contact with Yan Clan Stronghold.

260
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,860
Now we know

261
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,860
they're a serious problem.

262
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,450
Now tell everyone

263
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,330
what you know.

264
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,180
Sirs,

265
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,210
I saw it myself.

266
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,740
Yan Clan Stronghold

267
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,130
teamed up with the demonic sects

268
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,300
to set a trap.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,620
All the Seven Sect disciples at the wedding

270
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,010
were sealed and killed inside the city.

271
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,300
What?

272
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,570
All of them died?

273
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,500
What are you saying?

274
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,130
That can't be true!

275
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,210
The demonic sects

276
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,860
never planned to spare Yue Kingdom.

277
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,690
They struck Yan Clan Stronghold today,

278
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,420
but tomorrow it can be all Seven Sects!

279
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,860
Xuan'er...

280
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,330
Yan!

281
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,530
Yan!

282
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,180
Yan, you're awake!

283
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,090
Father?

284
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,420
Father!

285
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,940
You're finally awake!

286
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,860
I...

287
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,660
How do you feel?

288
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,290
Wasn't I supposed to be at Moonshadow Sect?

289
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,660
Do you feel unwell?

290
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,090
Why am I dressed like this?

291
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,290
Don't panic.

292
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,460
Listen to me.

293
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,730
So much has happened

294
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,290
while you were unconscious.

295
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,090
All I can tell you is,

296
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,530
you're now married to Wang Chan,

297
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,530
heir to Ghost Spirit Sect.

298
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,420
Our clan

299
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,490
has officially joined the Ghost Spirit Sect.

300
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,220
Father,

301
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,460
what are you talking about?

302
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,940
The Ghost Spirit Sect is demonic!

303
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,090
Are you really defying the Seven Sects of Yue?

304
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,940
The Seven Sects?

305
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,420
Yan,

306
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,940
don't blame me.

307
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,010
When you were gravely ill,

308
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,530
did anyone from the Seven Sects

309
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,010
care about you?

310
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,940
I didn't want to betray them.

311
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,220
They forced my hand!

312
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,420
To save you,

313
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,490
this was the only way.

314
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,620
I can feel within me

315
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,700
their wrongly spilled spirits.

316
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,290
So...

317
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,770
they died because of me?

318
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,180
If they hadn't died,

319
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,570
you couldn't have lived.

320
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,330
Father...

321
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,090
How could you do this?

322
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,860
We've stood against the demonic sects for 300 years!

323
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,290
Now, just because of me,

324
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,810
you've joined forces with them?

325
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,730
If I had known,

326
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,660
I'd rather you never saved me!

327
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,940
I'm going back to Moonshadow Sect!

328
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,530
Yan!

329
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,770
Stop, Yan!

330
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,180
Yan!

331
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,220
Are you okay?

332
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,330
Yan,

333
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,980
are you alright?

334
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,730
Yan!

335
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,730
Yan,

336
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,220
you can't go back now!

337
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,620
Your husband, Wang Chan, used the Blood Spirit Spell

338
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,250
and the blood of Seven Sect cultivators

339
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,460
to bring you back to life.

340
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,090
You think you can go back?

341
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,770
Moonshadow Sect

342
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,180
and all the Seven Sects

343
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,220
see us as enemies now!

344
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,570
You can't go back anymore!

345
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,290
I'm old.

346
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,140
My cultivation in this lifetime

347
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,660
has likely

348
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,980
hit its limit.

349
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,220
But you're different.

350
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,380
You have a heavenly spirit root.

351
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,050
On the path of cultivation,

352
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,140
you have limitless potential!

353
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,010
I've always believed

354
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,140
you'll become

355
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,250
our clan's

356
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,330
first Nascent Soul cultivator.

357
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,620
With you protecting us,

358
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,140
no one will dare bully us again!

359
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,380
Yan,

360
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,860
I had to save you,

361
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,530
not just because you're my daughter,

362
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,770
but also because...

363
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,770
you...

364
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,490
you're the future of our clan!

365
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,180
That burden

366
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,460
is now yours to carry.

367
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,980
Thanks for your sharing.

368
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,660
Don't mention it.

369
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,900
I talked too much.

370
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,730
That must've tired you out.

371
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,090
Just how far

372
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,570
has the demonic sects' plan come?

373
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,250
Nangong,

374
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,290
please tell us everything you know.

375
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,290
To be honest, we noticed it too.

376
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,530
You were holding back earlier.

377
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,570
Normally, we shouldn't press you,

378
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,860
but...

379
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,620
this concerns the survival of the Seven Sects.

380
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,090
We have to ask further.

381
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,700
Some time ago,

382
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,330
I fought a demonic cultivator

383
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,180
who'd infiltrated

384
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,180
Yue Kingdom.

385
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,250
He said

386
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,620
they've already won over

387
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,660
some Core cultivators in Yue.

388
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,140
Even Core cultivators

389
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,490
have betrayed us.

390
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,940
No wonder they kept stalling,

391
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,730
turning a blind eye.

392
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,460
So they've become traitors.

393
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,620
Can we trust

394
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,700
what that man said?

395
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,730
At this point,

396
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,940
nothing can be trusted completely anymore.

397
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,330
I'm only telling you this

398
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,810
so the Seven Sects understand

399
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,140
we can't just focus on what's in front of us.

400
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,420
We need to watch our back.

401
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,620
Thanks for your warning.

402
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,860
Yellow Maple Valley will take it to heart.

403
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,420
Right now,

404
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,180
Yan Clan Stronghold has defected,

405
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,860
leaving Yue Kingdom

406
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,180
wide open to invasion.

407
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,250
Do you have a strategy?

408
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,090
The demonic sects are closing in fast.

409
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,090
Even Nascent Soul cultivators

410
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,010
have joined the battle.

411
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,380
Our best option

412
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,010
is for each sect to send

413
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,330
their own Nascent Soul elders

414
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,090
to handle the conflict at their level.

415
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,010
That way, we can keep mortals out of it.

416
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,980
Of course.

417
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,050
You've thought it through.

418
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,460
In addition,

419
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,140
battles between Core cultivators

420
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,660
will be key to deciding the outcome.

421
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,980
We need Core cultivators stationed

422
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,090
on every front line

423
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,250
to fend off the demon assault.

424
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,460
Agreed.

425
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,900
Now that Yan Clan Stronghold has fallen,

426
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,860
Yellow Maple Valley and Moonshadow Sect

427
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,220
must be the first line

428
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,220
of defense.

429
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,660
Junior Li and I

430
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,330
will each lead a unit into battle.

431
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,730
Your resolve is admirable.

432
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,530
I'm deeply impressed.

433
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,140
Third,

434
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,490
it's time to send in elite Foundation disciples.

435
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,460
We need to form scout teams.

436
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,330
They'll rescue survivors near Yan Clan Stronghold

437
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,140
and gather intel on the enemy.

438
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,620
If anything comes up,

439
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,460
they'll report it immediately.

440
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,730
Moonshadow Sect will have

441
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,180
Xuan Yue lead the squad.

442
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,570
This mission

443
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,660
is part of our build-up to a full counterattack.

444
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,900
I take the mission.

445
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,620
Xuan Yue,

446
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,250
are you sure

447
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,900
not a single Seven Sect disciple made it out?

448
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,620
Reporting:

449
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,660
I couldn't confirm on the spot,

450
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,220
but I fear

451
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,900
most didn't survive...

452
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,180
Don't worry, Senior.

453
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,770
That little disciple of mine

454
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,730
is always careful to a fault.

455
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,290
Before he left,

456
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,530
he promised again and again

457
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,090
he'd look after Xuan'er.

458
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,620
If anyone survived,

459
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,050
it must be the two of them.

460
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,010
But Han Li's only a Foundation cultivator...

461
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,180
Han Li?

462
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,980
He went to Yan Clan Stronghold?

463
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,220
He can't have died just like that.

464
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,090
Miss Mo!

465
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,980
Han!

466
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,570
Hurry, get on!

467
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,860
Han,

468
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,700
are you badly hurt?

469
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm fine.

470
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,420
I already took a healing pill.

471
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,290
What about that man chasing us?

472
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,010
Did you kill him?

473
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,330
No.

474
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,380
But he didn't walk away happy.

475
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,700
Then what?

476
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,460
What's your next move?

477
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,090
There's a village up ahead.

478
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,770
You can lie low there for a while.

479
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,860
Then head to the Imperial Capital.

480
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,810
It's safer than Yan Clan Stronghold.

481
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,860
Last time we met was ten years ago...

482
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,660
Who knows when the next time will be?

483
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,730
You cultivators live so long,

484
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,900
but I'm just a mortal.

485
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,700
How many decades do I really have?

486
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,730
Can I even wait that long?

487
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,090
Han, are you fine?

488
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,290
It's all right.

489
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,180
Miss Mo,

490
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,460
this is as far as I can take you.

491
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,010
If I'm right,

492
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,940
a major war is coming

493
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,810
to the cultivation world.

494
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,220
I've got some pills here.

495
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,050
You can keep them for yourself,

496
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,730
or sell them for money.

497
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,940
Go settle down in the capital,

498
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,090
and try to live a peaceful life.

499
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,620
I don't need them.

500
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,290
Miss Mo,

501
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,810
we part ways today.

502
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,490
Who knows when we'll meet again?

503
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,330
Take care of yourself.

504
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,180
Han...

505
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,180
If I have a spirit root,

506
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,090
I'll be able to stay by your side, right?

507
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,700
You're always like this.

508
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,330
Whenever the question gets hard,

509
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,010
you just go quiet...

Grandmaster.

535
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:56,810
What is it?

536
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,180
You sent me to find royal bloodlines

537
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,570
from Cheqi and Jiang Kingdoms.

538
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,700
I only returned with two children.

539
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,420
Keep them in our sect.

540
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,810
If they have spirit roots,

541
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,250
train them.

542
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,140
If not,

543
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,460
find them good homes.

544
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,570
Understood.

545
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,530
Grandmaster,

546
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,220
I discovered something strange

547
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,330
while I was undercover in both kingdoms.

548
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,530
The demonic sects were gathering

549
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,620
entire populations together

550
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,090
to test for spirit roots.

551
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,220
Anyone who had one

552
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,730
was taken away on the spot,

553
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,570
even children weren't spared.

554
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,420
They're downright monstrous.

555
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,330
Aren't they afraid of incurring heaven's wrath?

556
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,700
Ma'am,

557
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,220
why would they do

558
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,420
something like that?

559
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,050
They're forcing people to cultivate fast.

560
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,380
Then using forbidden techniques

561
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,900
to rush them into higher stages.

562
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,180
Finally send them to the front lines.

563
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,090
As for those people,

564
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,490
even if they survive,

565
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,770
their foundation's ruined.

566
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,940
They won't live long anyway.

567
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,660
Who goes there?

568
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,570
Congrats, Young Master!

569
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,530
Hail the Young Master!

570
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,420
Young Master,

571
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,490
you're peerless!

572
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,810
With just a bit of trickery,

573
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,860
you took Yan Clan Stronghold effortlessly.

574
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,330
With the Seven Sects,

575
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,250
you'll crush them

576
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,420
just as easily!

577
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,140
Get lost!

578
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,900
Oh, Young Master,

579
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,780
you're seriously hurt.

580
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,170
The Bloody Trial Ground...

581
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,940
Blackflood Drake's poison...

582
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,980
Zhong Wu,

583
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,210
you know a lot about the Seven Great Sects.

584
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,050
You went to the Bloody Trial Ground too.

585
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,650
Did you come across someone

586
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,780
named Li Feiyu from Yellow Maple Valley?

587
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,650
Young Master,

588
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,740
I was too busy

589
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,420
stirring up trouble at the time.

590
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,090
Who could remember names?

591
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:26,980
Here's an idea.

592
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,010
Once we take Yellow Maple Valley,

593
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,170
I'll round them all up,

594
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,260
and deliver him straight to you.

595
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,010
Problem solved.

596
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,650
Then put out the order.

597
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,820
Find out where he went.

598
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,130
He's hurt worse than I am.

599
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,260
He can't have gone far.

600
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,130
Of course!

601
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,010
There's no way he got far!

602
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,460
Wait.

603
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,460
How's Yan Ruyan doing?

604
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,050
She's awake.

605
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,940
But she probably realized

606
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,090
her home is gone

607
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,860
and she got married in her sleep.

608
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,340
That's a lot to take in.

609
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,010
She won't speak to anyone now.

610
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,530
The game's already set.

611
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,860
She has no say in it.

612
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,780
Let me rest a bit, will you?

613
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,570
I'm off now!

614
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,900
What a fine mood you're in, dear.

615
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,340
Let's properly introduce ourselves.

616
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,690
My name is Wang Chan,

617
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,340
Young Master of Ghost Spirit Sect,

618
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,130
and your new husband.

619
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,900
You vile scum.

620
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,900
You'd better kill me now,

621
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,650
or I swear one day

622
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,820
I will kill you!

623
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,610
If you really want revenge,

624
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,210
then dual cultivate with me.

625
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,610
Once your powers grow

626
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,740
and you reach Nascent Soul, come and try.

627
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,340
Shameless!

628
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,300
I just wonder

629
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,490
will you really kill your dear husband?

630
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,650
Well, broad daylight and all,

631
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,940
congrats on your big day!

632
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,650
Aunt,

633
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,740
I should be congratulating you.

634
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,740
You just took Cheqi Kingdom,

635
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,820
and made Grandmaster Yunlu

636
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,130
grin ear to ear.

637
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,090
Sweet talker, aren't you?

638
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,610
You handled the Yan Clan Stronghold business well.

639
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,940
I've already put in a good word

640
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,340
with my brother for you.

641
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,010
He was so pleased.

642
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,490
He couldn't stop smiling.

643
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,300
Thanks, Aunt.

644
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,690
That said,

645
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,010
in Yan Clan Stronghold,

646
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,900
you did lose

647
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,980
to some no-name from Yellow Maple Valley.

648
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,490
If my brother knows it,

649
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,130
he won't be thrilled.

650
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,090
Understood.

651
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,210
I'll take it to heart,

652
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,420
and be more careful next time.

653
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,820
Truly your father's son,

654
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,300
sharp and sensible!

655
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,860
Oh, you're badly injured.

656
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,090
You should stay out of the fight

657
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,130
with the Seven Sects.

658
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,300
What? Why?

659
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,490
I'm almost healed!

660
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,210
Why the rush?

661
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,260
Yan Clan Stronghold just surrendered.

662
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,940
And as their new live-in son-in-law,

663
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,340
shouldn't you be home doting on your bride?

664
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,050
Leave the fighting

665
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,460
to others.

666
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,530
Even my brother,

667
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,860
I mean, your father, agrees.

668
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,780
Things are tense

669
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,940
on the battlefield.

670
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,780
We can't spare anyone

671
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,940
for the front lines.

672
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,650
We've already drafted

673
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,300
a huge number of mortals from Jiang and Cheqi.

674
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,490
Mortals?

675
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,460
They're all mortals with spirit roots.

676
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,740
Anyway,

677
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,010
get back to your sweet little bride

678
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,980
and keep her company!

679
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,420
Forgive my aunt, dear.

680
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,210
This is the real face of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

681
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,170
You'll have to get used to it.

682
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,460
She's your actual aunt?

683
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,210
Yes.

684
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,780
But she's also probably...

685
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,780
the one who most wants me dead.

686
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,420
Your family

687
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,900
is really something else.

688
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,740
Well, going forward,

689
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,690
they'll be your family too.

690
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,570
Don't worry.

691
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,940
In the future,

692
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,010
I'll need you desperately.

693
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,010
But I may betray you anytime,

694
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,090
and use you for my own ends.

695
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,740
Of course,

696
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,380
you're free to betray me too,

697
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,260
and use me however you like.

698
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,130
Dear.

699
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,340
As for the Yan Clan Stronghold situation,

700
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,210
I assume everyone's already heard.

701
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,570
The demonic sects are running wild.

702
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,260
We can't let our guard down.

703
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,420
On orders from the Seven Sects' elders,

704
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,090
we from Yellow Maple Valley

705
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,820
must also send disciples

706
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,100
to join the joint scout teams.

707
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,820
You're heading to Yan Clan Stronghold

708
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,130
to investigate the situation.

709
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,460
Who's willing to go?

710
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,210
I volunteer, Wu Xuan!

711
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,260
Chen Qiaoqian volunteers!

712
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,380
You?

713
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,900
This mission is dangerous.

714
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,940
You've just reached Foundation Establishment Stage.

715
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,260
I'm afraid...

716
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,210
Senior,

717
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,340
I gained little

718
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,860
from the Bloody Trial Ground.

719
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,610
I made no contributions to our sect,

720
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,650
yet was granted a Foundation Pill.

721
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,740
Though I succeeded in my breakthrough,

722
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,130
if I keep coasting like this,

723
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,010
I may develop inner demons.

724
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,300
Now that the demonic sects have invaded,

725
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,490
and I share ties

726
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,570
with Junior Xuan'er and Han Li,

727
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,260
I just can't sit by and do nothing.

728
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,010
Please allow me to go.

729
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,690
Since you're willing,

730
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,380
you and Junior Wu Xuan

731
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,820
may go together.

732
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,340
Thank you, Master.

733
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,900
Let Moonshadow Sect's Xuan Yue lead the team.

734
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,530
Xuan Yue accepts the order.

735
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,740
All scouts,

736
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,610
come with me!

737
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,050
- Yes! - Yes!

738
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,650
All disciples, hear this!

739
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,610
The demonic sects

740
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,980
have officially declared war on us.

741
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,570
On orders from the elders,

742
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,460
all Foundation and Qi Refining disciples

743
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,340
of Yellow Maple Valley

744
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,570
must now choose a battlefront

745
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,900
and prepare to fight.

746
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,260
In this war,

747
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,380
we cannot retreat!

748
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,610
We must not surrender!

749
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,210
Any who defy orders will be severely punished!

750
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,780
- Yes! - Yes!
