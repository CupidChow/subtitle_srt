00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,460
Add this one

193
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,890
and...

194
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,010
What's

195
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,770
16 plus 1?

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,850
18.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,980
Fu Yunzi.

198
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,300
I have seen cheating,

199
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,490
but never someone this shameless!

200
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,580
Isn't it 18?

201
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,730
It's 17!

202
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,220
Give me that!

203
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,060
Get it!

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,890
Hurry!

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,370
Quickly!

206
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,770
Whose is this?

207
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,100
- Oh, you. - My talisman!

208
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,490
This token

209
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,820
couldn't have come at a better time.

210
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,490
I'll remember you.

211
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,850
This is yours.

212
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,580
Hold up.

213
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,580
My talisman.

214
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,580
Where is he?

215
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,010
At the bottom of the north valley.

216
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,060
Mentor.

217
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,940
What precious possessions

218
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,250
have you brought today?

219
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,660
[Hongfu, Yellow Maple Valley]

220
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,770
[Zhong Lingdao, Yellow Maple Valley Sect Master]
Snow Mountain Ice Lotus.

221
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,610
Paired with hundred-year banana leaf you brought,

222
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,940
it balances cold and heat.

223
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,730
Nourishes the spirit root.

224
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,180
Excellent.

225
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,890
Wu.

226
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,250
What about you?

227
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,100
[Wu Mian, Yellow Maple Valley]
What I brought is nothing

228
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,940
compared to what you all have.

229
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,490
That's a fine item.

230
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,610
Nine Heavens Mystic Cicada.

231
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,300
Gentlest of all.

232
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,300
Please.

233
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,180
What tea are we having today?

234
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,530
Let's enjoy some fine tea.

235
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,850
Allow me.

236
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,250
Watch this.

237
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,010
Excellent tea.

238
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,300
Enjoy.

239
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,220
Having tea without me?

240
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,580
Here comes the tea moocher.

241
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,460
Quick! Finish the tea!

242
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,010
I hope the tea scalds you,

243
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,370
you money-grubber.

244
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,710
Who says I am mooching tea?

245
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,650
Look.

246
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,700
I brought something.

247
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,280
A hundred-year spirit herb.

248
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,730
Excellent choice.

249
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,340
Hongfu,

250
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,730
I brought it just for you.

251
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,300
Everyone,

252
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,920
today Yellow Maple Valley welcomes a rare guest,

253
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,100
someone who's the likes of whom we haven't encountered in a hundred years.

254
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,060
Come

255
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,890
and have a look at this.

256
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,460
What is it?

257
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,610
I'm Song Meng, a Foundation Establishment disciple

258
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,250
of Yellow Maple Valley.

259
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,490
This is my sixth junior brother,

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,060
Wu Xuan,

261
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,060
and this is our seventh junior sister.

262
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,850
So he is the one who brought the Ascension Token?

263
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,130
That is right.

264
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,650
What is your name?

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,820
My name is Han Li.

266
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,300
Why is he here?

267
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,310
That guy has

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,960
the Ascension Token?

269
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,420
That guy?

270
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,830
No way.

271
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,970
Someone with a fake spirit root

272
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,530
couldn't possibly have an Ascension Token.

273
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,010
They say anyone who enters with an Ascension Token

274
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,060
receives a Foundation Pill by default.

275
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,220
Why?

276
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,610
Because their ancestors rendered great service

277
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,460
in the past.

278
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,980
He doesn't look like someone from a meritorious bloodline.

279
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,650
A mere mortal

280
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,580
trying to sneak into the cultivation world.

281
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,940
Their ancestors did great service?

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,940
Cultivation clans use their most precious resources

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,420
on their own descendants.

284
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,650
Even I had

285
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,340
to fight for my life at Tianwu Arena just to earn

286
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,980
the right to a Foundation Pill.

287
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,340
What gives him

288
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,940
the right?

289
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,580
Enough.

290
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,650
We are here to cultivate,

291
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,130
so let us focus on that.

292
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,650
Do not judge others.

293
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,610
Understood.

294
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,100
Got it.

295
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,940
Qiaoqian is right.

296
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,940
We came here to become cultivators,

297
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,010
unlike someone

298
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,490
who came to be a toad lusting after a swan.

299
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,340
Right.

300
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,010
Pay no mind to their comments.

301
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,240
Four of the five elements spirit roots,

302
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,650
all at once.

303
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,730
You could not ask for worse.

304
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,650
Indeed.

305
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,060
And a fake spirit root at that.

306
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,250
Indeed.

307
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,610
Which clan would waste

308
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,580
an Ascension Token

309
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,340
on someone this useless?

310
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,650
If I remember correctly,

311
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,650
sect rule 23 states that anyone bearing the Ascension Token

312
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,580
must be accepted

313
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,100
without questioning

314
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,370
their background or aptitude.

315
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,180
That is right.

316
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,940
And by the rules,

317
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,220
he should be given one Foundation Pill as well.

318
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,180
What?

319
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,770
Giving him a Foundation Pill

320
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,010
is such a waste.

321
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,490
What about my disciples then?

322
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,650
Yellow Maple Valley has already done him a huge favor

323
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,180
by accepting this fake spirit root.

324
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,700
Must we give him a Foundation Pill too?

325
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,220
What is owed must be given.

326
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,980
We can't break the rules over one pill.

327
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,460
Indeed.

328
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,530
If word gets out,

329
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,100
we'll become the target of mockery from the other six sects.

330
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,770
Indeed.

331
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,010
He's right.

332
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,120
Regardless of his talent,

333
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,220
he should be accepted

334
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,460
into the sect.

335
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,400
The Foundation Pill should

336
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,130
be given too.

337
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,770
However...

338
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,820
However what?

339
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,490
The Foundation Pill quota

340
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,820
is set in advance every year.

341
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,370
This year, we only prepared one, for the champion

342
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,300
of the Tainan Bazaar.

343
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,730
If we give it to this newcomer,

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,610
then the champion

345
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,530
will not get one.

346
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,060
Then so be it.

347
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,770
My suggestion is

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,340
that we temporarily replace it with gems.

349
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,610
After all, the champion

350
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,130
will surely qualify next year.

351
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,180
Well.

352
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,820
It's settled then.

353
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,250
It's settled then.

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,460
Wu,

355
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,340
go

356
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,420
and welcome him into the valley.

357
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,890
Yes, Sect Master.

358
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,460
Hongu.

359
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,340
Please.

360
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,980
You brat,

361
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,890
I just repaid that gambling favor earlier.

362
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,490
Let's have some tea.

363
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,180
Come.

364
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,460
Lovely tea.

365
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,370
Sect Master Zhong,

366
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,530
where's my cup?

367
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,180
Here you go.

368
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,940
No tea for latecomers.

369
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,700
The tea's rather ordinary.

370
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,650
It's good.

371
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,180
There's more.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,530
Really?

373
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,460
Senior Wu.

374
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,420
Senior Wu.

375
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,250
You are the one

376
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,490
who brought the Ascension Token?

377
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,100
Yes.

378
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,530
My name is Han Li.

379
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,180
The Ascension Token is a rare item.

380
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,980
Even I have never seen one before.

381
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,180
How did you come by it?

382
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,290
It was passed down from my ancestors.

383
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,250
Are you perhaps from a cultivation clan?

384
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,140
Or do you have a senior family member

385
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,770
working in one of the seven sects?

386
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,290
I come from the mortal world.

387
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,090
I am not from a cultivation clan.

388
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,420
No matter.

389
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,250
The Ascension Token is rare.

390
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,620
The fact that you received one means you have fate with Yellow Maple Valley.

391
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,460
My surname is Wu.

392
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,860
From now on,

393
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,490
you may call me Mentor Wu.

394
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,810
Welcome

395
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,180
to Yellow Maple Valley.

396
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,180
I am

397
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,700
officially

398
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,420
a disciple

399
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,700
of Yellow Maple Valley

400
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,460
now.

401
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,290
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

402
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,090
For today,

403
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,330
I will act as your guide

404
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,900
and help you

405
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,980
understand

406
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,010
the basic rules of the valley.

407
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,330
Follow me.

408
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,460
Mentor,

409
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,420
watch your step.

410
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,730
That is the Qianji Library.

411
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,140
It holds basic cultivation manuals and alchemy recipes.

412
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,980
You can borrow them by paying gems.

413
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,490
I also

414
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,940
work there.

415
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,830
To the west is where

416
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,330
Qi Refining Stage disciples live.

417
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,330
Aside from being hot like a steam furnace,

418
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,660
it is not too bad.

419
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,460
If you have enough gems,

420
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,620
you can apply to move to the rear mountain,

421
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,140
where the accommodation is better.

422
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,090
Move aside.

423
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,770
Otherwise,

424
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,010
you will have to wait until you reach the Foundation Establishment,

425
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,700
Thank you.

426
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,220
and establish your personal abode.

427
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,010
There are many things that require gems in the valley.

428
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,010
How can I earn them?

429
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,250
You can go to Baiji Hall and take on tasks

430
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,290
to earn gems.

431
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,940
What kind of tasks?

432
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,050
Tasks such as

433
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,640
caring for spirit beasts in the valley,

434
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,090
supervising mining operations at the quarries,

435
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,090
or instructing new disciples

436
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,160
in basic techniques

437
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,700
at the Chuangong Pavilion.

438
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,980
Each task pays a different amount

439
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,860
depending on its difficulty.

440
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,570
Baiji Hall is overseen by Mentor Ye.

441
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,460
He has a rather eccentric temperament,

442
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,770
so stay sharp around him.

443
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,530
This is the Alchemy Room.

444
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,050
Once you've saved up enough gems,

445
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,770
you can come here.

446
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,460
Ye.

447
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,420
What are you doing so early in the morning?

448
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,770
I brought a new disciple

449
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,140
to pick up his entry supplies.

450
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,700
Didn't someone just come earlier?

451
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,380
Why are we doing this again?

452
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,140
Greetings, Mentor Ye.

453
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,980
You must be the one with the Ascension Token?

454
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,250
Even you've heard about it.

455
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,860
These youngsters

456
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,250
have no interest in learning,

457
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,140
but they are all experts when it comes to gossip.

458
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,010
You may not have much talent,

459
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,860
but you sure are lucky.

460
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,900
Wait here.

461
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,090
Don't touch anything.

462
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,250
Come here.

463
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,980
[Cultivation Basics]

464
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,090
This is the Yellow Maple Valley entry token.

465
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,220
Draw a strand of spiritual power and inject it to activate it.

466
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,570
After that, it will be bound to you.

467
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,530
Go ahead and infuse your spiritual power.

468
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,810
A tenfold mystic pouch,

469
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,250
one Cultivation Basics,

470
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,380
a set of daily refining tools,

471
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,810
the Solarflame Sword and Cold Moon Blade,

472
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,780
and a yellow entry robe.

473
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,620
You will take tasks to earn gems,

474
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,810
and spend them on gear

475
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,940
and tools here with me.

476
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,770
Come back when you have more gems.

477
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,220
Thank you, Mentor Ye.

478
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,220
Well?

479
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,620
Does the Yellow Maple Valley disciple's robe

480
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,980
not look flawless?

481
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,940
It does.

482
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,380
It is the first time in my life

483
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,380
I have seen a robe without stitching.

484
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,090
Walk with me.

485
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,180
That is about all you need to know

486
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,570
about the valley for now.

487
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,980
According to sect rules,

488
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,090
anyone entering with an Ascension Token is to receive

489
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,980
a Foundation Pill in advance.

490
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,730
This one

491
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,980
is yours.

492
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,860
Take it.

493
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,660
A word of advice.

494
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,090
There are many

495
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,140
who covet Foundation Pills.

496
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,700
Keep it safe.

497
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,010
If you lose it,

498
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,980
no amount of gems will get you another.

499
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,810
Thank you, Mentor.

500
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,810
I am responsible

501
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,770
for teaching the disciples basic cultivation techniques.

502
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,490
If you ever encounter difficulty in your cultivation,

503
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,810
come find me anytime.

504
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,490
I will never forget your guidance

505
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,980
when I succeed

506
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,620
in reaching the Foundation Establishment.

507
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,660
Don't worry about Foundation Establishment just yet.

508
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,460
Regardless of whether you succeed,

509
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,250
this pill must be

510
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,530
carefully safeguarded.

511
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,090
I'll remember that.

512
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,140
Thank you.

513
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,290
Hurry back to your quarters.

514
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,940
Even if they gave me a Foundation Pill,

515
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,730
with a fake spirit root like mine,

516
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,570
I'll never reach the Foundation Establishment.

517
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,900
That must be

518
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,180
what he meant.

519
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,090
Don't give me that look.

520
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,980
Wasted on the undeserving.

521
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,940
Like giving a lamp to a blind man.

522
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,980
An absolute waste of resources.

523
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,700
Look at that snow. So white.

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,090
Hey, it's Ascension Token!

525
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,050
Ascension Token!

526
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,810
My name is Han Li.

527
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,940
"Han Li" doesn't sound nearly as impressive as "Ascension Token."

528
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,220
Why not just rename yourself?

529
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,460
You can be "Ascension Token" from now on.

530
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,530
You two, that's enough.

531
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,140
Grandmaster Hongfu.

532
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,730
Choose a leaf you like.

533
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,380
You will ride it

534
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,220
through the skies.

535
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,180
Yellow Maple Valley's expanse is such that,

536
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,420
using just your legs,

537
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,090
you wouldn't cover it in ten days.

538
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,010
If you can't fly,

539
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,330
you'll never find

540
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,530
your place here.

541
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,420
Most of you have only taken flight

542
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,250
in your dreams.

543
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,290
Some are too timid

544
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,770
to even dare dream of flying.

545
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,330
Those people

546
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,730
will never leave the ground.

547
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,460
Cultivation begins

548
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,730
by breaking past the limits in your heart.

549
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,530
If the Kunpeng can soar,

550
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,900
so can people.

551
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,770
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth,

552
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,730
command

553
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,770
the six energies,

554
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,290
and fly upon the wind

555
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,530
through the void.

556
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,330
Grandmaster,

557
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,460
are you saying that if we believe,

558
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,380
we can fly?

559
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,940
Then what does that make us cultivators?

560
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,860
Fools chasing dreams?

561
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,250
Whether something is possible is one thing,

562
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,940
but whether you can do it is another.

563
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,250
Just because others can

564
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,570
doesn't mean you can.

565
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,940
Just because others cannot

566
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,770
doesn't mean you cannot.

567
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,380
Remain steady in both praise and shame,

568
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,770
and let your heart guide your every move.

569
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,460
This is the state

570
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,770
that cultivators seek to attain.

571
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,050
All right.

572
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,660
I've explained

573
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,770
what needs to be explained.

574
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,140
Fly beyond the mountain ahead,

575
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,810
and you will be

576
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,380
formally inducted as disciples of Yellow Maple Valley.

577
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,620
Any other questions?

578
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,700
Grandmaster Hongfu,

579
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,810
we just need

580
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,660
to fly over the mountain.

581
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,330
We don't need to use these leaves, do we?

582
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,290
The choice is yours.

583
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,010
I will be waiting on the other side.

584
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,770
I don't need this lousy leaf!

585
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,900
Come on!

586
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,770
Come on!

587
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,290
Let's go.

588
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,010
Let's go!

589
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,620
How did this turn into tug-of-war?

590
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,980
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth.

591
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,250
Command

592
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,490
the six energies.

593
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,980
Here I go!

594
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,090
With the Kunpeng in my heart,

595
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,220
I will surely take flight.

596
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,330
This is too slow.

597
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,420
This is no Kunpeng.

598
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,250
This is a bug.

599
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,770
What do you think?

600
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,620
When did you learn this spell?

601
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,700
While the flowers of April fade in the mortal realm,

602
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,140
peach blossoms bloom anew at the mountain temple.

603
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,330
It's just a small trick of mine.

604
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,050
Don't let Xuan'er see you

605
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,220
using this.

606
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,090
Seeing all these flowers and plants

607
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,420
will only distract her more from her cultivation.

608
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,770
You're right.

609
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,250
One moment.

610
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,420
There.

611
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,140
No more of that.

612
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,860
I'll never use that again.

613
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,570
Hongfu,

614
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,250
why are this year's

615
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,420
new disciples

616
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,530
so untalented?

617
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,140
They're the worst group I've ever seen.

618
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,570
That's not entirely true.

619
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,570
What about the disciple with the Ascension Token?

620
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,290
Surely, his possession of such a rare item

621
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,460
indicates

622
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,050
that there is something exceptional about him.

623
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,900
It is a waste of a Foundation Pill.

624
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,290
Still, he is not without merit.

625
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,290
Maybe because he knows

626
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,660
he is mediocre,

627
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,940
he has

628
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,770
a good attitude

629
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,050
and strong will.

630
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,570
A human life is short, like trees in autumn.

631
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,220
With talent like his,

632
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,490
I fear

633
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,860
he might grow old and die

634
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,290
before he ever uses that Foundation Pill.

635
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,290
What was that for?

636
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,250
I gave him some wind to wield.

637
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,700
Let us see if he is a sparrow

638
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,620
or a great swan.

662

From today onward,

663
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,610
you are officially disciples

664
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,130
of Yellow Maple Valley.

665
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,860
As your Sect Master,

666
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,420
I have only one request.

667
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,610
Focus on your cultivation

668
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,260
and avoid causing trouble.

669
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,460
Your purpose here

670
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,740
is cultivation.

671
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,900
The first major milestone in cultivation

672
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,050
is the Foundation Establishment Stage.

673
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,210
- Once you reach the Foundation Establishment... - Want some?

674
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,740
I'm fine.

675
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,170
Thank you.

676
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,300
...you can absorb

677
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,170
the essence

678
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,980
of the sun, moon, earth, and heavens.

679
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,420
You will no longer need to consume food

680
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,900
or take in worldly impurities.

681
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,090
So,

682
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,530
even if

683
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,010
you are still in the Qi Refining Stage,

684
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,170
you should already

685
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,130
begin practicing fasting.

686
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,340
You should eat later.

687
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,170
It's fine.

688
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,460
I can eat

689
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,420
while he talks.

690
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,170
I can understand if it takes time

691
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,260
to let go of gourmet food.

692
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,380
But if you can't even put down a piece of flatbread,

693
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,010
how will you ever succeed in cultivation?

694
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,740
Who says cultivating means you can't eat?

695
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,340
My family told me

696
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,010
there's a Core Formation Grandmaster

697
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,260
who loved eating.

698
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,340
They carry all their utensils with them.

699
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,860
What's wrong with me eating a flatbread?

700
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,300
It's better than starving.

701
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,530
Bad examples shouldn't be followed.

702
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,530
Is there really a Core Formation Grandmaster

703
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,740
that greedy?

704
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,570
Indeed.

705
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,420
Don't listen to his nonsense.

706
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,010
What a joke.

707
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,900
Is there really be such a gluttonous Core Formation cultivator?

708
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,210
The rule of the Ascension Token was set by our ancestors.

709
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,490
It's not something that can be changed.

710
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,300
If you work hard and make good progress

711
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,650
with your variant spirit root,

712
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,420
the Valley may grant you

713
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,460
another Foundation Pill as a reward.

714
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,490
Another one?

715
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,340
These 300 gems

716
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,610
are compensation

717
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,050
for you.

718
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,650
Sect Master,

719
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,610
I was the champion at the Tianwu Arena.

720
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,570
According to sect rules,

721
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,980
I should receive a Foundation Pill.

722
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,530
You were simply unlucky.

723
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,260
By the sect's rules,

724
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,530
the Foundation Pill must go to him first.

725
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,460
That

726
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,980
is a rule

727
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,340
we cannot alter.

728
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,740
Sect Master,

729
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,820
I cannot accept this!

730
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,650
Enough.

731
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,740
Just accept your loss and move on.

732
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,460
Did you not hear what the Sect Master said?

733
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,940
The Foundation Pill goes to the Ascension Token holder first.

734
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,780
- But... - You are engaged

735
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,530
to the daughter of the Chen family.

736
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,260
The Chen family has plenty of Foundation Pills.

737
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,570
What's the matter?

738
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,210
Too proud to ask them for one?

739
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,490
If you want to blame someone,

740
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,460
blame the one with Ascension Token.

741
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,820
Watch closely.

742
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,780
Did everyone understand?

743
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,090
Is there learn a specific technique you wish to learn?

744
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,940
Mentor.

745
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,530
- Mentor. - Mentor.

746
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,690
You, over there, go first.

747
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,460
♪We made a promise to reunite♪

748
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,500
♪And walked into the unknown♪

♪But now that we've met again...♪

750
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,380
I want to learn

751
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,260
Aura Concealment.

752
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,530
A fake spirit root wants

753
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,490
to learn Aura Concealment?

754
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,570
What aura do you have to hide?

755
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,420
Aura Concealment,

756
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,780
as the name suggests,

757
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,210
uses spiritual aura

758
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,860
to isolate yourself from the outside world.

759
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,900
If done well,

760
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,090
it can hide

761
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,130
your presence

762
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,420
