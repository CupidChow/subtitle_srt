Perhaps the scar of war

26
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,530
will disappear

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,420

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,210
of Yellow Maple Valley turn red.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,690
Where is his cavern?

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,260
I should ask around.

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,370
What do I want?

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,940
I've always wanted the same thing.

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,330
Don't you know?

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,220
Hongfu.

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,410
When Huayuan

36
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,050
was a new disciple,

37
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,740
we often gazed at the snow mountain here.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,570
He was a nostalgic person.

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,330
I'm sure

40
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,460
he is glad

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,570
to return to this place.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,210
We promised

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,180
to return and gaze upon the same view.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,460
Little do I know,

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,930
this is how I send him off.

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,570
One less drinking friend.

47
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,850
Moonshadow Sect's Immortal Stupor

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,050
was his favorite liquor.

49
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,890
What is your plan now?

50
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,060
I heard everyone from the Yellow Maple Valley

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,340
went to the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,410
I am just a rogue cultivator now.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,610
Be it the demonic sects

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,450
or Yellow Maple Valley,

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,980
my past no longer has anything to do with me.

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,290
However,

57
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,690
I promised Huayuan

58
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,540
to look after

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,610
his disciples.

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,890
Especially his favorite, the youngest one.

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,260
He's gone missing.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,010
That young man

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,890
who goes by the name of Han?

64
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,170
Han Li.

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,690
Have you met him before?

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,690
Yes.

67
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,500
He

68
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,780
looks unassuming,

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,220
yet

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,980
he is quite smart.

71
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,380
So he caught my attention.

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,100
Your description

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,410
is apt.

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,060
Despite his plain talent,

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,290
he stands out

76
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,010
and is often favored by fortune.

77
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,780
Xuan'er went to the Yan Clan Stronghold with him.

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,060
And she missed him a lot when she returned.

79
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,570
I thought that

80
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,540
would become her inner demon.

81
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,780
I see.

82
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,850
You can't judge a book by its cover.

83
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,100
It's just a story between the younglings.

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,850
There's no point

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,130
talking about this now anyway.

86
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,570
I can only hope

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,100
he manages to escape

88
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,410
like he usually does.

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,850
If that is Huayuan's last wish,

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,450
I

91
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,940
can help you find him.

92
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,380
I wouldn't want

93
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,690
to bother you with a small matter.

94
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,100
Besides,

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,380
I plan to find them

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,290
after I take care

97
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,660
of everything here.

98
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,570
It's fine.

99

Moonshadow Sect

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,220
is negotiating peace with the demonic sects.

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,450
I have nothing to do as well.

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,290
In that case,

103
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,130
thank you.

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,170
Hongfu.

105
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,060
I'll take my leave.

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,220
Huayuan,

107
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,660
don't worry.

108
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,660

138
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,100

for two days.

144
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,140
He looks scary.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,580
He's a friend of mine.

146
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,250
I have some pills.

152
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,140
Yes.

153
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,140
We were betrayed

154
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,730
and defeated.

155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,290
Spirit Beast Mountain

156

You are still hurt.

161
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,410
No point in acting tough.

162
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,050
Now that our sect has fallen

163
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,250
and the demonic sects are hunting us,

164
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,460
we need to find a way to survive.

165
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,290
Our sect

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,980
has fallen?

167
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,580
What about Master and other mentors?

168
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,660
When I was fleeing,

169
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,460
they were fighting the demonic sects.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,370
What happened to them?

171
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,140
We just learned

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,100
that Master

173
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,050
fought Yunlu

174
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,100
to defend our sect.

175
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,010
He sacrificed his Golden Core

176
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,490
and passed away.

177
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,730
How could this be?

178
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,300
Master...

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,700
He already

180
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,460
made the decision to die

181
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,180
when he went to Mentor Hongfu's side.

182
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,010
Perhaps this is what

183
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,100
Master wanted, to make peace

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,370
with himself.

185
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,100
And now,

186
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,610
we're truly

187
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,220
disciples

188
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,340
without a home.

189
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,340
Senior Song,

190
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,060
Master asked me to keep this

191
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,250
and give it to you if I saw you.

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,130
Consider

193
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,460
it delivered.

194
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,610
Han,

195
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,770
Master surely

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,650
left some for you too.

197
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,770
I already took mine.

198
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,010
The rest

199
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,610
is just some gems and pills.

200
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,580
You need them

201
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,610
more than I do wherever you go.

202
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,320
[Li]

203
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,010
He

204
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,890
embroidered this word the year I achieved

205
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,060
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

206
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,530
He kept it by his side

207
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,180
as if it were his treasure.

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,460
I also have

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,530
some pills that I made.

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,250
Take them.

211
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,220
Here you go.

212
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,300
You won't join us to regroup with others?

213
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,770
We can retaliate

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,300
and fight those scums.

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,300
The last thing Master did

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,940
before he left

217
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,940
was to remove the Soul-Burning Spell on me.

218
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,010
Thinking back,

219
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,890
the demonic sects

220
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,490
knew

221
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,700
precisely where we were.

222
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,700
Master didn't say anything,

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,980
but I understood why now.

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,730
Were we

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,180
betrayed by the sect?

226
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,300
Exactly.

227
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,370
I feel bad for our peers.

228
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,300
They didn't even know

229
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,460
they were bait till the very end.

230
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,490
Perhaps

231
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,940
this is how the world works.

232
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,250
But we are currently powerless

233
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,420
to change it.

234
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,940
And I

235
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,340
don't want to be bait anymore.

236
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,980
It's time

237
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,650
to live differently.

238
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,610
If we live,

239
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,940
there is hope.

240
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,370
Han,

241
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,650
now that you've explained everything,

242
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,610
I don't want to regroup with them anymore.

243
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,100
Weiniang.

244
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,060
What about you?

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,730
Let's turn to Mentor Hongfu

246
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,940
and see what she plans to do.

247
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,100
Han.

248
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,100
You've always been a free soul.

249
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,610
Go wherever

250
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,010
you want.

251
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,180
Yellow Maple Valley may be gone.

252
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,220
But we're still here.

253
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,100
If possible,

254
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,850
let's meet again.

255
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,060
Seniors,

256
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,180
farewell.

257
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,730
Han Li.

258
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,460
Farewell.

259
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,580
Farewell.

260
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,460
Reunion is rare.

261
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,980
Departure is bitter.

262
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,650
Every regret

263
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,340
is unique.

264
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,650
I can't stop here.

265
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,890
My mentors

266
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,130
told me to explore the world outside.

267
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,180
I'll fix the teleport array first.

268
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,460
I wonder if Yunxiao

269
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,180
and the rest are ready.

270
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,090
[In Memory of Qi Yunxiao]
Qi is...

271
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm too late.

272
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,700
Miss Ruyin.

273
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,060
Her Dragon Roar Body

274
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,490
is ferocious.

275
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,770
This cask

276
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,580
contains the Yunxiao Heart Technique

277
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,610
you've seen.

278
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,700
My husband

279
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,180
has removed all the restriction spells.

280
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,420
And the other one

281
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,460
contains all my understandings of the array

282
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,980
as well as

283
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,580
rare array scrolls you won't find on the market.

284
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,380
Please

285
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,660
accept them.

286
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,530
I can't accept them for free.

287
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,700
What can I do for you?

288
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,570
My days are numbered.

289
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,380
Can I ask you for a favor?

290
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,980
My husband

291
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,090
was killed by the Fu clan.

292
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,810
He fled here

293
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,250
and succumbed to his injuries.

294
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,980
I hope

295
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,530
you can

296
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,630
avenge us

297
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,250
on our behalf one day.

298
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,660
The Fu Clan has poisoned the Yuanwu Kingdom long enough.

299
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,860
[In Memory of Qi Yunxiao]
They rob and kill

300
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,730
as if it's no different from breathing.

301
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,660
I know

302
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,660
it is a huge favor to ask.

303
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,460
But I have no other options.

304
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,420
Get up now.

305
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,090
I can

306
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,860
give you my promise.

307
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,900
When I'm strong enough,

308
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,140
I

309
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,620
will bring justice to you.

310
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,460
Please accept my bow,

311

Senior.

312
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,180
Miss Ruyin.

313
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,660
I have done

314
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,900
some research on your ailment

315
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,290
and found some recipes too.

316
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,620
While they might not cure you,

317
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,010
they can alleviate

318
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,380
your suffering

319
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,460
more or less.

320
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,090
I

321
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,770
will stay here for a few days

322
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,330
to make pills

323
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,460
for you.

324
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,250
Thank you so much, Senior.

325
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,620
Please

326
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,700
don't mind my humble abode.

327
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,220
Once

328
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,730
I'm done with the teleport array,

329
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,140
you will have it.

330
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,420
Thank you.

331
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,290
Master,

332
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,530
I

333
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,250
might not understand it now,

334
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,770
but I don't regret giving her my promise.

335
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,460
But I can only deliver my promise

336
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,140
once I reach the Core Formation Stage.

337

and brash

339
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,460
will only kill me.

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,010
unbeknownst to you and my husband,

343
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,660
the difficulty in repairing ancient arrays

344
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,250
does not lie in technicality,

345
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,090
but that it requires the vitality of array masters.

346
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,860
Do not feel guilty.

347
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,770
[Serenity and Peace]
Given my impending demise,

348
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,420
to sacrifice myself for an array

349
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,860
is an honor.

350
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,730
Lastly,

351
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,380
if my passing

352
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,730
makes you honor your promise,

353
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,010
then it's worth it.

354
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,250
My husband built this hut himself.

355
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,490

If it's not too much trouble,

357

please

358
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,860
bury me next to my husband behind the mountain.

Senior Han,

361
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,940
the ancient array is indeed a mystical one.

362
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,290
It took

363
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,290
all of me

364
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,010
to repair the array slightly.

365
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,250
Place it on the stone tablet.

366
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,460
Gather the missing ingredients

367
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,900
and the Greater Teleport Command Seal.

368
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,090
You may then activate the array.

You will move a thousand li

Alas, the ancient array

372
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,810
is barely recorded in any scrolls.

373
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,140
I can't identify the destination.

374
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,570

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,900
It seems like they

389
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,050
have not found out about the array.

390
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,620
He won't give up.

391
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,460
How annoying.

392
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,570
Nangong Wan?

393
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,250
What is she doing here?

394
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,220
Senior Nangong of the Moonshadow Sect?

395
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,090
You still stand

396
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,140
despite your injury.

397
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,770
As expected of a veteran from the Moonshadow Sect.

398
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,460
Him again.

399
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,460
He's everywhere.

400
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,090
I suppose

401
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,380
you are behind all the escaped

402
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,730
captives lately, then.

403
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,570
Young man,

404
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,620
you keep chasing me.

405
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,900
Do you have a death wish?

406
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,980
My apologies.

407
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,220
I wouldn't provoke you

408
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,980
if we were anywhere else.

409
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,900
But you're now

410
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,730
at the heart of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

411
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,180
Can I help you?

412
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,810
Let's have some tea together.

413
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,010
I must

414
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,940
be a good host.

415
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,770
All this because I'm looking for

416
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,010
that stupid Han Li.

417
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,980
Why did he return to the Yan Clan Stronghold?

418
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,010
I don't have

419
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,810
the interest, the mood,

420
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,700
or the time.

421
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,380
Go away

422
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,460
if you want to live.

423
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,290
But you're injured.

424
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,460
Elder Gui, Elder Tong.

425
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,250
Didn't you say

426
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,980
you want to swear loyalty to me again?

427
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,420
Show me your devotion.

428
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,860
Of course.

429
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,940
Bring our people

430
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,140
across the forest in front of us

431
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,660
and cut off her retreat

432
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,570
by sieging her from the cliff behind.

433
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,050
Oh, no.

434
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,250
I'm so close

435
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,940
yet this is happening.

436
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,220
Whatever.

437
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,180
Lay in ambush here.

438
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,570
Yes!

439
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,810
It's her.

440
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,900
I think she is hurt.

441
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,290
Dong Xuan'er?

442
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,330
Why is she here?

443
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,290
Did she join the demonic sects?

444
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,090
And this guy from the Ghost Spirit Sect

445
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,980
who won't leave us alone.

446
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,140
Who knew a Core Formation Stage cultivator

447
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,180
could run with her tail

448
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,180
between her legs?

449
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,770
Senior,

450
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,490
isn't it shameful to flee

451
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,290
without putting up a fight?

452
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,570
Not as shameful as ganging up on others

453
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,050
and conquering other lands.

454
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,010
You two,

455
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,330
what are you waiting for?

456
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,620
Young Lady!

457
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,570
I am Dong Xuan'er,

458
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,900
a disciple of Hongfu under Yellow Maple Valley.

459
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,010
Greetings.

460
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,900
Dong Xuan'er.

461
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,140
Why are you consorting with the demonic sects?

462
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,090
It's a long story.

463
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,380
Please come with us

464
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,330
and clear up this misunderstanding.

465
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,860
Your sect is negotiating peace with the Six Demonic Sects.

466
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,090
I can ensure your safety.

467
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,420
That peace talk

468
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,730
is just one's wishful thinking.

469
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,810
The righteous and evil are sworn enemies.

470
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,900
The demonic cults sow chaos for their selfish desires.

471
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,860
I hate fighting,

472
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,660
yet I must avenge

473
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,900
my friends.

474
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,620
Let's

475
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,380
settle the score today.

476
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,180
Senior,

477
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,860
your life-bound treasure is damaged.

478
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,810
This sword technique is powerful,

479
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,700
but it consumes your cultivation core.

480
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,220
Look.

481
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,010
There are so many of us.

482
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,420
Can you win?

483
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,050
Now's the time.

484
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,050
Don't!

485
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,810
Don't come near me.

486
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,420
It's him.

487
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,980
Why is he here?

488
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,250
Wait.

489
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,330
Let's talk it out.

490
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,380
Don't move.

491
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,660
Impressive.

492
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,380
You snuck

493
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,460
into my incompetent team quietly.

494
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,810
Senior,

495
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,660
he and I have a history.

496
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,730
I can't show my face.

497
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,660
Please deal with him.

498
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,180
It's him?

499
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,330
Why is he here?

500
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,050
No, I can't let him know I'm here for him.

501
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:01,940
It's...

502
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,010
It's too embarrassing.

503
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,860
Make way for me!

504
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,660
Don't kill me.

505
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,490
Don't kill me.

506
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,420
You there!

507
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,530
Let go of Young Lady.

508
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,220
Listen to me.

509
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,140
Do not move an inch!

510
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,980
Silence.

511
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,530
This is weird, Xuan'er.

512
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,770
You've always avoided the remnants

513
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,010
of the Seven Sects.

514
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,810
Why are you so eager to intervene today?

515
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,980
Unless

516
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,290
you want to be held hostage by him?

517
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,570
Wang Chan!

518
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,530
Shut your mouth!

519
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,730
Wise words, Young Master.

520
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,570
We were almost fooled by her.

521
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,530
Indeed!

522
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,010
We split up later.

523
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,330
He's a cunning foe.

524
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,220
It won't be easy to fight him.

525
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,250
Their target is you.

526
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,570
You should go first.

527
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,250
I have Dong Xuan'er.

528
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,570
They won't do anything to me.

529
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,220
All right.

530
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,730
Enough of this farce.

531
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,180
I don't care if you're doing this on purpose.

532
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,980
Capture them both

533
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,050
and we'll know.

534
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,010
Senior,

535
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,490
and this

536
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,090
masked friend,

537
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,620
just

538
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,770
give up already.

539
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,810
A Foundation Establishment cultivator cannot burrow underground.

540
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,620
Can you escape?

541
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,570
Forgive me.

542
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,660
Take them down.

543
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,090
I'll be waiting for you

544
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,050
a hundred li to the west.

545
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,380
Don't come with pursuers.

546
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,260
I hate this.

547
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,980
The easy prey

548
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,170
escaped.

549
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,820
Search everywhere

550
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,300
within a 100-li radius!

551
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,820
Yes, Young Master!

552
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,900
Han Li.

553
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,740
It's you, right?

554
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,690
You're hurting me.

555
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,130
Can you put it away?

556
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,900
I'm sorry.

557
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,460
It really is you.

558
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,340
Han Li.

559
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,300
You never told us you're safe

560
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,420
after you escaped from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

561
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,940
Don't you know I...

562
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,130
and your master are worried about you?

563
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,490
Forgive my recklessness

564
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,820
just now.

565
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,130
You're so courteous.

566
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,570
I heard you were kidnapped.

567
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,170
It seems like

568
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,210
you've joined the Joyful Union Sect.

569
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,610
Grandmaster Yunlu of Joyful Union Sect

570
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,090
is my father.

571
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,740
My master

572
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,010
is my mother.

573
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,900
She had a history with him.

574
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,570
She didn't know who he truly was when they met.

575
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,780
When she found out,

576
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,860
she was already deeply in love

577
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,820
and pregnant with me.

578
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,690
That was why Wang Chan was after you

579
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,610
when he first met you.

580
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,650
Your gift of enchantment

581
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,690
must have come from your father.

582
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,260
Father

583
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,300
took me in

584
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,300
as his disciple.

585
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,170
He even forcefully erased

586
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,980
whatever I learned in Yellow Maple Valley.

587
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,420
But since training under him,

588
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,130
I've progressed very quickly.

589
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,980
Can you imagine a Nascent Soul cultivator

590
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,900
teaching you everything he knows?

591
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,010
Not many can turn down

592
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,420
an opportunity like that.

593
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,820
Do you understand?

594
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,610
But you're not like them.

595
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,050
You won't

596
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,260
ever be one of them.

597
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,260
But I was told

598
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,170
that once I mastered my technique,

599
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,130
my personality would change too.

600
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,740
When that happens,

601
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,980
I might not even remember what you look like.

602
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,420
A cultivator

603
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,130
lives longer than a mortal.

604
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,170
You will

605
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,650
meet more people,

606
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,420
and forget more people.

607
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,690
But this doesn't matter.

608
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,460
What matters

609
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,690
is that you don't forget who you are.

610
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,050
All right.

611
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,490
I am Han Li.

612
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,380
How may I address you?

613
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,650
I am Dong Xuan'er.

614
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,610
We're now friends.

615
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,860
Han.

616
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,020
You're also here?

617
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,090
Master,

618
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,090
Father,

619
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,820
sorry.

620
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,690
I still

621
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,050
can't let go of him.

622
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,980
Senior Han,

623
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,780
just drop me here.

624
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:51,780
All right.

625
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,610
Go.

626
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,860
I'll explain

627
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,050
to my father.

628
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,820
I'll buy you and Senior Nangong

629
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,050
some time.

630
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,610
Don't get caught by Wang Chan again.

631
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,570
What exactly did you do to him

632
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,650
in the Yan Clan Stronghold

633
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,490
to make him so obsessed with you?

634
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,130
Dong Xuan'er.

635
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,690
Take care.

636
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,010
Take care.

637
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,610
Senior Han.

638
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,490
Farewell.

639
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,130
Mother,

640
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,820
Mentor Li,

641
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,260
and everyone in Yellow Maple Valley.

642
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,010
Don't worry.

643
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,090
I

644
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,260
will walk my own path.

645
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,260
I won't be swayed by anyone.

646
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,940
Farewell.

647
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,860
A hundred li to the west.

648
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,650
This should be the place.

649
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,260
She's seriously injured.

650
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,740
I'm here.

651
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,300
I won't let you die.
