25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,730
While we're already bound by the betrothal arrangement,

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,890
I still wish to know you

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,090
better.

28
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,490
I see

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,940
you're still averse to me.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,330
You think

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,700
you're above a man of my lowly background, don't you?

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,530
Not at all.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,810
Then what?

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,490
Why are you afraid of me?

35
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,420
Senior Lu,

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,490
there are people here.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,420
Behave.

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,420
You're adorable when you're shy.

39
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,490
There is no one here.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,010
Him again.

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,820
Senior Lu.

42
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,180
Why do you like to pick on him?

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,940
He picked on me first.

44
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,370
His Foundation Pill

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,860
should have been mine.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,730
Han Li!

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,090
Stand right there!

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,410
Senior Lu,

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,500
ever since I entered the valley,

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,050
I have done nothing but concede.

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,460
Why must you back me into a corner?

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,490
You know very well why.

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,850
Give me back the Foundation Pill

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,690
or be the fertilizer to the forest.

55
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,690
You've done nothing wrong

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,850
but you stick out like a sore thumb

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,490
because you possess something you shouldn't have.

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,490
What are you doing?

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,210
This is between him and me.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,410
Please stay out of this, Mentor Wu.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,220
I didn't teach you magic to hurt your peers.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,260
Before I came here, I fought with my life

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,660
on the Tianwu Arena

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,170
before I was offered a Foundation Pill.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,060
Yet he simply

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,500
took my spot with a show of his Ascension Token.

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,940
It was only reasonable for me to be angry!

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,380
The Sect Master and the elders

69
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,450
decide who can have the Foundation Pill.

70
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,940
If you have issues with their decision, appeal to them.

71
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,380
I want fairness!

72
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,290
The prestigious cultivators already look down on me.

73
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,820
He's just a rogue cultivator with a fake spirit root.

74
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,170
How come he gets to steal my thunder too?

75
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,340
You have accepted

76
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,820
the compensation gems we offered

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,940
so you're no longer entitled to the pill.

78
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,690
You still have a chance to get it in the future.

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,170
Just work hard for it when the time comes.

80
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,940
Senior Lu.

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,850
Let's go.

82
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,890
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,690
Han Li.

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,340
You will never

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,730
hear the end of me.

86
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,610
You won't

87
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,410
be so lucky next time.

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,940
Are you all right?

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,220
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

90
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,730
He was right.

91
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,130
You've done nothing wrong,

92
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,660
but you stick out like a sore thumb.

93
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,410
There's only one way for you

94
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,100
to keep your Foundation Pill.

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,340
Get to Tier 13 as soon as possible

96
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,290
and ingest it.

97
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,570
It's the only way.

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,980
Do I

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,540
not deserve the pill?

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,540
Senior Lu.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,580
Calm down, Senior Lu.

102
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,490
Senior Lu.

103
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,370
Calm down!

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,410
I am calm.

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,100
You're digging your own grave here.

106
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,410
I fought for that pill for you!

107
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,810
Only by reaching the Foundation Establishment Stage that I am deserving of you.

108
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,340
Senior...

109
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,580
Didn't they offer you 300 gems as compensation?

110
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,780
That's a lot.

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,340
No need to take any tasks from me anymore.

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,490
That's not compensation.

113
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,930
It was a robbery.

114
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,900
Mentor,

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,490
I was told

116
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,900
that you

117
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,100
know a way to obtain a Foundation Pill.

118
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,410
I do.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,610
But it costs a lot.

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,700
Are you

121
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,340
going to splurge?

122
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,170
300 gems.

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,980
Take it.

124
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,140
300 gems.

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,490
You won't keep anything for yourself?

126
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,930
Gems are nothing

127
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,850
compared to a Foundation Pill.

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,020
Wait for my good news.

129
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,660
Thank you.

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,780
Have you made up your mind?

131
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,980
Almost.

132
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,050
Are you done?

133
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,980
Mentor,

134
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,170
ten books in total.

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,170
Ten books.

136
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,930
20 gems.

137
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,370
Leave the gems here and you can go.

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,780
18...

139
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,930
That's not good.

140
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,020
18 gems.

141
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,730
Leave one book behind.

142
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,490
Take nine books.

143
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,220
Mentor,

144
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,780
can you help me out?

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,020
No.

146
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,930
It took me a while to pick those books.

147
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,850
Perhaps when I...

148
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,340
Fine.

149
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,580
Just this once.

150
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,220
Don't do it again.

151
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,460
Go.

152
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,580
Thank you, Mentor.

153
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,410
Don't move.

154
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,290
If I

155
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,610
treat your swollen neck,

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,250
is my effort

157
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,290
worth two gems?

158
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,290
You can heal?

159
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,930
You never mention it.

160
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,290
Have you been

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,780
ingesting supplements imbued with the fire element?

162
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,340
No.

163
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,370
No?

164
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,220
Perhaps I've spent

165
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,980
too much time at Dihuo Palace lately.

166
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,700
Not bad.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,180
You hide many tricks.

168
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,490
It's swollen

169
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,700
because the heat

170
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,700
has pervaded your body.

171
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,850
I need to cut it open.

172
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,370
I'll gather some poisonous herbs

173
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,370
and make a numbing soup.

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,340
After you drink it,

175
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,610
it won't hurt when I cut it.

176
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,490
Han Li.

177
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,300
Come back.

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,060
Just cut it open now.

179
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,980
No need to numb it.

180
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,650
It's bothering me so much.

181
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,370
Come.

182
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,890
It's going to hurt a lot.

183
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,730
Not being able to sleep or eat is worse.

184
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,730
Just do it.

185
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,060
Come.

186
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,530
Hurry up.

187
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,010
Liar.

188
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,340
I can't

189
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,340
count on him at all.

190
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,580
It hurts.

191
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,490
Mentor.

192
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,700
Come.

193
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,370
Are you sure?

194
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,530
Listen.

195
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,770
If you botch it,

196
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,100
I'll make you pay.

197
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,060
It's true?

198
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,130
What is?

199
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,940
I've read that some patients

200
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,460
had a bird coming out of their shoulder.

201
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,060
It hid under the skin

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,850
like a tumor

203
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,180
or a lump.

204
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,010
You can hear a bird's chirping from within.

205
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,340
When it's cold or hungry,

206
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,490
you'll feel pain.

207
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,530
Once one uses a silver blade to slice its feet,

208
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,100
the bird

209
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,010
will fly out.

210
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,530
The fire energy

211
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,580
has taken a form.

212
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,850
Come.

213
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,010
I'll apply some ointment.

214
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,490
Brilliant!

215
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,610
What do you think?

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,300
It's treated.

217
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,220
Who would have thought

218
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,770
that you could heal too?

219
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,180
You have a knack

220
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,530
for medicine and herbs.

221
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,010
Here.

222
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,980
Your reward for treating me.

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,460
Keep it.

224
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,650
No need,

225
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,220
Mentor.

226
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,700
Just keep it.

227
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,250
Like I said,

228
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,490
curing your swollen neck is to be remunerated

229
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,650
by two gems.

230
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,530
Also,

231
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,700
I picked ten books,

232
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,010
and find myself short of two gems.

233
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,580
Therefore,

234
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,530
adding this to that.

235
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,340
We're even.

236
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,060
You

237
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,850
know your math well.

238
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,060
Speaking of gems,

239
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,100
living here can be costly.

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,130
If you need money,

241
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,340
go to Baiji Hall

242
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,490
to take up some tasks

243
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,490
and earn some gems.

244
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,100
Are you sure

245
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,850
I can do that now?

246
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,220
Just tell them you have my permission.

247
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,130
Thank you, Mentor.

248
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,820
Mentor Ye

249
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,250
is focusing on wood carving,

250
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,730
yet I can't help but feel watched.

251
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,580
Can someone

252
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,700
do two things at once?

253
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,130
Come in.

254
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,700
Greetings, Mentor Ye.

255
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,300
Here for a task?

256
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,490
It's your first time, and you came alone.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,770
Should I give you a rundown?

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,980
Tame a beast.

259
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,700
50 gems.

260
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,700
That's a lot.

261
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,380
[Tame a Beast]

262
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,180
But taming a beast

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,490
can be dangerous.

264
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,460
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

265
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,890
If you're too scared for it,

266
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,770
there's this one.

267
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,850
Move a mountain.

268
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,770
100 gems.

269
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,490
Anything simpler for me?

270
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,850
I have no use for that many gems anyway.

271
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,130
If you don't want to take these tasks,

272
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,250
feel free to come back next month.

273
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,130
Mentor Ye,

274
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,730
is the task at Herbs Garden still available?

275
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,940
Can I take that one?

276
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,420
Do you know what kind of place it is?

277
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,890
I looked down once

278
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,100
when I was flying.

279
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,770
I'm confident enough to carry out

280
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,180
a herb-gathering task.

281
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,420
I have to warn you first.

282
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,420
The herbs in the Herbs Garden

283
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,980
are more precious than the disciples here.

284
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,890
If you destroyed one or two herbs,

285
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,650
you would have to pay

286
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,980
more than a few thousand gems.

287
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,010
You don't trust me?

288
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,530
I would like

289
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,420
to give it a try.

290
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,060
A fool never heeds any warning.

291
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,820
Pay up.

292
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm here to take up a task.

293
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,180
Why do I have to pay you?

294
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,370
I take 10% of the reward as commission.

295
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,490
It's the rule here.

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,890
What about other tasks?

297
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,850
Besides,

298
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,460
to make sure you can't walk away should you destroy the herbs,

299
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,770
you need to pay a small fee

300
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,180
as security deposit to accept this task.

301
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,770
You can't get anywhere without gems here.

302
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,980
You're gemless.

303
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,940
How can you survive in Yellow Maple Valley?

304
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,460
Herbs Garden...

305
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,340
There is a way, though.

306
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,490
Mentor Ye,

307
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,650
will you help me?

308
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,060
Easy.

309
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,220
Don't you have a Foundation Pill?

310
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,420
Sell it to me.

311
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,460
Not only can you own a large amount of gems

312
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,700
but I will also offer you better tasks

313
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,940
for you to choose freely.

314
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,770
Mentor Ye,

315
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,730
you don't have a use

316
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,010
for that Foundation Pill.

317
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,530
Who wants it

318
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,370
from me?

319
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,340
Why does it matter?

320
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,060
You have a fake spirit root.

321
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,180
You can never reach the Foundation Establishment Stage in your life.

322
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,490
You should thank me for purchasing

323
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,060
that pill from you.

324
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,180
I know.

325
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,370
But I plan to seize any chance,

326
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,650
no matter

327
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,770
how slim it is.

328
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,700
200 gems.

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,980
And 50 extra.

330
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,130
Don't be too greedy now.

331
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,250
That's 250 gems in total.

332
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,890
You're not strong enough

333
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,130
to keep that pill.

334
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,730
So why hold onto it so dearly?

335
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,250

It seems like I can't leave this place

340

without surrendering the pill.

341
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,420

you want the task at the Herbs Garden?

Yes.

Fortunately,

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,490
and you'll know how many you've killed.

386
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,490
Then,

387
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,620
I'll ask you to pay for it.

388
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,010
You just have to pay up.

389
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,220
Yes.

390
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,250
1,723.

391
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,810
1,724.

392
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,530
1,725.

393
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,220
1,726.

394
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,860
[Dong Xuan'er, Yellow Maple Valley]

395
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,380
There is a total of

396
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,250
7,123 herbs here.

397
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,810
1,727.

398
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,090
1,728.

399
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,490
1,7...

400
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,140
- 1,729. - I come here to paint every day

401
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,420
so I remember every plant vividly.

402
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,460
I can't get it wrong.

403
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,570
1,739.

404
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,620
You must be new here.

405
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,290
1,7...

406
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,420
Oh, no.

407
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,700
She's using a trick.

408
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,980
She's more powerful than I.

409
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,420
I must leave.

410
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,900
Wait.

411
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,530
What is it?

412
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,460
What are you doing?

413
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,460
Stay still.

414
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,730
Let me look at you.

415
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,250
You look plain.

416
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,530
Your talent is also ordinary.

417
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,490
But you have great eyes.

418
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,460
Very clear.

419
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,700
Miss,

420
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,730
take care.

421
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,980
You don't like people looking at you?

422
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,700
I don't like to be stared at.

423
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,140
Your stare

424
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,900
makes me uncomfortable.

425
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,090
Do you get nervous when you see me?

426
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,220
Don't worry.

427
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,420
In this garden,

428
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,860
other than herbs,

429
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,360
you hardly find any humans here.

430
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,400
Relax.

431
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,700
Don't move.

432
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,380
No. 91 on the rare insect list, Chelonian Beetle.

433
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,940
Look at its long horn.

434
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,660
Its black and white horn points at the sky.

435
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,730
How strong.

436
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,940
And look at its fine hair

437
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,180
that gives out a green hue under the sunlight.

438
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,900
It's beautiful.

439
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,250
It's like a war general.

440
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,290
What rare insect list?

441
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,010
Even insects have a ranking?

442
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,620
That's right.

443
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,140
If there is a ranking for cultivators,

444
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,090
the bugs and the plants can have one too.

445
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,380
Don't underestimate this garden.

446
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,420
There's more than meets the eye.

447
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,770
Indeed.

448
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,250
This cultivation sanctuary

449
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,860
is otherworldly.

450
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,420
What was the last number again?

451
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,250
I lost count.

452
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,220
Can you stop staring at me?

453
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,290
One.

454
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,250
Two.

455
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,730
But weren't we born to be admired?

456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,250
Look at the bugs and the plants.

457
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,770
They don't care about us,

458
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,980
so they are happy.

459
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,250
You shouldn't care if others are looking at you or not.

460
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,730
This garden

461
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,290
has a lot of eccentric people.

462
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,220
I don't want any attention.

463
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,220
That said,

464
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,900
she seems to be quite familiar with this place.

465
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,940
Perhaps I can learn from her.

466
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,380
Greetings.

467
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,700
I am Han Li.

468
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,250
How may I address you?

469
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,530
Oh, you're the one with the Ascension Token.

470
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,770
I don't mean to look down at you.

471
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,180
I am Dong Xuan'er.

472
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,980
We're now friends.

473
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,900
Miss,

474
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,420
do you work in this garden as well?

475
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,770
She is the Dong Xuan'er.

476
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,980
No one can order her around.

477
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:00,900
Mentor Ma.

478
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,810
Mentor Ma.

479
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,810
Good.

480
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,620
Since you two have met,

481
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,130
I don't need to make a lengthy

482
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,090
introduction.

483
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,380
This is Han Li.

484
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,290
Dong Xuan'er

485
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,050
is different from others.

486
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,770
She is the direct disciple

487
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,420
of a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

488
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,250
She

489
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,810
sees things differently

490
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,730
in comparison to you.

491
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,730
Don't waste

492
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,140
your time with her.

493
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,660
Understood.

494
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,380
This is an excellent bug.

495
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,660
What do you think?

496
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,730
It is good.

497
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,900
Raise it for another decade or so

498
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,090
and it will become grade 2.

499
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,860
Keen eyes.

500
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,620
The universe is predestined

501
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,010
as countless lives were brought to this world.

502
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,380
They exist,

503
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
so we should learn to admire them.

504
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,050
Don't you think so?

505
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,490
Han Li.

506
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,220
She sees the beauty in everything.

507
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,010
Perhaps

508
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,980
this is another way of cultivating too.

509
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,380
This garden

510
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,860
is wonderful.

511
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,380
I love it.

512
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,140
How is your day?

513
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,530
You don't look happy.

514
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,140
Be happy.

515
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:37,940
Mentor Ma.

516
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,660
How many

517
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,290
did you count today?

518
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,420
If we count the ones on the surface,

519
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,380
there are 7,123 plants.

520
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,290
If we include Jade Wyrm Root that grows underground,

521
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,250
we have

522
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,140
7,177 plants here.

523
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,860
Wrong.

524
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,810
I counted twice.

525
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,700
I am very sure.

526
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,460
Seven thousand,

527
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,460
one hundred,

528
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,050
and eighty-two plants.

529
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,180
Impossible.

530
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,980
Impossible.

531
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,980
That's impossible.

532
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,530
There are five plants

533
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,620
in my hands.

534
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,770
Anyway, you passed.

535
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,330
Take them.

536
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,250
You

537
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,330
barely pass.

538
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,730
Thank you, Mentor Ma.

539
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,180
Can I stay here?

540
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,730
Mentor Ma,

541
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,250
I've tended to herbs before.

542
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,700
Please be reassured.

543
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,980
Wait here.

544
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,770
Don't gawk.

545
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,940
Han Li,

546
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,900
come here.

547
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,620
I told you that if you killed

548
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,330
any plants,

549
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,180
you'd have to pay.

550
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,490
Did you have a backup plan

551
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,460
in your mind already?

552
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,620
I'll do my best.

553
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,290
Good.

554
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,900
Write down anything.

555
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,730
Anyway,

556
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,330
take care of this garden.

557
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,250
I'm going to cultivate in isolation.

558
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,250
You can stay here for the moment.

559
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,810
It makes it easier

560
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,860
for you to manage this place.

561
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,700
I'll return

562
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,730
after one season.

563
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,090
After we harvest them,

564
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,810
you will be rewarded

565
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,090
with plenty of gems.

566
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,050
Do you understand?

567
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,810
Please put your mind at ease, Mentor Ma.

568
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,010
Also,

569
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,180
do not disturb me.

570
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,290
Mentor Ye!

571
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,010
Mentor Ye!

572
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,460
Where did that old man go?

573
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,660
He's often away during the day.

574
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,620
I see he has been tinkering with puppets.

575
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,810
It seems like he is adept

576
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,290
in puppetry.

577
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,730
This is huge.

578
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,010
Wow.

579
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,940
I won't be able to defeat him when I fight him.

580
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,660
That ancient fool.

581
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,420
You're so early.

582
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,290
Are you here to snatch up new tasks?

583
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,730
Mentor Ye,

584
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,900
I heard

585
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,980
you have obtained a Foundation Pill.

586
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,420
I came to thank you.

587
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,180
Why thank me?

588
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,140
An ancient fool like me made a promise

589
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,420
to a fledgling fool like you.

590
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,940
Then

591
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,140
when can I

592
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,730
have the pill?

593
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,050
Be patient.

594
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,980
Just wait.

595
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,620
The disciples will be arriving soon

596
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,620
to accept new tasks.

597
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,330
If you don't mind that they find out about this deal,

598
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,490
you can wait for me here.

599
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,860
Once they are gone,

600
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,010
I'll let you know.

601
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,180
Come in.

602
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,420
Come get your tasks.

603
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,140
Morning, Mentor Ye.

604
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,940
Morning.

605
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,530
Pick whatever task

606
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,380
you like.

607
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,220
Which idiot

608
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,620
took the task in Herbs Garden?

609
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,290
Does he not know how odd Mentor Ma is?

610
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,220
Or how dangerous the herbs are?

611
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,010
Who else can it be?

612
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,290
Who?

613
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,050
The one with the Ascension Token.

614
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,380
So he took it.

615
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,490
It's over for him.

616
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,770
The Herbs Garden

617
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,010
will be his final stop in Yellow Maple Valley.

618
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,050
This garden

619
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,180
is no different from the garden in Shenshou Valley.

620
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,980
It's only bigger in scale.

621
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,330
I can do it.

622
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,330
Water the root and not the leaves.

623
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,420
You need eight hours of sun.

624
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,460
Looking after these plants

625
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,380
feels so much better than hanging out

626
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,090
with those

627
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,140
scheming disciples.

628
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,140
The sun is bright.

629
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,940
Soak it in.

630
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,660
Grow faster.

631
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,290
Bear me more fruits.

632
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,420
My path to riches

633
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,810

When you

accepted the task in Herbs Garden,

665
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,300
I thought

666
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,340
Ye somehow tricked you into it.

667
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,210
It seems like

668
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,690
not only are you good with the art of healing,

669
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,820
you have a talent

670
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,050
for herbal horticulture too.

671
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,260
Not bad.

672
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,340
Mentor Wu,

673
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,420
I merely make use of what I have.

674
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,490
I owe it all

675
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,690
to your trust in me.

676
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,940
It seems like you have mastered the Telepathy skill

677
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,300
that I taught you last time.

678
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,420
I'm leaving.

679
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,340
It's not over yet.

680
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,530
It's not over yet?

681
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,820
Sure. Come.

682
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,980
That feels great.

683
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,300
That's the spot.

684
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,900
Tell me honestly.

685
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,210
What techniques

686
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,530
do you want this time?

687
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,780
I want them all.

688
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,210
I'm not talented

689
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,650
and I joined late.

690
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,170
I have too many things

691
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,340
that I want to learn.

692
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,820
Done.

693
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:23,940
Okay.

694
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,900
I'll teach you

695
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,820
this technique today.

696
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,130
Watch carefully.

697
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,780
This is Freeze.

698
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,130
This is Quicksand.

699
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,130
Don't underestimate these two tricks.

700
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,460
When used by someone powerful enough,

701
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,820
acres of land can turn into desert.

702
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,780
Raging rivers can turn into glaciers.

703
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,490
Try it.

704
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,820
Not bad

705
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,650
for a first try.

706
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,650
Don't rush it.

707
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,340
The efficiency of your spell

708
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,170
depends on

709
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,340
your ability

710
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,940
and your proficiency.

711
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,260
You are not talented,

712
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,610
but you're diligent.

713
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,130
In time,

714
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,490
it will pay off.

715
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,650
Thank you, Mentor.

716
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,570
I'm leaving now.

717
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,300
Also,

718
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,460
when do I come back next?

719
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,010
As often as you want.

720
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,050
All right.

721
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,780
Practice the spells regularly.

722
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,300
Not too shabby.

723
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,340
You've tended to the garden well.

724
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,090
It's all thanks to your notes.

725
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,090
I merely replicated them.

726
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,610
Besides, the weather helped me

727
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,780
to achieve

728
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,170
the results too.

729
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,380
Mentor,

730
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,650
since you know herbs so well,

731
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,130
surely you're well-versed

732
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,210
in alchemy too.

733
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,980
Nonsense.

734
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,740
My apologies.

735
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,090
But

736
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,940
I see lights on the wall

737
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,900
at the loo every night.

738
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,300
I suppose

739
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,610
that is the doing

740
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,460
♪In a fleeting moment called eternity♪

741
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,570
Hence

742
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,980
my question.

743
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,610
If you have the time

744
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,460
to study these things,

745
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,050
it means you have too much time on your hands.

746
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,610
Mentor,

747
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,530
will you give me a few recipes?

748
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,090
Truth be told,

749
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,570
I want to try

750
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,860
refining a pill.

751
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,010
You

752
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,610
are asking for too much.

753
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,210
I spent more than a decade

754
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,570
to come up

755
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,490
with those recipes.

756
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,530
I can't give them to you for free.

757
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,210
Even rough drafts will do.

758
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,260
I can experiment with them myself.

759
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,740
This is a different story.

760
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,420
You passed my trial

761
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,340
at this garden.

762
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,420
But the real challenge

763
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,780
is

764
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,090
doing it consistently.

765
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,460
From now on,

766
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,260
I will drop by every six months.

767
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,050
Take care of this garden.

768
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,610
Do your job well

769
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,860
and you'll

770
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,490
have enough gems

771
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,260
to buy whatever recipes you want.

772
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,860
Thank you, Mentor.

773
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,610
If you truly want recipes,

774
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,380
bring gems with you

775
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,980
to Lushan Hall.

776
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,420
Tell the person in charge

777
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,170
that I told you to go there.

778
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,380
Don't tell anyone.

779
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,820
Thank you so much, Mentor.

780
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,300
You've arrived at Lushan Hall.

781
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,860
How dare you walk in

782
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,820
without gems?

783
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,030
[Mentor Xu, Lushan Hall]

784
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,050
You may borrow books,

785
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,900
make copies,

786
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,170
or rent the alchemy room

787
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,420
but

788
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,740
you need gems for that.

789
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,690
He's mid-tier of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

790
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,940
I know who you are.

791
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,300
I am the one with...

792
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,530
A fake spirit root.

793
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,570
Indeed, Mentor.

794
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,050
Don't call me Mentor. I don't like that.

795
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,490
My surname is Xu. Call me Xu.

796
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,490
Elder Xu.

797
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,340
Xu.

798
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:07,820
Mentor Xu.

799
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,420
Xu.

800
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,940
Elder...

801
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,210
Come.

802
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,740
Go to the right for refinement.

803
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,210
Right?

804
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,380
Your right.

805
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,170
Go to the left for browsing books.

806
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,090
One gem every two hours.

807
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,130
Do not bring anything outside.

808
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,420
Duly noted.

809
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,340
Elder Xu,
