Lv,

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,780
calm down.

What happened to Han Li?

He needs your help now.

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,980
Where is he?

00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,690
Xuan'er.

45
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,860
Xuan'er, what's wrong?

Everyone,

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,380
Xuan'er escaped from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,900
I must send her to the Valley.

49
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,100
Go now.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,900
We'll go rescue Han.

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,620
Xuan'er...

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,490
I feel much better now.

53

The demonic sects

54
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,930
might be on the way back.

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,100
I should take a detour.

56
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,220
My seniors,

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,780
aren't we going to rescue Han?

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,010
This is the wrong way.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,820
Chen.

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,890
The elder sent us a message.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,010
The Yan Clan Stronghold

62
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,780
owns a gem quarry nearby.

63
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,380
The demonic sects must not seize it.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,690
We are ordered to take it immediately.

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,220
Han Li?

66
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,340
Why are you here?

67
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,010
What is she doing here?

Senior Chen.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,060
Is he from

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,170
the Yellow Maple Valley?

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,570
I am Lv Tianmeng

from Moonshadow Sect.

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,890
I am Han Li from Yellow Maple Valley.

77
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,660
I escaped from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

78
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,820
Han.

79
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,100
Are you alright?

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,290
You look badly hurt.

81
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,010
No one else can find out

82
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,660
about the change in our route.

83
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,450
We must keep this person here.

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,100
Agreed.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,060
What's with these two?

86
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,380
This is weird.

87
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,500
For you to escape the Yan Clan Stronghold

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,610
proves you are highly capable.

89
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,240
The rest of us

90
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,130

Things are urgent right now.

93
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:20,780
Join us.

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,130
We can watch

95
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,980
each other's backs.

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,980
Senior Xuan.

97
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,060
Since Han is injured,

98
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,500
he should return to the Valley.

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,100
We can handle

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,290
the mission.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,610
Chen.

102
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,220
The coalition gave an order.

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,730
All Foundation Establishment disciples

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,890
were assigned missions.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,450
Lv has the coalition's official dispatch

106
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,290
as proof.

107
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,570
Han.

108
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,060
Please lend us a hand.

109
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,290
Please don't turn us down.

110
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,290
It seems they are

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,690
ready to accuse me

112
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,340
- if I refuse... - Han.

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,890
to help them.

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,410
Please.

115
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,930
No choice then.

116
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,540
I'll play it by ear.

117
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,900
I accept the order.

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,250
I'll go with you.

119
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,340
Senior Chen.

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,850
What's going on

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,020
with these two?

122
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,410
We were originally ordered

123
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,810
to scout the Yan Clan Stronghold.

124
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,020
But they suddenly changed course.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,930
They claimed to have received

126
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,900
an order to seize a gem quarry.

127
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,730
A gem quarry?

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,780
The Yan Clan Stronghold is overrun.

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,290
With just a few of us,

130
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,100
even if we take it,

131
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,460
can we hold it?

132
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,730
Why did you come?

133
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,900
I couldn't just let you go rescue them

134
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,290
on your own.

135
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,540
Don't worry,

136
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,980
I can handle it alone.

137
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,980
The big battle is coming, and we need you

138
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,580
at the front lines to hold the fort.

139
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,610
We don't even know

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,100
how many enemies are coming this time.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,460
I heard that person leading them.

142
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,370
That is the very reason

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,220
I must go.

144
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,850
Siding with the demonic sects...

145
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,900
Xuan'er!

146
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,700
Are they back?

147
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,170
- Xuan'er! - Master!

148
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,900
Master!

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,370
Mentor.

150
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,980
Mentor.

151
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,140
The Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold sided with the demonic sects.

152
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,170
Han fought to protect me so I could get back.

153
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,610
He's still fighting those villains.

154
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,900
Please go save him

155
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,340
before it's too late.

156
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,250
Alright.

157
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,250
Understood.

158
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,730
Here, take this.

159
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,930
Quick.

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,730
He is in danger right now.

161
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,050
You must go help him.

162
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,220
Go, now.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,610
Wu Xuan.

164
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,730
Yes, Master.

165
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,340
Take good care of her.

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,100
Without your mentor's permission,

167
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,930
she is not to leave the Valley.

168
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,580
Stop standing there.

169
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,850
She just escaped death.

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,740
Do you think she'll

171
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,050
get that lucky again next time?

172
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,250
Yes, Master.

173
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,660
Hold her.

174
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,460
Alright.

175
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,780
Xuan'er is safe.

176
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,170
But your disciple...

177
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,340
I sent Liu Jing

178
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,220
to search for him.

179
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,100
That rascal is pretty clever.

180
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,810
Since he was able to get Xuan'er out,

181
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,050
he must be confident he can escape on his own too.

182
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,050
That would be best.

183
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,170
If he returns safely this time,

184
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,580
as his mentor,

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll have to reward him.

186
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,250
But with this turn of events,

187
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,930
Xuan'er's identity may be exposed.

188
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,730
If she runs into that person,

189
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,220
what then?

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,020
Don't worry, Hongfu.

191
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,470
With me here,

192
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,370
I won't let anyone harm you two.

193
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,930
Quit acting like a hero.

194
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,660
Don't forget,

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,900
you still can't beat me.

196
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,610

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,050

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,460

206
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,660

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,810

Yes!

383
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,420
What are your orders?

384
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,730
Where is my wife?

385
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,180
Latest news is

386
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,610
that she safely arrived

387
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,180
at the Six Sects' territory this morning.

388
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,010
As for Li Feiyu...

389
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,250
Still no sign?

390
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,180
Scouts reported.

391
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,010
No trace

392
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,770
of Yellow Maple Valley disciples on the run.

393
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,460
But they did spot

394
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,650
a few cultivators from the Seven Sects

395
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,220
heading southwest.

396
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,130
Southwest?

397
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,490
It's the Yan Clan Stronghold.

398
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,060
Why would those fools go there?

399
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,100
Let's find out.

400
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,610
Young Master.

401
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,460
There's nothing over there.

402
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,700
Just rocky mountains.

403
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,420
Wide open too.

404
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,770
Are you sure we're going?

405
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,850
Sure!

406
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,820
No harm in taking a look.

407
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,850
Stupid rock, worthless rock!

408
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,610
Tripping Young Master!

409
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,100
Shut up.

410
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,460
Contact our men at the base.

411
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,490
Find out

412
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,610
what those fools are really up to.

413
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,300
As you say, Young Master.

414
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,700
There's a gem quarry there.

415
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,300
I'll send word right away.

416
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,300
Gem

417
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,420
quarry?

418
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,940
A quarry it is!

419
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,610
What are we waiting for?

420
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,250
I was in charge

421
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,650
of the gem trade between Yan Clan

422
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,850
and the Moonshadow Sect.

423
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,420
Now that

424
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,700
they've sided with the demonic sects,

425
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,420
this ill-gotten wealth

426
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,220
is now earned fair and square.

427
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,700
Han from Yellow Maple Valley

428
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,730
may seem like nothing special,

429
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,180
but his strikes were sharp and clean.

430
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,980
He caught me by surprise.

431
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,980
So what if he's good?

432
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,980
We have orders from the sect.

433
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,060
Doesn't matter if he's elite or useless,

434
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,580
he still has to follow our lead.

435
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,340
Now, these gems

436
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,940
seem to be under a seal.

437
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,650
We'll have to break it

438
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,820
before we can store these gems.

439
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,300
So,

440
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,940
we need to act fast.

441
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,220
As I recall,

442
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,060
you are quite skilled with sealing spells.

443
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,940
So...

444
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,980
I leave the place

445
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,650
in your hands now.

446
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,610
You've got a good eye, Xuan.

447
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,580
Before the demon brats

448
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,490
get here,

449
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,460
let's grab

450
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,420
as much as we can.

451
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,730
But let's be clear.

452
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,340
Whatever we get this time,

453
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,850
we split it fifty-fifty.

454
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,220
I promise

455
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,130
you will get a fair share.

456
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,890
You call the shots, Lv.

457
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,820
The sentries are in position.

458
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,820
The defense array is ready.

459
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,180
Senior Chen

460
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,850
truly lives up

461
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,700
to her background.

462
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,770
Mentor Chen.

463
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,730
The array has been set up.

464
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,890
We prepared plenty of gems.

465
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,530
There won't be any mishaps.

466
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,250
Our disciples

467
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,420
are also on high alert.

468
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,220
Go on ahead.

469
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,490
I'll go to you later.

470
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,010
Senior Chen,

471
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,770
well done.

472
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,380
This place...

473
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,420
Han,

474
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,570
I'm so glad you're alright.

475
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,940
How's your injury?

476
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,900
Thanks for your concern.

477
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,660
I'm alright now.

478
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,900
Good to hear.

479
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,730
It's only been a few days,

480
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,420
and you've already grown so skilled.

481
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,980
You must've suffered a lot.

482
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,660
You flatter me.

483
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,530
They are

484
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,290
only some unremarkable tricks.

485
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,140
By the way,

486
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,530
where are the two seniors?

487
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,180
Do you know

488
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,490
their next plan?

489
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,530
When the seven sects coalition

490
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,980
was picking scout teams,

491
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,570
Senior Xuan and Senior Lv

492
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,770
worked well together.

493
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,140
They volunteered.

494
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,620
But for some reason,

495
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,700
they both disappeared

496
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,980
after arriving at the quarry.

497
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,290
This quarry is too important.

498
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,770
I doubt Yan Clan

499
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,220
and the demonic sects

500
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,220
will just give it up.

501
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,090
Once they regroup,

502
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,530
they will return.

503
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,420
This place has an array,

504
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,180
but against the demonic army

505
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,050
and Core Formation cultivators,

506
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,050
it's not enough.

507
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,180
If things go south,

508
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,330
we'll all

509
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,460
be trapped like fish in a barrel.

510
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,660
You're right.

511
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,250
It's not just about the defenses.

512
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,050
We need those two late Foundation Establishment seniors

513
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,730
to lay down a solid plan.

514
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,730
I agree.

515
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,380
Let's split up.

516
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,660
Stay here.

517
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,810
Prepare the array.

518
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,140
I'll look for them.

519
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,050
Mentor Chen.

520
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,530
Mentor Chen.

521
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,010
Where is the core

522
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,530
of the Four-Menace Array?

523
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,290
This quarry is like a maze.

524
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,490
Where do these tunnels lead?

525
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,860
I've got a bad feeling.

526
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,900
Better find a spot

527
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,700
to get ready.

528
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,250
Nice and quiet here.

529
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,660
Perfect.

530
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,980
Time for my talismans

531
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,770
and puppets.

532
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,140
Hey little guy,

533
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,250
where did you come from?

534
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,290
You little rascal.

535
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,810
Impeccable timing.

536
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,940
All done.

537
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,770
With enough gems,

538
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,730
this will do.

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,330
Alright,

540
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,010
here's your task.

541
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,180
Scout out

542
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:51,940
the quarry.

543
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,460
Great Deployment Art

544
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,660
boosts my spiritual sense.

545
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,570
With my current strength,

546
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,140
plus these puppets,

547
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,810
I can take on a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator.

548
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,900
Who's there?

549
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,900
His spirit sense is strong.

550
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,900
Could he be in the late

551
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,940
Foundation Establishment?

552
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,220
No...

553
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,980
The moment he saw me,

554
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,700
he bolted like the wind.

555
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,700
Could it be someone who knows me?

556
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,460
Young Master!

557
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,090
Young Master!

558
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,420
Young Master!

559
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,380
Young Master!

560
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,220
Bad news!

561
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,290
The quarry

562
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,980
has been taken!

563
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,050
By whom?

564
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,620
The guys from the Seven Sects!

565
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,900
The Seven Sects?

566
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,620
And he knows me…

567
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,090
The direction and distance match too…

568
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,660
Could it be you?

569
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,220
Li Feiyu!

570
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,940
That villain never stops haunting me.

571
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,620
I must leave.

572
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,700
Hope Senior Chen sees it

573
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,860
and gets ready.

574
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,250
Yellow Maple Valley's emergency flare!

575
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,860
Firing a signal at a time like this?

576
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,700
Those Yellow Maple Valley fools...

577
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,330
Die, all of you!

578
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,530
Move out at full speed!

579
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,730
A Yellow Maple Valley's emergency flare!

580
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,250
Mentor Chen!

581
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,330
Look, an emergency flare!

582
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,730
We're under attack!

583
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,220
Quick!

584
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,860
Throw gems into the array core!

585
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,900
Activate the defense array!

586
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,140
Yes!

587
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,940
Senior Chen!

588
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,770
We're under attack!

589
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,900
Was that your signal?

590
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,980
Do we have enough gems to power the array?

591
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,220
I sent people to collect a bunch.

592
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,660
But this quarry is huge.

593
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,900
Many areas are empty.

594
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,290
It all depends on

595
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,460
how many enemies there are.

596
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,530
At least a hundred,

597
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,980
but no siege weapons.

598
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,330
Saber-Shearing Sect, Giant Sword Sect!

599
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,290
Go look

600
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,330
for more gems.

601
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,090
The others,

602
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,380
keep powering the array!

603
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,290
Yes!

604
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,380
Finally activated.

605
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,290
This array is way too weak.

606
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,980
It's all low-level cultivators out there.

607
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,860
Are the seniors still not back?

608
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,700
I haven't seen them either.

609
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,700
Something's up.

610
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,570
This is strange.

611
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,490
Senior Chen,

612
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,730
we're from the same sect.

613
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,940
Let me offer a word.

614
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,250
When it gets critical,

615
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,420
we can't count on others.

616
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,900
If things go south,

617
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,330
retreat into the quarry.

618
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,660
You just might survive.

619
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,050
In a pinch,

620
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,980
this might save you.

621
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,900
I'll go look for them.

622
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,620
Be careful, Han.

623
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,010
Everyone

624
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,770
in the Seven Sects knows me.

625
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,530
You will

626
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,810
get your share.

627
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,250
Wait, no!

628
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,220
Yellow Maple Valley just sent up a flare!

629
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,940
The demonic sects

630
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,940
are here!

631
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,490
They are nothing.

632
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,570
What's the panic?

633
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,900
Keep working.

634
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,140
Of all times to show up…

635
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,860
Why now, of all times?

636
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,220
Xuan,

637
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,940
what do you think?

638
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,460
I'll follow your lead, Lv.

639
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,700
If the demonic sects send their main force,

640
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,530
our array

641
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,090
won't stand a chance.

642
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,460
But if we pull everyone out,

643
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,330
the array will collapse.

644
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,810
Someone has to

645
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,900
stay behind to cover the retreat.

646
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,810
Right.

647
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,530
Exactly right.

648
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,900
The sect only sent us here

649
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,700
to gather intel.

650
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,090
As for where the gems end up,

651
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,940
nobody will ask.

652
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,380
Not the Seven Sects,

653
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,940
not the demonic sects,

654
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,810
and not the Yan Clan Stronghold.

655
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,220
However,

656
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,250
the cultivators from the other sects

657
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,090
are a bit of a problem.

658
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,180
Lv,

659
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,770
under a falling nest,

660
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,090
no egg survives.

661
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,490
But still,

662
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,380
if we don't join the defense

663
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,700
and let Chen Qiaoqian

664
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,090
go alone,

665
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,570
people will start suspecting us.

666
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,730
Got it.

667
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,090
How about

668
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,140
you and I each send two men

669
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,570
to hold the fort?

670
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,570
That should shut everyone up.

671
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,570
Alright.

672
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,300
Xiao Liu, Xiao Qi.

673
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,090
Lan Yan, Lan Rong.

674
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,290
Listen up.

675
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,420
Right now,

676
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,860
the quarry's under attack.

677
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,730
It's a matter of life and death.

678
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,940
Each of you, grab a box of gems.

679
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,380
Get to the main hall fast.

680
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,620
Power up the array.

681
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,770
Yes!

682
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,570
Go tell Chen Qiaoqian

683
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,810
we'll be right there.

684
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,330
Yes!

685
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:03,730
You,

686
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,010
start loading.

687
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,090
Yes!

688
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,660
Even the Four-Menace Array is used.

689
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,290
Looks like we picked the perfect time.

690
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,940
Right on time.

691
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,180
They activated the Four-Menace Array.

692
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,620
Li Feiyu, you little pest!

693
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,090
I finally got you now.

694
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,570
I'll vanquish you.

695
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,940
Someone,

696
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,770
tear open that turtle shell for me!

697
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,380
Come on!

698
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,090
Break open Young Master's shell!

699
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,490
Now,

700
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,860
open that turtle shell for the Young Master!

701
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,090
All disciples, listen up!

702
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,530
This quarry is crucial to our front line.

703
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,620
We can't lose it!

704
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,180
You two,

705
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,570
keep powering the array.

706
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,900
The rest,

707
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,900
defend with full power!

708
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:52,980
Yes!

709
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,420
Still putting up a fight, huh?

710
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,420
Scout ahead.

711
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,420
Lv,

712
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,460
it's about time.

713
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,180
Let's pull out.

714
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,980
No choice now.

715
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,860
Let's go.

716
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,980
Young master!

717
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,010
Young master!

718
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,490
If this drags on,

719
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,860
we'll be stuck forever.

720
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,140
How about I head back

721
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,330
and bring some siege gear?

722
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,290
Stop the barrage!

723
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,490
Cease fire!

724
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,770
Cease fire!

725
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,810
Cease fire!

726
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,570
Stop it!

727
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,090
Look!

728
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,490
The bombardment stopped!

729
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,770
The Four-Menace Array

730
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,570
isn't something a normal spell can break.

731
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,180
Could this be Yan Clan's

732
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,380
parting gift to us?

733
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,810
Fight fire

734
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,250
with fire!

735
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,700
Too bad it's burning through gems.

736
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,220
Prepare the Blue-Sun Blaze.

737
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,810
Did I hear that right?

738
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,530
Blue-Sun Blaze?

739
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,420
Young master.

740
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,290
That's a rare magic fire!

741
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,620
It's not worth using here!

742
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,050
Why do you care?

743
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,860
That's the Blue-Sun Blaze!

744
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,780
Keep going!

745
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,460
Keep it up!

746
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,340
Hurry!

747
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,780
Keep powering the defense array!

748
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,050
Are they freaks from the Demonic Flame Sect?

749
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,860
That blast has

750
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,690
the might of a Core Formation cultivator!

751
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,610
Where are Xuan Yue and Lv Tianmeng?

752
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,980
Why are there only four of you?

753
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,940
They are still moving gems in the vault.

754
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,090
They will be here soon.

755
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,610
Keep bombing them.

756
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,050
When it gets critical,

757
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,300
we can't count on others.

758
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,610
If things go south,

759
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,820
retreat into the quarry.

760
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,210
You just might survive.

761
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,900
Everyone, listen up!

762
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,490
The enemies are too strong.

763
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,300
We can't hold this position.

764
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,900
Saving yourselves is what matters most.

765
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,090
Please don't hold back.

766
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,820
Channel all your gems into the formation.

767
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,300
Buy us some time.

768
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,210
Move!

769
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,650
Fall back into the quarry!

770
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,780
Go!

771
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,260
This turtle shell won't hold.

772
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,260
Come on.

773
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,460
It's a maze here.

774
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,090
Where is the treasure?

775
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,940
Almost there.

776
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,940
Found them.

777
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,650
Creeping around like rats.

778
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,170
Looks like

779
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,780
they've been here before.

780
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,170
Two late Foundation Establishment cultivators.

781
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,570
Two late Qi Refining cultivators.

782
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,610
That's trouble.

783
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,380
If they find out

784
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,780
I know what they're up to,

785
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,530
they will silence me.

786
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,530
This is bad.

787
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,460
I'd better run.

788
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,130
Young master,

789
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,690
that was the third shot.

790
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,860
Our cultivators can't take much more.

791
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,050
What do you know?

792
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,170
Down there

793
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,650
are the Seven Sects'

794
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,170
elite meatheads

795
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,740
and Li Feiyu!

796
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,130
He dies here today, no matter what.

797
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,740
Keep blasting!

798
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,900
Move in!

799
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,260
Go!

800
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,740
Wait!

801
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,570
Where is Mentor Chen?

802
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,260
Run!

803
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,210
Head into the quarry!

804
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,900
Hurry!

805
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,690
