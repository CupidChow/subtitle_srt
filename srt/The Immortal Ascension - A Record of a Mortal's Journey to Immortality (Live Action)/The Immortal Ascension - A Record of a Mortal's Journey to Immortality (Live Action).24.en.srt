[Episode 24]

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,580
If I may comment,

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,620
I've fought those four

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,090
Foundation Establishment Blood Guards before.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,730
They are strong.

29
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,980
Especially their Demonic Transformation.

30
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,820
It allows them to ascend

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,410
to the next tier by brute force.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,450
Of course,

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,850
it is not without weaknesses.

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,660
One, the transformation

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,980
requires one to enter a Blood Cocoon.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,260
That takes time.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,050
Two, upon transformation,

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,410
one will be overtaken by the thirst for blood

39
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,620
and lose all

40
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,740
rationality.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,180
We can exploit those two weaknesses.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,660
Do not forget that.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,620
We'll try to waste their time.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,490
My fellow sisters,

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,260
please stick to our plan.

If things go awry,

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,180
quit fighting

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,020

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,900
Stay alert.

Master is training in solitude.

52
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,900
We have released Beguiling Mist in the palace.

53
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,900
So don't fall into a deep slumber

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,130

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,930
Those three scoundrels.

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,060
Who do they think they are?

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,890
How dare they put me on watch duty?

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,450
The enemies will fall for our traps, they said.

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,940
It's just an excuse to shirk.

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,450
Once Master comes out,

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,220
I'll report them to him.

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,130
What is this new gadget?

63
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,010
It's quite useful.

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,730
I assembled it myself.

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,380

67
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,940
I knew it. An ambush.

Kill the messengers first.

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,690

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,100

He's too strong.

95
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,760

Stop him from transforming.

102

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,130
The transformation brings out your animalistic instincts.

113
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,130
If he loses his humanity,

114
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,610
he'll be dead soon.

115

This is bad.

122
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,420
It is a very potent corpse venom.

123
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,130

124
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,820
I can't believe we met again.

125
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,100
How have you been,

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,850
Han?

127
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,610
I see you used the Ascension Token to enroll in Yellow Maple Valley.

128
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,650
And you have reached mid-Foundation Establishment.

129
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,460
You

130
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,130
lured rogue cultivators to join you at Tainan Bazaar.

131
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,890
Thanks to you,

132
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,090
Wu Jiuzhi has turned to this.

133
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,750
Fate keeps me alive

134
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,580
so that I can kill you.

135
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,130
Enough.

136
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,770
For what you did to Wan Xiaoshan,

137
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,650
we'll settle the score today.

138
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,730
Go support Senior Liu.

139
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,770
Take care.

140
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,730
Like I said,

141
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,100
you are mine.

142
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,730
You're different from others.

143
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,850
You fight like a martial artist.

144
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,730
You are smart.

145
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,890
I hail from the Song Clan of Hanzhou.

146

Perhaps you

148
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,340
were also

149
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,580
a martial artist?

150
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,420
Cultivators like you claim to stay away from the mortal affairs.

151
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,530
Yet the endless war in our world

152
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,420
is all orchestrated by the cultivation sects.

153
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,100
You claim to maintain peace.

154
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,980
But in the end,

155
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,460
the mortals pay with their lives.

156
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,610
You're neither a human nor a demon.

157
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,060
You don't have the right

158
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,460
to speak such insolent words

159
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,850
on behalf of all mortals.

160
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,650
Scums from the Seven Sects,

161
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,460
die!

162
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,770
The art of spear

163
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,580
is about

164
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,250
blocking,

165
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,940
lifting,

166
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,770
stabbing,

167

parrying,

168
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,490
striking,

169
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,220
sweeping,

170
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,050
and thrusting.

171
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,620
The same goes for the art of sword.

172
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,290
The longer the weapon,

173
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,140
the stronger it is.

174
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,010
Your reckless fighting technique

175
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,570
does no justice to your monstrous strength.

176
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,380
What a waste.

177
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,250
You talk so much.

178
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,730
We did it.

179
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,330
Careful!

180
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,900
Chen Mu!

181
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,330
Chen Mu.

182
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,530
Chen Mu.

183
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,530
I'm sorry.

184
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,420
You

185
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,530
must taste good too.

186
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,860
Chen Mu.

187
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,010
Chen Mu.

188
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,420
Chen Mu.

189
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,010
Chen Mu.

190
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,980
One less useless ally

191
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,330
for you.

192
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,330
Han,

193
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,380
make it quick.

194
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,380
I need your support.

195
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,050
This is Pinggu's belonging.

196
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,620
Drop dead.

197
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,490
I will crush you

198
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,700
with my bare hands!

199
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,140
Using his blood essence to activate his life-bound treasure?

200
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,180
Senior Liu is going all out.

201
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,290
You are quite durable.

202
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,530
Tell me.

203
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,810
What is your name?

204
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,570
If I'm in a good mood, I'll erect

205
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,490
a tombstone for you.

206
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,570
I am Tie Luo, General of Lanzhou Cavalry.

207
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,770
I'll also be the man who takes your life.

208
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,900
Stop hiding any tricks.

209
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,900
Our foe is strong.

210
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,330
The ice demon is dead.

211
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,050
Transform now

212
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,380
and fight them

213
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,290

Good.

262
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,660
I don't have to intervene then.

263
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,660
Villain.

264
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,380
You cannot leave.

265
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,660
What joy is there in life?

266
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,380
What suffering is there in death?

You cannot leave...

268
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,420
It defeated a mid-Foundation Establishment

269
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,810
demon in one blow.

270
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,460
As expected of a life-bound treasure.

271
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,290
However,

272
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,180
it also burned the mystic pouch to a crisp.

273
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,570
What a waste.

274
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,940
Han.

275
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,220
I consider

276
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,090
this match

277
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,900
a draw.

278
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,980
Well done, Jing!

279
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,860
We've killed them all.

280
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,290
You would sacrifice

281
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,860
your life-bound treasure to kill demons.

282
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,330
How admirable.

283
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,570
You flatter me, Han.

284
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,570
Don't

285
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,900
tell Weiniang about today.

286
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,180
I don't want her to worry.

287
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,570
Chen Mu.

288
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,660
I didn't mean to kill you.

289
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,010
How am I supposed to face others now?

290
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,570
What am I supposed to do now?

291
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,620
Their leader still lives.

292
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,050
No one knows

293
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,050
if the worst will come.

294
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,980
We can't leave him here.

295
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,570
Chen Mu.

296
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,940
Forgive me.

297
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,530
Forgive me.

298
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,530
Chen Mu.

299
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,570
Senior Liu.

300
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:43,940
Senior Song.

301
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,330
Senior Han.

302
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,050
I'll tell

303
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,220
Qiaoqian about Chen Mu myself.

304
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,290
Don't tell her for now.

305
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,900
I don't want her to be distraught.

306
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,660
Of course.

307
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,140
My condolences.

308
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,420
Chen Mu,

309
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,050
let's go home.

310
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,010
Let's go inside.

311
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,810
Something is amiss.

312
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,250
This might be their hideout.

313
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,220
Over here.

314
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,290
Murong Qing.

315
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,490
Zheng Tiannan.

316
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,180
Zhou Yan.

317
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,530
Chu Shanming.

318
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,940
Zhang Wei.

319
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,140
Feng Wan'er.

320
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,900
An Keqiao.

321
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,860
Zhang Shuisheng.

322
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,700
Murong Chu.

323
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,940
These should be

324
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,380
the names of the victims.

325
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,530
Meng Yuan.

326
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,770
Murong Zhu.

327
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,490
Shen Qianxun.

328
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,180
A blood pool?

329
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,140
Jing.

330
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,570
Jing.

331
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,090
Are you all right?

332
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,290
Did you

333
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,090
have a flashback?

334
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,490
We can kill all dark cultivators and demonic sects.

335
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,810
There will always be new ones.

336
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,180
They can't be purged.

337
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,460
You

338
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,730
are too critical of yourself.

339
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,860
It's all in the past.

340
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,570
We're no longer the trembling kids

341
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,700
in the dungeon.

342
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,700
We gained spirit roots

343
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,420
and became Foundation Establishment cultivators.

344
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,460
It's been so many years.

345
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,730
You are still my senior.

346
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,530
I'm still not as capable as you.

347
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,420
Your potential

348
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,050
is far superior to mine.

349
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,770
But you've been suppressing yourself.

350
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,460
You ascend every time after I do

351
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,980
so that I don't feel inferior.

352
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,180
Right?

353
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,940
Just because you don't

354
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,330
say it out doesn't mean I wouldn't know.

355
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,090
Come on. That's not true.

356
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,180
When it comes to cultivation,

357
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,700
there's no waiting for anyone else.

358
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,090
Also,

359
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm not as thoughtful as you imagine.

360
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,010
No need to comfort me.

361
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,180
The experiment those dark cultivators put me through

362
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,700
has damaged my constitution.

363
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,980
I might never reach the Core Formation Stage ever.

364
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,770
Weiniang and you have great potential.

365
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,380
Don't squander your talent away.

366
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,050
You

367
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,660
always make things up.

368
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,220
This is not fun.

369
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,460
I'll check on Han.

370
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,380
Thank you so much for what you've done, Song Meng.

371
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,940
What is going on?

372
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,090
There is no exit.

373
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,220
Jing!

374
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,380
Weiniang.

375
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,940
- Weiniang? - Qiaoqian.

376
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,730
How did you find this place?

377
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,530
We chanced upon

378
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,490
a contraption.

379
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,250
Then, we ran into the emperor

380
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,090
and took the secret passage here.

381
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,570
The Black Fiend Cult

382
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,420
sure has done many things.

383
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,620
[Emperor Yue]
It digs deep.

384
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,730
Greetings,

385
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,770
fellow cultivators.

386
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,220
Thank you for rescuing me.

387
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,460
You're welcome.

388
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,980
It is our duty to kill dark cultivators.

389
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,460
There is a soporific array here.

390
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,090
All mortals will fall asleep.

391
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,010
How do you stay awake?

392
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,810
And did you

393
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,330
run into

394
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,980
any pursuers?

395
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,330
Master,

396
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,220
I have

397
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,660
no idea at all.

398
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,700
I stumbled upon

399
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,530
these two cultivators

400
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,570
and they woke me up.

401
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,980
They even gave me a pill.

402
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,250
Master,

403
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,860
are my

404
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,010
consorts

405
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,340
and ministers

406
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,210
all...

407
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,010
Are they all dead?

408
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,530
Han,

409
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,260
I did give him a sobering pill.

410
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,570
And we truly

411
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,010
did not run into pursuers here.

412
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,820
Han,

413
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,690
the enemies still roam about.

414
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,570
Let's find more clues now.

415
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,300
Any delay will bring more variables.

416
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,780
Come with us.

417
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,490
We can protect you.

418
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,130
Thank you.

419
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,940
Weiniang,

420
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,420
please look after him

421
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,570
with Qiaoqian.

422
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,610
Don't worry about it, Jing.

423
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,860
Let's go.

424
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,130
Seniors.

425
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,460
There might be traps.

426
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,050
What is this place?

427
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,300
What is this place?

428
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,130
I've

429
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,420
never been here either.

430
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,170
Apologies for the lack of reception, my esteemed guests.

431
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,610
But since you're here,

432
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,210
there's no need to leave.

433
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,900
Late Foundation Stage.

434
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,010
He is the leader of Black Field Cult.

435
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,340
Evil cultist.

436
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,300
Chen Rong!

437
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,210
Why did he attack

438
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,690
the weakest Chen Rong first?

439
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,130
Time to return them to their rightful owner.

440
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,650
Are they the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills?

441
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,130
How come there are only four?

442
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,300
You shall not leave!

443
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,010
Come.

444
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,460
Where did he go?

445
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,050
He is a Late Foundation Stage cultivator.

446
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,690
Why did he attack ruthlessly

447
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,490
as if he doesn't care about his life?

448
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,420
Unless

449
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,900
there's something wrong with the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills?

450
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,980
Thank you.

451
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,340
You brought me

452
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,300
the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills.

453
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,980
Everything

454
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,940
is now in order.

455
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:06,980
One.

456
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,740
Two.

457
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,570
Three.

458
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,340
Four.

459
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,420
Who is the last Blood Condensing Five-Element Pill?

460
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,650
Tie Luo is metal.

461
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,210
Qingwen is wood.

462
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,380
The ice demon is water.

463
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,900
Wu Jiuzhi is earth.

464
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,780
He must be fire then.

465
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,130
Oh, no.

466
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,210
He is not the leader of the Black Fiend Cult,

467
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,010
but the last Blood Guard.

468
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,570
Where is

469
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,420
the real leader then?

470
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,340
Jing!

471
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:50,860
Jing!

472
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,380
Weiniang.

473
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,940
- Do not move. - Weiniang.

474
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,130
Or he will die.

475
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,130
Jing.

476
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,210
I'm sorry.

477
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,740
You have to show your face today.

478
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,460
Don't worry, my dear brother.

479
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,050
What's yours is mine.

480
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,130
Villains,

481
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,170
quit pretending.

482
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,690
You sicken me!

483
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,820
Jing.

484
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,130
Stop speaking.

485
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,610
Use your power to heal yourself now.

486
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,380
You're right.

487
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,650
He's

488
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,380
about to die.

489
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,260
Surrender yourself.

490
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,490
Weiniang.

491
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,900
