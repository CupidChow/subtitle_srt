00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,980
I know what's at stake.

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,340
This time,

194
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,980
I'm just trying to track down the missing cultivators.

195
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,610
I won't attempt to assassinate him again.

196
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,170
Lately, several supply runs

197
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,050
have gone through different estates

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,580
under Steward Wang's command.

199
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,340
Although

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,490
they've been careful,

201
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,410
keeping things spread out.

202
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,200
I have a few reliable contacts

203
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,540
in and out of the estate.

204
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,580
Piecing together

205
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,170
what I've learned,

206
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,850
I suspect

207
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,730
those missing cultivators

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,850
are being held in a few specific places.

209
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,700
Give me a moment, Li.

210
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,370
Li, look.

211
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,420
This is the east side of the city,

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,370
too crowded with shops and people.

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,850
Not a good place to keep anyone.

214
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,340
The west side's near the palace,

215
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,370
with guards all over.

216
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,730
Hard to move there.

217
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,770
Not ideal either.

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,700
It should be...

219
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,700
This spot!

220
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,700
We should check out all these places.

221
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,940
Aren't you quite smart?

222
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,490
Come on, let's hear your thoughts.

223
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,060
Earlier,

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,460
that Li fellow went missing

225
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,890
near a base in the south of the city.

226
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,530
And Miss Zhao too.

227
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,770
They both vanished on the way back

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,940
through the South Gate.

229
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,730
So I think

230
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,940
every one of these spots

231
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,730
needs checking!

232
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,460
You really know a lot

233
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,890
for someone so young.

234
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,250
You're amazing.

235
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,580
Someone's right too.

236
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,580
You're a pretty sharp lady.

237
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,370
Miss Cui'er,

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,340
let's talk inside.

239
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,180
Come.

240
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,610
Let's go.

241
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,820
Those two hit it off.

242
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,460
No need to worry there.

243
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,700
I once dreamed

244
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,580
of running a clinic like this.

245
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,730
The simple life of a mortal

246
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,300
isn't so bad.

247
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,220
Li,

248
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,370
here's the rouge you asked for.

249
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,220
Thanks.

250
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,530
How much silver?

251
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,820
I'll have Qin Gui send it over.

252
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,010
Come on, don't be so formal.

253
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,010
We're friends, aren't we?

254
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,650
Still,

255
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,060
this is women's stuff.

256
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,490
Is it

257
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,220
for that Miss Xuan'er we saw last time?

258
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,180
You've got it wrong, Miss Mo.

259
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,850
It's for a senior sister of mine.

260
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,220
She's really into this kind of thing.

261
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,530
Senior Zhong's gotten me in trouble!

262
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm never shopping for her again.

263
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,100
Li,

264
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,610
you sure have

265
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,730
a lot of senior and junior sisters.

266
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,180
Come look!

267
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,850
This herb is so pretty!

268
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,940
She's got talent,

269
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,370
but she's still too naïve.

270
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,980
If no one guides her,

271
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,220
I worry

272
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,250
she'll get herself into trouble.

273
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,770
I still need to do some digging.

274
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,420
Cui'er

275
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,650
may need you to look after.

276
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,180
Sure.

277
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,730
Li,

278
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,490
I know

279
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,180
what you're really thinking.

280
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,370
You said I should look after her,

281
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,060
but in truth,

282
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,490
you want her to protect me, right?

283
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,370
Don't worry.

284
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,460
I can take care of myself.

285
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,890
And of course,

286
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,580
I'll keep an eye on Cui'er too.

287
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,420
I'll make sure she doesn't get in your way.

288
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,700
Here,

289
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,980
take this talisman.

290
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,370
Keep it on you.

291
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,850
If you're in danger,

292
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,980
it'll trigger on its own

293
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,180
to save your life.

294
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,700
Hopefully,

295
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,420
you'll never need it.

296
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,730
Time to go.

297
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,220
Li!

298
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,340
Will I see you again?

299
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,650
He's gone?

300
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,180
Thank goodness!

301
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,650
On the seventh day of the seventh month,

302
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,890
a unit of a hundred men

303
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,420
from Saber-Shearing Sect

304
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,340
was ambushed

305
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,530
at Yanliang Mountain.

306
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,820
More than half were killed or wounded.

307
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,100
After years of fighting,

308
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,980
is there not any good news?

309
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,820
Wan.

310
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,060
Nichang?

311
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,420
Weren't you headed to Tiandu Kingdom for reinforcements?

312
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,700
Why are you here?

313
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,530
Did something major happen at the front?

314
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,730
It's good news.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,100
A victory report just came in.

316
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,420
Spirit Beast Mountain and Skyfort Castle won a big battle.

317
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,130
Elder Han led the charge

318
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,770
and managed to trap

319
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,340
over a hundred Foundation cultivators from Beast Taming Sect.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,850
They even killed

321
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,370
two Core Formation demonic cultivators.

322
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,770
But,

323
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,820
didn't our people

324
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,370
find out before

325
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,770
that Elder Han

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,580
was in close contact with the demonic sects,

327
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,220
even exchanging letters?

328
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,730
Is the report reliable?

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,980
There was contact, sure,

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,770
but it was all part of Elder Han's ruse.

331
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,700
She pretended to defect to gain their trust.

332
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,460
If we hadn't already learned

333
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,130
Beast Taming Sect's route,

334
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,940
this surprise attack

335
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,100
wouldn't have worked.

336
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,180
Still, something feels off.

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,980
If Spirit Beast Mountain

338
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,530
can fool the demonic sects,

339
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,010
what's stopping them

340
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,300
from fooling us too?

341
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,980
Wan,

342
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,580
it's good to be cautious.

343
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,490
But this victory

344
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,650
is real.

345
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,700
Many disciples saw it firsthand.

346
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,980
Some Core Formation cultivators

347
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,890
even fell in the battle.

348
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,180
Even if the demonic sects

349
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,130
and Spirit Beast Mountain were colluding,

350
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,650
they wouldn't throw away

351
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,010
Core Formation cultivators' lives

352
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,130
just to keep up appearances.

353
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,490
This is a much-needed win

354
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,420
after all those bitter fights

355
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
against the demonic scum!

356
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,490
Not bad at all!

357
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,370
Once the dust settles,

358
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,490
I'll go learn from Elder Han.

359
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,130
These past days,

360
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,250
I've been feeling low.

361
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,420
You've been shouldering

362
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,060
the burden of battle command.

363
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,460
It's my fault

364
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,770
for dragging down the Golden Drum Plains campaign.

365
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,610
Hongfu,

366
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,650
still no word on Xuan'er?

367
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,890
That demon keeps moving around.

368
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,770
We have no idea

369
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,890
where he's hiding her.

370
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:14,980
No matter.

371
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,490
Clear Void Sect and Spirit Beast Mountain

372
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,300
will meet up with us in a few days.

373
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,940
Once the main forces gather,

374
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,700
I'll send more people

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,220
to expand the search.

376
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,770
We'll find her for sure!

377
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,940
Wang Chan of Ghost Spirit Sect

378
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,250
seeks an audience with Grandmaster Yunlu!

379
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,010
Please announce him!

380
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,730
You brat's here.

381
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,010
What now?

382
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,580
Come begging for medicine?

383
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,940
So young

384
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,420
and already sick?

385
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,130
Or is it for your father?

386
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,060
You jest, Grandmaster.

387
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,610
I recently came across a rare item,

388
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,220
and thought

389
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,890
it might be of interest to you.

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,700
So I made a special trip to present it!

391
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,420
A rare item?

392
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,890
Let's see it.

393
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,700
Please, Grandmaster.

394
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,610
Take a look!

395
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,850
Wang Chan of Ghost Spirit Sect

396
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,490
greets Grandmaster Yunlu!

397
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,420
Unbelievable...

398
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,020
[Grandmaster Yunlu]

399
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,050
How's your mother?

400
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,290
Is she doing well?

401
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,660
My mother...?

402
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,620
Time flies.

403
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,140
You've grown so much already.

404
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,200
What's your name?

405
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm Dong Xuan'er.

406
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,510
Still so stubborn.

407
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,460
My master

408
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,010
is supposed to be righteous!

409
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,660
How would she side with you demonic lot?

410
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,660
Righteous?

411
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,140
Demonic?

412
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,050
Who filled your head with such outdated nonsense?

413
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,940
The so-called Seven Sects

414
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,490
were all born from the Six Demonic Sects.

415
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,810
A few centuries ago,

416
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,620
the Righteous Alliance and the Grassland Clans invaded.

417
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,250
They took advantage of the chaos

418
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,050
and broke away.

419
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,330
They act all high and mighty,

420
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,010
but they're just a bunch

421
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,330
of self-righteous fame chasers.

422
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,050
I've never heard

423
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,770
any of that before.

424
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,900
Someone like Grandmaster Yunlu

425
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,330
has no reason

426
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,250
to lie to you.

427
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,180
Moonshadow Sect came from Joyful Union Sect.

428
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,620
Spirit Beast Mountain

429
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,380
was born of Beast Taming Sect.

430
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,770
And now,

431
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,810
even Yan Clan Stronghold

432
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,460
has returned to Ghost Spirit Sect.

433
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,980
The Seven Sects

434
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,620
are already on the verge of collapse.

435
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,220
Is that so?

436
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,330
Maybe it's time

437
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,330
your father here

438
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,620
gave you a real education.

439
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,250
Father?

440
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,140
A tiger's cub

441
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,940
should never live among sheep.

442
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,420
Xuan'er,

443
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,250
from this day on,

444
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,810
you are my direct disciple.

445
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,420
You are no longer allowed

446
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,900
to practice anything from Yellow Maple Valley.

447
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,770
With your gift of enchantment,

448
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,460
you should cultivate the ultimate art of Joyful Union Sect.

449
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,090
I told you,

450
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,660
you owe me a thanks.

451
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,490
Now go on, acknowledge your kin,

452
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,570
and call him Master.

453
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,730
So this man is really my father?

454
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,490
I never knew.

455
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,380
Congrats, Grandmaster!

456
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,700
Today,

457
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,420
you're finally reunited with your dear Xuan'er.

458
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,090
I won't forget this great favor

459
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,770
from Ghost Spirit Sect.

460
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,810
But tell me,

461
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,220
how did you and Xuan'er meet?

462
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,980
When you brought her here,

463
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,140
didn't her mother stop you?

464
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,530
My mother...

465
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,050
Could it be Master Hongfu?

466
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,460
Is she

467
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,290
really my mother?

468
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,460
Reporting,

469
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,460
Xuan'er and I first met

470
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,980
at Yan Clan Stronghold.

471
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,220
Even back then, I could tell

472
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,660
she carried a powerful legacy.

473
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,140
Honestly, Yellow Maple Valley

474
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,810
is rotten from top to bottom.

475
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,660
They even had male and female disciples

476
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,940
train together.

477
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,090
They clearly wanted them to pair off.

478
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,530
I've seen Xuan'er

479
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,250
blushing like crazy.

480
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,620
You'd better be careful,

481
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,290
or some sleazy guy may trick you,

482
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,940
and mess with your cultivation.

483
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,660
That's enough nonsense!

484
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,050
Is that true?

485
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,380
What's that guy's name?

486
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,810
Just some nobody,

487
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,770
not worth mentioning.

488
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,250
He's Li Feiyu.

489
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,530
Of course,

490
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,490
if you

491
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,250
hadn't asked,

492
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,980
that name

493
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,490
wouldn't be worth speaking in your presence.

494
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,290
You're the one not worthy!

495
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,530
I am!

496
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,060
[A few days later]

497
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,860
This ancient book isn't ordinary.

498
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,940
Too bad I only understand the intro, some Aura Concealment Technique.

499
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,090
The rest is hard to decipher.

500
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,770
I'll find someone

501
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,050
to translate it later.

502
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,900
It's been days now,

503
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,460
and still no sign.

504
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,620
I can't sense Wu Sanxing's spirit at all.

505
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,730
Maybe...

506
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,380
he's been killed?

507
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,420
Come on, let's go!

508
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,080
That's enough!

509
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,770
Move!

510
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,570
Move, Wu!

511
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,140
Let's go!

512
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,570
Poor Wu.

513
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,250
They got him in the end.

514
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,460
But those guys who buried him

515
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,730
look so familiar.

516
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,380
Da,

517
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,460
are they gone?

518
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,570
- Yeah, they're gone. - So it really was them.

519
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,900
That's just despicable.

520
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,570
Wait.

521
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,090
Where are you all headed?

522
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,050
Shall I send you off myself?

523
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,380
Who's that?

524
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,940
Who are you?

525
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,220
Say your name!

526
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,380
Hiding your face like that,

527
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,870
what kind of coward are you?

528
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah!

529
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,910
Hang us longer,

530
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,090
and our heads are going to burst!

531
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,380
The gang of us

532
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,730
doesn't ask to be born the same day!

533
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,980
Only to die the same day!

534
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,490
If you want to kill us,

535
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,730
make it quick!

536
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,810
Yeah, make it quick.

537
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,420
Ow!

538
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,530
Weren't there five of you?

539
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,220
Where's the last one?

540
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,940
How'd he know that?

541
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,980
Are we famous now?

542
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,220
Our name's finally out there!

543
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,380
Where's the last one?

544
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,490
San?

545
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,980
She's been taken.

546
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,700
San's been kidnapped.

547
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,220
Da!

548
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,050
That's a Wind Barrier spell.

549
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,420
You won't break through.

550
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,330
Da, he's over there!

551
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,180
Spill everything you know.

552
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,050
Right now.

553
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,730
No?

554
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,700
Then rot in there.

555
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,730
- Please! - Senior!

556
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,980
- Please, Senior! - Senior!

557
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,330
We're just victims too!

558
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,010
Yeah, we're the pitiful ones!

559
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,220
We were cursed

560
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,290
and bound by a spell!

561
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,090
We...

562
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,010
Who cursed you?

563
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:13,940
Black...

564
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,900
Black Fiend Cult!

565
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,010
Why?

566
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,810
They controlled us.

567
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,250
They made us help them

568
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,620
lure and capture rogue cultivators

569
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,290
around Yue Kingdom.

570
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,940
Where are those rogue cultivators now?

571
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,140
The rogues...

572
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,900
We don't know.

573
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,570
So basically,

574
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,900
you've all got blood

575
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,860
on your hands.

576
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,420
Blood?

577
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,940
We'd never dare kill cultivators!

578
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,220
- Yeah! - We kept our hands clean!

579
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,660
Then who killed the ones you buried?

580
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,570
It... it wasn't us!

581
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,810
Steward Wang of Prince Xin's Mansion told us to bury them!

582
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,860
And the others?

583
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,620
I'm telling you,

584
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,530
those cultivators

585
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,900
weren't killed.

586
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,140
The Black Fiend Cult

587
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,140
just hid them away somewhere!

588
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,010
Where are they hidden?

589
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,770
They're hidden at...

590
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,730
at...

591
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,570
at...

00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,860
We really don't know.

Senior!

594
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,860
We do know!

595
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,090
- We know! We'll take you there! - Senior!

596
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,980
Are you with the Seven Sects?

597
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,570

00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,490
Senior,

599
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,180
I once met Elder Liu

600
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,490
from your side.

601
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,050
He's our second uncle.

602
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,230
- No, our eldest uncle. - Yeah, eldest.

603
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,180
Eldest or second, uncle's still uncle.

604
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,560
Right.

605
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,090
Senior,

606
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,730
please help us

607
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,730
break the blood curse

608
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,900
and lift the restriction spell.

609
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,010
We swear to aid you

610
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,620
in wiping out the Black Fiend Cult

611
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,900
and restoring justice!

612
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,860
Even if it costs us our lives!

613
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,860
The Five Meng

614
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,490
is known for our loyalty!

615
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,250
The Five Meng? What a joke!

616
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,420
They can't do anything right,

617
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,420
only good at screwing things up!

618
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,090
They're just outer disciples

619
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,490
who never passed the sects' entrance trials.

620
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,980
The Master already put a blood curse on them long ago.

621
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,660
Good thing you were sharp enough.

622
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,620
Now those losers

623
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,290
won't be blabbing anymore.

624
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,490
That Wu Sanxing guy

625
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,420
clearly had backup.

626
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,570
But that may not be a bad thing.

627
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,770
The Master happens to need

628
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,490
Foundation Establishment Stage blood for his cultivation.

629
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,940
This guy

630
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,180
may be just what he needs.

631
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,770
If anyone else starts asking questions

632
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,570
like Wu did,

633
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,010
they're probably connected to him.

634
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,090
We can capture them too

635
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,180
and offer them to Master!

You're finally back!

643
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,530
Master,

644
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,050
you lifted the spell on us

645
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,980
and rescued our sister too.

646
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,460
This is a debt

647
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,860
we'll never forget!

648
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,860
Enough.

649
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,940
Get up, all of you.

650
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,900
Get up.

651
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,420
Since the five of you were forced into it,

I won't report this

to the sects.

However,

655
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,290
if you're truly turning over a new leaf,

656
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,050
you'd better make up for what you've done.

657
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,380

does the Black Fiend Cult have in this city?

661
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,290

00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,780
Wu!

767
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,820
We can't stop her!

768
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,210
I'll...

769
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,210
What did you do?

770
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,780
Someone stay and watch her.

771
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,690
You're in trouble now!

772
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,490
I...

773
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,740
Wu!

774
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,690
That hide is tough!

775
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,050
Looks like

776
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,090
we won't break through anytime soon.

777
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,980
Wait!

778
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,690
I'm Prince Xin's son!

779
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,980
The Seven Sects made a pact.

780
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,740
Cultivators aren't allowed

781
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,650
to harm royal bloodlines!

782
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,490
Their rules

783
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,010
don't apply to me.

784
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,210
If you're not one of the Seven Sects,

785
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,210
then why get involved?

786
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,690
Because I feel like it.

787
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,650
Watch him.

788
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,420
Don't kill him!

789
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,900
Master!

790
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,260
Master!

791
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,490
It was the Black Fiend Cult

792
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,740
who set you up!

793
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,170
It was all them!

794
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,170
I was forced into this!

795
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,420
I've never had

796
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,650
a personal grudge with you!

797
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,780
If you let me go today,

798
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,610
I'll reveal every secret I know

799
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,860
about the Black Fiend Cult.

800
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,940
I heard you're from Lanzhou.

801
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,530
Do you know someone named Mo Juren?

802
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,940
Master,

803
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,460
what's your grudge with him?

804
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,860
That man

805
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,860
once tried to kill me

806
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,490
and failed.

807
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,340
So in a way,

808
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,380
I helped you get revenge.

809
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,380
I wiped out his entire clan.

810
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,650
You're on the path to immortality,

811
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,570
so why target a mortal family?

812
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,940
Just a bunch of mortals.

813
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,460
So what if they're dead?

814
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,050
He dared to rival me once.

815
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,460
That was enough.

816
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,170
I was going to ask

817
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,610
about your demonic transformation technique...

818
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,130
Master,

819
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,780
if you'll spare

820
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,900
my life,

821
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,300
I'll give you the technique

822
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,260
willingly!

823
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,210
Forget it.

824
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,980
Scum like you

825
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,130
should just die.
