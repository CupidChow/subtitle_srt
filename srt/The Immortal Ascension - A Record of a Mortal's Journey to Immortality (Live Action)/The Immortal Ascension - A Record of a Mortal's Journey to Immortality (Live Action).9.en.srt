00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,530
He wants in,

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,490
but afraid we'll take his spot.

195
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,060
So he's trying to scare us off.

196
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:23,940
But...

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,340
what if he's telling the truth?

198
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,300
Airship approaching!

199
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,300
Elders,

200
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,130
thanks for coming all this way.

201
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,100
I greet you

202
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,820
with respect!

203
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,060
I've prepared tea and fruit

204
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,730
in the Qianji Library.

205
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,220
Please,

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,370
come with me.

207
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,770
Mentor,

208
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,850
everything is ready.

209
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,490
You may go now.

210
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,180
Yes.

211
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,850
Come on,

212
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,370
eat up.

213
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,100
Try this.

214
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,180
Try one of these pastries.

215
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,580
- This one's good. - Smells amazing!

216
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,300
Tastes good.

217
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,770
Better than last time.

218
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,940
Stop eating!

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,940
We haven't even had enough yet.

220
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,530
The Bloody Trial Ground is about to open.

221
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,420
Per tradition,

222
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,940
the Solunar Purification Pearl,

223
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,010
held by Yellow Maple Valley,

224
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,180
must now be passed

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,650
to the next sect,

226
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,650
the Moonshadow Sect.

227
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,730
Hongfu,

228
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,770
please wait.

229
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,850
Before we transfer the pearl,

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,220
there's something

231
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,220
I'd like to discuss with the elders.

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,220
Isn't this a Foundation Pill?

233
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,700
But the quality's a bit poor.

234
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,460
Mine's slightly better.

235
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,650
These two Foundation Pills

236
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,250
must've been made

237
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,180
in different batches.

238
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,610
That's right.

239
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,980
The one Fu Yunzi has was made with herbs

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,060
gathered from the Trial Ground twenty years ago.

241
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,460
And

242
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,460
mine?

243
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,940
Yours was made with recent herbs from the Trial Ground.

244
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,300
They're both Foundation Pills,

245
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,340
but the quality difference is clear.

246
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,180
I believe you all

247
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,100
have noticed it as well.

248
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,010
The quantity and quality of spiritual herbs

249
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,490
in the Trial Ground

250
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,530
aren't what they used to be.

251
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,010
Therefore,

252
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,370
on behalf of Moonshadow Sect,

253
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,980
I propose that after this trial,

254
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,340
we enter an early seal period,

255
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,700
and seal the Trial Ground

256
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,890
for sixty years.

257
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:12,980
What?

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,180
Sixty years?

259
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,270
That's way too long!

260
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,250
Exactly!

261
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,490
Li!

262
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,820
It's really you!

263
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,700
Miss Han!

264
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,980
After we parted at Tainan Valley,

265
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,060
I thought I'd never see you again.

266
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,420
I didn't expect

267
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,850
you'd join Yellow Maple Valley.

268
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,890
I should be thanking you

269
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,250
for that book you gave me.

270
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,940
Miss Han,

271
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,700
are you here for Seven Sects' Summit too?

272
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,650
Oh right.

273
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,980
Just ahead,

274
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,420
there are snacks for Qi Refining disciples.

275
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,890
Go give them a try.

276
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,980
Those over there

277
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,820
are all about to reach the Foundation Establishment Stage.

278
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,180
Just sitting near them

279
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,460
makes me nervous.

280
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,530
I'll pass.

281
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,610
Thank you, Li.

282
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,850
Miss Han,

283
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,250
are you going into the Bloody Trial Ground too?

284
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,340
My brother's old illness flared up.

285
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,700
He's been unconscious.

286
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,850
Only the Solarflame Blossom from the Trial Ground

287
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,980
can save him.

288
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,220
Can't your elders

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,420
cure him?

290
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,770
That's why

291
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,890
I have to find the Solarflame Blossom myself

292
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,980
to cure my brother.

293
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,770
Even if I die trying.

294
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,100
You're so nice to your brother.

295
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,250
I have a younger sister too.

296
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,420
When I left home,

297
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,220
she was about this tall.

298
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,130
The herbs in the Trial Ground

299
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,250
are incredibly rare.

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,580
Even with one opening every five years,

301
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,770
we barely gather enough for Foundation Pills.

302
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,650
And now it's sixty years between?

303
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,300
[Elder Han, Spirit Beast Mountain]
How should we make up the shortfall?

304
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,530
Exactly!

305
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,420
That's right!

306
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,940
Yeah!

307
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,820
Your Moonshadow Sect is rich and powerful.

308
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,610
Of course you've stocked up on Foundation Pills.

309
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,940
But the rest of us?

310
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,490
Our disciples are still waiting in line.

311
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,250
- Exactly! - That's right!

312
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,010
What are we supposed to do?

313
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,420
Foundation Pills matter

314
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,820
because they're for the younger generation.

315
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,580
But every time the Trial Ground open,

316
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,940
nearly half the Qi Refining disciples end up dead.

317
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,620
Do their lives

318
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,250
mean nothing

319
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,490
to you elders?

320
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,620
Heaven's way never changes,

321
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,010
not for sages, not for tyrants.

322
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,570
Does your compassion

323
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,290
outweigh the way of Heaven?

324
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,860
You're putting a mere Foundation Pill

325
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,050
on par with the way of Heaven?

326
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,860
That's a bit much.

327
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,170
Seems like

328
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,380
your Yellow Maple Valley

329
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,700
is siding with Moonshadow Sect.

330
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,700
Rare treasures in this world

331
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,660
are limited by nature.

332
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,160
Some spirit herbs

333
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,200
take a hundred,

334
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,680
even a thousand years to mature.

335
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,010
But in recent years,

336
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,770
disciple numbers have skyrocketed,

337
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,980
while herbs

338
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,010
only get scarcer with every pick.

339
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,140
Exactly.

340
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,940
At this rate,

341
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,460
we're just killing the golden goose.

342
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,770
Besides,

343
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,940
I heard the Six Demonic Sects are starting to stir again.

344
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,980
We should be minimizing losses,

345
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,330
or what if they strike?

346
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,290
Demonic sects?

347
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,980
It's been centuries,

348
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,090
and every year someone claims they're back.

349
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,770
But aside from us old-timers,

350
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,620
who's ever actually seen them?

351
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,420
True!

Always in a rush, huh?

[Elder Gui, Early Core Stage]
The Seven Sects of Yue Kingdom

359
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,900
are a chaotic mess.

360
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,980
If we just charge in blindly,

361
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,250
how many men are we going to lose?

362

363
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,250
forgive me.

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,810
Of course I am.

385
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,900
The three of us are enough.

386
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,620
Just the three of us?

387
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,860
No need for a full army?

388
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,250
Besides, the Bloody Trial Ground

389
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,770
is about to open.

390
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,570
Time for those blockheads

391
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,050
from the Seven Sects

392
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,810
to get busy.

393
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,460
And another thing:

394
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,010
once you two get there,

395
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,250
keep your mouths shut.

396
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,860
They don't talk the way you do.

397
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,220
Yes, Young Master.

398
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,220
Yes, Young Master.

399
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,090
That's true.

400
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,860
You've all been around the sects for years.

401
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,980
Don't you know full well

402
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,380
how the Seven Sects are doing?

403
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,140
How do they compare to five years ago?

404
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,140
Or sixty years ago?

405
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,850
It's because our strength is fading

406
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,460
that we need the Trial Ground

407
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,810
to gather more herbs,

408
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,380
so our Qi Refining disciples

409
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,140
can grow stronger

410
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,330
and level up.

411
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,900
Exactly!

412
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,380
That's right.

413
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,180
We can't just avoid

414
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,490
the Trial Ground out of fear.

415
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,250
Won't that

416
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,490
be throwing the baby out with the bathwater?

417
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,140
Exactly!

418
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,860
It's just not worth it!

419
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,900
Anyway, we don't agree.

420
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,330
Why's everyone so stubborn?

421
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,130
- I'm fine either way. - You sure?

422
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,010
Before, it was a gamble every five years.

423
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,700
Now it's one shot every sixty.

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,490
I just wonder

425
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,140
Can some folks afford

426
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,180
to wait that long?

427
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,900
Hey, you talking about me?

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,010
Hongfu,

429
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,380
please activate the Solunar Purification Pearl.

430
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,180
Hongfu,

431
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,900
if you would.

432
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,090
What's that?

433
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,900
The Solunar Purification Pearl!

434
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,810
Looks like something's up with the elders.

435
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,980
I'll go check it out.

436
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,940
Miss Han.

437
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,620
Come back safe from the Trial Ground.

438
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,660
See you!

439
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,620
What's the Solunar Purification Pearl?

440
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,460
Fellow Elders,

441
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,380
have you noticed

442
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,980
anything different about the pearl?

443
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,460
It's dimmer.

444
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,250
It's not as bright

445
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,380
as it used to be.

446
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,620
That's right.

447
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,900
The Solunar Purification Pearl

448
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,010
was crafted by our sect's ancestors

449
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,140
to dispel the mists within the Trial Ground.

450
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,940
It glows with the essence of sun and moon.

451
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,290
But what you may not know

452
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,810
when the heavens shift,

453
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,570
the pearl is affected too.

454
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,770
Sun and moon should shine steady

455
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,090
through the ages.

456
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,090
But with the Trial Ground opening too often,

457
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,010
the spiritual energy is drying up,

458
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,290
and the pearl has lost its glow.

459
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,490
Doesn't that prove my point?

460
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,810
Now you understand?

461
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:38,980
Come on,

462
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,220
let's talk this through.

463
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,570
The Trial Ground is so dangerous.

464
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,380
Maybe I should wait for the next round

465
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,050
when I'm better prepared.

466
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,330
Did you hear that?

467
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,090
From now on,

468
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,660
the Trial Ground will open once every sixty years.

469
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,770
Getting a Foundation Pill

470
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,940
just got a lot harder.

471
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,010
Yeah.

472
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,770
If you don't reach the Foundation Establishment Stage,

473
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,460
your lifespan tops out at around 200 years.

474
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,010
Wait another sixty,

475
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,570
we'll be old by then.

476
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,530
Why not take this chance?

477
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,010
Let's ask my cousin.

478
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,980
If she goes, we go.

479
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,090
No need to ask.

480
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,050
If that Lu guy's going,

481
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,090
you know she'll follow.

482
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,700
But the rules have changed this time.

483
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,140
There'll be way more disciples than usual.

484
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,140
We've got to be extra careful.

485
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,460
Losing your life over this

486
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,730
just won't be worth it.

487
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,460
Alright.

488
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,570
Let's go.

489
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,660
Everyone's lining up to sign in.

490
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,660
Let's move!

491
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,090
Once it closes again,

492
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,140
it won't reopen for sixty years!

493
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,290
Senior Xiang,

494
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,860
didn't they say

495
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,860
those signing up for the Trial Ground

496
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,660
should gather here?

497
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,940
Are we having the wrong spot?

498
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,730
Who are you all waiting for?

499
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,420
I'm right here.

500
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,620
Grandmaster!

501
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,330
Greetings, Grandmaster!

502
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,810
Quite a turnout.

503
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,770
Are you all ready

504
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,220
to throw your lives away?

505
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,700
I'm not trying to scare you,

506
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,220
but out of thousands in our sect,

507
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,420
do you know

508
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,700
how many have reached the Foundation Establishment Stage?

509
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,860
Barely a hundred.

510
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,180
And do you know why?

511
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,140
Because Foundation Pills are rare.

512
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,380
That's only part of it.

513
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,460
Listen,

514
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,290
Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment may be just one stage apart.

515
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,900
However,

516
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,090
the gap between them

517
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,220
is like night and day.

518
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,810
That's why

519
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,010
so many people,

520
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,490
just like you,

521
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,010
all want to enter

522
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,090
the Trial Ground,

523
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,220
hoping to get lucky.

524
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,490
And the result?

525
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,730
They die for nothing.

526
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,220
Forget reaching Foundation Establishment,

527
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,620
just surviving is a long shot.

528
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,460
So,

529
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,730
if you haven't come

530
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,220
with the resolve to die,

531
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,180
I suggest you leave now

532
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,140
before your cultivation journey ends here.

533
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,090
Of course,

534
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,290
if you've heard me out

535
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,050
and still want to go,

536
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,220
step forward.

537
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,090
Let's see who's got guts.

538
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,180
Let's go.

539
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,700
Wait...

540
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,330
Hurry up!

541
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,980
You thirteen guys here

542
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,420
have heard

543
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,090
the Trial Ground

544
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,980
won't open again for sixty years, right?

545
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,090
Not bad.

546
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,010
Smart thinking.

547
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,460
Our Yellow Maple Valley

548
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,010
has fifteen spots

549
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,050
this time.

550
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,090
Two are still open.

551
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,050
Me!

552
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,420
Count me in!

553
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,490
Can you handle it

554
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,460
at your age?

555
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,050
I just can't wait another sixty years!

556
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,940
Fair enough.

557
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,180
That leaves one spot.

558
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,050
Alright then.

559
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,570
I'll count to three.

560
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,460
One...

561
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,530
Jumped early, huh?

562
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,860
You're only at Tier 11 of Qi Refining.

563
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,140
You want to die out there?

564
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,090
Grandmaster,

565
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,460
I may lack talent,

566
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,220
but I don't have sixty years

567
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,090
to spare.

568
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,770
Please grant me this chance.

569
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,570
Not bad.

570
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,180
Bold kid.

571
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,420
I like it.

572
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,330
Shame about the talent though.

573
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,810
Alright,

574
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,810
the rest of you

575
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:24,940
go home.

576
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,490
Grandmaster!

577
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,490
I want to go too!

578
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,140
Grandmaster!

579
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,730
What were you waiting for earlier?

580
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,290
Get back for now.

581
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,010
If you still want to go,

582
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,660
wait for the next batch sixty years later.

583
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,090
I'll be 120 in sixty years, Grandmaster!

584
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,860
Please, give us one more chance!

585
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,380
There's still training and testing ahead.

586
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,250
If someone drops out,

587
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,380
you may get called in.

588
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,460
Alright, enough. Head back.

589
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,420
Go on, now.

590
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,220
We're so lucky.

591
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,330
Getting picked today

592
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,900
took some luck!

593
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,730
Everything starts with courage.

594
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,940
Congratulations.

595
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,530
You've passed the first round

596
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,250
of my test.

597
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,620
Thank you, Grandmaster!

598
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,570
The Bloody Trial is more than just a treasure hunt.

599
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,810
This is a mission

600
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,700
that affects our sect's standing among the Seven Sects.

601
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,860
It can shape our future power.

602
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,460
To make sure you all come back alive,

603
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,140
I'll be training you thoroughly.

604
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,940
This trip is extremely dangerous.

605
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,290
If you're having second thoughts,

606
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,730
now's the time to back out,

607
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,220
before you lose your life in there.

608
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,980
Inside, the weather's brutal

609
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,220
and wildly unpredictable,

610
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,520
with rugged terrain.

611
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,240
Many don't even survive day one,

612
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,100
brought down

613
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,090
by nature itself.

614
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,810
You'll need to memorize these herbs:

615
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,090
Jade Marrow Mushroom,

616
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,620
Violet Monkey Blossom,

617
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,330
and Celestial Essence Fruit.

618
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,090
These are key herbs

619
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,010
for the Foundation Pill.

620
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,090
The Trial Ground

621
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,860
is crawling with demon beasts.

622
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,530
If you want those herbs,

623
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,380
you'll have to get past them first.

624
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,180
If you can't,

625
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,490
you'll be their dinner.

626
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,330
The disciples in the Trial Ground

627
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,570
fall into three general categories.

628
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,380
First,

629
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,900
the weak ones,

630
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,490
like some of you here.

631
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,530
Some are forced to come,

632
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,180
others are just gambling on luck.

633
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,620
These disciples

634
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,290
usually don't survive the first day.

635
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,810
Second,

636
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,670
those with decent cultivation

637
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,330
but not true experts.

638
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,770
Some of them cut corners.

639
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,290
They skip herb gathering

640
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,420
and try

641
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,090
to kill others for loot.

642
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,220
But by day three,

643
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,900
the cleverest among them

644
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,660
start vanishing

645
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,460
in the Trial Ground,

646
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,700
without a trace.

647
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,460
That's when

648
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,220
the third group shows up.

649
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,460
Grandmaster,

650
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,290
what about the third group?

651
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,010
They're the ones

652
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,090
who know

653
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,180
how to bide their time

654
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,570
and hide their power.

655
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,250
When they finally strike,

656
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,220
they each

657
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,700
reveal their true strength.

658
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,690
Grandmaster!

659
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,070
With all that said,

660
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,810
which group survives the most?

661
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,380
Naturally, the third,

662
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,770
the real powerhouses.

663
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,770
Wrong.

664
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,900
It's the first group.

665
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,860
The...

666
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,980
the first group?

667
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,530
Standing out makes you a target.

668
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,380
Everyone entering the Trial Ground

669
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,050
has some kind of skill.

670
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,180
But without caution,

671
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,860
even the strongest

672
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,140
end up dead and gone.

673
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,420
And the weakest?

674
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,170
They accept their limits early on.

675
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,040
And that

676
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,140
often help them make it out alive.

677
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,730
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

678
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,340
- We won't be cowards - "Do good with discretion."

679
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,750
- in the Trial Ground! - Never thought

680
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,670
everything Physician Mo taught me...

681
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,260
Let's grab the most spirit herbs!

682
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,780
- ...would still hold up in the cultivation world. - Let's beat Moonshadow Sect!

683
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,250
Let's beat Moonshadow Sect!

684
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,700
We'll crush Saber-Shearing Sect!

685
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,680
- Crush them! - Crush them!

686
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,800
We're outpacing Spirit Beast Mountain!

687
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,600
We'll wipe out Giant Sword Sect!

688
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,970
We'll wipe out Giant Sword Sect!

689
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,080
Alright, that's enough.

690
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,240
I love the enthusiasm.

691
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,330
But I'll say it again:

692
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,050
what matters most is coming back alive.

693
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,700
Yes, Grandmaster.

694
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,770
The Solunar Purification Pearl

695
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,460
was crafted by our ancestors

696
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,180
specifically for navigating the Trial Ground.

697
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,490
It emits radiant light

698
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,140
and suppresses

699
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,330
all manner of toxic mist.

700
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,040
In the Bloody Trial,

701
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,720
there's an artifact

702
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,460
called the Solunar Purification Pearl.

703
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,290
It shines like sun and moon.

704
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,810
It worked so well

705
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,730
in the Trial Ground

706
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,420
that the other six sects protested.

707
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,660
Our sect

708
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,220
had to surrender it.

709
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,330
It became shared property of all Seven Sects.

710
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,410
After each Bloody Trial,

711
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,730
the sect holding the pearl

712
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,810
must pass it to the next.

713
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,250
This year,

714
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,090
it's returned to our hands.

715
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,050
The Seven Sects agreed:

716
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,420
the pearl can only be activated

717
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,980
on the fourth day.

718
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,900
So, Grandmaster,

719
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,900
does that mean it'll be easier

720
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,050
to collect herbs on day four?

721
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,660
Quite the opposite.

722
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,490
Until the Solunar Purification Pearl appears,

723
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,420
you'll be relatively safe.

724
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,250
Once it's out,

725
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,140
you better start hiding.

726
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,940
Why's that?

727
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,900
Because its appearance signals the start of killing.

728
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,140
Think about it.

729
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,980
If you've spent three days

730
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,330
and still haven't found a single herb,

731
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,220
what will you do

732
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,380
with limited time left?

733
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,570
Kill for treasure.

734
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,900
Now, I must pass the pearl

735
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,250
to one of you.

736
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,980
Yan Ruyan.

737
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,810
I won't let you down, Master.

738
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,940
How's your health lately?

739
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,420
Any more

740
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,050
fainting spells?

741
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,180
Thanks for your concern, Master.

742
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,180
I've been much better.

743
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,980
Since joining the sect,

744
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,250
my old heart condition hasn't returned.

745
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,380
Even so, don't let your guard down.

746
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,330
I've studied the ancient texts.

747
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,220
To fully cure you,

748
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,620
you'll need a Dark Spirit Root cultivator

749
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,700
to balance your yin and yang.

750
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,220
Thanks for the care, Master.

751
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,010
But right now, cultivation is my only focus.

752
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,700
I'm not ready to think about marriage.

753
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,420
You had me stay behind.

754
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,290
I assume you've got a task for me.

755
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,400
You'll lead the team

756
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,290
into the Trial Ground,

757
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,010
and guard the pearl.

758
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,330
There's one more task, something important.

759
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,250
What is it?

760
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,900
There'll be battles for sure

761
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,730
during this Trial.

762
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,050
I'd better to prepare some solid artifacts.

763
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,730
[Wangyu, Shopkeeper of Treasure House]
I am Wangyu,

764
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,620
shopkeeper of Treasure House.

765
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,980
My name...

766
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,700
is Li Feiyu,

767
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,900
a rogue cultivator.

768
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,530
I'm looking for some artifacts.

769
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,810
Price is not an issue.

770
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,730
Mr. Li, I like how direct you are.

771
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,330
Come on in.

772
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,940
Brew a pot of top-grade tea.

773
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:06,770
Yes, sir.

774
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,700
No need.

775
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,460
I'm not here

776
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,460
for tea and chit-chat.

777
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,010
If you've got nothing good,

778
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,940
I won't waste my time.

779
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,180
Wait, Mr. Li!

780
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,700
This is a full set of Mother-Child Blades.

781
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,460
One mother blade,

782
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,490
and eight child blades.

783
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,730
They're forged from refined steel and pure gold

784
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,900
by a master craftsman

785
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,090
over three days and nights.

786
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,090
With the mother blade in hand,

787
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,700
you can control all eight child blades at once.

788
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,780
The enemy won't just be overwhelmed,

789
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,530
they'll lose their minds.

790
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,770
You'll be unstoppable!

791
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,940
This is the Mystic Iron Flying Shield,

792
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,340
a rare defensive artifact.

793
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,460
It's forged

794
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,900
from mystic iron mined in the icy land.

795
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,300
Not only is it tough,

796
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,690
once activated,

797
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,940
it orbits your body

798
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,090
and defends you automatically!

799
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,210
Tell me, Mr. Li,

800
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,780
what have you been through?

801
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,980
Some big-shot battlefield?

802
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,010
Alright then.

803
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,090
No more pretending.

804
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,650
Let me show you

805
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,980
my favorite little toy.

806
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,490
The Thunder Ball!

807
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,170
It's formed from condensed heavenly lightning.

808
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,170
Even

809
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,570
a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator

810
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,010
will be blasted to dust

811
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,900
if caught head-on.

812
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,170
Just gone like that.

813
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,940
It's rare, sure.

814
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,130
But it comes with a fine price.

815
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,130
You sure

816
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,650
you can afford it?

817
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,130
Golden Glow Ganoderma?

818
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,150
That's not worth much.

819
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,820
Come on now.

820
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,010
Even one over a hundred years old

821
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,340
barely fetches anything.

822
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,820
Smell it again.

823
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,170
Five hundred?

824
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,980
Five hundred years old?

825
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,940
It's five hundred years old!

826
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,900
Alright, that's fair.

827
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,170
I want more.

828
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,170
Bring out your best stuff.

829
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,420
Close your eyes.

830
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,340
This is the Golden Brick Talisman,

831
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,540
our shop's finest treasure!

832
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,000
Only a cultivator

833
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,090
at the Core Formation Stage can craft one.

834
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,960
It's a bit slow to activate,

835
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,160
but it's far

836
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,050
from ordinary.

837
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,530
Now tell me,

838
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,880
Mr. Li.

839
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,920
Which treasure

840
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
do you want?

841
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,780
I'll take them all.

842
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,090
You're talking

843
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,050
like a real big spender.

844
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,210
But Mr. Li,

845
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,050
aren't you mistaken?

846
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:51,860
Yes,

847
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,090
your herbs

848
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
are rare,

849
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,860
but still not enough to trade...

850
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,820
for all of this.

851
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,420
Who said

852
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,860
I only brought five-hundred-year herbs?

853
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,490
A thousand years.

854
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,420
It's a thousand years old!

855
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,980
Deal.

856
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,820
It's all yours.

857
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,300
Including the table,

858
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,940
the gourd,

859
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,170
and the tea set, take it all.

860
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,300
The Bloody Trial Ground is extremely dangerous.

861
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,740
We'll need to stick together.

862
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,460
Yes.

863
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm not going with you.

864
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,210
I'll be moving solo!

865
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,380
Senior!

866
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,530
What's wrong, Senior?

867
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,820
Enough.

868
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,690
Don't just stand there!

869
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,490
Go get the Grandmaster, now!

870
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,260
Her old illness is acting up again!

871
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,940
I'm in the middle of nowhere,

872
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,780
perfect place to test my new artifacts.

873
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,740
Mother-Child Blades...

874
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,780
Lu Mingyuan,

875
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,380
I even gave you my Foundation Pill.

876
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,820
Now you're breaking off the engagement?

877
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,690
Someone's there!

878
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,420
Qiaoqian,

879
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,420
was that really necessary?

880
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,820
If I can win Dong Xuan'er's favor,

881
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,050
then Grandmaster Hongfu

882
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,940
may take me as her disciple.

883
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,300
Why will I still need your pill?

884
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,610
You're an absolute idiot.

885
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,340
Alright.

886
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,740
Soon enough,

887
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,490
you'll see how lucky you were

888
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,820
to have me.

889
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,820
Get your hands off me!

890
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,380
My father will know we're done.

891
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,530
Keep dreaming!

892
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,460
Give me back my Foundation Pill.

893
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,050
Even if you don't,

894
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,170
the Chen family will come for it.

895
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,090
We're done here.

896
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,740
Easy, Qiaoqian.

897
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,780
No need to worry.

898
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,570
That's just my Wind Bind spell.

899
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,460
If you aren't the only heiress

900
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,610
of the Chen family,

901
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,820
maybe I'll let you go.

902
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,090
But honestly,

903
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm worried you'll hold a grudge

904
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,050
and get back at me.

905
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,570
So I'll take

906
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,940
your Foundation Pill.

907
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,050
As for you...

908
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,940
it'd be best if you disappeared

909
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,300
from this world.

910
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,900
How did scum like him

911
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,380
