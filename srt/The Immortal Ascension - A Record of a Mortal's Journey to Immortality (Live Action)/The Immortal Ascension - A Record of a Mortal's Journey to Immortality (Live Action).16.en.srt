00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,310
Now I understand

193
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,460
why Han Li wishes to avoid attention.

194
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,650
Solitude feels good.

195
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,980
Why must I have

196
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,370
the gift of enchantment?

197
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,490
A mortal

198
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,940
can live freely.

199
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,300
Yet I always attract conflicts

200
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,220
even though I don't mean to hurt anyone.

201
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,850
I have no freedom.

202
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,890
I arrived here yesterday.

203
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,370
And I heard that there were

204
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,730
some mysteries in the Lower City.

205
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,730
Are you aware of them?

206
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,820
Mysteries?

207
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,730
Like the sudden death of some commoners

208
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,890
of some commoners

209
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,010
or rookie cultivators.

210
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,010
I did hear that some people

211
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,250
disappeared under mysterious circumstances at night.

212
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,060
But no one has found their bodies.

213
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,980
Miss,

214
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,130
it is a great evening tonight.

215
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,370
Why are you sulking alone?

216
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,300
Relax.

217
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,100
We are not

218
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,940
bad guys.

219
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,890
We just hate to see

220
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,820
a frown on your face.

221
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,820
Miss,

222
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,220
try this.

223
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,490
It makes me

224
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,700
feel happy?

225
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,730
Have you not heard of this saying?

226
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,490
Liquor can drown

227
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,060
your sorrow

228
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,730
away.

229
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,530
We're not trying to make you drunk.

230
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,610
We just don't want

231
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,130
to see you sulk.

232
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,180
And I know you're not bad guys.

233
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,820
I just can't bring myself to drink the moon in this cup.

234
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,580
You worry for naught.

235
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,060
The moon will appear in all things that flow.

236
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,130
Just as all things that flow will reflect the moon.

237
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,770
So long as your cup is filled,

238
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,610
I...

239
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,770
The moon will always be in your hands.

240
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,100
Well said.

241
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,890
Thank you.

242
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,250
It's beautiful.

243
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:41,980
Cheers.

244
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,300
- Cheers. - Cheers.

245
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,250
It burns.

246
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,460
That's it.

247
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,010
Again.

248
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,340
You can drink.

249
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:53,730
Okay.

250
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,490
You can drink, miss.

251
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,060
You hold your cup.

252
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,370
Let me fill it.

253
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,890
Li,

254
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,530
you must be a powerful cultivator now.

255
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,340
I only reached the Foundation Establishment Stage.

256
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,490
Well,

257
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,130
just strong enough

258
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,130
to protect myself.

259
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,630
Beautiful.

260
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,050
Look over there.

261
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,240
It's so beautiful.

262
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,890
So pretty.

263
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,060
Look there.

264
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,490
I am Dong Xuan'er of Yellow Maple Valley.

265
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,130
How may I address you?

266
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,530
I am Wuyouzi of Clear Void Sect.

267
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,850
I am Ba Chushui of Giant Sword Sect.

268
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,370
Are you here

269
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,820
for the betrothal ceremony?

270
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,610
We're here to catch the bad guys.

271
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,850
But

272
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,130
this doesn't matter.

273
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,610
Come. Drink up.

274
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,130
Come.

275
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,700
Yes, it doesn't matter.

276
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,300
- Come. - Thank you.

277
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,910
Great!

278
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,380
There's more.

279
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,990
Wow!

280
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,850
Bravo.

281
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,460
I've never seen him this happy before.

282
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,900
He found a new girl

283
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,620
this soon in a foreign place.

284
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,700
Let's go down

285
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,770
and check it out.

286
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,010
Well,

287
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,570
we shall take our leave.

288
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,490
We'll be admiring the fireworks.

289
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,770
Enjoy the drink.

290
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,730
Thank you.

291
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,330
Let's go.

292
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,860
Let's go.

293
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,540
♪Shards of dreams inside a dream...♪

294
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,570
Li,

295
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,730
is it impossible to be

296
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,330
a cultivator

297
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,010
without a spirit root?

Come.

318
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,330
You're hit by my enchantment.

319
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,810
Look at me.

320
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,770
Look at me.

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,660
I am Dong Xuan'er of Yellow Maple Valley.

322
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,010
You are all enchanted.

323
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,180
Look at me.

324
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,290
Look at me.

325
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,380
Oh, no.

326
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,900
She's in danger.

327
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,810
Miss Mo,

328
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,940
please go home first.

329
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,900
I still have things to do.

330
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,010
I must go now.

331
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,730
Keep this.

332
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,090
If those cultivators give you trouble,

333
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,660
throw it at them.

334
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,570
These are the seeds of mystic herbs

335
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,180
and the pills good for mortals.

336
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,460
You can take them,

337
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,900
or sell them after refining.

338
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,570
Don't sell them for too cheap.

339
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,700
They are good pills.

340
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,090
If anything,

341
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,180
leave a message

342
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,900
at the inn.

343
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,460
Will we meet again?

344
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,220
I'll see you off.

345
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,860
Go home.

346
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,620
Okay.

347
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,420
So beautiful.

348
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,180
My dear,

349
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,700
just come with me.

350
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,860
I'll make you feel good.

351
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,010
I'm not your dear.

352
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,980
I'm Dong Xuan'er of Yellow Maple Valley.

353
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,660
I

354
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,490
know that.

355
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,660
You know me?

356
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,570
I know

357
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,570
your father, mother, grandmother, and grandfather.

358
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,860
All of them.

359
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,490
I can recite your family lineage.

360
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,620
Oh, I know now.

361
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,330
You're enchanted by me.

362
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,050
Yes.

363
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,490
I'm so enchanted by you.

364
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,050
Where does this guy come from?

365
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,050
Who are you?

366
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,420
Don't get in our way.

367
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,050
You want to play the hero?

368
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,010
Are you strong enough?

369
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,700
You want to play the hero?

370
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,290
Are you strong enough?

371
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,010
You two

372
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,770
should fight.

373
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,730
I'll go with the winner.

374
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,330
Okay?

375
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,330
All right.

376
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,010
Come.

377
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,140
Fight.

378
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,380
Fight now.

379
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:36,980
Fight.

380
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,090
What a weird technique.

381
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,460
Why won't he show his face?

382
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,700
Perhaps he doesn't want to draw attention.

383
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,810
Wow.

384
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,180
That's amazing.

385
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,420
Who's there?

386
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,010
He fled.

387
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,530
You won.

388
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,620
I'll come with you!

389
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,290
You are all enchanted by me.

390
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,010
I am Dong Xuan'er of Yellow Maple Valley.

391
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,420
Can you resist my enchantment?

392
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,700
Oh, no.

393
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,420
If my master

394
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,380
and mentors see her like this,

395
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,180
they'll hold me accountable.

396
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,940
I need to sort this out first.

397
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,980
Han,

398
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,660
where am I?

399
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,660
Drink the medicine.

400
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,900
What medicine is this?

401
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,980
Stop staring at me.

402
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,810
Drink it.

403
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,380
Dong Xuan'er,

404
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,090
I told you to stop using your enchantment.

405
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,570
That man took advantage of you and damaged

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,900
your spirit.

407
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,900
You need a few days to fully recover.

408
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,810
We promised to stay out

409
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,180
of each other's business.

410
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,250
Why are you following me?

411
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,770
Following you?

412
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm following

413
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,810
your kidnapper.

414
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,490
I've sensed

415
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,940
his gaze on you many times

416
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,140
in the city.

417
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,460
He's following me?

418
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,090
Yes.

419
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,420
I have an ominous feeling.

420
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,730
Stay close to me tomorrow.

421
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,620
We'll go back as soon

422
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,570
as the ceremony ends.

423
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,050
Obey

424
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,770
my order for now.

425
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,010
Then, we stay out of each other's business.

426
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,220
This is not a negotiation.

427
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,330
Okay.

428
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,770
Where are you going, Han?

429
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,140
I mean,

430
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,330
can you stay the night?

431
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,140
I will keep watch tonight.

432
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,010
I hope you won't

433
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,460
tell my master about what happened today.

434
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,660
I never intend to cross anyone.

435
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,420
Why is it my fault every time?

436
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,810
All right.

437
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,730
I know

438
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,860
you don't mean to use your gift.

439
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,620
I won't

440
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,810
tell anyone

441
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,330
about today.

442
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,530
You promise?

443
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,860
I promise.

444
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,140
Han, I'm hungry.

445
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,220
Sleep.

446
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,660
But what about my tummy?

447
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,530
You don't feel hungry when you're asleep.

448
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,460
But I want to...

449
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,530
You're boring.

450
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,420
Han,

451
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,490
is it cold over there?

452
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,740
[Quarry, Yan Clan Stronghold]

453
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,570
Quit staring.

454
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,860
Where are you from?

455
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,660
I am Xuan Yue of Moonshadow Sect.

456
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,940
My sect has instructed me

457
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,940
to retrieve this month's gems.

458
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,250
Xuan.

459
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,980
Xuan.

460
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,700
They are our loyal patron.

461
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,420
No need to check.

462
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,330
Go back to your work.

463
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,090
Follow me.

464
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,180
How come you're early, Xuan?

465
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,180
We're two days

466
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,180
before the deadline.

467
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,700
My sect needs it

468
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,810
urgently.

469
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,860
Can you

470
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,660
help us?

471
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,490
Oh, come on.

472
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,770
We always reserve the best

473
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,730
for your sect.

474
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,700
Enjoy your tea

475
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,290
first.

476
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,570
My friend,

477
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,730
what has happened

478
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,460
to the quarry?

479
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,810
I see many new faces.

480
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,570
Young Lady is getting married.

481
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,330
So we station more people here

482
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,290
for better security.

483
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,900
The groom

484
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,050
is so fortunate then.

485
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,660
He will own

486
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,730
the entire quarry.

487
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,250
He got lucky.

488
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,900
Which sect does the groom

489
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,180
hail from?

490
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,140
He is fortunate enough

491
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,940
to marry

492
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,940
the daughter of Lord Yan.

493
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,090
I heard he's

494
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,050
a foreign cultivator.

495
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,940
A foreign cultivator?

496
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,140
From where?

497
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,420
What background?

498
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,180
Stop asking already.

499
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,460
This is for the higher-up.

500
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,490
We should just stay quiet.

501
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,770
Come. Have some tea.

502
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,730
The Mountain Barrier is hit?

503
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,940
Xuan,

504
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:42,810
stay here.

505
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,570
I'll be back soon.

506
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,010
Ouch.

507
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,620
Easy.

508
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,420
Tell me now.

509
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,220
Why mobilize so many people

510
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,530
for the betrothal ceremony tomorrow?

511
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,530
Ouch.

512
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,330
Xuan.

513
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,700
Stop asking.

514
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,940
For old time's sake,

515
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,490
listen to me.

516
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,330
Run.

517
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,940
I might not be able to return here again.

518
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,530
I need to carry out

519
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,050
my plan soon.

520
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,330
Grandmaster.

521
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:26,980
Yes?

522
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,770
The Jiang Kingdom and The Cheqi Kingdom are no more.

523
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,250
The whole royalty

524
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,460
was eradicated.

525
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,180
The Ghost Spirit Sect did it.

526
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,730
Inform all elders

527
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,660
to meet

528
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,490
at Yellow Maple Valley for a discussion.

529
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,460
And tell Xuan Yue

530
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,730
to report back about the Yue Kingdom's border.

531
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,050
Noted, Grandmaster.

532
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:46,900
Go now.

533
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,900
Is a war about to break out?

534
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,740
[Wedding]

535
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,580
It's so crowded.

Han, Dong.

537
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,810

538
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,860
- Morning. - Morning.

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,570
- Morning. - Morning.

541
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,490
Did you two

542
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,090
find anything last night?

543
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,700
Well...

544
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,180
The fireworks were mesmerizing.

545
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,290
The liquor was intoxicating.

546
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,140
Yes.

547
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,700
After the ceremony,

548
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,490
we'll return to what we came here for.

549
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,460
Exactly.

550
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:29,980

552
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,730
Sure.

553
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,420
I'll join you.

554
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,660
- We do it together. - We do it together.

555
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,620
Do what together?

556
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,290
It's a secret.

557
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,900
Listen.

558
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,940
We can't...

559
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,860
You said someone

was following me last night.

561
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,010
Did you find him?

562
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,660
No.

But you must stay close to me.

564
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,010
Don't go anywhere.

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,660
Look, Han.

00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,700
It's so festive in front.

568
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,810
How odd.

569
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,050
I sense something ominous.

[Yongning Gate]

571
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,640
It's majestic.

572
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,460
The grandeur!

573
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,290
Let's stand in the front row.

574
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,730
Stay behind me.

575
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,610
Where is Lord Yan?

576
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,300
I know, right?

577
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,050
It's a betrothal ceremony.

578
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,260
None of the elders is here.

579
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,260
Yan Ruyan

580
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,740
looks weird.

581
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,980
He was the person

582
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,740
from last night.

583
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,300
Him?

584
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,980
Why would Lord Yan

585
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,780
pick someone like him to be his son-in-law?

586
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,380
Hush.

587
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,010
There's something off about this ceremony.

588
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,170
Follow me.

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,860
Welcome

590
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,780
to the betrothal ceremony between Yan and me.

591
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,130
The banquet

592
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,900
begins now.

593
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,130
Wait.

594
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,820
My power is all gone.

595
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,940
Oh, no.

596
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,380
My power has been suppressed.

597
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,610
The Wind Boat doesn't work here.

598
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,570
Han.

599
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,940
My power has been suppressed.

600
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,410
My power has been suppressed too.

601
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,120
Run!

602
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,380
It's the Blood Spirit Spell by the Ghost Spirit Sect.

603
00:38:59,590 --> 00:38:59,940
Run!

604
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,490
Run!

605
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,090
Yan and I

606
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,010
received your gifts with thanks.

607
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,170
The so-called

608
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,900
righteous seven sects pride themselves

609
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,010
with their generosity.

610
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,940
Then surrender your power

611
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,460
to save the future heiress of the Yan Clan.

612
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,210
At this critical juncture,

613
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,210
forgive me.

614
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,420
There is

615
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,690
no turning back for my clan.

616
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,340
Lord Yan,

617
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,980
these people are not dead.

618
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,340
They merely turn into power

619
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,570
and are fused with Yan.

620
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,610
They should thank me

621
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,690
for this honor.

622
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,420
No.

623
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,380
They should thank you,

624
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,010
Lord Yan.

625
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,490
We made

626
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,170
a Truedeath Oath.

627
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,460
If you fail to save Yan,

628
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,610
I will make you pay.

629
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,570
Yan is my wife.

630
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,050
I want her back more than you do.

631
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,050
Yan is still unconscious.

632
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,530
Despite all this power,

633
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,570
she does not wake up.

634
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,820
My wife

635
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,860
sure has a big appetite.

636
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,530
Be patient.

637
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,090
A few escaped just now.

638
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,610
I'll chase after them

639
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,010
and feed them to Yan.
