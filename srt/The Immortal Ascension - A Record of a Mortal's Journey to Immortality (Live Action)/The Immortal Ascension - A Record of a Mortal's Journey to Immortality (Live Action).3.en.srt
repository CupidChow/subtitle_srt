00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,130
The heavens are on my side.

192
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,850
You really reached Tier 4!

193
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,060
I'm not going to die!

194
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,370
I'm only 37.

195
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,700
I've barely started living!

196
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,300
Strange, isn't it?

197
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,770
I look so old at my 37.

198
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,530
Anyone would think

199
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm pushing eighty and on death's door.

200
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,940
If not for the strange poison in my body

201
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,890
that I've struggled to keep down,

202
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,130
why would I go through all this trouble?

203
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,420
Come on.

204
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,130
Han Li.

205
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,730
Today marks the end

206
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,700
of our master-disciple bond.

207
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,300
Show me what you've got.

208
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,460
Let me see

209
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,770
what you've prepared.

210
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,370
In less than three months,

211
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,820
you've already made this much progress.

212
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,010
You really keep surprising me.

213
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,730
But my reputation

214
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,820
wasn't built

215
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,610
on medicine alone.

216
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,180
Think you can take me on?

217
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,460
[Silver Demon Palm]
My signature technique,

218
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,300
the Silver Demon Palm,

219
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,730
returns to the world today.

220
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,340
Easy, my dear disciple.

221
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,770
It'll all be over soon.

222
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,650
You little brat!

223
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,100
Hiding tricks up your sleeve, huh?

224
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,700
You dared poison me?

225
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,820
You've got some nerve!

226
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,140
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

227
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,050
You taught me that.

228
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,420
Armored Puppet!

229
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,700
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

230
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,180
That's what I taught you.

231
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,140
Armored Puppet.

232
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,570
Stop struggling.

233
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,940
He's a puppet I made myself.

234
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,770
He only listens to me.

235
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,220
Relax,

236
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,250
Han Li.

237
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,420
We were master and disciple, after all.

238
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,700
I won't let you suffer too much.

239
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,090
Did you

240
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,730
do the same to Zhang Tie?

241
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,090
Take a guess.

242
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,460
He saw you as a second father,

243
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,090
and you still harmed him?

244
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,810
I had no choice.

245
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,810
He didn't have a spirit root.

246
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,380
And

247
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,460
he couldn't practice the Longevity Art.

248
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,010
So to me,

249
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,420
he was useless.

250
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,940
Mo Juren!

251
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,010
Stop wasting time talking to him.

252
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,380
Do it now!

253
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,700
What's the rush?

254
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,220
At this point,

255
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,050
as long as your Seven Ghost Soul-Devouring Curse works,

256
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,050
he's not going anywhere.

257
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,530
Who are you talking to?

258
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,570
Whose voice is that?

259
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,220
Don't be afraid.

260
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,660
Don't resist.

261
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,660
Just enjoy

262
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,490
this grand feast I've spent years preparing.

263
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,570
I can hardly wait

264
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,530
the thrill of rebirth.

265
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,570
Seven Ghost Soul-Devouring Curse!

266
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,660
Who are you?

267
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,330
Take a look.

268
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,860
This is what I used to look like.

269
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,570
No need to be scared.

270
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,090
It won't hurt that much!

271
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,770
Relax.

272
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,050
In just a moment,

273
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,730
it'll all be over.

274
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,380
Hurry, use the immobilizing talisman!

275
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,980
Don't let him bite his tongue!

276
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,290
Do it faster!

277
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,290
All that you've achieved

278
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,900
won't be in vain!

279
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,940
Everything you are

280
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,180
now belongs to us!

281
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,980
[In Han Li's Consciousness Sea]

282
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,900
Give me your body.

283
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,420
Give it all to your master.

284
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,220
Give it to me.

285
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,460
Give it to me!

286
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,530
Give it to me!

287
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,770
Mine...

288
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,420
It's mine!

289
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,140
Give up everything you have,

290
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,010
and hand it over!

291
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,460
Hand it over!

292
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,250
Give it all to your master!

293
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,700
Hand it over!

294
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,220
Hand it over!

295
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,570
Hand it over!

296
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,050
You're mine!

297
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,570
You belong to me!

298
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,380
Give it to me!

299
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,380
- Give it to me! - Give it to me!

300
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,460
Hand it over!

301
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,380
Hand it over!

302
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,620
- Give it to me!- Give it to me!

303
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,420
Hand it over!

304
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,010
No!

305
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,620
This is my body!

306
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,090
All of you, get out!

307
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,770
How is he breaking free?

308
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,980
Didn't you say I could possess him

309
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,860
with your curse?

310
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,380
The mantra I gave you

311
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,050
only holds four tiers power.

312
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,570
But he's

313
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,140
also reached Tier 4.

314
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,010
So basically,

315
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,050
you wanted me and him

316
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,530
to wear each other down,

317
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,460
so you could swoop in and take over?

318
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,180
What do you think?

319
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,730
You sly little snake.

320
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,570
I won't let you take him.

321
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,220
He's my disciple!

322
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,980
Enough talking.

323
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,700
Let's settle this with skill!

324
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,380
Tier 6?

325
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,940
He tricked us.

326
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,700
He's reached Tier 6!

327
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,860
Oh, Han Li...

328
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,770
Looks like...

329
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,380
I really underestimated you.

330
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,090
"Do good with discretion."

331
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,330
That's what you taught me too.

332
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,490
You truly are my worthy disciple.

333
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,330
It's come to this.

334
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,810
Got anything else to say?

335
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,180
No.

336
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,570
Nothing at all.

337
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,700
That man just now

338
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,700
is named Yu Zitong.

339
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,860
Once you're out,

340
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,860
don't believe a word he says.

341
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,010
Kill him immediately.

342
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,050
A primordial spirit's weakest point is poison.

343
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,980
Use what you used on me.

344
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,490
That's enough.

345
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,490
Also,

346
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,220
he fears the light.

347
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,810
Goodbye,

348
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,330
Master.

349
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,460
And you?

350
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,220
Got anything left to say?

351
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,180
My name is Yu Zitong.

352
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,090
I come from a cultivator clan.

353
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,700
You're a cultivator,

354
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,250
and well-connected.

355
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,010
Got it.

356
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,220
If you

357
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,290
help me find another body

358
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,330
so I can start over,

359
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,490
I will, in return,

360
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,860
recommend you to my clan!

361
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,860
Don't believe a word he says.

362
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,090
Kill him immediately.

363
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,980
A soul's weakest point is poison.

364
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,090
Use what you used on me.

365
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,050
In the world of cultivation,

366
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,490
everything becomes easier

367
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,810
with a strong clan behind you!

368
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,420
How does that sound?

369
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,010
You said the same thing

370
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,730
to Physician Mo, didn't you?

371
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,380
That lowly mortal,

372
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,700
how could he ever compare to us?

373
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,660
Fair point.

374
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,420
But he asked me to give you something.

375
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,810
Get lost!

376
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,980
Come out.

377
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,420
Show yourself!

378
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,770
Also,

379
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,380
he fears the light.

380
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,490
Let me out!

381
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,700

00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,050
Senior Li.

570
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,010
This thing isn't bad.

571
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,210
I'll take it.

572
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,340
Hey, you!

573
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,010
Which family are you from?

574
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,170
Which family do you belong to?

575
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,940
I'm from the Ye family of Qinling,

576
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,170
just passing through

577
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,380
on my way to Tainan Valley.

578
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,490
I don't want any trouble.

579
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,690
Since you're here,

580
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,340
I'll back off.

581
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,010
What nonsense is this?

582
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,820
The Ye family from Qinling?

583
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,610
I've heard of them.

584
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,900
So why did you interfere?

585
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:29,860
I...

586
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,570
I just took his offering.

587
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,420
So I made an exception.

588
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,530
I didn't mean to offend you!

589
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:35,570
An exception, huh?

590
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,460
As cultivators, we really shouldn't meddle

591
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,690
in mortal affairs.

592
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,170
But...

593
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,860
I had no choice.

594
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:46,570
Since you've admitted your mistake,

595
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,210
take back

596
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:49,780
your flying sword talisman.

597
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,570
Then I'll accept your kindness.

598
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,260
And you might want to stay away

599
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,980
from these mortal insects,

600
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,460
or you'll end up tainted too.

601
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,090
- Great! - Great!

602
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,340
What kind of treasure is this?

603
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,610
Even the Fireball Technique can't burn it.

604
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,700
[Command Seal]

605
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,070
- Great! - Great!

606
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,130
Master Jia.

607
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,690
Where are you heading?

608
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:38,420
Master,

609
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,740
let's talk this through.

610
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,530
I've got no quarrel with you.

611
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,940
If you'd just spare me,

612
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:44,940
I'd gladly

613
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,590
reward you handsomely!

614
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,530
You've killed countless innocents.

615
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,650
Ever think this day would come?

616
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,340
I might spare the others,

617
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,650
but you...

618
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,610
You're the one I'll never forgive.

619
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,380
Will you take your own life

620
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,610
or shall I do it for you?

621
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,740
Everyone of the Wild Wolves Gang!

622
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,940
Kill!

623
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,490
Kill him!

624
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,780
Charge!

625
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,050
Kill him!

626
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,170
I'm dead either way...

627
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,740
Master!

628
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,380
Master, you saved the sect today.

629
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,050
I owe you a great debt.

630
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,530
How would you like to be repaid?

631
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,340
I'll give you the position of Deputy Sect Master,

632
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,980
one thousand taels of silver.

633
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,820
And all elders and disciples will obey your orders.

634
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,260
But,

635
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,820
only after I pass away,

636
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:07,210
the sect

637
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,300
will finally be yours.

638
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:09,780
What do you say?

639
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,260
Why don't you first call off the ambush

640
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,900
hiding out?

641
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,210
They were probably

642
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,690
put there by Elder Zhang.

643
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,650
Master,

644
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,860
I meant no disrespect.

645
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,340
As sect leader,

646
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,900
there are things I simply can't control.

647
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,820
When you found

648
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,820
your own sect,

649
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,090
you'll understand.

650
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,940
Don't worry, Master Wang.

651
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,170
I won't

652
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,460
be staying for long.

653
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,940
After today,

654
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,260
I'll be gone for good.

655
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,170
But before I go,

656
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:08,940
there's a deal

657
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,010
I'd like to strike,

658
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,860
one that benefits both of us.

659
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,670
Of course. No problem.

660
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,940
You haven't even heard my terms yet.

661
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,940
Please, go ahead.

662
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,980
Take Li Feiyu as your final disciple.

663
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:28,860
Besides,

664
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,840
appoint him as head of the Outer Blade Hall.

665
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,380
Done.

666
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,050
Anything else?

667
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,420
He's in love with Elder Zhang's third daughter, Zhang Xiu'er.

668
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,170
But Elder Zhang disapproves because he's poor.

669
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,570
I'll talk to him.

670
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:46,420
It's not a big deal.

671
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,570
Anything else?

672
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,170
I have a third uncle.

673
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,900
He's just an outer disciple.

674
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,530
He was the one

675
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,570
who brought me to the Seven Mysteries Sect.

676
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,010
If something happens to him later,

677
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,300
- I hope you'll take care of him. - Of course.

678
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,260
No problem at all.

679
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,940
As for me,

680
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,610
I won't let you go unrewarded.

681
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,530
This one

682
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,740
is a rare treasure, the Essence Pill.

683
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:13,780
Keep it.

684
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,170
It might just save your life

685
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,490
in a critical moment.

686
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,770
I got everything you've said.

687
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,360
I accept it all.

688
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,340
