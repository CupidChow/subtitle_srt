97
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,490

116
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,460

117
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,900

128
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,730
Elder Liu,

129
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,220

130
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,170
you know about this.

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,490
If you've made up your mind,

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,050
there's no need for me to convince you otherwise.

133
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,020
But please give me some time

134
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,540
to investigate

135
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,410
his background with others.

136
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,370

137
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,490

138
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,140

139
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,540

140
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,020

141
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,810

156

160
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,180

170

171
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,530

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,890
Just go.

176
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,730

184
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,180
or betrothing Yan,

185
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,010
they are just your pretexts.

186
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,890

190
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,820
Of course.

191
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,730
Were it not for our shared past,

192
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,610
do you think

193
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,580
I would still keep you alive now?

194
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,250
You sure are

195
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,980
a sentimental person.

196
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,180
In that case,

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,650
why don't we continue our shared history

198
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,770
so the Yan Clan

199
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,610
can return to its rightful master?

200
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,100
My father is thirsty for someone powerful

201
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,770
like you.

202
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,130
You must be joking.

203
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,580
My clan has settled down in the Yue Kingdom.

204
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,370
We left the Ghost Spirit Sect

205
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,700
300 years ago,

206
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,220
and we don't plan to return.

207
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,940
You're mistaken, Lord Yan.

208
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,980
What I mean is

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,940
the Seven Sects

210
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,460
have ruled the Yue Kingdom for long enough.

211
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,060
My sect

212
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,010
can help you

213
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,850
become the future ruler of Yue.

214
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,180
When that happens, you won't have to beg

215
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
for one spirit herb.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,180
Truth be told,

217
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,890
the Six Demonic Sects have rallied armies

218
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,610
and will attack soon.

219
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,370
The Seven Sects

220
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,060
will turn into dust.

221
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,940
Alas, the Yan Clan Stronghold

222
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,490
is located on the border.

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,890
It will feel the brunt of the invasion.

224
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,460
What will become of it?

225
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,980
The war hasn't begun.

226
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,770
No one knows

227
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,300
who the victor is yet.

228
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,130
Isn't it arrogant of your father

229
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,770
to ask me to take his side now?

230
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,460
Besides,

231
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,530
your father has sired many children.

232
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,060
His sister, Hongfen, is still there.

233
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,850
Do you truly have a say in regards

234
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,650
to your sect's matters?

235
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,100
Lord Yan,

236
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,730
this is both my father's

237
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,010
and my wish.

238
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,420
Look.

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,220
An exceptionally rare

240
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,770
dark spirit root?

241
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,650
Exactly.

242
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,580
Your daughter is born with the heavenly spirit root.

243
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,980
And I have the dark spirit root.

244
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,180
We make the best pair to study the Blood Spirit Spell.

245
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,770
And knowing her potential and mine,

246
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,490
we're likely to attain

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,650
the Nascent Soul Stage, let alone the Core Formation Stage.

248
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,850
Imagine this.

249
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,220
Your clan will have two Nascent Soul Stage cultivators.

250
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,220
You will be stronger than the Seven Sects.

251
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,460
Additionally...

252
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,010
Additionally, I promise

253
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,250
that our child

254
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,820
will become the successor of both

255
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,580
my sect and your clan.

256
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,130
You come up

257
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,460
with this plan yourself?

258
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,580
I will

259
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,820
take over my sect.

260
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,010
But I

261
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,250
need you as my ally,

262
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,060
more so than my father

263
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,490
or Aunt Hongfen.

264
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,700
I ask for your

265
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,370
cooperation.

266
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,940
Will you swear

267
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,770
a Truedeath Oath with me?

268
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,820
[An isolation chamber in Yellow Maple Valley]

269
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,980
Han Li.

270
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,770
Could it be him?

271
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,370
This is the last pill.

272
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,250
I

273
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,100
have to make this work.

274
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,420
By swallowing this golden pill,

275
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,770
I shall defy my predestined fate!

276
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,530
Oh, no.

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
If I don't put the extra power within me

278
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,060
to use,

279
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,530
my body will be overwhelmed.

280
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,060
Qingyuan Sword Manual!

281
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,810
Did I

282
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,050
do it?

283
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,570
I've also reached Tier 4

284
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,010
of the Qingyuan Sword Manual.

285
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,860
Despite

286
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,490
my fake spirit root, I'm now in

287
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,290
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

288
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,010
One Foundation Pill left.

289
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,330
Chen Qiaoqian,

290
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,940
stop getting distracted.

291
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,770
You can't let your family down again.

292
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,250
I can't stand it anymore.

293
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,770
- What's wrong? - What's the matter?

294
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm sick of it.

295
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,770
I know.

296
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,620
He's

297
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,090
sick of you.

298
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,860
Me?

299
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,770
What did I do?

300
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,010
All you do is stare at the sky

301
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,460
in hopes that Xuan'er

302
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,570
will appear.

303
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,770
Pot calling

304
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,660
the kettle black.

305
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,860
You keep staring at Senior Liu too.

306
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,530
No, I didn't.

307
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,080
What's so good

308
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,560
about dating anyway?

309
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,900
You might as well

310
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,330
use the time to cultivate.

311
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,940
Look over there.

312
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,860
It seems our sect has one more...

313
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,730
No.

314
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,530
Two more Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators.

315
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,570
Wonderful!

316
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,660
Mentor Xu.

317
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,700
I saw a column of light here just now.

318
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,380
Did someone reach the Foundation Establishment Stage as well?

319
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,620
Han Li did it.

320
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,220
Who

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,460
would have thought?

322
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,490
He and his fake spirit root

323
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,460
have proved

324
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,570
so many people wrong.

325
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,660
Where is he now?

326
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,900
He just left.

327
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,490
You arrived a second too late.

328
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,180
He is...

329
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,290
You're just as impatient as he is.

330
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,660
Han Li!

331
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,940
Han.

332
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,050
- Wait. - Senior Chen?

333
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,420
Han.

334
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,460
Congratulations.

335
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,330
You have reached the Foundation Establishment Stage.

336
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,940
Likewise.

337
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,770
You

338
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,460
saved me that day, didn't you?

339
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,250
What do you mean?

340
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,490
You killed Senior Lu

341
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,180
before the Bloody Trial Ground.

342
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,330
Quit joking around, Senior Chen.

343
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,050
Senior Lu is an excellent Qi Refining Stage cultivator.

344
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,730
I am not strong enough to kill him.

345
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,900
But

346
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,180
you escaped the dangerous

347
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,460
Bloody Trial Ground unscathed.

348
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,530
Grandmaster Li even took you in as his disciple.

349
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,460
It was just a stroke of luck.

350
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,860
I have things to do.

351
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,620
Farewell.

352
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,660
Why won't you admit

353
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,180
that you saved me?

354
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,220
I should have given her more Oblivion Pills.

355
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,490
I know it was you

356
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,250
even if you don't admit it.

357
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,860
Can you feel it?

358
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,900
Do you know

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,250
I'm performing cupping on your back?

360
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,900
It will remove the cold energy

361
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,940
and the bad energy from you.

362
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,730
All of it.

363
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,380
You're not doing it properly.

364
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,810
I don't think Han Li did this

365
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,570
when he was helping me.

366
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,090
If you're this good,

367
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,140
do it yourself.

368
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,570
If I can do it myself,

369
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,530
I won't ask you for help.

370
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,900
Mentor Ma.

371
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,180
Mentor Wu.

372
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,250
You've attained the Foundation Establishment Stage?

373
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,700
Not too shabby.

374
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,900
You've attained the Foundation Establishment Stage.

375
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,140
Nice one.

376
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,700
It's all thanks to you, Mentor Ma.

377
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,250
I wouldn't have achieved what I did

378
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,380
had you not let me

379
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,900
tend to this garden.

380
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,380
Then,

381
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,490
you should

382
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,530
address me differently now.

383
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,730
Call me

384
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,090
Senior Ma.

385
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,470
Now that you're in the Foundation Establishment Stage,

386
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,990
my garden is of no use

387
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,380
to you.

388
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,290
Pack up

389
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,490
and find your master now.

390
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,660
Go.

391
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,250
Go now.

392
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,220
Make haste.

393
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,660
♪The ripples disappear into the river♪

394
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,180
♪My robe is soaked under the drizzle♪

395
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,940
♪I drink alone as the moonlight melts with the liquor♪

396
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,100
♪The current flows swiftly, the mountains weigh heavily...♪

397
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,460
They say you see things differently

398
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,140
once you're in the Foundation Establishment Stage.

399
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,290
But all I see

400
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,460
are familiar scenes.

401
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,900
♪The breeze brushes through the corridor♪

402
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,380
♪As the swallows whisper overhead♪

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,980
♪The wind whispers to the forest♪

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,180
♪I wander into the dream under the clear galaxy...♪

407
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,940
I won't forget you,

408
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,810
Herbs Garden.

409
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,530
Just go!

410
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
♪This journey that spans across the universe♪

411
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,460

415
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,180
Come up.

416
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,010
You can't bring

417
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,810
those weary eyes of yours.

418
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,010
Present yourself properly.
(Watch on wwww.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

419
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,010
Again.

420
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,290
Come up.

421
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,380
Greetings,

422
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,460
I am Han Li.

423
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,570
You're greeting your master.

424
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,380
You have to kneel.

425
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,220
Greetings,

426
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,220
I am Han Li.

427
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,860
All right. Get up.

428
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,090
Thanks, Master.

429
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,730
As per our tradition,

430
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,960
before Master takes you in,

431
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,900
I have to give you a test.

432
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,290
I am but an average disciple.

433
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,420
I ask

434
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,660
for your leniency.

435
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,090
Relax.

436
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,290
It's just a simple test.

437
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,380
If you can understand my flute notes,

438
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,700
I consider you passed.

439
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,700
Close your eyes.

440
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,900
Open your eyes.

441
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,770
What did you hear?

442
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,090
Silence

443
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,330
speaks louder than words.

444
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,900
You passed.

445
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,570
In the Foundation Establishment Stage,

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,860
you will be able to sense the power in all beings.

447
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,860
It's as if you have one more sense on top of your five senses.

448
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,660
Do not forget this.

449
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,810
Thank you, Senior.

450
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,530
My turn now.

451
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,380
Remove the bird's ability to fly

452
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,620
without hurting it.

453
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,940
Then, you'll pass.

454
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,660
How kind of you, Senior.

455
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,010
You wanted me to help you

456
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,460
free a trapped bird, right?

457
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,940
Yes.

458
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,200
Since Senior Liu approves of you,

459
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,660
I consider you passed.

460
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:17,900
All right.

461
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,530
It's my turn now.

462
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,050
Dodge all three of my sand pouches.

463
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,330
Then, you'll pass.

464
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,980
Here I go.

465
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,700
Good.

466
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,010
You passed.

467
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,010
Listen up.

468
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,490
Cultivation is important.

469
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,530
But don't forget

470
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,460
to train your body as well.

471
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,250
If you live a long life and don't move a lot,

472
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,530
you're no different from a tortoise.

473
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,380
It's my turn now.

474
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,900
Enough, Wu Xuan.

475
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,570
No.

476
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,940
He's better than this.

477
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,290
Tier 4?

478
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,770
Upon reaching Tier 4 of the Qingyuan Sword Manual,

479
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,570
you can guard against blades automatically.

480
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,220
The manual states

481
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,420
that

482
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,220
when attacked,

483
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,570
the shield will block any blades.

484
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,460
You've reached Tier 4 of the manual?

485
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,810
Don't you know you should

486
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,090
stop at Tier 3?

487
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,980
Did you feel something off

488
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,220
when you were cultivating?

489
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,290
My progress slows down

490
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,380
a lot

491
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,330
at Tier 4.

492
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,490
After a while,

493
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,010
the spirit power I gathered

494
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,700
will slowly disappear.

495
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,860
It's

496
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,380
the dissipation.

497
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,730
Dissipation?

498
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,090
Upon reaching Tier 4 of the Qingyuan Sword Manual,

499
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,980
your power dissipates

500
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,620
every few days.

501
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,220
But Master didn't tell me about this

502
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,380
when he taught me.

503
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,090
Calm down, Han.

504
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,900
At Tier 4,

505
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,660
only 1/10 of your power will dissipate.

506
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,490
At Tier 5,

507
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,380
another 1/10 of your power will dissipate.

508
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,570
That's too much.

509
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,660
I trained so hard to reach Tier 4

510
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,290
just for it to backfire on me?

511
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,220
It is a flawed

512
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,770
but unique technique.

513
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,380
I was told that each tier you reached

514
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,980
would expand your Meridian system

515
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,570
and deepen your energy pool.

516
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,860
You will have

517
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,330
much more power reserve

518
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,140
than your peers.

519
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,420
That's right.

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,400
Perhaps this is why

521
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,810
your power dissipates.

522
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,180
Unfortunately,

523
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,420
the manual we have is incomplete.

524
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,180
The sect only possesses the first nine tiers of the manual.

525
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,530
What do I do?

526
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,220
Master.

527
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,090
Han Li is here.

528
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,730
He is?

529
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,730
Right away.

530
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,490
I'm coming.

531
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,980
Give me a moment.

532
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,460
Greetings,

533
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,180
Master.

534
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,050
Forget it.

535
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,730
At ease.

536
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,810
It's a hassle.

537
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,900
Just get up.

538
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,940
As cultivators,

539
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,730
we seek simplicity.

540
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,810
From now on,

541
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,380
you

542
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,250
are my disciple.

543
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,420
Cultivate diligently

544
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,570
from now on.

545
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,700
Don't bring dishonor to my name.

546
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,730
Yes, Master.

547
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,220
You see, cultivation

548
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,380
is a way to defy your destiny.

549
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,980
Look at yourself.

550
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,490
The Foundation Pill has transformed

551
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,860
your body.

552
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,860
You no longer possess a mortal body.

553
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,010
But to go further,

554
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,380
you must train your mind too

555
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,380
in order

556
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,330
to complete your internal and external transformation.

557
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,380
Do enlighten me.

558
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,700
Mortals

559
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,810
have desires.

560
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,140
Therefore,

561
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,180
they have obsessions.

562
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,420
When you are obsessed,

563
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,380
it'll affect your progress.

564
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,860
You'll hit a bottleneck

565
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,250
as it turns into your inner demon.

566
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,810
In serious cases,

567
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,700
you might

568
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,050
lose your progress

569
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,810
or your life.

570
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,810
Master, do you mean

571
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,420
we should forsake our desires?

572
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,140
Not at all.

573
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,660
See?

574
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,330
I knew you would think that way.

575
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,090
You're wrong.

576
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,980
Cultivation

577
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,980
is about easement.

578
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,570
To forsake all desires

579
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,700
is to go against

580
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,770
the purpose of cultivation.

581
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,660
But

582
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,770
true easement

583
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,090
is hard to achieve.

584
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,090
Therefore, I ask my disciples

585
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,770
to accept all outcomes with grace.

586
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,330
Accept your

587
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,490
failures

588
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,980
and you make peace with yourself.

589
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,010
Make peace with yourself?

590
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,420
This is very important.

591
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,010
Make peace with yourself.

592
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,220
Ask your seniors.

593
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,010
I became the top Core Formation Stage cultivator

594
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,940
in our sect

595
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,770
thanks to this philosophy.

596
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,980
Greetings, Grandmaster Hongfu.

597
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,660
Hongfu.

598
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,140
Well,

599
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,180
I meant to say

600
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,620
the top male Core Formation Stage cultivator.

601
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,140
I need to borrow your master for some quick words.

602
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,250
But carry on.

603
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,530
I can wait.

604
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,050
We're done.

605
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,770
Han Li,

606
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,090
you're now in the Foundation Establishment Stage.

607
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,980
You can have your own cavern.

608
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,180
Show him where to get

609
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,700
the map to the back of the mountain

610
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,980
as well as the array for the cavern.

611
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,050
Go now.

612
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,420
- Yes, Master. - Yes, Master.

613
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,330
Hongfu,

614
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,490
just some quick words?

615
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,570
It could be more.

616
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,010
Well,

617
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,730
you...

618
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,140
Farewell, Master.

619
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,900
Go.

620
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,420
Farewell, Grandmaster.

621
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,660
You're so long-winded.

622
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,490
Just go already.

623
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,730
Farewell.

624
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,140
That silly kid.

625
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,090
Go ahead.

626
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,220
The Clear Void Sect brought us some news.

627
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,810
Fu Yunzi conducted an investigation for a year.

628
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,980
He reported that half of the surviving

629
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,180
disciples

630
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,290
in the Trial Ground

631
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,810
said that Spirit Beast Mountain was fishy.

632
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,570
300 years ago, that sect

633
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,570
split

634
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,140
from the Beast Taming Sect of the Six Demonic Sects.

635
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,050
It's not a stretch to think that they

636
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,860
are consorting with the demonic sects.

637
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,090
Remember who suggested

638
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,810
that we changed the opening date of the Trial Ground?

639
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,420
And who insisted that they knew where the demonic sects were?

640
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,730
The Beast Taming Sect.

641
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,050
I remember that.

642
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,380
You know what?

643
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,490
There's no use speculating.

644
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,770
Bring them over

645
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,180
and interrogate them.

646
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,220
All right.

647
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,050
I'll be leaving, then.

648
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,980
You're leaving?

649
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,290
So that's all.

650
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,530
I rehearsed my greetings so many times

651
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,460
only for it to end so abruptly.

652
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,490
Can I trust this master of mine?

653
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,490
He doesn't

654
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,220
look like someone enlightened.

655
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,730
Making peace with yourself.

656
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,570
What does

657
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,220
that even mean?

658
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,140
Han,

659
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,570
stop ruminating.

660
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,010
Making peace with yourself

661
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,140
is not something you get by thinking very hard about it.

662
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,490
Master was very cryptic about it.

663
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,050
Would you care to explain to me?

664
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,660
Obsessions can be huge or small.

665
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,010
We want different things,

666
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,490
so we each

667
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,860
have different obsessions.

668
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,690
Oh.

669
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,050
For Senior Liu,

670
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,300
his obsession

671
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,900
is to kill all evil perpetrators.

672
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,260
Wu Xuan's obsession

673
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,420
is Xuan'er.

674
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,940
Weiniang's obsession

675
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,740
is...

676
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,050
Shut your mouth.

677
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,130
My obsession

678
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,900
is to have a real fight with you.

679
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,340
Senior Song,

680
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,420
you know I can't defeat you.

681
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,610
Work hard then.

682
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,210
I'll be waiting.

683
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,340
Han,

684
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,490
there's no need to obsess over it.

685
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,780
Making peace with yourself

686
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,050
is easier said than done.

687
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,610
Look at our master.

688
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,090
Grandmaster Hongfu came and was like,

689
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,460
"I need to borrow your master for some quick words."

690
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,420
Just some quick words?

691
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,820
You silly kid.

692
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,860
You're so long-winded.

693
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,940
Just go already.

694
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,820
Just go!

695
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,420
We're talking about you.

696
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,130
You weren't aware?

697
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,260
If you get

698
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,090
easily distracted in your progress,

699
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,820
how can you achieve true peace?

700
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,220
[Nangong Wan, Early Core Formation Stage]

701
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,380
Congratulations,

702
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,340
Wan.

703
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,340
You have returned to the Core Formation Stage.

704
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,300
I've nonetheless lost a lot of progress.

705
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,130
It's all that fool's fault.

706
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,570
Who?

707
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,980
I was asking

708
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,130
if our disciples

709
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,050
have been cultivating properly or not.

710
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,170
Wan,

711
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,450
I've had a feeling that something is on your mind after you left

712
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,610
the Bloody Trial Ground.

713
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,130
Tell me already.

714
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,420
What exactly

715
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,090
happened there?

716
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,980
My name is Han Li.

717
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,260
Shoo.

718
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,210
Shoo?

719
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,820
No.

720
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,090
I mean the sun.

721
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,050
The sun

722
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,530
is bright today.

723
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,300
You...

724
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,900
Since you care so much about our sect,

725
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,610
do tend

726
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,490
to those pending tasks accumulated while you were cultivating in solitude.

727
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,050
You just returned to the Core Formation Stage.

728
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,570
Your mind is still clamoring.

729
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,780
We don't want any inner demon now, do we?

730
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,260
Anyway,

731
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,980
I was expecting you.

732
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,690
Thanks to the Green Vial,

733
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,490
I have an abundance of pills.

734
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,460
But the dissipation of my power is an issue.

735
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,210
They also said I could have my own cavern.

736
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,300
How do I do that?

737
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,740
Perhaps I should ask Mentor Wu.

738
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,900
I'm so pissed.

739
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,340
If I don't

740
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,780
get rid of Han Li,

741
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,490
I'll have an inner demon sooner or later.

742
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,650
Grandmaster.

743
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,530
Yes?

744
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,340
Yellow Maple Valley sent us a jade scroll.

745
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,610
Cultivator Li Huayuan

746
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,090
invites all Core Formation Stage cultivators

747
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,420
of the Seven Sects to discuss a strategy.

748
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,420
Got it.

749
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,460
What strategy?

750
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,780
He just wants someone to play mahjong with him.

751
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,610
But I do like the food there.

752
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,170
All right.

753
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,460
This can be my excuse.

754
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,170
My senior can't stop me.

755
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,090
And it's not about the food too.

756
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,980
I can

757
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,210
use this visit

758
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,260
to check if that he told anyone or not.

759
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,980
If he did,

760
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,690
I'd make him pay.

761
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,210
I need to kill him sooner or later.

762
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,170
Mentor Wu.

763
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,300
Mentor Wu.

764
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,300
Just call me Senior Wu.

765
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,530
I'm used to it already.

766
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,210
You taught me so many things

767
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,300
when I first came here.

768
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,900
If you hadn't done that,

769
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,090
I wouldn't have been able to enter the Bloody Trial Ground.

770
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,340
Allow me to keep this appellation,

771
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,340
Mentor Wu.

772
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,530
It doesn't matter anyway.

773
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,460
I saw you studying mugwort therapy

774
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,820
in Herbs Garden last time.

775
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,490
These two vials

776
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,530
can help reduce the foul energy on you.

777
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,530
It's more convenient too.

778
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,650
Just let me know

779
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,690
if you want

780
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,780
to steam some mugwort.

781
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,170
Thanks.

782
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,050
It's very considerate of you.

783
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,010
Oh.

784
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,690
Have you found a place

785
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,740
for your cavern?

786
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,340
The array we distribute

787
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,570
barely suffice.

788
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,210
You need to pull

789
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,300
some tricks.

790
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,210
That said, I can't help you

791
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,780
in this regard.

792
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,340
Head to Treasure House

793
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,380
to find a spirit beast.

794
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,530
A spirit beast?

795
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,740
It can help you.

796
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,420
Wise choice, Mr. Li.

797
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,940
This is

798
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,170
a Treasure-Hunting Mouse that reached Grade 2 recently.

799
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,780
It can find herbs, steal gems,

800
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,170
and even locate a secret realm.

801
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,610
Locate a secret realm?

802
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,820
How much for it?

803
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,130
A lot.

804
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,340
I'll take it.

805
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,170
Come.

806
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,300
This is a lot.
