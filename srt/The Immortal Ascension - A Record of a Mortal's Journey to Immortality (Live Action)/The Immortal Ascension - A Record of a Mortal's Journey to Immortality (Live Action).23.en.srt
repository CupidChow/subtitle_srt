00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,700
Wu.

190
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,580
Master.

191
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,460
Wu's mistake

192
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,730
was grave enough

193
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,290
to warrant execution,

194
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,140
but I'm grateful you chose

195
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,140
to spare her.

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,340
Thank you, Master.

197
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,370
She has always been defiant,

198
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,050
but I know all five of you

199
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,580
mean no real harm.

200
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,020
This is

201
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,220
- the Foundation... - the Foundation...

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,660
- the Foundation... - the Foundation...

203
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,930
the Foundation Pill!

204
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,170
Take it.

205
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,580
You earned this.

206
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,180
- This is... - The Foundation...

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,250
This is for me.

208
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,930
I thought

209
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,020
I smelled something foul from a distance.

210
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,730
Bullhead,

211
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,580
who did this to you? You're in awful shape.

212
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,900
This is urgent.

213
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,900
I must report to Master immediately.

214
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,930
Let me through.

215
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,900
We got the Foundation Pill.

216
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,170
It'll work this time.

217
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,340
Keep your voice down.

218
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,290
There is hope for us now.

219
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,340
Stop talking.

220
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,900
Master.

221
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,540
Master.

222
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,700
Master.

223
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,540
Master.

224
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,100
Master.

225
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,580
The palace?

226
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,580
The Master of the Black Fiend Cult is really hiding

227
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,370
within the royal palace.

228
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,410
Wu,

229
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,810
open your eyes and look at me.

230
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,020
Wu, are you all right?

231
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,020
Wu.

232
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,290
He took his own life.

233
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,540
What is this?

234
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,700
An introduction to the Mystic Yin Art.

235
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,220
My respects to you, Master.

236
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,020
I have failed in my mission.

237
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,290
The outpost beyond the city walls,

238
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,540
Protector Wang,

239
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,780
and the Young Prince

240
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,900
have all been captured by the enemy.

241
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,340
I deserve whatever punishment you see fit.

242
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,610
Do not fault yourself.

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,660
Anyone who could wound you so grievously

244
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,140
is no common foe.

245
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,340
Those two must have acted

246
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,700
with reckless pride

247
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,610
and brought this fate

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,290
upon themselves.

249
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,050
Your wisdom is unmatched, Master.

250
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,370
Our opponent's strength

251
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,170
is formidable.

252
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,140
Even when I used my demon transformation, my Beast Form,

253
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,850
I still couldn't gain the upper hand.

254
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,460
Master,

255
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,140
from what I can tell,

256
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,050
his cultivation

257
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,290
is most likely at the Mid Foundation Stage.

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,370
If we track him through those rogue cultivators

259
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,010
and Protector Wang,

260
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,730
we should be able to figure out where he's from.

261
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,580
Then,

262
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,820
we'll capture him

263
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,770
and use his blood to aid your cultivation.

264
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,340
I'll be ending my seclusion soon.

265
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,850
If you stir up too much trouble now,

266
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,250
you'll attract the attention

267
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,980
of the Seven Great Sects

268
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,850
and the Six Demonic Sects.

269
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,060
Just be patient.

270
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,250
When I emerge from seclusion,

271
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,010
I'll have broken through to the next stage.

272
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,300
By then,

273
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,580
there's no one we'll need to fear.

274
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,530
My congratulations to you, Master.

275
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,650
Our lives and futures

276
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,980
all rest on you.

277
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,940
I will gather our forces

278
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,130
and strengthen our defenses.

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,250
We won't let him

280
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,490
interfere you.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,460
All of you may leave now.

282
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,610
I take my leave.

283
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,980
Tie Luo,

284
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,130
you stay.

285
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,180
I shall tend

286
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,100
to your injuries myself.

287
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,580
Thank you, Master.

288
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,370
Please help...

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,580
Master.

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,580
...bury him.

291
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,980
Yes, Master.

292
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,060
Master,

293
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,580
these are the loot and gems

294
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,460
we found on those cultists.

295
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,980
We offer it all to you.

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,940
You have been

297
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,060
a great help this time,

298
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,530
but what lies ahead will be

299
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,980
far too dangerous for you.

300
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,340
Consider this

301
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,180
my parting gift.

302
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,300
Parting gift?

303
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,650
- But... - Master,

304
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,700
did we do something wrong?

305
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Why are you leaving us?

306
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,420
Truth be told,

307
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,300
fighting alongside you

308
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,980
and taking down the cultists

309
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,700
over these past days

310
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,300
has brought me more joy than I've known

311
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,770
since I began cultivating.

312
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,820
That's true.

313
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,980
Master,

314
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,130
please don't leave us.

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,460
That's right, Master.

316
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,340
The Five Mengs stand for loyalty.

317
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,370
Are you really going to abandon us?

318
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,490
Take me with you, won't you?

319
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,370
Let me follow you...

320
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,940
The Black Fiend Cult

321
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,850
may have lost its wings,

322
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,340
but its core remains untouched.

323
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,300
All of you have been exposed.

324
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,980
If you stay in the Imperial Capital any longer,

325
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,370
you risk your lives.

326
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,250
We're not afraid!

327
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,730
My answer is still no.

328
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,770
Go back.

329
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,890
Master,

330
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,340
from this day forward,

331
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,980
the Five Mengs swear

332
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,940
to become your disciples.

333
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,940
We will follow you

334
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,340
through the ends of the world without hesitation.

335
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,980
Nonsense.

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,700
All of you,

337
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,010
be safe

338
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,460
and live long lives.

339
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,220
He's not taking us with him?

340
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,130
He's gone.

341
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,490
Take this Telepathy Talisman.

342
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,490
If anything happens,

343
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,370
send me a message through it.

344
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,980
While I was in the Imperial Capital,

345
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,580
I uncovered an organization practicing a deviant means of cultivation.

346
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,130
They're known

347
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,610
as the Black Fiend Cult.

348
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,100
Their claws reach deep into every level of the capital.

349
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,610
There's even a base hidden

350
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,820
within Prince Xin's Mansion.

351
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,220
I fear

352
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,980
the royal palace itself may have been compromised.

353
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,340
The front lines are already engulfed in chaos.

354
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,130
If they incite unrest

355
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,340
in the shadows now,

356
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,730
the Yue Kingdom

357
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,130
will never know peace.

358
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,730
Until this cult is gone,

359
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,490
I can't rest easy.

360
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,060
I urge you to dispatch reinforcements swiftly

361
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,770
to eliminate this threat, Master.

362
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,010
Hongfu,

363
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,890
listen to this.

364
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,130
None of my disciples ever let me relax,

365
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,890
especially that Han Li.

366
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,820
He may seem composed

367
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,850
most of the time,

368
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,850
but when it matters most, he's the least reliable.

369
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,890
I sent him to the Imperial Capital,

370
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,650
and what does he do?

371
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,940
Unearths a whole cult.

372
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,250
What cult?

373
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,460
Probably one that grew in the shadows while we were caught up

374
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,460
in the chaos of war.

375
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,220
The front lines are a disaster right now.

376
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,340
Maybe it's better for the younger ones

377
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,250
to stay far away from all this.

378
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,420
True.

379
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,530
You're right.

380
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,820
I'll send Liu Jing,

381
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,650
Wu Xuan,

382
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,420
Song Meng, and Weiniang away for now

383
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,610
to preserve our strength.

384
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,890
All right.

385
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,180
Let's go with that plan.

386
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,340
That boy just won't let me have

387
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,490
a moment of peace.

388
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,490
After all this time cultivating,

389
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,770
I still sneeze.

390
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,650
I have a bad feeling about this.

391
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,770
This won't do.

392
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,010
I mustn't let myself be distracted anymore.

393
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,700
I must cultivate.

394
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,770
Cultivate.

395
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,820
Cultivate.

396
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,770
As of now, I've raised my main technique, Cyan Sword Technique,

397
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,420
up to Tier 6.

398
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,730
Once the Qin Residence situation is dealt with,

399
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,460
I'll use the Green Vial's elixir

400
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,530
to attempt a breakthrough

401
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,730
into the Late Foundation Stage.

402
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,340
Dissipation?

403
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,730
Why are there signs of dissipation again?

404
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,060
According to Triple Cycle Core Rebirth,

405
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,460
once you reach Tier 6 in the Cyan Sword Technique,

406
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,730
you must let your cultivation dissipate

407
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,850
and rebuild it three times.

408
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,530
With my fake spirit root,

409
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,650
the only way I stand a real chance of breaking through to Core Formation

410
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,100
is by compressing my cultivation core over and over.

411
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,760
Still, repeated dissipation

412
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,860
causes too much strain.

413
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,890
And this manual doesn't appear

414
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,820
to be complete.

415
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,490
Demonic Transformation

416
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,890
can boost one's power tremendously,

417
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,700
but it comes with equally great risks.

418
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,490
Those who practiced it

419
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,650
eventually went insane.

420
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,130
Perhaps it's the eerie blood aura

421
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,100
that corrupts them.

422
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,130
The Blood Condensing Five-Element Pill can be used

423
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,220
to break through the Core Formation bottleneck.

424
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,130
That explains things.

425
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,700
The Master of the Black Fiend Cult

426
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,460
must be cultivating this art.

427
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,890
Still,

428
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,340
if it means turning into something

429
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,130
like Tie Luo, half-man and half-beast,

430
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,650
then never mind.

431
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,300
My tracks must have been exposed.

432
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,730
They got here fast.

433
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,730
Mr. Han!

434
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,300
Mr. Han,

435
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,770
you have visitors.

436
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,650
Visitors?

437
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,610
Mr. Han,

438
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,010
do you know them?

439
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,130
If not,

440
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,730
I can send them running.

441
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,490
All right.

442
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,300
Jing, Meng, Xuan, Weiniang,

443
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:07,980
please come in.

444
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,580
Seniors,

445
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,530
you've all traveled far

446
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,420
to assist me.

447
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,980
I'm grateful.

448
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,850
Han,

449
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,130
why the secrecy?

450
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,220
You even told us in your message

451
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,730
not to reveal that we're from Yellow Maple Valley.

452
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,580
How's our disguise?

453
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,890
Do we look like ordinary mortals?

454
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,460
We rushed here.

455
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,420
I'm glad we made it in time for the Lantern Festival.

456
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,700
You've been in the Imperial Capital a while now.

457
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,300
Have you visited Moxiang Abode?

458
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,570
They say the peonies here are unmatched.

459
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,810
Have you seen them for yourself?

460
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,330
Are there any great martial artists in the capital?

461
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,620
Any good food?

462
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,700
Tell us everything!

463
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,660
Han is here on Master's orders to eliminate evil

464
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,660
and uphold the righteous path.

465
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,140
It's best not to speak too casually

466
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,700
about mortal affairs.

467
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,250
Right, Han,

468
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,090
about that cult you mentioned.

469
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,220
What exactly is going on?

470
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,570
Allow me to explain, Senior Liu.

471
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,090
They're known as the Black Fiend Cult.

472
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,980
They have been operating in the Imperial Capital for years,

473
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,940
recruiting rogue cultivators from across the land.

474
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,140
But in truth,

475
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,380
they practice blood sacrifice,

476
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,770
killing fellow cultivators

477
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,050
to absorb their cultivation.

478
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,220
Unforgivable!

479
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,330
A cult that practices blood sacrifice

480
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,860
must be eradicated.

481
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,380
What is the Discipline Hall even doing?

482
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,700
A matter this serious,

483
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,050
and they know nothing?

484
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,420
Han,

485
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,490
do you have evidence

486
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,770
for these accusations?

487
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,900
Our sect's rules

488
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,490
strictly forbid

489
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,980
interfering in mortal kingdoms.

490
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,700
The elders

491
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,900
won't take it lightly

492
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,250
if you act recklessly

493
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,050
on mere assumptions.

494
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,570
If you ask me,

495
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,570
it's like hand doesn't know what the other is doing.

496
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,940
The Seven Sects are too busy fighting the demonic sects

497
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,770
to deal with anything else.

498
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,660
And most of the victims

499
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,700
are rogue cultivators,

500
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,460
with no sect or backing.

501
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,980
They're overlooked by the Seven Sects,

502
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,700
so they have no power or reason to interfere.

503
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,420
Based on the intelligence I've gathered,

504
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,940
the Black Fiend Cult currently

505
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,220
has four Foundation Establishment Stage Blood Guards,

506
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,770
and a Master

507
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,730
in seclusion.

508
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,330
Right now, the few of us working together

509
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,730
still stand a chance.

510
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,490
But if that Master breaks through,

511
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,220
the cult

512
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,010
will become a real threat.

513
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,220
- Amazing! - Wonderful!

514
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,660
Another!

515
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,490
Stop it.

516
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,180
Did you forget what Li warned?

517
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,940
There are still cult remnants free out there.

518
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,460
You've got to be cautious with your spellcasting for now.

519
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,660
Once someone learns spells,

520
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,460
how can they ever go back to living a mortal life?

521
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,900
It's just a trick.

522
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,290
Don't worry, Caihuan.

523
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,620
Li promised

524
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,860
he'd protect us.

525
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,460
- Impressive. - Indeed.

526
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,490
[Ye She]
Daoist Qingwen,

527
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,250
it has been confirmed.

528
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,900
Half of those rogue cultivators were intercepted by these two.

529
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,330
A child at the Qi Refining Stage

530
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,330
and a mortal?

531
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Before the incident,

532
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,730
they were spotted going in and out of the Qin Residence several times.

533
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,050
Should we bring them in and interrogate them?

534
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,140
No need.

535
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,490
We have enough clues for now.

536
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,140
If we move too soon,

537
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,490
we might cause more trouble than it's worth.

538
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,940
Head back.

539
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,330
Say nothing about tonight

540
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,570
to anyone.

541
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,530
Understood.

542
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,700
Qin Residence...

543
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,460
Ye She,

544
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,140
let's go.

545
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,810
The lantern festival is lively.

546
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,660
It's time

547
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,940
we acted too.

548
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,490
Everyone,

549
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,810
stop hesitating.

550
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,290
Han worked hard

551
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,900
to uncover the cultists' secrets.

552
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,250
Now is the time

553
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,900
to act.

554
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,700
Meng,

555
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,730
aren't you always itching for a good fight?

556
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,860
Fine.

557
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,010
Since you've put it that way,

558
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,010
count me in.

559
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,660
If Jing's going,

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,660
then so am I.

561
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,290
Han, you brought us here.

562
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,860
You must have a plan.

563
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,660
Tell us

564
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,530
about it.

565
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,730
[Map of the Yue Kingdom Imperial Palace]
I left a tracking mark

566
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,730
on one of the cultists.

567
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,410
- The palace? - The palace?

568
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,420
The Imperial Palace of Yue Kingdom.

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,770
The Imperial Garden.

570
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,770
The Imperial Library.

571
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,140
The cult

572
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,660
picked their location well.

573
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,010
Cultivators are strictly forbidden from entering the palace.

574
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,090
It's a firm rule.

575
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,980
Should we storm in recklessly

576
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,010
and falter,

577
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,420
the consequences will be dire.

578
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,220
That's exactly

579
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,330
what they're counting on.

580
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,770
I fear

581
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,490
even the emperor

582
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,700
may have become their puppet.

583
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,980
They're using that rule

584
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,660
to restrict our movements.

585
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,530
But if we back down now,

586
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,140
we're playing right into their hands.

587
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,980
Sometimes,

588
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,250
rules outweigh

589
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,730
right and wrong.

590
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,290
Rules are made by men.

591
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,530
Right and wrong are set by the heavens.

592
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,220
How can they be the same?

593
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,570
If blame comes from above,

594
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,770
I'll take full responsibility.

595
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,220
The enemy is exposed.

596
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,010
It's the perfect chance to strike their core!

597
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,420
I agree with Senior Liu.

598
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,250
So do I.

599
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,940
Did you forget to mention that this cult

600
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,330
was hiding inside the palace?

601
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,010
Or were you simply unaware?

602
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,250
Senior Wu,

603
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,810
no matter

604
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,140
where the cult tries to hide,

605
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,380
we can't just stand by and do nothing.

606
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,810
He's right.

607
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,700
Xuan,

608
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,090
are you coming with us or not?

609
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,490
Just give us a straight answer.

610
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,050
Yes, you should come with us.

611
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,770
I'm afraid I must decline.

612
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,290
I urge all of you to reconsider.

613
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,460
Don't misjudge yourselves.

614
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,570
Farewell.

615
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,700
- Xuan! - Wu Xuan!

616
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,860
Let him go.

617
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,220
Those demonic sects

618
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,140
are barely a threat.

619
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,460
We don't need everyone to take them down.

620
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,380
We can do this

621
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,570
even without him.

622
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,810
With you here,

623
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,140
those demonic sects don't stand a chance.

624
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:42,940
That's right.

625
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,220
The three of us

626
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,250
are more than enough.

627
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,140
Still, better safe than sorry.

628
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,570
We have to always assume

629
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,330
the worst from our enemies.

630
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,050
Han's right.

631
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,900
Evil forces are nothing to fear,

632
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,730
but those four Blood Guards are a different matter altogether.

633
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,490
We mustn't underestimate them.

634
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,460
But if we ask the sect for more reinforcements...

635
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,090
I have an idea.

636
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,330
There's someone who can help us.

637
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,860
Look!

638
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,460
- Look at all those lanterns! - They're beautiful!

639
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,700
That fish lantern is exquisite.

640
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,180
It's so lively here.

641
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,010
- It's so beautiful here. - Han,

642
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,380
you never told us

643
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,660
the mortal markets were this lively.

644
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,490
It's my first time

645
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,660
at such a festive event too.

646
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,530
Really?

647
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,380
Weiniang,

648
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,090
check this out!

649
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,180
While the cultivation world

650
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,330
is mired in turmoil, the mortal realm

651
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,980
could still find moments of celebration.

652
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,700
It probably won't last.

653
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,770
Soon enough, blood and chaos will flood these streets again.

654
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,250
I grew up

655
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,770
in war as well.

656
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,940
Troops from the north and south clashed endlessly.

657
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,530
No matter who won,

658
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,050
it was always

659
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,730
the common people who paid the price.

660
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,620
These cultists

661
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,220
feed off that chaos.

662
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,140
Just thinking about what they've done

663
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,490
makes my blood boil.

664
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,940
I want to tear them limb from limb.

665
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,250
Did something happen to Senior Liu in the past?

666
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,290
He gets so worked up

667
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,490
every time a cult is mentioned.

668
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,940
Hey,

669
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,730
look who's here!

670
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,770
I brought help.

671
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,330
- Chen. - Senior Liu.

672
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,330
- Chen. - Senior Song.

673
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,730
Senior Chen.

674
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,220
Han.

675
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,140
You're always asking me

676
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,050
about Han.

677
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,900
Well, he's right here now.

678
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,490
I already told Qiaoqian

679
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,570
about the Black Fiend Cult.

680
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,860
She happened to be around here on a clan mission

681
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,090
in Nanwu City,

682
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,090
and agreed right away

683
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,530
to help us storm the palace.

684
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,010
I've been receiving reports from the frontlines.

685
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,810
The battle against the demonic sects is finally winding down,

686
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,460
so I took the chance

687
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,980
to visit the Imperial Capital and take a breather.

688
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,900
If I can be of help to you,

689
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,140
all the better.

690
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,090
All right.

691
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,950
You two catch up.

692
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,980
Let's go check out the lanterns, Jing.

693
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,010
- Come on! - I...

694
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,090
Learn from us.

695
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,090
Speak your mind.

696
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,220
Never keep it bottled inside.

697
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,490
Qiaoqian.

698
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,120
- Let's go see the lanterns! - Go on.

699
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,700
Slow down.

700
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,730
Let's go! Wait for us!

701
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,660
Let's go!

702
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,660
Let's go see the lanterns!

703
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,420
Senior Liu!

704
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,660
Han.

705
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,980
It's been a while.

706
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,090
When I was young,

707
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,420
my father kept me holed up at home cultivating.

708
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,420
I missed out on so much of the world's splendor.

709
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,380
Now, I find myself a little envious

710
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,940
of those who get to experience it.

711
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,220
Xiaomei.

712
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,620
Father.

713
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,090
Mother.

714
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,730
Li Feiyu.

715
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,700
I hope all of you are well.

716
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,090
Han?

717
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,050
There is nothing to envy.

718
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,290
The cold of the mountains

719
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,570
and the suffering of the world,

720
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,330
immortals or mortals,

721
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,220
all have their burdens.

722
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,570
Do you think

723
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,490
there is another world

724
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,810
behind the reflection in the water?

725
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,900
A place without cruelty

726
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,090
or war,

727
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,730
filled with freedom

728
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,090
and purity.

729
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,940
Like a dream.

730
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,940
Illusions, like blossoms in a mirror and the moonlight on water.

731
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,290
Beautiful, but fleeting.

732
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,420
This world holds

733
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,330
more sorrow than joy.

734
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,570
Even on the path of cultivation,

735
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,010
there is more hardship

736
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,570
than ease.

737
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,860
Senior,

738
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,250
you should try to let go.

739
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,860
You're unshackled by petty concerns.

740
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,460
Talking to you for just a bit

741
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,220
has helped me forget all my troubles.

742
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,220
Have you had any dreams lately?

743
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,250
Ever since I began cultivation,

744
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,090
I rarely dream anymore.

745
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,140
Is that so?

746
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,660
I've been dreaming a lot lately.

747
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,220
There is always a dark figure

748
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,900
chasing me.

749
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,900
No matter how I run, I can't escape.

750
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,490
But every time,

751
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,770
someone appears and protects me.

752
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,420
Yet, I can never see their face clearly.

753
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,290
Maybe what you saw

754
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,380
was only a reflection in the water.

755
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,860
Fireworks!

756
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,700
Fireworks!

757
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,570
They're so pretty!

758
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,140
- Look, Jing! - Stunning!

759
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,770
They're gorgeous!

760
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,770
I see it!

761
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,290
Jing,

762
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,420
they're so beautiful!

763
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,090
Look!

764
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,730
Look, Jing!

765
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,860
It's amazing!

766
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,810
Look at that color!

767
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,180
Look, Jing!

768
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,290
This is amazing!

769
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,700
Isn't it?

770
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,010
Look, Jing!

771
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,180
It's phenomenal.

772
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,980
Look at that one!

773
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,940
That one's so pretty!

774
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,090
- Isn't it? - Look at that!

you belong with them, after all.

794
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,810
Cultivators and mortals

795
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,140
were never part of the same world.

796
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,090
I can never

797
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,140

Miss Mo,

801
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,330
take care of yourself.

802
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,420
How shameless!

803
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,900
That Han

804
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,180
is too much!

805
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,670
Inviting all those relatives of his to stay at our residence

806
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,620
for free.

807
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,040
Does he think the Qin family runs a charity?

808
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,490
Please, Young Master. Calm yourself.

809
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,170
Mr. Han is new here.

810
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:35,980
He hardly knows any propriety.

811
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,930
Besides,

812
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,290
the Master seems to favor him now.

813
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,180
You're above all this.

814
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,180
No need to stoop to his level.

815
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,090
Fine.

816
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,620
If I can't get at Han,

817
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,250
I'll settle for his miserable relatives instead.

818
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,180
Are you really going to go that far?

819
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,090
Some people are just too eager

820
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,050
to take the lead.

821
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,620
If they lose,

822
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,700
I'll personally report them

823
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,330
to the Discipline Hall.

824
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,140
Xuan'er,

825
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,090
you think I'm right, don't you?

826
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,420
I only want what's best for them,

827
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,050
but they never listen.

828
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,730
I miss you so much.

829
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,420
You're one

830
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,140
of Han's people, aren't you?

831
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,090
Han?

832
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,050
Men.

833
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,810
Teach him a lesson.

834
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,460
Monster!

835
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,730
He's a monster!

836
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,770
Run!

837
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,530
Get out of here!

838
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,110
Come on!

839
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,730
Run!

840
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,460
He's a monster!

841
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,770
Xuan'er,

842
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,420
I didn't scare you, did I?

843
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,900
These people...

844
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,010
Who's there?

845
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,420
Such a bizarre cultivation technique...

846
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,050
A new Foundation Establishment cultivator is around here.

847
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,900
Unclear origins.

848
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,050
Connected to the Qin residence.

849
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,250
Looks like

850
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,810
you're the one we've been searching for.

851
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,770
You must

852
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,570
be mistaken.

853
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,940
That matters not.

854
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,490
What matters is that our Master

855
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,250
is breaking through right now.

856
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,900
You're at Foundation Establishment Stage.

857
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,460
We don't want to waste your cultivation.

858
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,810
One against two, I don't stand a chance.

859
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,570
I need to warn the others.

860
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,180
How are you feeling?

861
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,570
I am to blame.

862
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,860
To think you had to tend to my wounds

863
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,050
during your closed-door cultivation.

864
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,900
You've served me for many years.

865
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,140
Healing you

866
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,940
is no trouble at all.

867
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,420
But it seems

868
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,090
someone has placed

869
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,210
a tracking seal

870
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,570
on you.

871
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,570
Do you want me

872
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,420
to remove it?

873
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,740
No, Master.

874
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,300
Leaving that mark

875
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,210
might serve

876
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,860
a greater purpose.

877
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,380
What do you mean?

878
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,460
If he traces it

879
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,610
and finds his way here,

880
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,340
we can turn the tables

881
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,980
and trap him instead.

882
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,780
Once I capture him,

883
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,380
we'll sacrifice him

884
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,340
to aid your cultivation.

885
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,740
Very well.

886
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,340
Let's do it your way.

887
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,300
Master.

888
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,530
I come bearing good news.

889
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,820
I've acquired a valuable gift

890
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,860
and wish to present it to you.

891
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,300
Show me what it is.

892
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,740
Indeed, the scent of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's blood.

893
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,420
Leave me.

894
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,050
I want to savor this

895
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,570
in solitude.

896
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,260
Seniors,

897
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,940
do you remember this map?

898
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,420
I've been

899
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,820
watching this for days.

900
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,920
[Map of the Yue Kingdom Imperial Palace]

901
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,610
Even before

902
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,900
you all arrived at the Imperial Capital,

903
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,210
it never once

904
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,460
moved an inch.

905
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,740
You mean

906
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,490
they knew they were being followed

907
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,170
and set up an ambush there?

908
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,260
That's right.

909
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,980
Instead of walking into their trap,

910
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,740
we'll use it against them.

911
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,460
Then, we'll bypass this area

912
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,780
and enter

913
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,820
through the Royal Bedchambers and Cold Palace.

914
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,380
Tonight, we split into two groups.

915
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,130
Weiniang and Chen will head

916
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,090
to the Royal Bedchambers to rescue Emperor Yue,

917
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,860
while the rest of us

918
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,460
seek the Master's hiding place

919
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,900
before he leaves seclusion.

920
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,340
We strike where they're forced to respond,

921
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,380
then ambush their reinforcements.

922
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,300
Precisely.

923
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,650
That's the plan.

924
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,420
In that case,

925
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,010
everyone take a short rest.

926
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,570
We move out at the hour of Zi tonight.

927
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,260
Let us unite our strength

928
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,490
and eradicate the cult.

929
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,780
Understood.

930
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,460
Someone's coming.

931
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,380
Mr. Han.

932
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,690
The kitchen has prepared some refreshments.

933
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,490
Would any of you care for some?

934
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,210
Great!

935
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,300
We're starving.

936
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,900
That won't be necessary.

937
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,050
Please leave us.

938
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,170
Is there anything else?

939
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,570
Mr. Han.

940
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,840
The Young Master seems to have lost his mind

941
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,460
after he returned from the street.

942
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,130
He's completely out of it.

943
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,340
He won't stop muttering,

944
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,530
"Spare me, Immortal."

945
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,460
Madam fainted from worry.

946
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,820
The physician says there's nothing more he can do.

947
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,050
The Master has sent me

948
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,490
to fetch you

949
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,530
to examine them.

950
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,340
I must tend to this.

951
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,740
It won't delay our plans.

952
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,980
This is far too risky.

953
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,570
I just barely got off the frontlines,

954
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,490
and now I have to fight for my life once more in the Imperial Capital.

955
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,610
The two of you.

956
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,610
I will report your contributions tonight

957
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,490
to the Seven Sects.

958
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,130
I promise your efforts

959
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,210
won't be in vain.

960
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,420
This mission will be grueling.

961
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,610
Tonight,

962
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,010
we will require your support.

963
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,090
We won't

964
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,280
let you down.

965
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,400
- All done. - Oh, my son!

966
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,610
You're finally awake!

967
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,230
Master.

968
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,690
Mr. Han brought him back like a miracle.

969
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,460
He merely touched

970
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,430
the Young Master lightly, and he woke.

971
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,300
Madam is all better now too.

972
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,420
Go on! Quickly!

973
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,070
Master.

974
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,610
Mr. Qin.

975
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,690
I can never truly repay

976
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,980
your kindness.

977
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,970
Lord Qin, no need for such words.

978
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,490
Still, allow me to say this.

979
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,220
After tonight,

980
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,660
things may change.

981
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,090
You are a good man.

982
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,090
It would be wise to make preparations.

983
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,340
Change?

984
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,320
[Bamboo Grove in Imperial Garden, Imperial Palace]

985
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,450
In this entire palace,

986
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,610
only this bamboo grove is well-hidden.

987
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,450
We'll use this location

988
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,930
as our fallback point.

989
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,340
The Black Fiend Cult Master's cultivation is at least

990
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,300
at the Late Foundation Stage.

991
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,740
It's going to be a tough fight.

992
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,890
This is the perfect opportunity

993
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,270
to test the newly restored Five Phases Reversing Array.

994
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,010
Sword auras,

995
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,900
sword shields,

996
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,050
talismans,

997
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,970
artifacts, and talisman scripts are ready.

998
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,130
I've got my trump card too.

999
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,380
The only thing left

1000
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,010
is to give it everything I've got.

1001
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,650
Han.

1002
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,010
There's still some time before we move out.

1003
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,860
Can we have a moment alone to talk?

1004
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,610
Han.

1005
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,650
Before the Bloody Trial,

1006
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,090
you were the one who saved me

1007
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,740
in Yellow Maple Valley, right?

1008
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,690
No need to deny it.

1009
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,610
I know it wasn't a dream.

1010
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,980
I know

1011
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,010
it was you.

1012
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,980
And not just that one time.

1013
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,090
I feel like we've crossed paths many times since then.

1014
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,260
Every time I see you,

1015
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,900
I feel a little closer.

1016
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,380
But for some reason,

1017
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,380
I just can't remember clearly.

1018
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,650
Are the effects of the Oblivion Pill

1019
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,820
wearing off again?

1020
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,090
Forget it.

1021
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,530
If I can't remember, then I'll stop trying.

1022
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,170
I just wanted to tell you

1023
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,260
that the engagement between me and that Lu scoundrel

1024
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,940
was arranged by our families.

1025
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,690
I never had any feelings for him.

1026
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,010
Senior Chen,

1027
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,820
I...

1028
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,260
I don't even know why I'm telling you all this.

1029
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,530
But,

1030
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,010
there are just some things I wanted you to know.

1031
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,530
You don't think

1032
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,300
I'm a bad person, do you?

1033
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:24,610
No.

1034
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,380
All right.

1035
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,490
That's all I wanted to say.

1036
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,210
The operation will begin soon.

1037
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,780
Don't let yourself get distracted.

1038
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,940
Go make your preparations.

1039
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,490
Han,

1040
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,940
one more thing.

1041
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,050
Not far from Yellow Maple Valley

1042
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,860
is Baili Mountain,

1043
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,530
where wildflowers bloom in abundance.

1044
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,690
It's a beautiful sight.

1045
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,570
If we make it through tonight safe,

1046
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,420
would you go see the flowers with me?

1047
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,820
Senior,

1048
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,860
I don't think...

1049
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,260
So you want me

1050
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,010
to remember everything from before.

1051
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,210
Senior.

1052
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,530
With an invitation like that,

1053
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,860
how could I say no?

1054
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,460
I'll follow your arrangements.

1055
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,420
