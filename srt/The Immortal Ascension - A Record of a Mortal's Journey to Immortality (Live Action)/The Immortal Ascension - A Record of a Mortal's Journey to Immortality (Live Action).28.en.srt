Huayuan.

39
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,540
Come over.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,170
Sit and have some tea.

41
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,410
No need for tea.

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,690
My Senior Hongfu...

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,220
Grandmaster...

44
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,570
Was that person just here?

45
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,340
You're a clever man.

46
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,780
Why bother asking?

47
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,540
Then I'll take my leave.

48
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,220
Huayuan.

49
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,130
Do you remember

50
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,260
the first lesson I gave you

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,730
when you joined the sect?

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,610
I do.

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,500
The highest state of cultivation

54
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,290
is absolute detachment.

55
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,940
It lies in

56
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,610
letting go of desire.

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,340
It lies in

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,340
learning to give up.

59
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,540
It lies in...

60
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,100
I remember it all.

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,980
I also remember

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,010
another thing you once told me.

63
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,220
If you can't even clear your own thoughts,

64
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,730
what's the point of cultivating at all?

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,500
Exactly.

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,410
Yet after all I said,

67
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,570
you didn't take in a word, did you?

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,340
If you had,

69
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,660
would we

70
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,170
be under siege like this?

71
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,660
Your criticism is fair, Grandmaster.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,100
Sacrifice a little

73
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,170
to preserve

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,060
our sect.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,940
It's the best

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,730
we can do now.

77
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,260
Do you

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,820
have a better plan?

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,730
No, of course not.

80
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,610
This strategy truly took everything.

81
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,410
It's brilliant and exhausting.

82
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,290
I couldn't have pulled it off.

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,290
That tongue of yours...

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,660
You think

85
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,690
I can't hear

86
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,220
the sarcasm in your voice?

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,220
Grandmaster,

88
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,930
I just want to know

89
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,140
one thing.

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,660
Does my Senior Hongfu

91
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,980
and my disciple Han Li

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,250
know about this?

93
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,540
Well...

94
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,220
Then I'll ask Senior Hongfu myself.

95
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,140
Let's see

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,700
if she's willing.

97
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,290
You handed her over to Yunlu!

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,580
That fiend

99
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,100
slaughters innocents

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,410
and plans to destroy Yellow Maple Valley!

101
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,930
If she falls into his hands,

102
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,250
she'll die before she gives in!

103
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,490
It was a trade.

104
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,290
Not a betrayal.

105
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,660
Thanks for clarifying, Grandmaster.

106
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,810
Their main force is Mid Foundation cultivators.

107
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,780
A few are early stage.

108
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,370
What rotten luck!

109
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,980
We ran into the elites.

110
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,020
But the real trouble

111
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,700
are the two leading them.

112
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,700
Hongfu of Yellow Maple Valley is here.

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,220
Who wishes to face me?

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,700
Oh, I thought you'd be some sweet young lady.

115
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,100
But you're already so old.

116
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,050
And not even

117
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,340
that good-looking.

118
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,170
Right?

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,250
Your figure's not much either.

120
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,850
What on earth

121
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,220
does the Grandmaster see in you?

122
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,850
You insolent fool!

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,490
Ms,

124
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,340
always rushing to fight

125
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,250
the moment we meet.

126
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,540
That's a nasty habit!

127
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,220
Two Core cultivators.

128
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,900
I am

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,170
from the Ghost Spirit Sect.

130
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,850
They call me Skull.

131
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,660
You seem to be in a hurry.

132
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,810
Where are you headed?

133
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,980
I can sense Fu Yunzi's aura on you.

134
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,100
You mean that old Daoist?

135
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,140
He turned out

136
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,900
to be quite the worthy opponent.

137
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,700
In that case,

138
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,410
this item...

139
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,900
Mentor Fu Yunzi's relic!

140
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,100
I now return it to you!

141
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,100
For returning

142
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,900
a fallen friend's keepsake,

143
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,900
I'll overlook

144
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,850
your earlier offense.

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,780
But I'm taking these disciples.

146
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,460
I hope you two

147
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,780
won't stop me.

148
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,170
You dumb woman,

149
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,250
are you slow in the head?

150
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,850
Don't you get it?

151
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,850
We came for you.

152
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,900
These disciples

153
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,460
are just extras.

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,050
The real prize

155
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,610
is you!

156
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,300
Mrs,

157
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,890
Grandmaster Yunlu requests your presence.

158
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,420
Please come with us.

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,220
As for these disciples,

160
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,940
since we are at war,

161
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,850
I can't let them go.

162
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,940
Apologies.

163
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,130
In that case,

164
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,610
let's fight!

165
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,850
Break out the moment battle starts.

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,130
Whoever escapes, escapes.

167
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,250
Meet at the spot marked by the Soul-Burning Spell.

168
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,730
Grandmaster!

169
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,220
Go now.

170
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,100
This fight isn't for you!

171
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,100
Move!

172
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,700
Qu Hun, move!

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,580
Trying to run?

174
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,100
Your opponent is here.

175
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,420
Is this where it all ends?

176
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,700
I hope Han Li and the others got out.

177
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,770
We're almost there.

178
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,980
We'll be safe once we're there.

179
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,700
Han!

180
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,010
Something's off.

181
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,010
Be careful!

182
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,180
This is clearly the meeting spot.

183
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,820
Why are the demonic cultivators here?

184
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,370
Where's the person sent to pick us up?

185
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,700
There won't be anyone.

186
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,650
Come with me!

187
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,180
It's him!

188
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,250
Oh, isn't that Li Feiyu?

189
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,420
No.

190
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,650
You're not Li Feiyu.

191
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,010
Your name is...

192
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,730
Han Li.

193
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,940
No wonder I couldn't track you down.

194
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,820
How did he know I'd be here?

195
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,300
Not bad.

196
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,300
You've got some skills.

197
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,220
This makes killing you way more fun!

198
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,010
A Core cultivator is here...

199
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,340
Master!

200
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,010
You're a lucky one, kid.

201
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,850
You made me work so hard

202
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,100
just to find you.

203
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,700
Master,

204
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,010
I finally found you.

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,300
Where's your Mentor Hongfu?

206
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,770
She told us

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,650
to meet here.

208
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,060
And she stayed behind

209
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,700
to stall those demonic cultivators.

210
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,180
Didn't expect

211
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,100
we'd get ambushed too.

212
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,820
I see.

213
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,610
You've done well.

214
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,420
Here.

215
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,010
Take this.

216
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,300
Some supplies and gems.

217
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,730
If you run into your senior brothers and sisters,

218
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,730
share these with them for me.

219
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,650
Also this.

220
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,770
This one

221
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,420
is for you to keep.

222
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,220
[Core Formation Notes]

223
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,130
There are some insights from me.

224
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,010
Read them when you're breaking through.

225
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,010
Thanks for your guidance, Master.

226
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,220
But I can't accept

227
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,820
this mystic pouch.

228
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,730
Please,

229
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,130
give it to the others yourself

230
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,980
once you return safely.

231
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,490
What are you talking about?

232
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,650
It's just some travel funds.

233
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,700
Alright, enough.

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,580
Next up

235
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,130
is a battle between Core cultivators.

236
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,460
With your current level,

237
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,370
you won't be able to help at all.

238
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,700
Hurry up

239
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,820
and focus on healing.

240
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,820
Remember,

241
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,820
once you leave Yue Kingdom,

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,250
the demonic sects won't be able to reach you.

243
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,340
Got it?

244
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,060
Master...

245
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,650
do you really have to go?

246
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,060
What?

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,650
Go where?

248
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,420
From what those demonic guys said,

249
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,940
they may not want

250
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,850
to kill Senior Hongfu.

251
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,730
They seem to have a hidden motive.

252
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,340
Please be extra careful.

253
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,850
You kid...

254
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,010
I can't hide anything, huh?

255
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,100
Come on.

256
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,820
Get up.

257
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,580
Han Li,

258
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,890
you haven't been here long,

259
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,650
but you're smart,

260
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,700
cautious,

261
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,460
and know how to keep a low profile.

262
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,730
One day,

263
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,820
you may even surpass me.

264
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,530
I know full well,

265
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,530
this mission

266
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,980
is incredibly dangerous.

267
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,220
Odds are I won't make it back.

268
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,700
But I have my reasons.

269
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,530
The longer one lives,

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,250
the more one realizes

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,770
some things in this world

272
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,770
matter more than your own life.

273
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,060
Like...

274
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,370
certain people.

275
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,460
Give me your hand.

276
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,250
I'll remove the Soul-Burning Spell

277
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,330
for you.

278
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,530
This settles our sect's debt to you.

279
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,770
Alright.

280
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,530
Leave Yue Kingdom quickly.

281
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,290
There are many beautiful sights out there.

282
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,290
Go see them for me.

283
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,220
That's enough.

284
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,250
I'm off now.

285
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,220
We're alive?

286
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,900
Where even are we?

287
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,090
That guy's insane.

288
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,570
Stick with him,

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,330
and you'll end up dead sooner or later.

290
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,290
What did you say?

291
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,530
I didn't say anything!

292
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,770
Just spitting out some sand.

293
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,810
I meant, congrats, Young Master!

294
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,050
You made it out alive against a Core cultivator!

295
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,220
You're destined for great things!

296
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,290
Any plans now?

297
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,940
What plans can I have?

298
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,250
Oh, I've got loads of ideas,

299
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,900
but the big calls

300
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,940
are up to you.

301
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,490
You give the word, I'll follow.

302
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,980
We'll head to Yellow Maple Valley

303
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,010
and regroup with the Grandmaster.

304
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,570
Han Li...

305
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,420
I swear I'll kill you myself someday!

306
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,770
What's wrong with you?

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,290
You truly are the strongest woman of Yellow Maple Valley.

308
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,660
Your strength is remarkable.

309
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,690
Seems I'll have to

310
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,740
give it everything I've got!

311
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,060
Let's grab that woman first,

312
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,940
then kill off the weaklings.

313
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,060
Just leave her face intact.

314
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,650
An arm or a leg missing

315
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,610
doesn't matter.

316
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,010
As you wish, my dear!

317
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,940
You're strong enough,

318
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,980
but unfortunately...

319
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,620
this battle will be your last!

320
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,620
Senior,

321
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm here with you!

322
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,490
Senior,

323
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,010
sorry I'm late!

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,460
Hurry,

325
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,330
take this pill

326
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,140
and start healing.

327
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,140
This is high-grade stuff from Wangyu?

328
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,330
Yeah!

329
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,050
One pill costs 2000 gems!

330
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,330
Like swallowing money!

331
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,380
I sent Han Li and the others ahead.

332
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,140
I wonder how they're doing...

333
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,250
I just saw him.

334
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,250
Don't worry.

335
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,420
That kid

336
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,490
is not dying anytime soon.

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,530
What about the other disciples?

338
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,220
Did they all make it out of the valley?

339
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,810
Grandmaster likely got them out.

340
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,770
That guy

341
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,940
met with Grandmaster.

342
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,620
This was all part of their plan.

343
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,620
Even the Soul-Burning Spell on us

344
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,940
was part of it.

345
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,810
I see...

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,900
That's exactly his style.

347
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,730
Still, trading me alone

348
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,620
to save all of Yellow Maple Valley,

349
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,900
that's a deal worth making.

350
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,010
Senior,

351
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,770
doesn't this feel

352
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,050
just like when we first joined the sect?

353
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,010
We snuck into Clear Void Sect for spirit herbs,

354
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,420
and they sent a whole squad after us.

355
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,050
The whole place was chaos!

356
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,010
I still remember it clearly.

357
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,570
There were also Junior Lei

358
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,010
and Wangyu.

359
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,330
We even knocked over

360
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,490
a whole pot of pills

361
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,700
Fu Yunzi was refining.

362
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,460
Fu Yunzi cried over it

363
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,860
for days!

364
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,460
Like, hiding-under-the-blanket sobbing!

365
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,090
That old gambling addict!

366
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,530
This was from that fiend earlier.

367
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,090
I think Fu Yunzi would want you to keep it.

368
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,250
We messed around all our lives.

369
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,050
But I doubt I'll ever get the chance

370
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,570
to repay that favor.

371
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,250
The Mountain Barrier's down...

372
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,810
Yellow Maple Valley has fallen.

373
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,140
You both

374
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,810
aren't getting away either!

375
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,050
Senior,

376
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,290
do you think

377
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,420
we'll get out of this one

378
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,530
like we used to?

379
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,660
These punks

380
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,090
aren't even worth the effort!

381
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,570
Junior,

382
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,180
don't you dare steal my kills!

383
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,700
It's a shame the sect's gone.

384
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,380
As long as we live,

385
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,570
the sect lives on.

386
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,700
These bastards are noisy.

387
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,620
Let Li Huayuan here

388
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,050
clear the path for you.

389
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,810
Time to go home!

390
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,810
Congrats, Grandmaster.

391
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,620
You finally wiped out Yellow Maple Valley.

392
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,660
My Herbs Garden...

393
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,900
That hasn't been yours for a long time.

394
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,940
Everything below us now

395
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,940
is dead.

396
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,530
Besides, you've already joined our sect.

397
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,050
You should've let go

398
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,980
of these things long ago.

399
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,700
If all that's left is scorched earth,

400
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,980
what's the point of conquering it

401
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,770
for the Joyful Union Sect?

402
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,330
I've done as you asked

403
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,530
and gave them as much mercy as I could.

404
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,180
Wang Chan

405
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,530
will handle this place.

406
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,980
Grandmaster,

407
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,810
I won't disappoint you!

408
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,940
One more thing.

409
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,530
Did you catch that leftover

410
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,900
from the Seven Sects?

411
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,940
Grandmaster...

412
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,460
that brat's too lucky.

413
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,290
I didn't expect

414
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,620
he'd be rescued by a Core cultivator

415
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,900
from Yellow Maple Valley.

416
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,620
Even in a death trap like that,

417
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,570
he still got away.

418
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,570
Maybe his fate really hasn't run out yet.

419
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,220
Does that mean...

420
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,620
I'll have to deal with him myself?

421
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,290
Grandmaster,

422
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,250
please,

423
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,180
there's no need for that!

424
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,490
In cultivation,

425
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,460
you need something to sharpen yourself.

426
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,940
That boy

427
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,530
is still yours to face.

428
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,090
Rest assured, Grandmaster.

429
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,490
He won't get far.

430
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,290
I hope Han Li will make it out alive.

431
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,980
I hope you won't get yourself killed.

432
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,250
Looks like...

433
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,620
he's become your inner demon.

434
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,330
That'll seriously hinder your cultivation.

435
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,660
Father...

436
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,620
please don't kill him.

437
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,330
Let him fight Wang Chan.

438
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,010
Hubby...

439
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,860
Darling!

440
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,730
Our grandmaster's here.

441
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,250
You're dead now!

442
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,810
Grandmaster,

443
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,700
that's the one who saved the boy.

444
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,250
A Core cultivator from Yellow Maple Valley.

445
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,660
Master...

446
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,140
Mentor...

447
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,980
Come back with me.

448
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,330
Junior,

449
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,420
go on ahead.

450
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,620
At this point,

451
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,010
death's the only outcome.

452
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,860
Li Huayuan of Yellow Maple Valley

453
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,250
is here!

454
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,810
Let's see

455
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,940
what Yunlu has to teach me!

456
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,180
How foolish.

457
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,860
Yellow Maple Valley is finished.

458
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,620
But I'll honor my pact with Linghu.

459
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,330
Hongfu stays.

460
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,810
Everyone else must leave.

461
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,530
Not leaving!

462
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,530
You, a mighty Nascent Soul cultivator,

463
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,810
won't even duel me one-on-one?

464
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,220
Yunlu...

465
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,940
Junior!

466
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,860
Let's make a wager!

467
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,770
If I can force you

468
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,980
to make a move,

469
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,700
then I win!

470
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,940
And you'll have to

471
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,730
let my senior go!

472
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,460
Junior,

473
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,420
don't be stupid.

474
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,660
You're no match for him.

475
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,980
My turn.

476
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,250
Junior!

477
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,420
Worthy of a Nascent Soul cultivator...

478
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,980
After all these years,

479
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,160
you're still cold as ever

480
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,170
and won't change your mind?

481
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,700
After all these years,

482
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,330
you're still so arrogant.

483
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,860
As if the world

484
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,490
belongs to you alone.

485
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,730
She's right.

486
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,700
Dead right.

487
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,730
People like you

488
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,420
destroy homes and kill loved ones

489
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,770
all for your own gain,

490
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,660
then pretend you've done nothing wrong.

491
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,770
Shameless!

492
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,860
Mentor!

493
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,940
Stop fighting!

494
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,770
Mentor Li!

495
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:02,810
Please!

496
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,810
Please stop!

497
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,250
Master...

498
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,330
My mother will be okay.

499
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,490
You have to treat your wounds now,

500
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,250
before it's too late!

501
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,380
Xuan'er...

502
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,290
honestly...

503
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,010
you looked better in your old clothes.

504
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,330
Mentor...

505
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,940
back in the day,

506
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,380
there was this crusty old man.

507
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,330
On my very first day in the sect,

508
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,940
he taught me something.

509
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,860
He said, in this world,

510
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,620
the weak must bow their heads,

511
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,730
but only the strong

512
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,980
get to take what they want.

513
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,140
Whether it's status,

514
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,700
power,

515
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,980
strength,

516
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,860
or even someone else's life,

517
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,420
if they want it,

518
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,900
they take it.

519
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,420
That's the iron law of this world.

520
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,860
If you want to live long,

521
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,250
you'd better understand that.

522
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,220
But if that's all this world is,

523
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,660
what's the point?

524
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,940
He's shattering his own core

525
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,090
to forcibly boost his power.

526
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,020
Is he insane?

527
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,170
For Yellow Maple Valley,

528
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,530
take one more strike from me!

529
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,820
You old bastard!

530
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,740
Yunlu!

531
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,530
I finally forced you to fight back!

532
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,860
I win!

533
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,940
Junior!

534
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,650
Senior...

535
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,490
we won.

536
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,900
We can finally go home.

537
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,650
Junior...

538
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,260
My name's Hongfu.

539
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,010
From now on,

540
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,380
you better call me Senior.

541
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,260
