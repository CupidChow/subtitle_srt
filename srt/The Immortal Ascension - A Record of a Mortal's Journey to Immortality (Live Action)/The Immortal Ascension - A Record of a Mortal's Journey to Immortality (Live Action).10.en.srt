00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,100
and give this letter

191
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,300
to their sect leader.

192
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,850
As long as they give their all

193
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,730

194
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,820
the Yan Clan Stronghold's quarry

195
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,250

196
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,010
My Lord,

197
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,300
you mustn't do this!

198
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,530
The quarry's profits are the lifeblood of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

199
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,770
How can we hand it over just like that?

200
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,130
She is my only daughter.

201
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,530
I would give my life to save her.

202
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,100
What is a gem business compared to that?

203
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,220

204
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,580
Core Formation cultivators.

205
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,650
But all of them are Early Core Stage.

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,220
And yet a Mid Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator

207
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,060
can command them.

208
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,940
It's just a trip to the Bloody Trial Ground.

209
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,100

Wang Chan, the Young Master

213

you're after something important.

221
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,850
Since the Seven Sects

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,610
are unwilling to help,

223
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,460

224

225
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,460
yet they monopolize the Bloody Trial Ground.

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,220
Asking them for help is harder

227
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,940
than climbing to the heavens.

228
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,060
You are the Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

229
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,220
Isn't this

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,650
far too humiliating

233
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,890
I can arrange for someone

234
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,060
to enter the Bloody Trial Ground

235
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,610

241
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,730
were one and the same?

242

You should go back.

243

245
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,060
are truly your friends.

Her name

256
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,370
is Yan Ruyan.

257
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,300
She was born

something that only appears once in centuries.

260

A heavenly spirit root?

261
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,130
That explains

262
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,220
why the Yan Clan Stronghold will stop at nothing

263
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,100

264
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,460
However,

her old illness

266
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,420
has returned,

267
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,460
and she teeters on the brink of death.

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,060
The only thing that can save her

269
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,490
is the Blood Spirit Flower, which only grows inside the Trial Ground.

270
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,770
That explains things.

271
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,890
I see.

272
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,490
So if we control

273
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,940
the Blood Spirit Flower,

274
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,890
we can control the Yan Clan Stronghold.

we gain the upper hand in the coming war.

277
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,580

entirely on luck.

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,010
Qiaoqian,

379
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,250
time is tight.

380
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,180
We should get going.

381
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:47,980
Let's go.

382
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,770
I can't let them find out

383
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,490
the secret of the Green Vial.

384
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,860
I should act alone from here on.

385
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,090
Senior Xiang.

386
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,570
Let the hunt begin!

387
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,250
The spiritual aura has indeed become thinner.

388
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,860
Grandmaster.

389
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,940
The Spirit Fusion Talisman actually worked.

390
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,570
This talisman links the spiritual aura of its users.

391
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,330
Even though the teleportation is random,

392
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,570
there's at least a 50% chance

393
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,050
we would land near each other.

394
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,220
We landed here of all places.

395
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,090
The odds are in our favor.

396
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,660
I was right.

397
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,620
The closer you get to the outer edge of the Trial Ground,

398
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,250
the younger the spirit herbs.

399
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,940
This means

400
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,730
fewer rivals for me.

401
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,330
I'll gather some seedlings and seeds,

402
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,620
then rely on the Green Vial

403
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,570
to hasten their maturation.

404
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,490
Pardon me.

405
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,570
The Gilded Five-Petal Flame.

406
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,570
Someone's already dead.

407
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,700
I'll have to be careful

408
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,330
not to end up like him.

409
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,730
The northeast edge of Wulong Pool

410
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,090
lies in a secluded corner,

411
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,420
its terrain shaped around a deep pool plunging dozens of feet down.

412
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,570
According to the map,

413
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,330
the Violet Monkey Blossom

414
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,900
should grow somewhere near here.

415
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,380
The miasma is dense here.

416
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,140
[Miasma Purifying Veil]

417
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,330
Coldwisp Herbs.

418
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,620
They're valuable ingredients for concocting poisons.

419
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,090
Who's there?

420
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,380
Show yourself.

421
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,380
You've already been exposed.

422
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,490
Did my Stealth Talisman fail?

423
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,660
Come out!

424
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,290
I saw you lot!

425
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,050
What a bluff.

426
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,330
My precious.

427
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,290
Frost Toads.

428
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,620
Senior Yu,

429
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,620
your Beast Taming Powder is incredible.

430
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,090
Just a small bottle

431
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,620
and the Frost Toads became completely obedient.

432
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,010
Another elite of the Seven Sects taken down.

433
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,490
These little creatures

434
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,530
have certainly earned their keep.

435
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,860
Frost Toads are docile by nature.

436
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,940
They almost never attack

437
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,050
unless provoked.

438
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,490
Qi,

439
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,140
collect the Coldwisp Herbs.

440
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,460
There's no need

441
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,660
to risk my life for some herbs.

442
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,290
I'll let them have it.

443
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,180
My goodness.

444
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,570
I didn't expect

445
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,290
to find you guys here.

446
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,530
Keep your guard up.

447
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,140
There could be an ambush.

448
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,290
He was cautious,

449
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,460
yet he still lost his life so easily.

450
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,250
Those two

451
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,900
came here to kill.

452
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,420
What exactly are they after?

453
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,810
Why won't they leave?

454
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,460
Forget it.

455
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,490
If they won't go...

456
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,140
- The Coldwisp Herbs - ...I will.

457
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,860
may be highly poisonous,

458
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,860
but they're surprisingly beautiful.

459
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,810
Indeed.

460
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,940
Let's take his mystic pouch too.

461
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,770
All right.

462
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,940
Strange.

463
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,380
It was just here.

464
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,730
Is there

465
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,900
someone else lurking nearby?

466
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,620
I didn't find any spirit herbs,

467
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,660
but I did get several mystic pouches.

468
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,420
Now where should I go?

469
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,810
I don't see any Violet Monkey Blossoms here.

470
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,810
Seems the map the sect provided

471
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,330
isn't entirely reliable.

472
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,730
Senior Xiang,

473
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,050
the path is slippery. Go slow.

474
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,010
I've simply been here more times

475
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,180
and know the way.

476
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,420
I'll be counting on you

477
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,730
talented young cultivators

478
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,090
if we encounter spirit beasts.

479
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,290
Leave it to us.

480
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,660
This Trial Ground is practically a death labyrinth.

481
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,380
Knowing the lay of the land is half the battle.

482
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,940
You're the old steed who knows the way.

483
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,810
With the three of us united,

484
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,770
success is all

485
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,330
but guaranteed.

486
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,980
Why is he traveling

487
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,220
with disciples from another sect?

488
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,250
Han,

489
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,900
I didn't expect

490
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,050
to run into you here.

491
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,810
Han.

492
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,770
What do you say?

493
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,570
Care to join us?

494
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,420
We can look out for one another.

495
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,220
You may not

496
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,380
know this,

497
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,770
but each sect's map

498
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,940
for the Bloody Trial Ground

499
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,420
marks different priorities.

500
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,460
That's why

501
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,490
sharing information

502
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,940
and cooperating

503
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,730
with other sects

504
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,570
is

505
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,180
the smart move.

506
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,420
Thank you for your kind offer.

507
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,460
But I'm weak

508
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,090
and this is my first time in the Trial Ground.

509
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,900
I only plan to gather some spirit herbs to complete my task.

510
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,620
I wouldn't want to burden the three of you.

511
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,570
No worries.

512
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,140
No worries.

513
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,570
Still,

514
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,940
you didn't have to be so hasty to refuse us.

515
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,730
Or

516
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,900
are you perhaps

517
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,860
after

518
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,700
something important?

519
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,090
If this guy doesn't know what's good

520
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,380
for him,

521
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,860
you shouldn't waste your breath on him.

522
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,570
That's right, Xiang.

523
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,380
Let him fend for himself.

524
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,250
I shall leave now.

525
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,250
Please excuse me.

526
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,090
Farewell.

527
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,980
No choice.

528
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,420
I'll head in another direction.

529
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,010
It's as if Senior Xiang has turned into a completely different person

530
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,090
once we entered the Trial Ground.

531
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,140
Hey, gambling addict.

532
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,290
I'm talking to you!

533
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,980
Why didn't you answer?

534
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,820
What do you want?

535
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,090
How about

536
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,300
we place a bet?

537
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,860
What bet?

538
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,420
No bets.

539
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,260
This trial will shape

540
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,860
the future of the Seven Great Sects

541
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,010
for the next 60,

542
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,530
maybe even 100 years,

543
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,210
no?

544
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,690
I'm right, aren't I?

545
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,530
So,

546
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,460
let's bet

547
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,050
on which sect gathers the most spirit herbs.

548
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,530
Whoever collects the most wins.

549
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,050
How about that?

550
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,010
All right.

551
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,340
But your rules aren't foolproof.

552
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,860
What if it's a tie?

553
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,010
Then what?

554
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,010
Good point.

555
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,980
Let me think...

556
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,420
How about this?

557
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,380
We bet

558
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,690
on whether the number of disciples

559
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,130
who make it out alive is odd or even.

560
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,210
Shoo.

561
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,780
Leave me alone.

562
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,650
Han, you in?

563
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,300
I'm not betting with you.

564
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,570
He's no fun.

565
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,050
Sheesh.

566
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,610
Come on.

567
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,090
Here's my offer.

568
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,170
I'll wager

569
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,050
two

570
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,380
Bloodvein Drake Core Pills

571
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,380
against your two pieces of iron concentrate.

572
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,050
That's a fair deal, right?

573
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,900
Bloodvein Drake Core Pills?

574
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,210
What do you say?

575
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,170
Fine.

576
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:01,940
Two pieces it is.

577
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,650
We're only betting on spirit herbs, nothing else.

578
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,340
Whoever gathers the most wins.

579
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,380
Go back.

580
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,980
The bet's on.

581
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,170
That guy's dead.

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,050
That guy's dead too.

583
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,050
It's only day one,

584
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,130
yet their murderous intent has already been unleashed.

585
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,380
Invisible

586
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,690
and razor-sharp.

587
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,300
A perfect weapon for ambushes indeed.

588
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,380
Who goes there?

589
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,900
It's that young man from Tainan Bazaar.

590
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,420
Should we capture him and interrogate him?

591
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,940
I had to suppress my cultivation to the Qi Refining Stage

592
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,210
just to enter the Trial Ground.

593
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,460
I'm already in a troublesome position.

594
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,780
Let's focus on the mission.

595
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,170
We don't want to invite more trouble.

596
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,980
We should regroup

597
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,380
with our other disciples first.

598
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,570
Give these disciples a proper burial.

599
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,780
- Yes, Grandmaster. - Yes.

600
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,050
This should be

601
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,340
a safe spot.

602
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,530
The first day is already over,

603
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,860
but I still haven't found what I came here for.

604
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,340
To all disciples of the Seven Sects,

605
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,570
congratulations on surviving the first daylight cycle.

606
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,210
Remember, the night in the Bloody Trial Ground

607
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,860
is far deadlier than the day.

608
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,050
Death may come from the skies above.

609
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,780
It'd be wise

610
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,900
to find a safe place to hide.

611
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,300
Senior Xiang

612
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,380
knows this Trial Ground well,

613
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,820
yet he still hasn't reached the Foundation Stage after three attempts.

614
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,940
I can't share his fate.

615
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,460
I never want

616
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,260
to set foot in this place again.

617
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,210
This rain chills me to the bone.

618
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,490
There's something cursed about it.

619
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,050
I have to circulate my energy to dispel the cold.

620
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,210
It's only the first day

621
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,490
and already so many have fallen.

622
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,490
Seems this year's competition is fiercer

623
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,780
than we anticipated.

624
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,740
[Day Two, Bloody Trial Ground]

625
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,980
The Soul-Burning Spell is reacting.

626
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,340
Don't kill me!

627
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,690
Don't kill me!

628
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,490
Senior, save me!

629
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,690
This is quite a predicament.

630
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,050
Senior!

631
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,530
