[The Immortal Ascension]

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
[Adapted from the webnovel, The Immortal Ascension by Wangyu]

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,980
[serialized in www.qidian.com under China Literature Limited]

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,940
[Episode 12]

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,570
Wangyu was speaking the truth.

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,250
She's not as ordinary as I thought.

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,220
Show yourself.

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,050
That sickening beast is dead.

29
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,770
I'll tame you and make you our sect gatekeeper.

30
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,210
Since I've captured its primordial spirit,

31
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,100
you may have its body.

32
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,020
This Level 2 Demon Beast is literally a treasure trove.

33
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,820
Its hide is already impenetrable.

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,380
I just don't know

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,180
if you can break through its carapace.

36
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,410
You're just a young cultivator at the Qi Refining Stage.

37
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,660
But you have quite a lot of artifacts, huh?

38
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,330
Will you kill me and steal them from me?

39
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,100
To you, they might be treasures.

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,690
But to me,

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,020
those are just junk.

42
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,130
You're too reckless.

43
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,900
The horns and claws of Blackflood Drake

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,740
are excellent materials that can be used to make top-quality artifacts.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,290
You'll let them go to waste if you hack it as such.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,020
Stand back.

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,770
Step aside.

48
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,660
When harvesting a Demon Beast,

49
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,060
you have to extract its inner core first.

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,980
It's been too long since I've done this.

51
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,850
I'm not as sharp as I used to be.

52
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,060
But I can't afford to embarrass myself here.

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,260
What is that?

54
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,780
The core of a drake should be hard and tough.

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,820
But this is...

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,500
Consider yourself lucky.

57
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,220
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

58
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,220
Disciples,

59
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,580
evacuate immediately.

60
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,850
It's finally ending.

61
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,370
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

62
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,410
Disciples,

63
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,900
evacuate immediately.

64
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,220
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

65
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,220
Disciples,

66
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,540
evacuate immediately.

67
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,700
What's happening to me?

68
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,370
They're closing the portal to Trial Ground.

69
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,370
Why have I slept for this long?

70
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,540
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

71
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,490
Disciples,

72
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,900
evacuate immediately.

73
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,730
This won't do.

74
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,980
I have to leave immediately.

75
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:12,900
Wake up.

76
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,730
How long are you going to stay asleep?

77
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,930
It'll be too late if we don't leave now.

78
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,850
I...

79
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,290
Have I

80
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,900
slept for a long time?

81
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,050
That's not the point here.

82
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,930
The point is

83
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,250
that they're closing the portal.

84
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,140
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

85
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,100
Disciples,

86
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,460
- evacuate immediately. - Is this already the fifth day?

87
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,980
Are they closing the portal now?

88
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,890
What should I do with this boy?

89
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,770
Should I silence him right now

90
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,850
so that he won't spout nonsense outside?

91
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,460
Aren't you going to leave?

92
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,250
That was the Blackflood Drake's lust sack.

93
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,420
I didn't expect it to be a male drake, which was quite rare.

94
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,850
Contact by any female

95
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,820
will cause it to release

96
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,300
an aphrodisiac poison mist.

97
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,130
You should know well the kind of person I am.

98
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,820
What happened between us

99
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,420
was merely a misunderstanding.

100
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,850
Just treat it as a dream.

101
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,580
I understand.

102
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,650
If you dare to tell anyone what happened today...

103
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,770
Nobody else will know.

104
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,370
I'll take the chest with me.

105
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,370
I suppose you have no objections.

106
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,850
Not at all.

107
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,460
What about the spirit herbs?

108
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,460
I'll take the Blood Spirit Flower.

109
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,370
You can have the rest of it.

110
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,250
The Celestial Essence Fruit

111
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,700
is finally mine.

112
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,220
You'd better stop now.

113
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,300
We're running out of time.

114
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,890
This path is blocked off.

115
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,770
Do you have any solutions?

116
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,250
I do.

117
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,180
But thanks to you,

118
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,340
my power is entirely depleted.

119
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,530
Therefore,

120
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,580
you have to open a path.

121
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,770
Your power is entirely depleted?

122
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,370
How is that possible?

123
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,770
How dare you ask me that?

124
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,340
It doesn't look that way to me.

125
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,700
Hurry!

126
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,300
If we don't make it out,

127
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,700
we'll be trapped here for 60 years!

128
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,100
- Hurry! - Run for your life!

129
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,220
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

130
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,220
Disciples,

131
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,610
evacuate immediately.

132
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,610
Grandmaster!

133
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,580
Slow down! Don't panic!

134
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,300
Grandmaster!

135
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,420
Hurry!

136
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,130
Hurry!

137
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,530
Where are the rest of you?

138
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,420
Hurry!

139
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,460
My Golden Brick Talisman

140
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,820
actually broke just after two uses.

141
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,340
Which is more important? The talisman or your life?

142
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,650
Both are equally as important.

143
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,820
What a moneygrubber.

144
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,300
I'm Han Li.

145
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,060
What's your name?

146
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,820
You'll be trapped here for the next 60 years

147
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,300
if you don't make it out by nightfall.

148
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,980
May I know your name?

149
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,650
I'm Han Li.

150
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,530
"Li", as in erecting a tombstone.

151
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,530
I was just asking.

152
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,940
It's fine if you don't want to answer me.

153
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,610
I'm Nangong Wan.

154
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,530
I'm Han Li.

155
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,100
I don't care what your name is.

156
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,340
We'll be complete strangers once we leave this place.

157
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,700
Nangong Wan,

158
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,980
if, one day,

159
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,980
you're in any danger,

160
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,130
I'll surely come to your aid.

161
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,060
You should tend to yourself first.

162
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,220
Do not find me again.

163
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,490
Time is almost up!

164
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,460
The portal will be closed soon!

165
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,010
I don't think anyone else is coming out.

166
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,490
It's not nightfall yet.

167
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,850
Let's wait a little longer.

168
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,370
I'm sure anyone who's still alive

169
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,980
has exited the portal long ago.

170
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,180
Fellow peers,

171
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,100
I and the Moonshadow Sect shall make a move first.

172
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,100
Han Li?

173
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,490
That was a tough trip.

174
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,530
Is this how you lead your team?

175
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,460
Are these all of the members you have left?

176
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,850
Let's go!

177
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,490
Seems like

178
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,610
this trial was perilous indeed.

179
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,610
So many disciples have ended up as casualties.

180
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,820
Nangong Wan.

181
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,770
Has she already left?

182
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,700
Did you get anything out of it?

183
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,580
I shouldn't show them too much.

184
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,460
If not, they'll suspect me.

185
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,850
Is that the Celestial Essence Fruit?

186
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,180
Old gambling addict,

187
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,490
I accept my loss.

188
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,660
Take these!

189
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,570
Let's return now.

190
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,490
Let's go.

191
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,900
How did you manage

192
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,570
to obtain these spirit herbs?

193
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,140
Grandmaster,

194
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,900
I followed your advice

195
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,940
upon entering the portal.

196
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,460
I avoided conflicts

197
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,010
and focused on finding spirit herbs.

198
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,090
In the end,

199
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,220
by a stroke of luck,

200
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,340
I encountered several peers

201
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,860
from other sects who fought fierce battles.

202
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,380
I picked up

203
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,770
the spirit herbs they left behind.

204
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,250
So, you picked them up on the way, huh?

205
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,940
You're quite lucky.

206
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,010
Come here.

207
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,730
From today onward,

208
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,660
you shall serve me

209
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,220
as one of my disciples.

210
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,290
Thank you, Grandmaster.

211
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,380
Why are you still calling me that?

212
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,860
You should address me as Master.

213
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,620
Yes, Master.

214
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,530
Greetings, Master.

215
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,050
I'm Han Li.

216
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,490
Your name is Han Li, huh?

217
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,460
Get up here.

218
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,660
Han Li,

219
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,330
come to my side.

220
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,420
So many people had died

221
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,140
during this trial.

222
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,420
On the path of cultivation,

223
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,980
one wrong move

224
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,290
leads to utter ruin.

225
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,730
He didn't get ahead of himself.

226
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,860
And, he's grieving over the loss of his peers.

227
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,980
He seems like a good-natured boy.

228
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,460
This is the path of cultivation.

229
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,490
There are many different sights along the way.

230
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,050
Since you managed to survive,

231
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,490
you should be more open-minded.

232
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,010
That is what it means

233
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,180
to achieve true peace.

234
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,010
You can have this

235
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,940
Qingyuan Sword Manual

236
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,220
as our meeting gift.

237
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,140
But you can only practice it during the Qi Refining Stage.

238
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,530
Do not practice it excessively.

239
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,220
I'll select another art for you

240
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,490
once you reach the Foundation Establishment Stage in the future.

241
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,140
Thank you, Master.

242
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,860
Master.

243
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,330
I have something

244
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,900
to report to you.

245
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,050
You may speak.

246
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,770
When I was at Bloody Trial Ground,

247
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,460
I encountered several sect members of Spirit Beast Mountain.

248
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,140
They were behaving sneakily.

249
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,490
It didn't feel like

250
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,660
they were official sect members.

251
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,380
Tell me the details.

252
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,220
Most of the techniques they used

253
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,290
were related

254
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,530
to the arts of toxic and demonic cultivation.

255
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,010
They were ruthless.

256
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,250
They didn't try to steal spirit herbs.

257
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,140
They merely killed.

258
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,900
They didn't even spare their fellow sect members.

259
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,380
Could they be the troublemakers?

260
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,860
Han Li.

261
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,250
You reported your findings to me.

262
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,860
That deserves praise.

263
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,050
However, this is a huge deal.

264
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,180
Do not let anyone know about this.

265
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,250
Yes, Master.

266
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,140
Could the major casualties

267
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,420
be related to this incident?

268
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,940
You've been behaving strangely upon returning from Bloody Trial Ground.

269
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,730
It's either you're in a daze

270
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,570
or you vent your frustrations on the chest.

271
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,490
That's not true.

272
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,860
You're still denying it?

273
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,460
I spent so much effort just to procure this chest.

274
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,460
But now, I can't unlock it.

275
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,810
How could I not be frustrated?

276
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,050
I told you not to suppress your powers before heading inside.

277
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,250
You didn't heed my advice.

278
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,140
Now, things have taken an unexpected turn.

279
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,140
Has the Blood Spirit Flower

280
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,730
been delivered to Yan Clan Stronghold?

281
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,220
Did you forget?

282
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,570
The first thing you did upon exiting Trial Ground

283
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,900
was to instruct Qing to head to Yan Clan Stronghold.

284
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,290
Judging by the time,

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,180
she should arrive soon.

286
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,660
Wan.

287
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,700
Be honest with me.

288
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,700
What exactly happened at Trial Ground?

289
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,420
It feels like you've changed.

290
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,220
Why have you lost all of your powers?

291
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,010
Even the Maiden Cycle Technique

292
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,250
doesn't have such an effect on its practitioner.

293
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,010
It's the fault of the Blackflood Drake.

294
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,420
And, someone even cut off my escape route

295
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,050
when I engaged it in combat.

296
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,700
If not, I would've never ended up in such a pathetic state.

297
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,900
If so, how did you manage to escape by yourself?

298
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,940
Nichang.

299
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,490
I suspect

300
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,140
that some evil forces managed to sneak in

301
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,010
during the trip to Trial Ground.

302
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,900
If not, there wouldn't be

303
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,860
that many casualties.

304
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,290
Are you referring

305
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,770
to the demonic sects?

306
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,460
And,

307
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,490
they entered the Trial Ground

308
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,460
right under our noses.

309
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,420
I'm afraid they've infiltrated the Seven Sects long ago.

310
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,810
Maybe

311
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,940
Moonshadow Sect

312
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,380
was jeopardized as well.

313
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,730
Members of the demonic sects aren't that rare.

314
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,180
Just let them be.

315
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,940
Nothing major will go wrong for now

316
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,940
as long as we're holding the fort in our sect.

317
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,730
But those disciples...

318
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,460
Look at the state you're in.
(Watch on wwww.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

319
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,290
Even if the demonic sects were to invade us now,

320
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,140
do you think you can deal with them?

321
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,050
Right now, your priority

322
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,980
is to restore your powers as soon as possible.

323
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,570
Although it's a shame that many of our sect members

324
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,490
failed to make it out alive,

325
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,290
the world is unpredictable after all.

326
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,660
We can only pin our hopes on those who survived.

327
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,940
May they progress more smoothly

328
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,530
on the path of cultivation.

329
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,700
I am Zhong Wu.

330
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,290
I am Zhong Shu.

331
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,730
We're here to congratulate you, Young Master.

332
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,900
Speak.

333
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,330
Young Master,

334
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,940
I think I've somewhat accomplished the task

335
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,180
that you've assigned to me.

336
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,730
The cultivators of the Seven Sects...

337
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,380
No, I mean,

338
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,090
the fools of the Seven Sects.

339
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,290
Around 70% of them were killed.

340
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,180
They were Qi Refining Stage experts.

341
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,900
Their foundation has definitely been damaged.

342
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,180
So, for the remaining 30%,

343
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,220
do you expect me to deal with them for you?

344
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,290
Young Master, please be appeased.

345
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,570
The final battle is nearing. Forget about 30%.

346
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,420
I'll deal with them for you even if there are 3,000% of them left...

347
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,140
Shut up.

348
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,570
I...

349
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,530
Young Master, please be appeased.

350
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,980
Have you accomplished the task I assigned you?

351
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,940
He means the herb.

352
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,250
I have.

353
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,420
You passed.

354
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,570
Seems like you're not entirely useless.

355
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,180
At least you're somewhat useful.

356
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,940
Young Master, thank you for the praise!

357
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,460
Hurry and return to Spirit Beast Mountain.

358
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,810
Go and instigate the fools of Seven Sects.

359
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,290
Persuade them to join Ghost Spirit Sect.

360
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,050
It's best if they're at the Foundation Establishment Stage.

361
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,770
Roger that!

362
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,860
Stop shouting!

363
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,050
You have to be discreet.

364
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,980
Just wait and see.

365
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,570
What a talent.

366
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,560
Young Master, you have excellent taste!

367
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,290
The two sect members who returned from Bloody Trial Ground

368
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,070
had been kneeling there for one night.

369
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
You should see them.

370
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,180
How dare they come back

371
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,730
without the Blood Spirit Flower?

372
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,810
Elder Liu.

373
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,330
Is there still no news from the Seven Sects?

374
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,810
The trip to Bloody Trial Ground ended a few days ago.

375
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,900
Logically speaking,

376
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,620
the Blood Spirit Flower

377
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,700
should've arrived at its destination by now.

378
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,180
Are you the contact of Yan Clan Stronghold?

379
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,530
I'm here to see Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold

380
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,810
under the order of the Moonshadow Sect's sect leader.

381
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,420
Young Master.

382
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,620
This is the Blood Spirit Flower.

383
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,490
Elders, I appreciate the effort.

384
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,050
I suppose they managed to harvest it as well.

385
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,140
Who's daring enough to cause trouble in our territory?

386
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,090
The Blood Spirit Flower?

387
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,770
Elder Liu, don't be scared.

388
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,660
I just wish to be your friend.

389
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,180
My Lord.

390
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,250
My Lord,

391
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,460
do you still remember the guy from Ghost Spirit Sect?

392
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,330
He has found us again.

393
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,050
This time, he said

394
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,330
he's able to save Young Lady.

395
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,490
Are you willing to see him?

396
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,570
Please.

397
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,460
You dare to come here alone even though

398
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,980
you're merely at the Mid Foundation Establishment Stage.

399
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,940
You're pretty bold, aren't you?

400
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,490
To express my sincerity,

401
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,860
I've prepared

402
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,570
a humble gift.

403
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,090
It's meant for Young Lady.

404
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,050
Forget about the gift.

405
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,330
Right now, what she requires the most

406
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,380
is a herb.

407
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,090
I have the Blood Spirit Flower as well.

408
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,570
But it can't cure the root of the problem.

409
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,900
And, one's foundation will be damaged upon consumption.

410
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,050
I'm afraid

411
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,530
she'll never be able to reach the Core Formation Stage for the rest of her life.

412
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,810
Lord Yan,

413
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,660
can you bear for that to happen?

414
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,220
What do you mean?

415
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,330
Don't tell me you have other solutions.

416
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,220
Naturally.

417
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,460
The Ghost Spirit Sect practices a unique art.

418
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,050
It's much more effective than the Blood Spirit Flower.

419
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,330
Not only can it help your daughter to regain consciousness,

420
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,730
but it can also

421
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,050
cure her of her chronic ailment permanently.

422
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,940
Young boy,

423
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,940
no matter how flustered I am,

424
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,570
I won't resort to such dubious methods.

425
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,980
Young Lady's condition won't get any worse.

426
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,420
Lord Yan, you should let me give it a go.

427
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,530
If it doesn't work,

428
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,220
you can use the Blood Spirit Flower

429
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,730
to treat her by then.

430
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,860
Speak.

431
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,330
What conditions do you have?

432
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,330
I want the Yan Clan Stronghold

433
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,810
to be my ally.

434
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,810
I finally returned alive

435
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,950
from Bloody Trial Ground.

436
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,980
Han.

437
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,700
What are you doing here?

438
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,660
I'm here to check on you.

439
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,090
I heard

440
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,380
that many people had died at Bloody Trial Ground.

441
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,810
Indeed.

442
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,140
Aren't we practicing cultivation to attain immortality?

443
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,530
What's the point of us losing our lives

444
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,570
just to obtain the Foundation Pill?

445
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,220
There are many magnificent sights in the world.

446
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,140
Go and check them out

447
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,010
on my behalf.

448
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,320
I suppose this is the path of cultivation.

449
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,980
On this path,

450
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,140
one will witness all kinds of sights.

451
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,450
When you put it that way,

452
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,770
I think it makes sense.

453
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,010
However,

454
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,050
you actually came back in one piece.

455
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,490
That's great.

456
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,900
I was merely lucky.

457
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,490
Physician Mo.

458
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,490

Now, he'll address us as seniors.

Our ranks have been lowered.

465
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,050
I would rather let him address me as Senior.

466
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,700

467
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,380

I heard that your trip to Blood Trial Ground was a harrowing one.

487
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,460
You should rest and recuperate.

If this keeps up, it'll take ages before I can form a new core.

I'm Han Li.

505
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,570
What's your name?

506
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,490
May I know your name?

507
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,460
I'm Han Li.

508
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,340
"Li", as in erecting a tombstone.

509
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,130
This is so annoying.

510
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,210
Once I'm done with my retreat,

511
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,650
the first thing I'll do is to kill you.

512
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,420
I'll erect a tombstone for you after that.

513
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,900
If having one Foundation Pill isn't secure enough,

514
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,570
I'll create 10 of them.

515
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,050
Maybe even 20 of them.

516
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,380
I must reach Tier 13 as soon as possible

517
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,340
while waiting for the spirit herbs to ripen.

518
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,820
I haven't even landed yet.

519
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,610
Why is there already a banquet?

520
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,980
I suppose your aunt

521
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,210
prepared

522
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,780
the welcoming banquet for you.

523
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,460
As if.

524
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,490
She doesn't care about me that much.

525
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,610
Indeed.

526
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,440
[Hongfen, Ghost Spirit Sect, Skull, Ghost Spirit Sect]

527
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,530

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,530
You really know how to show up at the right time.

529
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,860
Great timing.

530
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,260
The banquet just started.

531
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,860
Who are we holding this celebration for?

532
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,210
Of course it's for me and your uncle-in-law.

533
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,610
We won our first battle in the Jiang Kingdom.

534
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,050
Once we take down Jiang Kingdom,

535
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,130
Cheqi Kingdom will be next.

536
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,740
After that, the Yue Kingdom.

537
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,740
Aunt Hongfen,

538
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,690
the Yue Kingdom is mine.

539
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,530
"The Yue Kingdom is mine."

540
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,090
You just managed to kill some of

541
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,460
the righteous sects' Qi Refining Stage sect members at Bloody Trial Ground.

542
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,130
Look at how smug you are.

543
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,490
You command 50,000 elite troops.

544
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,210
You begged and scraped and nearly killed yourself

545
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,130
just to win this one battle.

546
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,420
And now, you're actually holding a celebration?

547
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,820
When it comes to being thick-skinned,

548
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,420
Aunt Hongfen, I'm indeed no match for you.

549
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,010
Hongfen!

550
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,980
Don't be angry.

551
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,490
Your nephew

552
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,570
doesn't harbor any ill intentions.

553
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,130
Indeed.

554
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,900
By the way,

555
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,980
I heard

556
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,820
that you've been visiting the Yan Clan Stronghold quite frequently.

557
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,780
No wonder you're so bent on getting the Yue Kingdom.

558
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,090
Don't tell me

559
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,650
you fell for the clan leader's daughter.

560
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,460
And that you want to marry into their clan

561
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,690
and become a live-in son-in-law.

562
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,010
How did she find out about what I did at the Yan Clan Stronghold?

563
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,530
Young Master, please calm down.

564
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,900
Your aunt has spies

565
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,980
all across the Tiannan Continent.

566
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,610
She would've found out eventually

567
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,090
even if we kept the news from her.

568
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,300
Indeed.

569
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,530
Fine.

570
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,610
I understand.

571
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,950
But you see,

572
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,620
I have a mouth too.

573
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,740
Can you let me break the news personally in the future?

574
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,300
Just remember to keep your mouth shut.

575
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,130
Yes, Young Master.

576
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,420
Indeed.

577
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,570
And, can you two learn

578
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,050
how to speak formally, even just a little?

579
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,850
When I bring you two to the Yan Clan Stronghold,

580
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,480
you speak with

581
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,370
a weird dialect

582
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,880
while yours is even weirder.

583
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,570
You must be kidding me.

584
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,570
The Violet Monkey Blossom

585
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,300
is finally ripe.

586
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,650
I have enough herbs for the formula.

587
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,380
I have the formula for the Foundation Pill too.

588
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,820
With these,

589
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,260
I have enough to create over 10 Foundation Pills.

590
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,780
I've finally reached

591
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,130
Tier 13.

592
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,900
Now, I just need to reach the Foundation Establishment Stage.
