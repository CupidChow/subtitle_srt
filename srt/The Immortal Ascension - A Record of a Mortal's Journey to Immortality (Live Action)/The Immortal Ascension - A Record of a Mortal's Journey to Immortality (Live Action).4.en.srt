00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,930
Madam Wang.

193
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,660
[Madam Wang]

194
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,340
I am Han Li.

195
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,780
Greetings, Madams.

196
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,490
Han Li?

197
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,610
My eldest sister, Yuzhu.

198
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,780
I am Fengwu.

199
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,250
My younger sister, Caihuan.

200
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,370
Greetings, ladies.

201
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,930
So, she isn't a servant.

202
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,460
Young man.

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,850
Did that old fool say when he'll be back?

204
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,780
Madam Liu,

205
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,410
whatever Master wanted to say

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,730
was written in the letter.

207
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,250
Letter?

208
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,810
Where's the letter?

209
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,900
My wife and daughter, may this letter stand in for my presence

210
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,980
I'm entangled in pressing matters

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,660
and still can't return home anytime soon.

212
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,460
The one delivering this letter

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,140
is my final disciple,

214
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,220
Han Li.

215
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,370
He possesses unique skills

216
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,660
and can be trusted.

217
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,410
If anything happens at the Mo Residence,

218
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,730
feel free to let him handle it.

219
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,410
If he can keep the Mo family safe,

220
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,900
then he may choose

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,980
to marry one from Yuzhu, Fengwu,

222
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,490
or Caihuan.

223
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,100
As for her dowry,

224
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,340
use the Sunwarm Jade.

225
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,610
Why are they looking

226
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,460
so guarded?

227
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,250
It doesn't make sense.

228
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,810
I've read this letter hundreds of times.

229
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,340
There's nothing suspicious in it.

230
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,100
Master cares deeply

231
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,140
for the family.

232
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,020
He wants me

233
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,100
to ease the burdens

234
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,410
on the Mo family.

235
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,410
If you ladies have anything urgent

236
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,580
that needs dealing with,

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,020
just let me know.

238
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,050
I shall

239
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,290
give it my all.

240
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,530
It's getting late today.

241
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,340
Young Master Han, why don't you

242
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,890
stay here at the residence tonight?

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,180
As for everything else,

244
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,220
we can

245
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,610
talk about it tomorrow.

246
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,300
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

247
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,490
- But... - Yuzhu,

248
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,370
Fengwu, Caihuan,

249
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,010
quickly.

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,700
Show Young Master Han to the west wing to rest.

251
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,890
Please.

252
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,490
They're in such a rush to send me off.

253
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,180
Something is up.

254
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,420
You all remember

255
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,530
what the Master told us before leaving.

256
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,370
If valuables are sent here,

257
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,940
all is well.

258
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,340
But if it's a letter,

259
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,890
it's most likely

260
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,610
bad news.

261
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,650
Madam Yan,

262
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,890
let's read the letter.

263
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,060
Very well.

264
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,130
The secret letter

265
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,420
will show its content.

266
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,460
Secret letter?

267
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,890
That old fool

268
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,490
had a backup plan in place.

269
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,820
I told you to stop fooling around.

270
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,010
Our mothers seem to like him.

271
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,770
Nanny Wu,

272
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,220
bring some water.

273
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,980
Why water?

274
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,770
It's all silent now.

275
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,300
Li,

276
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,060
be honest.

277
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,130
First impression of Yuzhu?

278
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,820
What do you mean?

279
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,100
My father told us

280
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,300
he'd betroth one of us

281
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,060
to his final disciple.

282
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,060
You three are prestigious ladies.

283
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,250
Master must have

284
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,300
been kidding.

285
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,420
I can't take it seriously.

286
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,610
Ladies,

287
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,650
you need not worry.

288
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,420
Madam Wang, activate your inner strength.

289
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,940
Inner strength?

290
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,820
If you're reading this, it means I'm no longer

291
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,100
of this world.

292
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,770
The one who took my life was...

293
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,340
Father would never

294
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,060
- make a joke... - Did they finish reading?

295
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,770
with our marriage.

296
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,300
- Darn it. - My sister would like to speak with you.

297
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,370
- What's on the letter? - Young Master Han?

298
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,820
You came at the perfect time.

299
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,000
- She talks a lot. - If you can get rid

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,770
of that impostor Wu Jianming,

301
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,640
I can't hear a thing.

302
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,650
I don't mind marrying you.

303
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,820
It's him!

304
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,770
He looked like an honest fellow.

305
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,370
Can't judge a book by its cover.

306
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,850
If he could fool the Master,

307
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,060
we must be cautious.

308
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,700
What are they whispering?

309
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,820
This grudge

310
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,460
must be avenged.

311
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,580
Vengeance is needed.

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,730
He must pay for this.

313
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,490
What now?

314
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,340
We kill him.

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,610
It's always the same methods.

316
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,890
My venomous spider

317
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,980
was a gift from the Master before he left.

318
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,340
After all these years,

319
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,530
it's time for it to get some fresh air.

320
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,940
I have a recipe.

321
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,340
The Master says

322
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,220
to use it when necessary.

323
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,530
Tonight,

324
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,370
I'll brew the drug.

325
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,300
Madam Yan, brew the drug

326
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,820
for my Jade Hornet Sting.

327
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,980
Before we act,

328
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,820
we can knock him out with incense.

329
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,370
One more thing.

330
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,940
Father said you could choose,

331
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,580
but you must marry me first.

332
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,650
I am the oldest sister.

333
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,530
I can't hear a thing.

334
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,300
In this family,

335
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,490
- the old ones can't get married. - They talk too much.

336
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,610
The young can't get married yet.

337
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,850
Miss Yuzhu, do you have

338
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,940
the Sunwarm Jade?

339
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,650
You need not worry.

340
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,980
Since Mother said so,

341
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,700
the Madams will take care of it.

342
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,490
No,

343
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,300
I mean,

344
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,650
you'd better not be a greedy one.

345
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,300
You'd ignore a beauty like Yuzhu?

346
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,650
All you care about is the Sunwarm Jade.

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,730
Forget it, Fengwu.

348
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,730
Don't make things hard for him.

349
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,340
Yuzhu!

350
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,420
Don't speak like you've married him.

351
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,580
I wasn't!

352
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,610
The path ends here.

353
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,890
Where am I staying?

354
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,340
We got carried away chatting.

355
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,130
West wing.

356
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,980
This way.

357
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,730
When do we make our move?

358
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,100
Tonight.

359
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,370
No time like the present.

360
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,180
Alright.

361
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,530
Wait.

362
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,300
Young Master Han.

363
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,530
Please.

364
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,530
Thanks for walking me here.

365
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,980
Rest well.

366
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,100
I didn't say anything wrong just now, did I?

367
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,490
He won't be upset, right?

368
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,750
- Why are you still here? - I told you...

369
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,640
to talk less.

370
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,860
Alright. I'm going.

371
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,160
- Go. - Go on.

372
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,700
Did I say anything wrong just now?

373
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,410
Right?

374
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,290
What do you think about me and him?

375
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,540
They are finally gone.

376
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,980
Madam Yan always thinks things through.

377
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,340
Strange.

378
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,700
Why is it quiet again?

379
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,370
- We'll go with your plan. - Whatever you say.

380
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,130
Alright.

381
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,180
Since everyone agrees,

382
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,700
we still have to treat him well.

383
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,890
Let him stay at the residence.

384
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,460
Give him good food and drink.

385
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,220
Let him build up his strength.

386
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,820
That way,

387
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,730
he'll be

388
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,650
more useful to us later.

389
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,490
Nanny Wu.

390
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,010
Make sure Young Master Han gets a hearty breakfast.

391
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,060
Use the same standard

392
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,340
that we had for the Master.

393
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,180
Whatever they're planning,

394
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,460
I have to get the Sunwarm Jade

395
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,490
they promised me.

396
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,850
I'm running out of pills.

397
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,490
Better save them for a critical moment.

398
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,370
Good morning, Young Master Han.

399
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,980
Mother asked Nanny Wu

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,340
to prepare a hearty breakfast.

401
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,490
Come eat with us.

402
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,250
Young Master Han, have some.

403
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,700
Everything was specially made

404
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,530
by Nanny Wu at our mothers' request.

405
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,460
I called someone greedy last night,

406
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,180
but that was totally wrong.

407
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,130
He's just stingy, that's what.

408
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,340
Who comes as a guest,

409
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,940
eats and drinks for free,

410
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,250
and shows up empty-handed?

411
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,850
That's enough.

412
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,460
Can you stop going on and on?

413
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,770
Asking him for gifts the moment you open your mouth?

414
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,250
That's just as bad.

415
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,250
Didn't he ask us

416
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,370
for the Sunwarm Jade?

417
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,850
Ladies,

418
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,580
this meal,

419
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,100
is too much for me.

420
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,340
But,

421
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,760
I do have something

422
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,340
that can serve as a gift.

423
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,340
What's this?

424
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,300
This?

425
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,460
It's called Fragrance Pellet.

426
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,650
Carry it with you.

427
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,650
It helps keep mosquitoes and bugs away

428
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,980
with a light floral scent.

429
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,250
It smells so good.

430
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,060
What if men start lining up to propose?

431
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,010
This is official imperial medicine.

432
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,490
Such a rare and precious court medicine,

433
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,610
and you're giving it away?

434
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,060
Don't tell me you've fallen for the two of us.

435
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,370
Fengwu,

436
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,770
don't talk nonsense.

437
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,770
All of this

438
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,580
was made by Nanny Wu based on guesses.

439
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,100
We're not sure if it suits your taste, Young Master Han.

440
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,580
Whichever one you like,

441
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,220
we'll have her make it again tomorrow.

442
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,300
These two girls are noisy,

443
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,610
but they're easier to deal with than the mothers.

444
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,250
Until I find the jade,

445
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,060
I'd better play along with them.

446
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,850
Delicious.

447
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,890
Do you like it?

448
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,250
If you like it,

449
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,050
then I like it too.

450
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,700
My belly hurts.

451
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,380
Mothers?

452
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,220
You,

453
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,940
come with us.

454
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,490
We brought you here

455
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,330
because there's something we want to ask you in person.

456
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,730
No need to ask.

457
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,620
I killed Physician Mo.

458
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,050
At least you're honest.

459
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,770
He tried to kill me first.

460
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,860
All I did

461
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,940
was defend myself.

462
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,250
We can look past

463
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,220
what you did to the Master.

464
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,220
But you must agree to do something for us.

465
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,980
Alright.

466
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,900
But I want you

467
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,420
to swear on Physician Mo's spirit.

468
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,140
Once it's done,

469
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,810
give me the Sunwarm Jade.

470
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,090
Do you know who you're going after?

471
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,660
I must have

472
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,180
the Sunwarm Jade.

473
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,050
His name is Ouyang Feitian.

474
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,810
He has always committed evil acts.

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,090
He slaughters the innocent.

476
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,570
He has even spread the word

477
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,290
that he'd wipe out our family.

478
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,570
Eliminating him

479
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,980
not only protects us,

480
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,420
but also benefits the people.

481
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,900
Fine.

482
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,700
Don't say we didn't warn you.

483
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,900
His martial skills

484
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,460
surpass the Master's.

485
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,010
He treasures his life dearly.

486
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,220
He's probably surrounded by layers of traps.

487
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,220
Underestimating him

488
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,460
will only get you killed.

489
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,180
Did you get all that?

490
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,770
No need for you ladies to worry about that.

491
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,420
And your sincerity?

492
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,490
Alright.

493
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,050
We can do that.

494
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,010
We swear

495
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,220
on the spirit of our late husband, Mo Juren.

496
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,330
If you can get rid of

497
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,420
Ouyang Feitian for us,

498
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,140
we'll give you the Sunwarm Jade.

499
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,420
Deal.

500
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,290
Deal.

501
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,460
It's like he didn't hesitate at all.

502
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,310
[Ouyang Feitian]

503
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,330
Who might this mighty warrior be?

504
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,620
You're Ouyang Feitian?

505
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,250
This is a sacred place of serenity.

506
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,700
Don't be reckless.

507
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,010
You're reeking of murderous intent,

508
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,620
and you talk about serenity?

509
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,860
You're a cultivator?

510
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,700
A proper cultivator,

511
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,900
getting involved

512
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,330
in mortal disputes?

513
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,380
Who sent you?

514
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,570
Which family hired you?

515
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,700
I am

516
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,940
willing to pay double

517
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,290
if you

518
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,460
could spare me.

519
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,700
Bargaining?

520
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,180
I've looked into you.

521
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,900
You've committed

522
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,220
countless crimes.

523
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,700
Now you think you can buy your life back?

524
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,810
Master,

525
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,860
why must you trouble a mere mortal like me?

526
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,010
I've even sent men many times

527
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,140
to Tainan Valley to seek cultivators,

528
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,600
but

529
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,900
I never managed to find any trace.

530
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,530
Now that I finally met one,

531
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,570
naturally,

532
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,220
I'd like to build

533
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,010
a good relationship with you.

534
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,900
Tainan Valley?

535
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,140
Yes.

536
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,570
Since ancient times,

537
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,770
Tainan Valley

538
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,090
has been a gathering place

539
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,420
for immortals.

540
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,900
Legend has it that a hundred years ago,

541
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,980
someone there

542
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,220
was chosen

543
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,980
to become a disciple of an immortal.

544
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,420
Please look, Master.

545
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,250
This is

546
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,330
a map of Tainan Valley.

547
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,900
If you wish to have it,

548
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,330
I will

549
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,530
gladly hand it over.

550
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,050
Tainan Valley…

551
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,490
That sounds familiar.

552
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,460
Could there be other cultivators?

553
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,250
Seems like you're not interested in that, Master.

554
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,620
Well then,

555
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,730
forget it.

556
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,420
Once this is all done,

557
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,290
I'll go check out Tainan Valley.

558
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,250
Mother.

559
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,180
Ouyang Feitian...

560
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,180
We have news.

561
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,330
What happened?

562
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,620
He's dead.

563
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,380
That fast?

564
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,460
Mother!

565
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,460
How is that possible?

566
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,980
He is back.

567
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,290
So soon?

568
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,290
She is the only one who tends to the herbs.

569
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,420
Looks like Physician Mo passed

570
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,090
all his knowledge to this mute girl.

571
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,090
It's done.

572
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,180
Now hand over

573
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,220
the Sunwarm Jade.

574
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,860
This is indeed

575
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,180
the Ouyang family heirloom

576
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,090
from Lone Manor.

577
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,700
What's the meaning of this?

578
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,420
Trying to go back on your word?

579
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,770
No.

580
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,860
It's just

581
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,220
that it happened so suddenly,

582
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,940
we...

583
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,660
we weren't prepared at all.

584
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,090
Prepared for what?

585
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,730
We had an agreement.

586
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,810
I help you,

587
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,810
you give me the jade.

588
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,140
How long do you need?

589
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,180
Ten days.

590
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,050
Ten days?

591
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,050
We originally estimated

592
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,490
you and Ouyang Feitian would fight for ten days.

593
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,250
Those ten days were critical for us to seize control

594
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,420
of the Lone Manor forces.

595
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,250
Who knew you'd kill him in just two hours?

596
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,980
You completely disrupted our plan.

597
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,460
That was way too fast.

598
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,770
You told me to kill Ouyang Feitian,

599
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,250
but you never said how long.

600
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,730
Besides,

601
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,700
you swore to me.

602
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,530
Right.

603
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,220
We did make a vow.

604
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,980
We promised if you took care

605
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,980
of Ouyang Feitian,

606
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,050
we'd give you the Sunwarm Jade.

607
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,010
But now what?

608
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,700
You call that taking care of it?

609
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,420
Exactly.

610
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,770
One old problem is gone,

611
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,250
and now a new one shows up.

612
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,770
Now that Ouyang Feitian is dead,

613
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,250
not just the Jingjiao Sect,

614
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,700
but all of Jiayuan City will be in chaos.

615
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,090
I even heard whispers

616
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,180
that the Five-Color Sect will make a move tonight.

617
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,330
- The Five-Color Sect? - Yes.

618
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,830
Tonight?

619
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,320
Yes.

620
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,810
If they take over Lone Manor,

621
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,770
what about us?

622
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,390
Will we even survive?

623
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,990
- What now? - What should we do?

624
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,860
Seems like

625
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,490
you didn't just kill the Master,

626
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,860
you're also about to bring ruin to the Mo family!

627
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,570
We're widows and orphans here.

628
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,620
What are we supposed to do?

629
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,480
- Yeah! - What now?

630
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,900
Tell us what we should do!

631
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,660
What should we do?

632
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,810
Sounds to me like you're backing out!

633
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,660
We're not backing out!

634
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,220
Then, how do I get the jade?

635
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,860
You...

636
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,810
stay.

637
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,730
That's impossible.

638
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,730
Why not?

639
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,250
Yeah!

640
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,250
The Sunwarm Jade

641
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,940
is the Mo family's heirloom treasure.

642
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,570
And we've made a deal.

643
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,530
Our family

644
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,620
has three daughters,

645
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,660
and they'll all marry you.

646
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,700
The Sunwarm Jade would be their dowry.

647
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,770
- All yours. - No way!

648
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,220
- Everything yours. - I'm going to become an immortal!

649
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,250
Our daughters

650
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,770
are the pride of Jiayuan City.

651
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,770
The Three Beauties of the Mo family!

652
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,310
Trust me,

653
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,330
people are lining up just to marry into this family.

654
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,810
Exactly.

655
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,050
You're scoring big here, you know?

656
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,490
You even get the Sunwarm Jade!

657
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,010
- Don't be ungrateful. - It's all yours!

658
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,120
- So lucky. - Seriously.

659
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,050
- Don't run! - You hit the jackpot!

660
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,770
- Right? - Stop!

661
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,660
Are you all done?

662
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,490
Now hear me out.

663
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,490
There's no way I'm staying.

664
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,140
Come up with something else.

665
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,900
There are still villains in the City.

666
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,570
I wonder

667
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,980
where they hide the Sunwarm Jade.

668
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,570
If the three of us will marry Li...

669
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,770
If I snatch it by force,

670
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,330
- they might destroy it. - Yeah.

671
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,330
That'd be trouble.

672
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,570
You little rascal.

673
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,620
Just say it.

674
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,770
Do you agree or not?

675
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,090
If they're all bad guys,

676
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,940
then I'm just saving the people.

677
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,010
But I can't let them keep dragging this out.

678
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,420
[Mo Residence]

679
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,180
[May I borrow the recipe for Fragrance Pellets?]

680
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,980
It's you.

681
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,770
Can you hear me?

682
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,730
This book contains essentials

683
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,290
of medicines written by your father.

684
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,010
Aside from

685
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,250
the Fragrance Pellet formula,

686
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,010
I've also added my own notes.

687
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,420
I hope it'll help you.

688
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,460
[I'll return it after copying.]

689
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,420
No need.

690
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,660
This belongs to the Mo family.

691
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,140
I'm returning it

692
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,490
to its rightful owner.

693
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,700
Of all in the Mo family,

694
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,730
only she seems decent.

695
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,530
Quiet and well-behaved.

696
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,730
Looks like she has

697
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,810
inherited Physician Mo's medical skills.

698
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,860
Too bad she can't speak.

699
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,980
Young Master Han.

700
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,460
Young Master Han.

701
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,900
Have some tea before you go.

702
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,900
Never mind.

703
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,980
That's a good idea.

704
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,050
This man is nicknamed Black Bear.

705
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,980
The Five-Color Sect's

706
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,860
[Black Bear]
top contender for the next Sect Leader.

707
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,090
He rose through the ranks by pillaging and killing.

708
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,250
He even kills the elderly and children.

709
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,530
Taking him out

710
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,220
means removing a threat to the Mo Family.

711
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,660
It rids the people of a menace.

712
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,050
Once it's done,

713
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,530
I'll hand over the Sunwarm Jade

714
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,730
with both hands.

715
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,140
We give you our word.

716
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,570
So, you're Black Bear.

717
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,860
Sounds like you really are rotten to the core.

718
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,180
Who are you calling Black Bear?

719
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,460
He did it again.

720
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,290
He really killed Black Bear.

721
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,330
So what do we do now?

722
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,490
Are we seriously

723
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,940
going to let him marry all three

724
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,090
of our daughters?

725
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,700
And give him the Sunwarm Jade too?

726
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,570
No way.

727
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,620
If he leaves,

728
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,490
we'll be four helpless widows.

729
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,570
Besides,

730
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,050
we still have so many enemies.

731
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,810
That's

732
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,810
why we must do whatever it takes

733
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,980
to make him stay.

734
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,730
Why is it so quiet?

735
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,180
No one is here.

736
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,530
Don't tell me they ran off

737
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,810
to avoid paying up.

738
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,140
Young Master Han,

739
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,490
we were just looking for you.

740
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,420
Weren't you all out?

741
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,010
We've been waiting here for you.

742
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,570
Come.

743
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,460
What for?

744
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,180
Measurements for new clothes!

745
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,980
- Haven't had time to wash your old ones. - What?

746
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,010
You've killed two villains.

747
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,490
What?

748
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,900
We'll wash them for you.

749
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,620
No, no need!

750
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,850
Ladies, you don't have to.

751
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,900
From now on,

752
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,380
we'll take care of all your laundry.

753
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,050
No need!

754
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,220
You've killed two,

755
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,050
your clothes must be filthy!

756
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,220
I'm great at sewing.

757
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,250
From now on,

758
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,220
I'll make all your clothes.

759
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,810
Never mind.

760
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,220
Just help us out this once.

761
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,660
Don't tell me you want me to get revenge again?

762
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,570
That's right.

763
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,730
Guihua Alley.

764
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,660
Old Master Wu.

765
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,860
I'm not going.

766
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,660
Han Li!

767
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,830
No.

768
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,780
I can't delay any longer.

769
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:48,860
Here.

770
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,950
Have a bowl of herbal tea.

771
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,780
It'll cool you down.

772
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,950
Sir!

773
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,380
You're finally back!

774
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,950
Jiayuan City has been in chaos lately.

775
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,260
Ouyang Feitian, Black Bear,

776
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,180
and even the Mo Family's future son-in-law are dead.

777
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,820
Where's my friend?

778
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,380
Don't even ask about him.

779
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,510
He is lovesick.

780
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,030
He has been moping day and night.

781
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,660
He does nothing

782
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,380
but stand there.

783
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,910
He's ruining my business.

784
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,700
Qu Hun.

785
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,860
Let's go.

786
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,590
There's no time.

787
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,150
If they try to stop us again,

788
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,470
I won't hold back.

789
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,590
Why did you bring someone along?

790
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,380
He's backup.

791
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,340
Look,

792
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,070
aren't you misunderstanding us?

793
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,430
What?

794
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,660
You really think

795
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,150
we'd try to cheat you?

796
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,910
You know best.

797
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,430
I did everything Physician Mo

798
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,950
asked in the letter.

799
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,220
As promised,

800
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,180
hand over the Sunwarm Jade now.

801
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,110
Don't worry.

802
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,990
You all,

803
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:16,950
hurry

804
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,150
and bring the jade here.

805
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,590
Young Master Han,

806
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,590
word has been going around

807
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,950
that the Mo family

808
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,470
has gained a son-in-law with thunderous means.

809
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,180
Really,

810
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,060
we couldn't be happier.

811
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,820
At last, we have someone to rely on.

812
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,550
Look...

813
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,660
Spare me the excuses.

814
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,780
Look.

815
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,030
Turn around and take a look.

816
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,910
The dowries

817
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,260
are all here.

818
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,510
The first chest

819
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,510
is filled with priceless gold and jewels.

820
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,950
In the future,

821
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,740
the earnings from all our secret ventures

822
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,990
will be yours to manage entirely.

823
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,820
The second chest

824
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,220
holds our Mo family's ancestral medical compendium

825
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,860
and the keys to the clinic storeroom.

826
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,340
The third chest

827
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,380
contains all the weapon manuals from the Jingjiao Sect,

828
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,380
along with the Sect Master Token to rally the masses.

829
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,150
You're trying to use these

830
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,660
to keep me here?

831
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,470
And also

832
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,110
our three daughters.

833
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,300
And also

834
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,380
the four of us.

835
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,700
We all want to leave too.

836
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,910
Don't forget me.

837
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,980
We all want to go with you,

838
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,510
together.

839
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,510
Take us with you.

840
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,740
Let's run away together.

841
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,340
Who said I'm taking you along?

842
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,150
Let me be clear.

843
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,300
None of those three

844
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,700
will ever be my wife.

845
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:53,950
The four of you

846
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,340
are not coming with me!

847
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,030
Young Master,

848
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,380
take me with you.

849
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,380
Go back.

850
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,590
All I want is the Sunwarm Jade!

851
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,260
Why...

852
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,220
Why don't you want me?

853
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,180
Are the Three Beauties not good enough for you?

854
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,150
Where did you get the confidence?

855
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,470
I'm one of the four Han heirs!

856
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,780
If I say no, it's no.

857
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,070
Don't even try to persuade me!

858
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,220
What are we supposed to do without a man in the house?

859
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,990
I know what the ladies

860
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,950
are really up to with all this crying.

861
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,340
- Stop crying. - With Father gone,

862
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,910
those eying the Mo family fortune will surely strike.

863
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,430
- Stop crying. - The ladies just want

864
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,780
to keep this cultivator here...

865
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,910
- Stop crying! - to protect us.

866
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,220
As for marrying us off and giving him the Sunwarm Jade,

867
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,910
they never meant to follow through.

868
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,430
I just hope Li doesn't fall for it.

869
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,700
Keep this up

870
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,630
and I'll burn this place to the ground.

871
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,150
So there's really no room to talk?

872
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,300
None at all.

873
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,860
The Sunwarm Jade.

874
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,860
Hand it over now.

875
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,470
No more talking.

876
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,740
Attack!

877
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,030
You've been poisoned by Silver Demon Palm.

878
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,630
You don't have long left.

879
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,300
Once that poison sets in,

880
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,630
not only can you not cultivate,

881
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,950
you won't live much longer.

882
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,820
If I die,

883
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,820
you're coming with me!

884
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,910
Stay here,

885
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,990
and no one has to die.

886
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,110
The Sunwarm Jade, now!

887
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,380
Are you handing it over or not?

888
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,660
No!

889
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,820
We're dead either way.

890
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,340
If you've got the guts, kill me.

891
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,430
Kill us all.

892
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,660
- Kill us! - Go ahead!

893
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,910
Kill every one of us!

894
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,740
Kill us!

895
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,780
Do it!

896
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,910
Kill us!

897
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:50,510
Kill us!

898
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,180
Go on!

899
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,700
Kill us!

900
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,510
Kill!

901
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,180
The poison's taking effect.

902
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,260
You can talk?

903
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,470
Kill us!

904
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,150
Hurry!

905
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,340
Quick!

906
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,220
Hurry!

907
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,030
Sleeping drug?

908
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,260
