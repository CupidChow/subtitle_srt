It's also the final item this month.

194
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,420
Golden Glow Ganoderma.

195
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,940
Now that's rare.

196
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,650
A millennium-old one.

197
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,100
A thousand years old!

198
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,250
No starting bid set.

199
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,650
Smells amazing...

200
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,460
Isn't that the one I sold

201
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,490
to Treasure House?

202
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,610
Is that shady merchant

203
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,180
actually backing this auction?

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,010
Eighteen hundred!

205
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,530
Two thousand!

206
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,580
Two thousand!

207
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,250
Twenty-five hundred!

208
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,770
Twenty-five hundred!

209
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,700
Anyone higher?

210
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,630
Twenty-five hundred!

211
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,490
Twenty-eight hundred!

212
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,260
Twenty-eight hundred!

213
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,370
Thirty-three hundred!

214
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,130
Thirty-three hundred!

215
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,300
Thirty-eight hundred!

216
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,180
Thirty-eight hundred!

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,340
Thirty-eight hundred, once!

218
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,250
Hold it!

219
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,220
Qi Yunxiao?

220
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,850
This Millennium Ganoderma

221
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,730
shall be mine.

222
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,580
Stop causing trouble!

223
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,730
Guards, throw him out!

224
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,730
- Not this again! - Who even are you?

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,760
- I'll trade an array for it! - Still haven't learned, huh?

226
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,370
-This time... - Wait!

227
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,850
...he even dropped the disguise.

228
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,100
Esteemed elders,

229
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,340
I am Qi Yunxiao, an Artifact Crafter in this city.

230
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,220
I truly need that Golden Glow Ganoderma

231
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,100
to save a life.

232
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,980
I'm willing to offer

233
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,850
two high-grade arrays

234
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,130
in exchange for it.

235
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,010
Where did this guy come from?

236
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,340
Two arrays, you say?

237
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,580
I have eight myself!

238
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,610
Throw him out!

239
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,580
- I'm just trying to... - Kid,

240
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,130
stand down!

241
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,940
Get lost.

242
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:50,980
Hold on, wait!

243
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,890
Young man,

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,890
come back next time.

245
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,220
- Come on. - Elder, please!

246
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,980
I really need it to save a life.

247
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,610
Elder, wait!

248
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,530
A Qi Refining rookie?

249
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,610
An Artifact Crafter?

250
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,370
Move it.

251
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,450
- Four thousand! - Elder!

252
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,890
- Four thousand! - To save a life!

253
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,650
Four thousand!

254
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,770
Anyone want to bid higher?

255
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,490
Forty-five hundred!

256
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,420
Forty-five hundred!

257
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,340
Forty-eight hundred!

258
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,300
Forty-eight hundred!

259
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,580
Any higher than forty-eight hundred?

260
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,980
Blade Arts?

261
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,370
You're from the Fu Clan?

262
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,610
Now that you know,

263
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,300
even if you hand over the array,

264
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,700
we still can't let you live.

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,770
Han!

266
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,420
[Yunxiao Pavilion]

267
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,790
[Xin Ruyin]

268
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,250
Yunxiao.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,530
Ruyin?

270
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,530
How did you get hurt?

271
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,250
I let my guard down for a moment,

272
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,650
and some thugs mugged me.

273
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,340
Is this girl...

274
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,530
Han saved me.

275
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,940
...the one he cares so much about?

276
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,220
Han,

277
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,850
come in.

278
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,180
The Millennium Spirit Herb you took earlier

279
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,890
was the one he traded to us.

280
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,340
Yunxiao often mentioned you.

281
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,700
You saved me once.

282
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,700
I, Xin Ruyin, am deeply grateful.

283
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,100
Senior Han,

284
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,980
come inside.

285
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,420
Han,

286
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,980
you might not know,

287
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,890
those two

288
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,370
are from the Fu Clan, the top family

289
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,130
in Yuanwu.

290
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,490
They are trouble.

291
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,850
My advice?

292
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,130
Leave here soon.

293
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,300
You stepped in to protect me.

294
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,890
I don't want to get you involved.

295
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,490
Just now,

296
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,730
I wiped out all their traces.

297
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,180
I won't stay long.

298
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,220
However,

299
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,490
I think you two

300
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,940
should find somewhere quiet

301
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,130
and lay low

302
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,490
just to be safe.

303
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,180
Ruyin,

304
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,340
did you hear that?

305
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,100
Han says

306
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,060
we should find a quiet place and stay a while.

307
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,580
Yunxiao,

308
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,300
we're not even married yet.

309
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,060
By the way, Han,

310
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,770
thanks to Ruyin's help,

311
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,770
the upgrade for the Five Phases Reversing Array went smoothly.

312
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,250
Its defense is stronger now,

313
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,490
plus it now has

314
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,980
an illusory trap to restrain enemies.

315
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,250
I'll go get it.

316
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,300
Qi,

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,580
no rush.

318
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,490
Since Miss Ruyin is here too,

319
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,420
I actually came

320
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,820
to ask for your help

321
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,340
to appraise something.

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,770
Teleportation,

323
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,770
stabilization,

324
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,980
acceleration,

325
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,580
spiritual channeling,

326
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,530
amplification.

327
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,420
I can't believe

328
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,890
this ancient teleport array

329
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,700
actually exists.

330
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,890
Once this array

331
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,460
is infused with spiritual power,

332
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,980
it can teleport

333
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,010
across great distances.

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,650
It seems

335
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,300
you also need a Greater Teleport Command Seal

336
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,010
to withstand spatial turbulence.

337
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,530
Judging by your expression,

338
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,060
that shouldn't be a problem for you.

339
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,340
Unfortunately,

340
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,010
this array isn't complete.

341
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,180
A part is missing.

342
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,420
It may no longer be usable.

343
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,370
Do you think you can

344
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,610
restore it?

345
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,250
This array

346
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,370
is very ancient,

347
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,650
and part of it is broken.

348
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,130
To fix it

349
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,940
would take rare high-grade materials.

350
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,010
It also involves a secret art.

351
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,770
Right now,

352
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,850
I'm still unwell.

353
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm afraid we're not able

354
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,700
to help you with it.

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,100
We're truly sorry.

356
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,580
If it's about the cost,

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,530
don't worry.

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,980
I'll handle all of it.

359
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,820
I still have

360
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,580
Golden Glow Ganoderma.

361
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,890
I can trade it.

362
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,610
Ruyin,

363
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,060
your illness can be cured.

364
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,130
Let's just agree to it.

365
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,100
Don't worry, Han.

366
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,250
I'll figure it out.

367
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,130
Yunxiao,

368
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,940
my condition

369
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,180
comes from being born with the Dragon Roar Body.

370
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,060
As I cultivate,

371
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,850
my meridians

372
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,940
gradually wither.

373
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,460
No medicine can cure it.

374
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,530
To have lived this long

375
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,650
is already a blessing.

376
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,730
I shouldn't

377
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,220
leave you disappointed

378
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,940
and waste

379
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,890
Senior Han's spirit herb.

380
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,300
Besides,

381
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,220
the demonic sects are on the rise.

382
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,490
The ancient teleport array

383
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,010
is bound to attract attention.

384
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,650
She must think

385
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,060
I'll betray them when they are no longer useful,

386
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,490
then silence them for good.

387
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,220
Looks like

388
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,300
I'll have to put her doubts to rest.

389
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,100
Hear me out.

390
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,010
I'm a free soul

391
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,530
with no interest in power.

392
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,300
But with the world in chaos now,

393
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,700
a great conflict is brewing.

394
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,890
We can't just idle away anymore.

395
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,940
This time,

396
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,580
it was pure chance

397
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,250
that I came upon this ancient teleport array.

398
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,010
Naturally,

399
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,890
I planned to use it as an escape route.

400
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,850
Though I'm no expert,

401
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,100
I've studied a bit of medicine.

402
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,580
The ancients once said

403
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,610
this world is vast and full of wonders.

404
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,940
No disease is incurable.

405
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,730
We only think so because

406
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,220
of our limited knowledge.

407
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,890
Miss Ruyin,

408
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,850
don't ever give up hope.

409
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,650
Han is right.

410
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,180
With this array,

411
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,420
nowhere is

412
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,660
out of our reach.

413
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,220
Ruyin,

414
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,770
stop saying

415
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,570
it's pointless to find a cure.

416
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,860
With Han and this array,

417
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,250
we'll definitely find a way to heal you.

418
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,860
Senior Han,

419
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,900
if that day really comes,

420
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,140
would you take us with you?

421
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,380
Of course.

422
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,460
Come to think of it,

423
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,570
this is my first time in the capital.

424
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,530
The cultivation world is in chaos,

425
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,560
yet this place stays lively

426
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,460
as if untouched.

427
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,700
I just wonder

428
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,770
how long this peace

429
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,660
will truly last.

430
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,180
Grandpa!

431
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,730
Grandpa, come chase me!

432
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,010
- Cui'er! - Sweet sugar hawthorn!

433
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,250
- I'm over here! - Fresh sugar hawthorn!

434
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,380
Sweet sugar hawthorn!

435
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,140
Watch where you're going, little girl!

436
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,570
Cui'er!

437
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,180
Don't run, Cui'er. Slow down!

438
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,330
Careful! Slow down!

439
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,900
Cui'er!

440
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
[Xiao Zhen, Qi Refining Stage]

441
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,460
Qi Refining Stage?

442
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,730
I can't detect his cultivation.

443
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,530
Did he use Aura Concealment?

444
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,020
[Mind Control Spell]

445
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,900
I was a fool

446
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,050
for not knowing your might.

447
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,050
I offended you, Master.

448
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,420
Please forgive me!

449
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,420
Calm down.

450
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,900
Your technique

451
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,180
is rather interesting.

452
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,090
I've memorized your aura.

453
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,380
Once I'm done here,

454
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,730
I'll come find you again.

455
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,090
Come take a look!

456
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,530
Painted umbrellas!

457
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,530
Sir,

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,330
where is the Qin Residence?

459
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,460
Thank you.

460
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,420
Fresh and fragrant buns here!

461
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,810
Grandpa, what's wrong?

462
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,370
[Xiao Cui'er]

463
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,360
- Did someone bully you? - Run!

464
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,030
Run!

465
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,570
Wait, what's going on?

466
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,180
Hurry, let's go!

467
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,420
Who are you?

468
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,730
[Qin Gui]
You trespassed into the Qin Residence.

469
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,530
That's a crime!

470
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,010
Sir, please...

471
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,980
Who are you calling "sir"?

472
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,700
Handsome,

473
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,290
it's an urgent matter.

474
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,290
I must see your master.

475
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,770
Please inform him.

476
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,010
My master isn't

477
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,460
someone you can meet on a whim.

478
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,220
[To Qin Yan]

479
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,530
That's our lord's name...

480
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,090
Come with me.

481
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,250
Qin Yan greets the Master.

482
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,860
I failed to recognize you

483
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,770
and showed disrespect.

484
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,180
Please forgive my offense.

485
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,570
Master,

486
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,220
take a seat.

487
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,980
Please sit.

488
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,660
Have a seat.

489
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,700
Please.

490
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,530
Calm yourself down.

491
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,310
As the letter stated,

492
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,220
I, Han,

493
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,530
came on my master's orders.

494
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,220
I may have to

495
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,290
stay for a few days.

496
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,510
[Qin Yan]

497
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,900
Thank you for your generosity.

498
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,700
You bring honor to our humble home.

499
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,220
Before my father passed away,

500
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,940
he once said that if disaster ever befell the Qin family,

501
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,180
Master Li would surely lend us a hand.

502
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,980
May I know

503
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,010
if that's the reason you've come, Master Han?

504
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,180
You need not ask further.

505
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,490
But indeed,

506
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,900
my master sent me here

507
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,090
to ensure your family survives

508
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,660
this coming disaster.

509
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,180
A disaster...

510
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,490
In that case,

511
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,220
the lives of the entire Qin family

512
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,940
are in your care, Master Han!

513
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,620
No wonder he's a man of power.

514
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,620
Much more sensible than the gatekeeper.

515
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,250
We are in your hands.

516
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,510
Please protect us.

517
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,900
At ease, Lord Qin.

518
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,330
This is my sect's duty,

519
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,460
so I will

520
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,700
do my best.

521
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,730
However, for this mission,

522
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,530
I was ordered to proceed

523
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,490
in secret.

524
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,420
From now on, we shall

525
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,380
address each other as uncle and nephew.

526
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,860
Uncle and nephew...

527
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,090
As you wish, Master.

528
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,490
As you wish, Master.

529
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,140
As you wish, Master.

530
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,140
As you wish, Master.

531
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,730
- As you wish, Master. - That's enough.

532
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,140
Please, have a seat.

533
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,180
From now on,

534
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,050
we're uncle and nephew.

535
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,810
Did he say he's the descendant of the old Master's friend?

536
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,500
Yes.

537
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,940
Sounds like another freeloader to me.

538
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,530
Young Master, Madam,

539
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,090
while I was observing in the hall,

540
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,740
The Master was rather indifferent at first,

541
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,010
but after reading the letter,

542
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,060
his expression turned grave.

543
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,820
He even dismissed all the servants

544
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,300
to speak with him alone.

545
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,290
How old is he?

546
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,210
[Madam Qin]
And what does he look like?

547
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,220
Tell me everything.

548
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,330
Madam,

549
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,900
his looks are very ordinary.

550
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,660
His clothes were plain and shabby.

551
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,220
At first, I thought he

552
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,140
was another penniless fool trying to make a connection.

553
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,490
But I've served Master since childhood.

554
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,050
He's never treated anyone

555
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,090
[Qin Fei]
with such respect.

556
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,530
Come!

557
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,090
The Master actually poured tea for him.

558
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,980
I want him dead.

559
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,860
Qin Gui!

560
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,380
Throw him out!

561
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,090
Madam,

562
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,140
I wouldn't dare!

563
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,940
Calm down.

564
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,860
Please calm down.

565
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,220
Grandpa!

566
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,620
Cui'er, hide quickly!

567
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
Who did this?

568
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,090
It's a complete mess in here!

569
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,370
So much blood...

570
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,660
The mark

571
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,490
on the old man from yesterday

572
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,460
vanished here.

573
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,770
The trail is still fresh.

574
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,380
It must have just happened.

575
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,420
Rogue cultivators,

576
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,180
welcome to your paradise,

577
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,860
the Black Fiend Cult.

578
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,940
Everyone here

579
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,700
has been cast aside by the Seven Sects.

580
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,140
- Da. - We're...

581
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,700
Quiet!

582
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,380
- ...not overthrowing the Seven Sects. - Let him finish.

583
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,180
And we won't make you die for us either.

584
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,700
We just want you to know

585
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,860
the so-called Foundation Pill

586
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,860
is a lie by the Seven Sects!

587
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,380
Without that pill,

588
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,810
you can still break through Qi Refining

589
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,220
and reach the next stage!

590
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,490
Seriously?

591
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,220
The Master of the Black Fiend Cult

592
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,470
is using a secret technique.

593
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,670
Soon,

594
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,530
he'll break through to Core Formation.

595
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,050
What the Seven Sects keep hidden,

596
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,330
our Black Fiend Cult

597
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,940
shares with all of you.

598
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,730
Now,

599
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,700
the Black Fiend Cult

600
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,730
is willing to share

601
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,570
our secret arts with you all

602
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,730
so we may cultivate together.

603
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,620
Da,

604
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,420
this sounds sketchy to me.

605
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,330
What should we do then?

606
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,700
Sharing secret arts!

607
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,330
- Cultivating together! - What is this place?

608
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,460
- Who are these people? - Sharing secret arts!

609
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,660
[Meng Wu]
Cultivate together!

610
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,460
Share secret arts!

611
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,530
Cultivate together!

612
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,250
Share secret arts!

613
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,490
Cultivate together!

614
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,940
San.

615
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,330
You alright?

616
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,220
I'm fine.

617
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,050
How do you feel?

618
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm all itchy.

619
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,900
It has nothing

620
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,620
to do with me.

621
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,050
Sir,

622
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,900
save my grandpa!

623
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,700
Let go!

624
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,770
If you save my grandpa,

625
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,730
I'll give you

626
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,390
this book that holds the Aura Concealment.

627
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,090
No.

628
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,660
I'll even serve you if you want!

629
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,140
I already told you,

630
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,090
I can't help you.

631
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,090
Stop bothering me.

632
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,770
Leave now.

633
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,180
If you won't help me,

634
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,290
then I'll just die right here!

635
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,570
If you won't help me,

636
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,140
then kill me yourself!

637
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,090
We rogue cultivators

638
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,090
are all being hunted anyway.

639
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,010
They got my grandpa yesterday.

640
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,220
Last month, a boy from the Li family.

641
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,380
Three months ago, it was Miss Zhao.

642
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,980
Next time, it might be me.

643
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,330
How is it my concern?

644
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,980
Grandpa was right after all.

645
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,810
You are all two-faced hypocrites.

646
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,700
You don't care if rogue cultivators live or die!

647
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,180
If it weren't for that Aura Concealment,

648
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,980
Grandpa wouldn't have left the city.

649
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,010
And if I hadn't

650
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,700
insisted on seeing the Lantern Festival...

651
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,730
If it weren't...

652
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,700
What is it?

653
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,660
Young Master,

654
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,010
The Master has asked you to come to the front hall.

655
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,810
He says it's something important.

656
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,090
Alright.

657
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:15,700
Understood.

658
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,770
Hold on a sec.

659
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,980
Sorry about this.

660
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,810
As for you,

661
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,420
we'll settle this later.

662
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,010
They were all taken,

663
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,570
but not killed on the spot.

664
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,380
Seems like they're still useful.

665
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,330
It's no easy task to control so many rogues.

666
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,620
They must be locked up separately.

667
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,810
There are

668
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,050
different locations too.

669
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,050
Did Uncle Qin say what it was about?

670
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,940
Young Master,

671
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,770
Prince Xin's estate sent an invitation.

672
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,330
The Master thinks highly of you.

673
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,660
Perhaps he wants

674
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,660
to take you along.

675
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,220
You'll know when you're there.

676
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,010
Greetings, Mr. Qin.

677
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,420
Steward Wang, how have you been?

678
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,320
[Steward Wang]
Thanks to you, quite well.

679
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,420
Please.

680
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:15,900
Yes.

681
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,090
Qin Fei,

682
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,010
you sit here.

683
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,730
Han Li,

684
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,530
you sit here.

685
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,050
Please, Young Master Han.

686
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,860
What a strange wave of spiritual power.

687
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,730
The demonic sects?

688
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,660
Young Master Qin,

689
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,530
please.

690
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,490
Prince Xin has arrived.

691
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,940
[Prince Xin]

692
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,810
Tonight's family banquet

693
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,860
is an opportunity

694
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,220
for me to share

695
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,530
a once-in-a-lifetime chance

696
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,730
with all of you.

697
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,770
Steward Wang,

698
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,090
invite the cultivator.

699
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,940
Amazing!

700
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,900
Incredible!

701
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,820
[Wu Sanxing]

702
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,930
It may just be a basic Fireball Technique,

703
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,570
but the control was remarkably precise.

704
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,090
Quite interesting.

705
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,380
Good.

706
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,010
Excellent.

707
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,770
So impressive.

708
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,180
- Amazing. - Truly spectacular.

709
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,420
Honored guests,

710
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,050
this cultivator

711
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,570
shares a connection with the Prince.

712
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,810
He has

713
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,860
accepted the Young Prince

714
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,050
as his personal disciple.

715
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,330
All this fuss,

716
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,420
and he's just a Tier 5 Qi Refiner?

717
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,220
He's also seeking

718
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,980
others with spirit roots and potential

719
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,860
to guide them onto the immortal path

720
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,660
and teach the way to eternal life.

721
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,530
He is indeed a cultivator,

722
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,530
but his cultivation is weak.

723
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,380
He won't stir up much trouble.

724
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,980
Master.

725
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,660
Master.

726
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,810
Master.

727
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,420
Master.

728
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,710
Can you take a look at me?

729
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,550
Look at me, please.

730
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,110
Please, look at me!

731
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,290
Aside from this Steward Wang,

732
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,660
no one else here

733
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,220
has any spiritual power.

734
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,980
Miss Mo?

735
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,940
Why is she here?

736
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,660
You caused the commotion last night.

737
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,250
How did it end up like this?

738
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,140
[Young Prince]
We got the old one. The girl escaped.

739
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,570
No idea what spell she used,

740
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,980
but she hid her aura well.

741
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,810
Master will soon return.

742
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,250
No mistakes are allowed.

743
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,010
You're being too flashy.

744
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,140
If this causes trouble,

745
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,810
and Master gets upset,

746
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,650
he might use us

747
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,530
as dummies!

748
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,170
Understood.

749
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,050
Protector.

750
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,900
Lately,

751
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,610
I've told those five idiots

752
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,860
to search the capital

753
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,050
for rogue cultivators.

754
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,980
Miss Mo?

755
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,570
Why are you here?

756
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,340
You're here too?

757
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,260
You're tailing Steward Wang?

758
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,050
He's the one I told you about.

759
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,460
He wiped out my clan,

760
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,690
Sect Leader of the Five-Color Sect.

761
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,340
He's dangerous.

762
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,820
Way out of your league.

763
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,980
Is he a cultivator?

764
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,690
More or less.

765
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,260
But he reeks of dark aura.

766
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,690
Clearly a demonic type.

767
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,610
Not a righteous man.

768
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,170
I should've figured.

769
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,530
Everything he said,

770
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,010
and all those shady dealings...

771
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,980
How are there so many cultivators in the world,

772
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,300
and I just happen to meet them all?

773
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,650
Miss Mo,

774
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,340
this place is dangerous.

775
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,170
Before anyone sees you,

776
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:09,820
go back.

777
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,900
Don't come again.

778
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,090
Li.

779
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,460
I thought

780
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,490
I'd never see you again.

781
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,260
On the day we parted

782
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,010
at the Yan Clan Stronghold,

783
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,460
you didn't say anything.

784
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,130
But I knew

785
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,860
a mortal like me who can't cultivate

786
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,570
could never walk the same path as you.

787
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,090
Our lives are far too short,

788
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,490
like morning dew

789
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,690
that will be gone in a blink.

790
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,650
All love, hate, longing

791
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,130
will turn to dust.

792
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,010
But even with such a fleeting life,

793
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,570
I still want to make it count.

794
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,690
Even if it's like a moth to a flame,

795
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,050
even if

796
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,610
it ends in nothing,

797
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,650
I still want to try.

798
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,490
But you...

799
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,570
Li!

800
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,260
All these years,

801
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,530
you haven't changed

802
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,010
a single bit.

803
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,900
Don't worry.

804
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,570
Today,

805
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,490
I won't kill him.

806
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,740
I won't go head-on with him again.

807
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,340
I'll do as you and Father taught me.

808
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,340
I'll do it

809
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,940
one step at a time,

810
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,780
find his weakness and trap him,

811
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,650
until the day I can kill him.

812
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,490
No matter how it's done,

813
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,420
no matter how long it takes.

814
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,050
Farewell,

815
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,420
Li.

816
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,650
Miss Mo.

817
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,170
If I told you to stop,

818
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,820
you wouldn't listen.

819
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,010
Very well, then.

820
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,130
You've been compromised.

821
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,340
Do you admit your guilt?

822
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,490
I was too blind to see your powerful presence.

823
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,980
Please, spare me!

824
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,380
Senior,

825
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,130
I am just

826
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,530
a newcomer here.

827
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,610
All I've done is enjoy

828
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,740
some mortal offerings.

829
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,300
I don't know

830
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,530
what crime I've committed.

831
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,210
Whether you have or not,

832
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,260
that's for me to decide.

833
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,900
I'll ask the questions.

834
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,940
Answer truthfully.

835
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:20,860
Yes!

836
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,530
Yes!

837
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,740
You may rise.

838
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,980
Thank you, Senior.

839
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,050
Many thanks, Senior.

840
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,000
What is your name?

841
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,300
Who is your master?

842
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,490
That Fire Control Technique you used

843
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,050
back in the hall,

844
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,170
where did you learn it?

845
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,460
Senior,

846
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,530
I'm Wu Sanxing.

847
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,460
I have no sect or master.

848
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm just a rogue cultivator.

849
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,300
As for that spell,

850
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,090
I developed it

851
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,420
through my own practice

852
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,490
and knowledge.

853
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,340
It was a simple trick

854
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,820
to fool the mortals.

855
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,050
I meant no offense.

856
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,300
If you like it,

857
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,860
I'm willing

858
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,900
to offer it up with both hands.

859
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,090
A smooth talker.

860
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,900
Clearly used to dealing in the mortal world

861
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,420
and very street smart.

862
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,210
