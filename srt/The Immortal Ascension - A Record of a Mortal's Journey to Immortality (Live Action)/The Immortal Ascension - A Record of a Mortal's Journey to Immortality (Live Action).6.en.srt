00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,300
Mr. Wan,

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,650
if we run into each other on the arena,

193
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,130
how do you think you'd fare?

194
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,580
Sir, you're really joking.

195
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,060
Your cultivation is way above mine.

196
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,250
Of course I'd lose.

197
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,770
Then...

198
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,730
what if I lend you

199
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,580
this horsetail whisk?

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,340
It's a mid-grade artifact.

201
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,300
Well...

202
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,610
I might have a fifty-fifty chance.

203
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,890
What if I also lend you

204
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,060
this treasure?

205
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,530
Then...

206
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,490
maybe...

207
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,130
Oh,

208
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,460
I'd have a seventy percent chance!

209
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,820
Great.

210
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,700
In the cultivation world,

211
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,730
battles aren't just about power.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,220
They also rely on artifacts,

213
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,130
talismans,

214
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,250
and pills.

215
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,460
In terms of strength and techniques,

216
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,580
we can't compete

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,610
with those arrogant clan disciples.

218
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,100
But there's one thing we have

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,370
that they don't,

220
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,010
unity.

221
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,700
If our Azure Vein Society had a hundred rogue cultivators,

222
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,700
and each one

223
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,460
was willing to contribute a treasure,

224
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,820
then we'd have

225
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,730
a hundred treasures in our hands!

226
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,490
With that many treasures,

227
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,220
even if we're facing

228
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,700
Foundation Establishment cultivators,

229
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,530
we might

230
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,490
still stand a chance.

231
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,130
Absolutely!

232
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,340
I'm willing to lend my mid-grade whisk

233
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,060
for everyone to use.

234
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,420
Qingwen...

235
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,480
Since I brought this up,

236
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,420
it's only right I set the example.

237
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,700
I've said before.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,250
The reason I founded the Azure Vein Society

239
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,530
was to build a world

240
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,650
where all cultivators are equal.

241
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,700
We'll show those clan kids

242
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,060
that rogue cultivators like us

243
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,420
are no less than any of them!

244
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,060
Yes!

245
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,700
- Yes! - Right!

246
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,370
We're not weaker than them!

247
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,100
They're nothing special!

248
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,250
See?

249
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,700
You can't go wrong following this sir!

250
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,460
I know,

251
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,890
even with all these treasures,

252
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,980
not everyone here

253
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,010
will walk away victorious.

254
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,300
But as long as we give it our all,

255
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,490
even if we lose,

256
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,460
we'll make those clan disciples see

257
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,670
we rogue cultivators

258
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,690
won't be pushed around!

259
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,470
We won't be pushed around!

260
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,530
We won't be pushed around!

261
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,180
Sir,

262
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,650
even though I lack talent,

263
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,420
I still want

264
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,250
to contribute something!

265
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,060
Good!

266
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,650
Then,

267
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,980
those who want to help,

268
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,770
come with me!

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,730
All right!

270
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,490
Let's go!

271
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,130
Yes!

272
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,060
I'll contribute what I can!

273
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,130
Take mine!

274
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,330
- Take mine! - Here you go!

275
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,180
Take mine!

276
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,980
So that's their plan all along.

277
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,300
Mr. Han,

278
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,820
would you be willing to help?

279
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,010
After hearing what you said,

280
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,730
I've lost interest

281
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,340
in joining the Seven Sects.

282
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,580
I won't join the tournament

283
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,490
at Tianwu Arena.

284
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,300
My friend,

285
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,610
this is our best chance

286
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,980
to make a name for ourselves!

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,610
Yeah, a golden opportunity!

288
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,250
- Right! - Totally!

289
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,790
Do your part!

290
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,940
Looks like I can't leave today

291
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,770
without bleeding a little.

292
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,730
If you've got treasures,

293
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,940
bring them out and share!

294
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,300
All right.

295
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,490
I happened

296
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,890
to come across

297
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,370
a restorative pill.

298
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,180
I planned to keep it for myself.

299
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,650
But under the circumstances,

300
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,420
I'll share it with everyone.

301
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,700
Much appreciated, Mr.!

302
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,010
That's a good one.

303
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,820
Ugh, my stomach hurts.

304
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,340
I need to take a quick break.

305
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,820
You guys keep chatting.

306
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,370
Han!

307
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,340
You...

308
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,730
You're fine?

309
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,010
I'm fine now.

310
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,130
Xiaoshan,

311
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,100
Are you here to talk me

312
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,370
into joining the Azure Vein Society?

313
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,730
Of course not.

314
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,770
But,

315
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,580
aren't you planning to join

316
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,820
the Tianwu Arena tournament

317
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,980
and win yourself a Foundation Pill?

318
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,730
The Seven Sects are great,

319
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,730
but I gotta stay alive first.

320
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,650
I knew it, Han.

321
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,730
You're not one to go in blind.

322
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,180
Well,

323
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,580
you weren't joining the fight.

324
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,010
So why'd you still

325
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,180
share your treasure?

326
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,530
Just trying to win us rogues a little respect.

327
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,610
Xiaoshan.

328
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,180
I can't shake the feeling that those guys

329
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,530
aren't as simple as they look.

330
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,650
With your kind of naivety,

331
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,100
you'll get burned.

332
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,300
No way!

333
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,850
All rogue cultivators are one big family!

334
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,980
You're overthinking it, Han.

335
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,460
With what we saved up earlier,

336
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,220
we've got thirty-eight artifacts now.

337
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,130
Qingwen,

338
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,060
why not take all this

339
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,890
and run off now?

340
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,610
No can do.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,820
The barrier at the Tainan Bazaar

342
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,420
won't lift until the tournament is over.

343
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,340
We can't leave yet.

344
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,650
If those rogue cultivators

345
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,010
give up their treasures willingly,

346
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,820
that's ideal.

347
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,010
If not...

348
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,100
Don't worry, Sir!

349
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,300
If they won't,

350
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,220
I'll be the first to...

351
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:24,890
Yeah,

352
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,650
we won't spare them!

353
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,340
How many times do I have to say it?

354
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,700
Stop talking about fighting and killing

355
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,610
all the time!

356
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,250
Get up.

357
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,730
Yes, Sir.

358
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,060
Step back.

359
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,250
Li!

360
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,490
I finally found you!

361
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,100
What is it now?

362
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,980
I've got more talismans here.

363
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,770
I want to trade for more pills.

364
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,770
Would that be okay?

365
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,890
I've got Strength Boost Talismans,

366
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,650
and Freezing Talismans.

367
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,530
These are offensive.

368
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,300
These ones are defensive.

369
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,370
This Vajra Talisman is amazing!

370
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,580
It can block

371
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,820
a full-force strike from a tenth-level Qi Refiner!

372
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,300
What about this one?

373
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,250
This is a Thunderfire Talisman.

374
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,820
It hits with both lightning and fire at once.

375
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,010
Look!

376
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,180
Maybe...

377
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,220
I'll get you two brand new ones.

378
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,850
That's weird.

379
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,900
I followed the book's instructions exactly.

380
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,380
Li,

381
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,330
how about

382
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,530
these two?

383
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,770
I guarantee

384
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,940
they're top quality.

385
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,180
These two...

386
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,180
Miss Han,

387
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,090
why do you need pills so urgently?

388
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,090
I want to cure my brother's illness.

389
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,050
Sorry,

390
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,810
but your talismans

391
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,770
are not very useful

392
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,730
to me.

393
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,010
Still,

394
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,900
if you've got

395
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,010
cinnabar and talisman paper,

396
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,380
I might be interested.

397
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,810
You want to make talismans yourself?

398
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,940
Then you'll

399
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,900
definitely need this!

400
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,420
This one

401
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,530
is a Golden Bamboo Brush.

402
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,980
The tip

403
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,770
is made from the tail hair of a Level 2 demon beast.

404
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,940
The shaft

405
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,220
is forged from black iron mixed with refined gold.

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,090
It was crafted using secret techniques

407
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,220
by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

408
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,090
This is a must-have tool for talisman making!

409
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,010
A true rarity!

410
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,810
You're really selling it to me?

411
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,460
Honestly...

412
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,380
it's a family heirloom.

413
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,490
But as you can see,

414
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,180
I'm terrible

415
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,810
at making talismans.

416
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,530
So this brush

417
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,620
is pretty much wasted

418
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,570
on me.

419
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,620
How much are you asking?

420
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,420
Two bottles of pills.

421
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,330
How about that?

422
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,900
I'll even throw in

423
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,770
these talismans, ink,

424
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,010
and this Talisman Compendium.

425
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,620
[Talisman Compendium]

426
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,010
Deal.

427
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,980
Li!

428
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,660
I also have a Clear Stream Note.

429
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,620
It's got all sorts of funny stories

430
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,940
from the cultivation world.

431
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,810
I've read it already.

432
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,250
If you get bored,

433
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,250
maybe it'll help pass the time.

434
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,420
[Clear Stream Note]

435
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,810
I was hoping to learn more anyway.

436
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,050
Thanks.

"Anyone holding an Ascension Token

438
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,180
can skip testing and join a sect,

and even get a Foundation Pill."

440
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,010
What's an Ascension Token?

441
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,860
[Token]

442
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,090
Han!

443
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,180
Let's go check out the Tianwu Arena!

444
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,050
I heard

445
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,290
the sects have prepared

446
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,770
a bunch of rewards this time

447
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,090
to attract more participants.

448
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,220
The winner gets a Foundation Pill

449
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,770
and a ton of gems and techniques.

450
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,770
Xiaoshan,

451
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,050
I got a book

452
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,180
with all sorts of cultivation oddities.

453
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,620
Not sure if they're true.

454
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,140
Want to check it out together?

455
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,900
Sure!

456
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,050
Come over.

457
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,330
Clear Stream Note?

458
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,810
What's this?

459
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,940
Looks like

460
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,980
a token from some sect.

461
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,330
That's not just any token.

462
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,940
Look at the writing on it.

463
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,420
Ascension Token...

464
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,180
Ascension Token?

465
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,290
What's that?

466
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,800
The Ascension Token

467
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,530
is for...

468
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,010
They say...

469
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,570
Well, I heard,

470
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,770
if you hold

471
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,640
an Ascension Token,

472
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,700
you don't have to fight,

473
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,970
don't have to take the spirit root test,

474
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,940
you get straight into any of the Seven Sects.

475
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,530
Is that true?

476
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,570
Nonsense!

477
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,940
If that were true,

478
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,810
everyone would be fighting over this token.

479
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,570
Who'd bother risking their lives at the tournament?

480
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,980
Exactly.

481
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,570
Sounds like a made-up story.

482
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,420
Grandmaster,

483
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,530
you were right.

484
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,420
Several clan disciples

485
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,050
have reported their tokens stolen.

486
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,700
The Azure Vein Society never quit causing trouble,

487
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,900
even hit during the entrance test.

488
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,180
What should we do now?

489
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,220
So those rogue cultivators' missing

490
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,660
is really linked to them.

491
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,490
And now they're pinning it on the clan disciples.

492
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,980
Once the Tianwu Arena tournament ends,

493
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,980
let's arrest them all.

494
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,700
Yes, Grandmaster.

495
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,700
Looks like

496
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,090
this Ascension Token

497
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,490
is tied to Yellow Maple Valley.

498
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,420
Yellow Maple Valley...

499
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,140
They say it's one of the top sects

500
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,940
among the Seven.

501
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,700
What luck!

502
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,810
Nothing left to worry about now.

503
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,490
Charging in knowing you'll lose?

504
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,660
You think you're worthy of this Foundation Pill?

505
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,250
I've waited for this day

506
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,530
for decades.

507
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,290
You clan kid,

508
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,700
don't get cocky!

509
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,570
Who is this Qingwen?

510
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,010
Why does he have so many treasures?

511
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,140
Is Lu

512
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,220
about to lose?

513
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,810
No way.

514
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,980
He's just about to win.

515
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,490
Sir,

516
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,620
you went easy on me.

517
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,460
It's a test.

518
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,660
Don't take it too far.

519
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,090
He already admitted defeat.

520
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,380
Why try to kill him?

521
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,380
Grandmaster,

522
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,140
please forgive me.

523
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,620
I didn't realize

524
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,180
he had already surrendered.

525
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,180
You didn't realize

526
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,570
or was it because your opponent

527
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,180
was just some nameless rogue cultivator

528
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,460
and you didn't care?

529
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,140
Thank you, Grandmaster,

530
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,380
for standing up

531
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,490
for us rogue cultivators!

532
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,140
Yes!

533
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,090
Thank you for standing up for us!

534
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,490
Please stand up for us!

535
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,010
Please, we need your voice!

536
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm aware many rogue cultivators have gone missing lately.

537
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,700
Our Moonshadow Sect

538
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,940
will get to the bottom of it.

539
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,860
If anyone is found stirring up conflict

540
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,460
between rogues and clan disciples,

541
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,860
disrupting the order of the cultivation world,

542
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,140
I will not show mercy.

543
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,330
Lu Mingyuan

544
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,050
wins!

545
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,730
Receives one Foundation Pill!

546
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,860
Senior Lu is amazing!

547
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,140
You've got the Foundation Pill!

548
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,050
A cultivator's strength

549
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,530
doesn't just depend on spirit roots,

550
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,330
but also on artifacts,

551
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,460
talismans,

552
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,490
formations,

553
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,290
and pills.

554
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,700
Use everything you've got,

555
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,010
plan carefully before making a move.

556
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,250
Lay low, then explode.

557
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,900
Maybe...

558
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,250
this is the path meant for me.

559
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,140
But in the face of overwhelming strength,

560
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,290
all shortcuts

561
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,700
are doomed to fail.

562
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,730
- Congrats, Senior Lu! - Congrats, Senior Lu!

563
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,620
He got into Yellow Maple Valley too?

564
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,010
What are the odds!

565
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,250
Just one step...

566
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,420
I was just one step from victory!

567
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,700
Qingwen,

568
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,940
that guy's a genius

569
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,700
with a variant spirit root after all.

570
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,250
No need to go head-to-head with him.

571
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,250
We failed this time,

572
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,570
but there's always next time.

573
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,460
Next time?

574
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,180
You think chances like this come easy?

575
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,980
I told you,

576
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,660
we rogue cultivators are one big family.

577
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,770
Don't take it so hard.

578
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,290
Enough already.

579
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,420
You're making my heart ache.

580
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,140
Hey...

581
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,290
Listen, everyone.

582
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,770
Don't be so down.

583
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,180
I heard

584
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,090
if you find a certain item,

585
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,010
you can skip the tournament

586
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,770
and still get into the Seven Sects.

587
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,380
- What item? - What is it?

588
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,700
I think it's called...

589
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,420
the Ascension Token!

590
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,250
Ascension Token?

591
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,660
Ascension Token?

592
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,730
Sir,

593
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,180
I was about to ask you.

594
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,570
Do you know about the Ascension Token?

595
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,420
The Ascension Token

596
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,730
was created by the Seven Sects.

597
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,050
It was meant to reward

598
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,860
cultivation families who made great contributions.

599
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,730
It could be passed down for generations.

600
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,940
They say

601
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,860
anyone who holds one

602
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,220
can join any sect

603
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,330
without taking the test

604
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,220
and even get a Foundation Pill.

605
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,460
A Foundation Pill?

606
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,380
No test and a Foundation Pill?

607
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,940
That's amazing.

608
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,010
But this thing

609
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,180
hasn't shown up for centuries.

610
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,140
How do you even know about it?

611
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,530
I didn't know,

612
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,530
but Han...

613
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,940
He read about it in a book.

614
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,770
He asked you directly?

615
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,420
No...

616
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,810
Not really.

617
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,180
We were just casually chatting.

618
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,090
Where's Han Li now?

619
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,660
Why isn't he here?

620
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,620
Han Li...

621
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,050
He's not around.

622
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,490
Weren't you

623
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,050
always with him?

624
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,180
I don't really know him that well.

625
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,570
I think he already left.

626
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,140
He left?

627
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,730
But the barrier's still active.

628
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,010
Where could he go?

629
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,810
He...

630
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,810
I...

631
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,330
My stomach hurts!

632
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,770
I need a bathroom break!

633
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,900
Why'd he run off?

634
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,570
Is it really stomach pain?

635
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,940
You buying it?

636
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,140
Looks like

637
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,330
this trip to the Tainan Bazaar wasn't for nothing.

638
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,420
These treasures will really help my cultivation later on.

639
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,380
So what if I have a fake spirit root?

640
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,730
With this Ascension Token,

641
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,810
I've got nothing to worry about!

642
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,980
I'll just stay hidden till morning.

643
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,530
Once the barrier lifts,

644
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,620
I'll head straight

645
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,380
to Yellow Maple Valley.

646
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,250
He's there!

647
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,860
Hurry!

648
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,140
Stop!

649
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,290
Stop running!

650
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:33,940
Get him!

651
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,700
Stop!

652
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,460
Stop!

653
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,700
He's there!

654
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,570
Quick!

655
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,370
Han!

656
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,350
Han!

657
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,860
Han!

658
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,890
Han!

659
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,980
Han!

660
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,250
Xiaoshan!

661
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,010
Xiaoshan!

662
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,140
What happened?

663
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,530
Han...

664
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,050
Run!

665
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,770
Qingwen and his men are bad guys...

666
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm sorry...

667
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,810
I...

668
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,860
I got you

669
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,620
into trouble...

670
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,700
The Ascension Token

671
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,110
has been exposed.

672
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,380
Han!

673
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,700
Why are you running?

674
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,290
Stay and have a drink with us!

675
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,770
Nowhere to run now, huh?

676
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,810
You two,

677
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,530
why are you after me?

678
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,860
What do you think?

679
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,660
At this point,

680
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,770
Han,

681
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,730
you can drop the act.

682
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,530
Han,

683
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,530
you're being awfully selfish.

684
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,940
You got a treasure like the Ascension Token,

685
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,330
but won't even

686
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,730
let us take a look?

687
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,620
Ascension Token?

688
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,180
What is that?

689
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,420
Never heard of it!

690
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,300
In broad daylight,

691
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,490
you're trying to rob and kill someone.

692
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,740
Aren't you afraid the Seven Sects' punishment?

693
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,570
Enough talk.

694
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,300
Take him down first,

695
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,260
then search his body.

696
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,050
Where did he go?

697
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,690
Find him!

698
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,420
This won't work if it keeps up.

699
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,900
That Qingwen guy

700
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,420
is still hiding in the shadows.

701
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,260
Han,

702
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,690
I see you!

703
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,090
Stop hiding!

704
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,740
Come out!

705
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,210
A high-grade artifact!

706
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,530
Qingwen!

707
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,740
Help me!

708
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,780
Qingwen!

709
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,490
I knew you'd show up!

710
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,050
Wan Xiaoshan

711
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,740
was killed by you?

712
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,780
He was a good man.

713
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,260
But good men...

714
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,690
die too.

715
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,530
You lost your men too.

716
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,300
Why didn't you save them?

717
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,260
I had a feeling you had something up your sleeve.

718
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,090
So I let them go first.

719
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,010
Looks like I was right.

720
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,900
I get it now.

721
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,650
There are three of you,

722
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,210
but only one

723
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,490
Ascension Token.

724
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,050
You're a clever guy.

725
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,490
Pinggu and I go way back.

726
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,340
If this weren't about the path to ascension,

727
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,420
I wouldn't have let her die.

728
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,860
You really are a complete villain.

729
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,460
Han...

730
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,530
that Flying Sword Talisman

731
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,610
is your last trick, right?

732
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,420
What do you think?

733
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,050
This is Tainan Valley!

734
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,490
If you kill me here,

735
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,900
aren't you afraid you'll get caught?

736
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,260
You showed up out of nowhere,

737
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,010
clearly up to no good.

738
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,780
All I have to say is you snuck in here,

739
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,300
killed Wan Xiaoshan,

740
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,050
Wu Jiuzhi,

741
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,820
and Pinggu.

742
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,780
I'll kill you to avenge them.

743
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,940
Do you think the other rogues

744
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,690
will believe you,

745
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,760
or believe me?

746
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,690
Fine!

747
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,210
Then,

748
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,860
I'll use the token as bait.

749
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,740
Whoever kills you,

750
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,090
gets it!

751
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:29,980
You!

752
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,050
You'd throw your life away

753
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,570
over a token?

754
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,570
You're still young.

755
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,570
You don't understand what this means

756
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,420
to us rogue cultivators...

757
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,590
[Ice Demoness]

758
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,090
Who's there?

759
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,940
So, you're Daoist Qingwen?

760
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,650
Looks like you're dying.

761
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,210
But my master said

762
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,650
you can't die just yet.

763
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,650
Which means...

764
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,940
he'll have to die instead.

765
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,860
What stage is that guy in?

766
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,300
I can't even track his movements.

767
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,400
If I get caught,

768
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,210
I'm dead for sure.

769
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,010
I have to run!

770
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,210
Who are you, sir?

771
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,610
You founded the Azure Vein Society?

772
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,050
Interesting...

773
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,690
I'm just trying to stay alive.

774
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,860
That guy earlier

775
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,010
had the real treasure.

776
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,050
If you can spare me,

777
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,490
I'll question him myself

778
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,940
and hand over the treasure!

779
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,460
Ascension Token?

780
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,900
A crumb tossed by the Seven Sects.

781
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,740
You call that a treasure?

782
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,260
Are you interested...

783
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,650
in becoming a Foundation Establishment cultivator?

784
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,210
Foundation...

785
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,130
Senior,

786
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,460
if you can help me

787
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,980
step into the Foundation Establishment stage,

788
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,380
I, Qingwen, will give my life

789
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,780
to repay you!

790
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,170
Senior...

791
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,050
Even on death's door,

792
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,170
you're still dreaming of that?

793
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,780
Please, help me!

794
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,610
Fine.

795
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,420
