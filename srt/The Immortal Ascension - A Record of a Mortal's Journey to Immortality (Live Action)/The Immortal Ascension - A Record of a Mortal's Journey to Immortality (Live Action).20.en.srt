Nichang,

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,100
why stop me from leading the disciples?

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,850
Do you really think if we don't fight back,

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,330
the demonic sects will spare us?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,540
Look at you.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,650
You're good at everything,

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,380
except knowing when to quit.

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,140
The Six Demonic Sects are too powerful.

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,900
We, the Seven Sects, can't compare.

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,420
Even if we give it our all,

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,620
we still won't stand a chance.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,370
Better to hold our ground

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,580
and preserve our strength.

38
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,620
They're after cultivation resources.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,740
They likely won't come after us.

40
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,530
Nichang,

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,090
if they take the Yue Kingdom

42
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,820
and start rounding up spirit-rooted mortals,

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,130
then what?

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,130
I don't know if that counts as resources,

45
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,330
but I do know

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,180
we can't just stand by.

47
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,330
Aren't you afraid that if we go too far,

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,730
some Nascent Soul elder will step in

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,370
and get someone you care about killed?

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,820
That won't happen.

51

Besides,

55
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,900
don't bother with worldly affairs.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,180
Since logic won't work, I'll just tell you.

59
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,860
The demonic sects run wild.

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,100
But do you know why none of the Nascent Soul elders

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,100
from the Seven Sects are stepping in?

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,210
Simple.

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,570

74

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,730
Mostly Foundation Establishment

190
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,490
and Qi Refining Stage cultivators.

191
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,050
Core Formation cultivators on both sides

192
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,170
seem to be staying out of it.

193
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,660
But sneak attacks,

194
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,460
duels,

195
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,900
and even assassinations

196
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,370
among disciples are nonstop.

197
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,660
All my seniors

198
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,220
fought in the big battle early this year.

199
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,930
Making it out alive

200
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,460
was no small feat.

201
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,100
To me,

202
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,980
this is a good chance

203
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,610
to stabilize my cultivation and sharpen my skills.

204
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,850
I even picked up some gems and artifacts.

205
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,370
But fighting like this,

206
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,780
will it really lead anywhere?

207
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,220
Remember the royal heirs

208
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,610
from the Jiang and Cheqi Kingdoms?

209
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,370
I've arranged a way out for them.

210
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,340
Now it's up to you

211
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,050
to escort them somewhere safe.

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,980
Where are we taking them?

213
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,340
To the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

214
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,810
So you already found an escape route for our sect?

215
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,580
Only moving forward

216
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,490
and never retreating,

217
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,020
that'll cost us dearly.

218
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,850
You think one step back leads to peace?

219
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,770
For the Seven Sects,

220
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,940
it means nothing but ruin.

221
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,980
Those old geezers

222
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,130
probably secured their own exit long ago.

223
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,820
It's just a shame

224
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,890
the ordinary disciples

225
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,650
are dying on the frontlines

226
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,010
for nothing.

227
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,340
Moonshadow Sect will survive

228
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,890
under the Sect Leader's guidance.

229
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,370
But me,

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,340
I'm just a noisy bird,

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,610
chirping away

232
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,890
yet unable to change anything.

233
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,180
I can't save anyone either.

234
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,130
Han Li...

235
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,650
I shouldn't be thinking of him.

236
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,850
Where did you run off to?

237
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,180
Where were you?

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,980
We're still in the middle of a war,

239
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,300
yet you lofty types

240
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,300
just vanish?

241
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,250
I've held this in for so long.

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,610
Since we'll never meet again,

243
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,460
I might as well get it off my chest.

244
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,060
You're finally willing to talk to me?

245
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,420
As long as you're willing to speak,

246
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,060
I don't care what it's about.

247
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,650
Before the war started,

248
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,730
the Seven Sects and the demonic sects

249
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,940
signed a secret deal.

250
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,770
Don't say stuff that sensitive out loud.

251
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,730
At this point,

252
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,700
the whole war is following that deal.

253
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,130
The Seven Sects surrendered.

254
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,850
Gave in before the fighting even started?

255
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,010
That's not like you.

256
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,180
The agreement states

257
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,490
only cultivators

258
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,610
below Nascent Soul can take part in this war.

259
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,650
Which means

260
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,530
I can't save everyone.

261
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,700
We low-level disciples

262
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,460
are still fighting like fools.

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,010
People die every day.

264
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,420
And you already knew how it would end?

265
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,220
It's just not fair!

266
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,340
War isn't a game for low-level disciples,

267
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,130
yet they always pay the price.

268
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,220
Three hundred years I've lived,

269
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,250
and I still don't understand it.

270
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,700
It's pathetic.

271
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,010
Don't cry.

272
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,770
You did nothing wrong.

273
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,340
I couldn't stop it.

274
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,730
I couldn't stop anything.

275
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,890
Don't cry.

276
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,490
I'm here.

277
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,490
Where are you?

278
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,770
Right here.

279
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,060
Right here?

280
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,850
Grandmaster,

281
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,340
you haven't moved for three days.

282
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,060
Are we almost there?

283
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,890
One hour to Golden Drum Plains.

284
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,340
Elder Chen,

285
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,420
this stuff

286
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,530
was left behind

287
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,170
by the Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator

288
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,460
that we three took down today.

289
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,100
He was cunning,

290
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,770
and almost got away.

291
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,580
Luckily,

292
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,460
the three of us

293
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,580
worked seamlessly together.

294
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,420
That's right.

295
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,850
We just got lucky,

296
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,940
finding one traveling alone.

297
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,180
Last time I went solo,

298
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,010
I had to take on several demonic cultivators.

299
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,460
This is our first time here.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,890
Let's all keep a low profile.

301
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,530
Why is she everywhere?

302
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,980
Han Li!

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,610
Long time no see!

304
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,650
Han Li,

305
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,420
did you bring me another round of generous gifts?

306
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,820
Nice job.

307
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,010
In just three days,

308
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,400
you crushed five Qi Refining ones,

309
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,420
and a Foundation Establishment one,

310
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,700
all from the toughest Demonic Flame Sect.

311
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,130
Here,

312
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,340
this is your merit jade slip.

313
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,420
Are you using your war credits

314
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,980
to trade for ancient texts again?

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,610
Appreciate it.

316
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,460
Han,

317
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,250
long time no word from you.

318
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,460
Didn't expect to see you here.

319
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,580
It's been years, Senior Chen.

320
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,940
Hope you've been well.

321
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,300
You too.

322
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,850
Your cultivation's clearly come a long way.

323
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,980
Congrats

324
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,130
on taking down a Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator.

325
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,300
I just got lucky.

326
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,980
At least I didn't come back empty-handed.

327
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,650
That's the second time

328
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,300
I've taken down someone at my level.

329
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:31,980
Congrats.

330
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,850
I've got things to do.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,490
Excuse me.

332
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,730
Why do I feel like

333
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,010
Han Li's not the same guy

334
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,980
he used to be?

335
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,060
Feels like

336
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,770
he looks down on us now.

337
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,190
Well, he's following Mentor Li now.

338
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,460
Of course he won't bother with us.

339
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,060
Mentor Li

340
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,300
has always taken in

341
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,890
those rootless disciples like him.

342
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,890
Weird old man.

343
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,850
Enough already.

344
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,420
Where are your manners?

345
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,100
I didn't mean it like that.

346
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,340
I just meant

347
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,490
that the guy

348
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,180
was acting all high and mighty.

349
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,610
But he's no different from us,

350
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,980
just killed

351
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,610
a Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator.

352
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,210
What's there to brag about?

353
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,460
Here's your war credit record.

354
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,940
Take it and go.

355
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,130
You're just making a scene.

356
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,460
Elder Chen,

357
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,530
you're a Chen family elder.

358
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,490
Why are you treating outsiders

359
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,650
better than us?

360
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,770
Don't tell me

361
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,100
he killed a Core Formation cultivator?

362
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,060
Don't be ridiculous.

363
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,460
He clearly took out

364
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,220
someone on our level.

365
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,220
Then,

366
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,060
why are you all warm smiles to him?

367
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,420
And cold glares to us?

368
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,340
That's Han Li's

369
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,650
seventeenth

370
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,980
Foundation Establishment-level kill.

371
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,530
His war record is outstanding.

372
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,460
Seventeen kills?

373
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,010
No way!

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,890
You three just got your second one,

375
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,730
and it took all three of you.

376
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,340
Still yapping?

377
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,250
Thick-skinned, aren't you?

378
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,460
Bro...

379
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,890
No way.

380
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,220
Qiaoqian,

381
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,010
if you ask me,

382
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,460
Han Li's got solid skills

383
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,850
and knows when to hold back.

384
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,100
He's got a bright future.

385
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,010
If you've got any ties

386
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,130
to him,

387
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,890
don't let go.

388
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,850
Recruit more talents like him.

389
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,700
They'll be a great asset

390
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,930
to our family.

391
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,180
Got it, Elder Chen.

392
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,100
I haven't even tried out the high-grade furnace

393
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,610
I traded for last time.

394
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,100
Time to give it a go.

395
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,770
Lust Powder...

396
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,420
Soul-Stealing Incense...

397
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,940
What twisted demonic recipes!

398
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,130
Ageless Pill?

399
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,250
Keeping you young

400
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,370
and never aging.

401
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,100
Now that one

402
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,300
may be worth a try.

403
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,010
Han.

404
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,810
It's much easier to talk like this.

405
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,090
Congrats.

406
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,330
You've earned a mountain of war credits.

407
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,770
I'm genuinely envious.

408
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,470
If I remember right,

409
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,490
we joined the sect around the same time.

410
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,090
But in terms of cultivation,

411
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,530
you're way ahead of me now.

412
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,140
Still regarding you as my junior

413
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,810
feels a bit off, doesn't it?

414
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,180
It's fine.

415
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,180
I'm used to it anyway.

416
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,220
Once you break through again,

417
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,730
then I can change it.

418
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,140
Call me however you like, Senior.

419
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,980
I don't mind.

420
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,980
Did you need something here?

421
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,420
Han,

422
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,090
are you aware

423
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,980
of our Chen family's standing?

424
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,700
I'd like to invite you

425
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,330
to serve as our guest elder.

426
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,460
Here's the deposit.

427
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,570
You'll also get annual tribute later on.

428
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,140
Senior, I can't accept that.

429
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,860
My cultivation is still low,

430
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,220
and my talent's poor.

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,730
Even though

432
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,330
I've reached Foundation Establishment by sheer luck with fake spirit roots,

433
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,420
if anything major

434
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,620
comes up,

435
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,010
I may drag

436
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,140
your clan down.

437
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,250
Senior Chen,

438
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,140
I don't think I'm qualified

439
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,770
to serve as a guest elder.

440
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,420
And I can't accept

441
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,770
these gems.

442
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,290
Wait, it's her?

443
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,810
Han.

444
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,770
Take it.

445
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,330
You should keep it!

446
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,050
I really can't.

447
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,140
Just keep it!

448
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,490
Young Master,

449
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,330
you're truly wise and valiant,

450
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,140
brilliant beyond compare,

451
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,050
sharp-eyed and strategic,

452
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,810
always scheming,

453
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,810
meticulously plotting...

454
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,940
Shut your mouth.

455
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,940
Any news on that person?

456
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,290
Reporting, Young Master.

457
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,490
He's gone.

458
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,290
Gone?

459
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,490
Gone!

460
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,180
Well, I mean,

461
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,250
who knows exactly where he's gone!

462
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,730
No need to worry, Young Master.

463
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,490
I'm not worried?

464
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,010
Then you're going to worry for me?

465
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,090
What's beyond the sea?

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,730
Aren't you curious?

467
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,900
The world across the sea?

468
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,490
I've looked into it for ages,

469
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,090
but I still can't figure out

470
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,460
where that array leads.

471
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,620
He's over there.

472
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,530
Han!

473
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,250
We're here!

474
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,050
Han!

475
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,900
Impressive!

476
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,730
Seniors,

477
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,380
it's been

478
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,330
a while.

479
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,330
Who says we missed you?

480
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,420
Han,

481
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,290
if you've got no feelings

482
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,250
for Dong Xuan'er,

483
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,810
then let her go to Wu Xuan.

484
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,570
You idiot.

485
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,620
You can't "let go" of someone you like.

486
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,490
Han,

487
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,140
don't blame him.

488
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,620
He's upset

489
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
probably because

490
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,940
Xuan'er gave him

491
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,090
the cold shoulder.

492
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,810
Dong's here too?

493
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,770
Xuan'er told me

494
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,290
not to tell you.

495
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,420
She's been grounded

496
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,530
by Mentor Hongfu for quite a while now.

497
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,140
Why'd you suddenly bring her up?

498
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,530
Weiniang,

499
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,330
stop teasing fellow disciples.

500
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,530
Han,

501
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,770
it's not just us who came,

502
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,380
our master is here at Golden Drum Plains too.

503
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,010
He's looking for you right now.

504
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,900
Senior,

505
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,090
did Master mention

506
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,900
the reason?

507
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,010
Not exactly.

508
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,420
He just said it's something important.

509
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,730
You'd better go.

510
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,460
Even someone like Master, a Core Formation cultivator,

511
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,940
came here personally to hold the line.

512
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,140
And he brought so many elite disciples too.

513
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,090
Looks like things here

514
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,490
are getting worse.

515
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,620
This place won't stay safe for long.

516
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,220
I need to start planning ahead.

517
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,620
Young Master, your concerns are perfectly valid!

518
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:10,770
Stupid rock!

519
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,390
Evil rock!

520
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,090
You tripped our Young Master again...

521
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,660
Get over here!

522
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:14,930
Young Master,

523
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,010
let's pull back.

524
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,660
We've already captured a few

525
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,730
from the Seven Sects.

526
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,460
We may get

527
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,140
that brat's location out of them.

528
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,290
It's her...

529
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,490
It really is you!

530
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,900
What a coincidence.

531
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,220
Look,

532
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,980
of all the places,

533
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,730
we ran into each other.

534
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,900
You're really here for me?

535
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,620
Let me take a good look at you.

536
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,810
Don't give me that look.

537
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,860
Your enchantment doesn't work on me anymore.

538
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,810
Let me really get a good look.

539
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,010
Not bad.

540
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,620
Really not bad.

541
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,220
"Yun"...

542
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,010
Isn't it funny

543
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,420
how good my instincts are?

544
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,050
From the moment I saw you,

545
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,330
everything clicked!

546
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,180
Why aren't you saying anything?

547
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,220
Oh, yes.

548
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,660
Speak up.

549
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,680
You freak,

550
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,620
drop your spell and let me go now!

551
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,140
Wow, that mouth of yours.

552
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,660
Who are you calling a freak?

553
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,330
Technically,

554
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,220
you should call me cousin, you know?

555
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,180
Back at Yan Clan Stronghold,

556
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,980
if that guy hadn't shown up,

557
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,460
I would've already claimed you.

558
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,290
Who wants to be family with a freak like you?

559
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,730
My master is Fairy Hongfu,

560
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,610
the top Core Formation cultivator in Yellow Maple Valley!

561
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,180
Hold up...

562
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,050
Fairy Hongfu?

563
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,420
She's your master?

564
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,220
Guess I hit a nerve.

565
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,420
So Fairy Hongfu

566
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,520
never told you about him?

567
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,290
She said nothing,

568
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,810
but still had you wear this.

569
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,330
That means,

570
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,620
after all these years,

571
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,420
she still can't forget him.

572
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,620
She really had something with that guy.

573
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,660
What are you mumbling about?

574
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,490
I don't understand a word.

575
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,180
Let me go already!

576
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,980
No can do.

577
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,620
Joyful Union Sect

578
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,570
owed Ghost Spirit Sect a big favor.

579
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,140
What exactly are you planning?

580
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,180
Taking you to meet your kin.

581
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,010
Let's go.

582
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,530
Let me go!

583
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,290
You freak!

584
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,420
Where are you taking me?

585
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,570
Wangyu,

586
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,530
you're such a shameless rip-off!

587
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,420
Your Treasure House

588
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:09,620
Throwing your weight around!

589
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,420
has branches everywhere,

590
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,700
yet you're squeezing us

591
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,220
over a few war credits?

592
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,140
Also,

593
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,980
that Freezing Talisman?

594
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,050
Come on,

595
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,860
that thing's everywhere!

596
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,010
It's barely worth two gems!

597
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,490
Two gems!

598
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,570
You know how much he charged?

599
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,460
Twenty!

600
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,090
See that?

601
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,250
Total rip-off!

602
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,860
See what you've done?

603
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,050
Who's the rip-off?

604
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,730
Say that again?

605
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,050
We're at war.

606
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,530
Gems are in short supply.

607
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,330
Prices had to go up.

608
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,860
That takes money.

609
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:40,980
Moving supplies

610
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,460
to the front?

611
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,770
That takes money too.

612
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,620
Even the demonic sects

613
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,380
come to my shop

614
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,330
to snatch up supplies.

615
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,010
We're way past talking about just cost price.

616
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,330
You two get that?

617
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,290
Get it?

618
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,090
You blockheads.

619
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,420
Hey,

620
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,900
you...

621
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,460
Easy for you to say!

622
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,940
Besides,

623
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,810
you're using war merits to trade for my stuff.

624
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,220
You said

625
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,250
you'll pay up

626
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,700
after beating the demonic sects.

627
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,180
Who's buying that crap?

628
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,900
We'll settle it...

629
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,220
Yeah? When?

630
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,180
In the next lifetime?

631
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,730
So yes,

632
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,220
I run a proper business.

633
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,570
Fair trade.

634
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,620
And now I'm asking you two,

635
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,330
do you get it?

636
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,250
Get it.

637
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,050
Why can't we ever win an argument with him?

638
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,530
You never do.

639
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,940
I just didn't bring my A game today.

640
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,770
A game?

641
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,810
You've got

642
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,650
such a clumsy mouth,

643
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,770
and you think you can out-argue me?

644
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,090
You've got guts!

645
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,810
Hey!

646
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,570
Forget it!

647
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,330
Wait!

648
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,290
Fine.

649
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,750
Business is business.

650
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,660
But doesn't the bond we share

651
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,770
mean more than that?

652
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,730
Ugh, why did you spit?

653
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,160
What's with the attitude?

654
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,660
Have you forgotten?

655
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,520
Back when

656
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,880
Treasure House first opened,

657
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,140
we were the ones

658
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,220
who helped fund it!

659
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,940
Exactly!

660
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,530
You're being ungrateful!

661
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,220
And another thing.

662
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,770
Hongfu!

663
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,380
Why are you just staring?

664
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,860
We're talking to you!

665
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,050
If she hadn't given you

666
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,050
those two Foundation Pills back then,

667
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,860
could you have broken through?

668
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,810
- Exactly! - Yeah.

669
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,700
We agreed that helping fellow disciples comes first.

670
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,900
Money comes second!

671
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,820
- And now... - Yeah!

672
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,290
You've really changed!

673
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,860
Exactly!

674
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,940
Totally changed!

675
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,620
Not completely rotten.

676
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,380
You've got a point.

677
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,220
So,

678
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,860
you...

679
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,660
you can't forget your promise, right?

680
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,090
Am I right?

681
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,900
Your promise!

682
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,530
What happened to your promise?

683
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,700
I lost everything on this.

684
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,700
And you're still talking promises?

685
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,730
You really have the nerve to talk about promises?

686
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,050
Back then,

687
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,770
I couldn't even afford pills.

688
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,330
I got stuck at Foundation Establishment,

689
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,810
while you two

690
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,290
made it to the Core Formation Stage.

691
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,490
Core Formation cultivators like you

692
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,330
don't understand

693
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,420
what low-level cultivators

694
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,900
have to go through.

695
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,420
Speak only when

696
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,730
you know the struggle.

697
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:58,980
Understand?

698
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,180
Or not?

699
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,090
No!

700
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,570
You dare say you've suffered as a low-level cultivator?

701
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,460
I do.

702
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,730
Add up everything you own!

703
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,050
You're richer

704
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,770
than all of Yellow Maple Valley!

705
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,530
That's mine.

706
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,270
Enough to buy two Clear Void Sects!

707
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,290
Exactly!

708
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,480
Look at you,

709
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,490
"exactly," huh?

710
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,760
Figure out a way

711
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,010
or give it up.

712
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,700
Oh yeah!

713
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,530
I can't take it anymore. And you?

714
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,530
I've been done with him!

715
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,570
Fine.

716
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,980
Today,

717
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,330
I am going to bully you.

718
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,280
I'll show you

719
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,330
what real hardship feels like

720
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,330
for a cultivator!

721
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,660
Core crushing Foundation!

722
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,570
- Get back here! - Come taste the hardship!

723
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,620
- Core crushing Foundation! - Stop right there!

724
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,400
Don't run!

725
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,300
Core crushing Foundation!

726
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,180
Quit running! Face me!

727
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,050
Where's your honor?

728
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,700
Enough!

729
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,250
Huayuan,

730
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,900
show some dignity.

731
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,140
Hongfu's right.

732
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,730
Dignity matters.

733
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,730
- She meant you! - She meant both of you.

734
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,860
Fine, we won't bully you.

735
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,730
How about a little friendly match?

736
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,190
If we win,

737
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,010
you give us those supplies

738
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,250
at half price.

739
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,250
What kind of match?

740
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,290
Mahjong?

741
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,860
Wait.

742
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,250
Are we still using

743
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,220
that same old set?

744
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:18,980
No, not anymore.

745
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,900
Good.

746
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,460
This one's even better.

747
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,700
It's made from a Tier 4 beast shell,

748
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,810
expertly crafted

749
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,050
over six months

750
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,700
by our sect's top artisan.

751
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,860
Not only insanely durable,

752
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,090
but also

753
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,490
completely blocks spirit sense detection.

754
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,140
That's amazing!

755
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,380
But...

756
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,980
I just did a little divining.

757
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,660
Today's not my lucky day.

758
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,460
I'll lose.

759
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,140
Sorry.

760
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,050
I'm off now.

761
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,620
Hey, Fu Yunzi!

762
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,700
Fu Yunzi!

763
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,900
We're one short!

764
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,810
How are we supposed to play mahjong like this?

765
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,490
Bad hand!

766
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,180
You always win. What are you running from?

767
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,770
- He's always like this. - Bad hand!

768
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,860
And you'd sided with him

769
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,620
against me!

770
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,570
Why?

771
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,530
Don't even bring him up.

772
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,420
You're worse than he is!

773
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,570
All right then.

774
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:05,980
Let's play.

775
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,460
We're still one short. How?

776
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,570
Wait, it's him?

777
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:14,900
My name

778
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,490
is Wangyu,

779
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,220
the shopkeeper of Treasure House.

780
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,570
You can call me

781
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,700
Li Feiyu.

782
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,490
With all the disguise I wore that day

783
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,090
and using the name Li Feiyu,

784
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,660
he probably won't recognize me.

785
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,090
I'd better go.

786
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,460
Kid!

787
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,810
Get over here!

788
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,660
Forgot how to play already?

789
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,220
You even know how to play?

790
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,730
Once we start, I'll use Telepathy.

791
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,220
Just pass me whatever tile I want.

792
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,330
- Master... - Let's go.

793
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,570
We've got all four now.

794
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,380
Greetings, Mentor Hongfu.

795
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,330
This is my disciple.

796
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,530
My name is Han Li,

797
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,620
"Li" as in setting up a monument.

798
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,330
This is Wangyu,

799
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,140
"Wang" as in forgetting.

800
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,700
He's the owner of Treasure House.

801
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,010
Enough talk.

802
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,660
We've got four now.

803
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,570
Deal's still on.

804
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,330
If I win,

805
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,620
sell me those talismans at half price.

806
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,460
Go ahead!

807
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,090
Shuffle the tiles!

808
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,380
Xuan'er?

809
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,250
Xuan'er?

810
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,460
Xuan'er?

811
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,090
Senior Wu!

812
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,220
Have you seen Xuan'er?

813
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,220
I'm looking for her.

814
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:29,980
No.

815
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,250
It's from Xuan'er...

816
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:45,980
Too bad.

817
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,730
Pung!

818
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,010
Chow!

819
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,090
Han Li,

820
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,250
it's only been a year,

821
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,420
and you're already at Mid Foundation Stage?

822
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,050
Your cultivation

823
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,490
has grown this fast.

824
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,180
You flatter me, Mentor.

825
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,620
It was pure luck.

826
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,010
I got my hands on a few enhancement pills.

827
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,810
However,

828
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,530
my foundation's still unstable.

829
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,700
I've got to keep training hard.

830
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,620
See? I told you

831
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,140
this kid's lucky,

832
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,140
knows how to pick his moments.

833
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,900
He's just like me,

834
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,050
matured and composed.

835
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,050
- Draw. - Why are you laughing?

836
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,090
Oh...

837
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,420
That's not true.

838
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,570
What's that supposed to mean?

839
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,810
Just saying luck alone already makes him

840
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,050
better than you.

841
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,420
Much better.

842
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,940
Hu! (Winning call)

843
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,940
You rip-off!

844
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,180
Can't you give it a rest?

845
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,580
How are you winning again?

846
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,040
The three of you keep passing tiles,

847
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,730
passing and passing!

848
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,620
Aren't you done messing around?

849
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,250
You think I can't see that?

850
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,420
Who passed tiles?

851
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,380
Who did that?

852
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,420
Come on,

853
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,030
deal the next round!

854
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,380
We didn't even get the price down.

855
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,330
You're not going anywhere!

856
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,140
Just for saving a few gems,

857
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,010
you really don't value your life, huh?

858
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,090
I can't just back out now!

859
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,810
Fine! Half price!

860
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,090
What?

861
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,570
No joke?

862
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,330
Half price for you.

863
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,380
Seriously?

864
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,530
You better not go back on your word!

865
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,220
Go back on what?

866
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,010
I said half!

867
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,620
You'll get half off!

868
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,160
Now that's more like it.

869
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,960
Using Telepathy, huh?

870
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,810
You're way too obvious with the cheating.

871
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,810
Honestly,

872
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,860
I kind of envy you.

873
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,940
I may be a Core Formation cultivator now,

874
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,010
but I still can't act on every whim or desire, or make peace with myself.

875
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,090
What's the point

876
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,250
of all this cultivation

877
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,770
if I can't follow my heart?

878
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,700
Look at you,

879
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,090
all that sighing

880
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,940
and glooming around.

881
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,860
What's the point?

882
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,140
Focus on something real.

883
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,420
Your feelings for Hongfu

884
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,490
are written all over your face.

885
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,420
Even louder than that Telepathy of yours!

886
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,010
You should go after her!

887
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,180
Chase hard!

888
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,850
Who knows when we'll get another round like this?

889
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,010
Maybe centuries from now.

890
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,220
All right.

891
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,570
I'm off.

892
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,430
Keep your eyes open

893
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,050
on the battlefield.

894
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,980
I said I'm leaving.

895
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,460
Aren't you going to see me off?

896
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,300
You already got the price down.

897
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,380
What's left to see off?

898
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,300
Take care, then!

899
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,460
You old gambling addict.

900
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,780
Mentor.

901
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,740
Master asked me to see you off on his behalf.

902
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,900
I won't let you leave empty-handed.

903
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,300
Here.

904
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,090
This is

905
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,570
a VIP token for Treasure House.

906
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,940
With this,

907
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,380
any treasure in our shops,

908
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,940
you get 10% off.

909
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,940
Thank you, Mentor!

910
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:34,980
Look at me.

911
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,690
Li Feiyu!

912
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,460
I didn't expect this.

913
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,530
You already reached Mid Foundation Establishment

914
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,090
after all these years apart?

915
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,150
Not bad at all.

916
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,980
Still, in cultivation,

917
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,050
you can't rush the process.

918
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,130
You have to

919
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,940
lay a solid foundation.

920
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,210
No worries.

921
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,300
Who doesn't have a few secrets?

922
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,300
Next time you come across rare spirit herbs,

923
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,610
always trade with me.

924
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,010
Old gambling addict!

925
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,570
It's my first time meeting your disciple today.

926
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,010
I actually like him!

927
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,050
Following you around won't get him far.

928
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,170
Why not let him

929
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,690
work in my shop as an apprentice?

930
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,460
What do you say?

931
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,530
You rip-off!

932
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,130
Now you're trying to poach my disciple?

933
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,090
Get lost!

934
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,740
Don't let me see your face again!

935
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,900
So stingy!

936
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,340
That Wangyu guy

937
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,340
is really shameless.

938
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,530
Core beating Foundation?

939
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,490
Weaker or not, I'd still beat him.

940
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,820
The worst part is,

941
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,380
he had the nerve to hide behind you!

942
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:50,980
Seriously!

943
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,530
All I know is,

944
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,940
if I drag him to the mahjong table,

945
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,090
he's going down!

946
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,980
Wake up!

947
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,740
Who lost?

948
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,010
It was the three of us who lost!

949
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,050
He gave us a discount.

950
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,170
He's the real loser.

951
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,780
That guy's got heart.

952
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,490
He didn't have to do that.

953
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,980
Right!

954
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:08,980
That rip-off

955
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,530
was pretty decent this time.

956
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,740
With this new batch of supplies,

957
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,570
our disciples' survival rate will go way up.

958
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,170
Exactly.

959
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,610
Even basic Freezing Talismans

960
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,820
can save a life in the right moment.

961
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,170
Yeah!

962
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,380
So we owe him big now.

963
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,300
And you didn't even bother to see him off?

964
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,570
I tried.

965
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,530
He wouldn't let me.

966
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,340
And you just gave up?

967
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,570
Next time we see him

968
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,980
may be centuries from now.

969
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,940
You said that too?

970
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,090
That's exactly what he said.

971
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,170
Who knows how many centuries until the next game?

972
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,650
Can you all stop saying stuff like that?

973
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,570
It just

974
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,260
doesn't sit right.

975
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,740
Let's hope

976
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,860
the war ends soon.

977
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:44,860
Then,

978
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,340
we can invite Wangyu

979
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,460
and Fu Yunzi

980
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,780
to Yellow Maple Valley

981
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,570
for a proper gathering.

982
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,130
Sounds good.

983
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,170
You're agreeing?

984
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,610
Of course I am!

985
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,260
That sneaky brat Wangyu,

986
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,940
seriously!

987
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,420
He had the nerve to say

988
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,780
my feelings were louder than the Telepathy.

989
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,740
Feelings?

990
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,050
What feelings can you possibly have?

991
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,460
What feelings?

992
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,420
I've only ever had one feeling.

993
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,210
Then I already know.

994
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,300
You do?

995
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,740
Achieve true peace.

996
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,300
Something like that.

997
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,130
Master!

998
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,140
Master!

999
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,860
- What is it? - Bad news!

1000
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,650
Why the panic?

1001
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,570
Master, Mentor,

1002
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,380
I found this on the battlefield.

1003
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,640
It's Xuan'er's hair ribbon!

1004
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,860
What's going on?

1005
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,650
She left this morning alone,

1006
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,460
and didn't let me follow her.

1007
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,530
Several hours passed,

1008
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,340
and she still hadn't returned.

1009
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,170
I went looking,

1010
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,380
and found her ribbon.

1011
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,420
That area

1012
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,340
had demonic sect activity.

1013
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,570
We can't let Xuan'er fall into his hands.

1014
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,420
I'm going after her!

1015
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,040
I'll come with you!

1016
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,170
No! You can't!

1017
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:52,940
Stay and hold the line!

1018
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,130
Then...

1019
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,940
if you need backup, send word right away!

1020
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,340
- Don't just stand there. Go with her! - Yes, sir!

1021
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,650
Did you see Wangyu off?

1022
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,650
He's gone.

1023
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,420
Did he say anything?

1024
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,650
He said he'd miss you all.

1025
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,130
That's it?

1026
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,050
Oh, and he gave me a token.

1027
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,170
With it,

1028
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,010
we can get 10% off.

1029
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,420
Let me see.

1030
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,420
Stingy guy.

1031
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,460
Only 10%?

1032
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,780
Just keep it.

1033
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,540
Anyway, I called you here

1034
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,210
for something else.

1035
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,090
I need you to go to the capital.

1036
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,650
The capital?

1037
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,300
Yes.

1038
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,090
Back when I was your age,

1039
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,260
I had a senior brother

1040
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,460
who once saved my life.

1041
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,300
But sadly,

1042
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,170
he died during a trial.

1043
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,420
He left behind a son with no spirit root,

1044
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,380
just a mortal.

1045
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,530
I swore an oath

1046
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,490
to ensure that his family line

1047
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,690
would always live in wealth and peace.

1048
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,780
Now,

1049
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,650
they've since settled in the capital.

1050
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,570
It should be the fourth generation by now.

1051
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,980
Ordinarily, mortal affairs are untouched

1052
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,380
by cultivation wars.

1053
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,610
But this time is different.

1054
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,570
The demonic sects have already attacked

1055
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,170
Jiang and Cheqi Kingdoms.

1056
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,340
I'm afraid

1057
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,050
they'll target

1058
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,900
the secular world in Yue next.

1059
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,050
And if I recall,

1060
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,340
you're from Yue Kingdom, right?

1061
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,740
Master,

1062
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,820
I once made a mistake in cultivation,

1063
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,010
and lost some of my memory.

1064
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,460
I truly don't remember

1065
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,650
where I was born.

1066
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,610
Everyone in the cultivation world

1067
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,650
has secrets of their own.

1068
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,090
No need to explain too much.

1069
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,940
Just like your origins,

1070
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,490
I've never asked about.

1071
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,380
Right?

1072
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,570
All I'm asking

1073
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,420
is for you to go to the capital in my place.

1074
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,300
If the demonic sects

1075
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,490
make a move,

1076
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,780
I want you

1077
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,570
to protect that family.

1078
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,610
Heading to Yue's interior

1079
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,860
is a great chance to withdraw from the war.

1080
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,210
A chance worth taking.

1081
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,490
Here's the Qin family genealogy.

1082
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,050
Take it.

1083
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,940
This is a personal favor.

1084
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,780
Our sect forbids interference

1085
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,690
in mortal affairs.

1086
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,820
You understand what I mean.

1087
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,900
Yes, Master.

1088
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,170
I'll carry out the task in secret.

1089
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,980
But...

1090
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,650
But right now,

1091
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,490
the Seven Sects are standing against the demonic sects.

1092
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,780
It's our time to fight for righteousness.

1093
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,900
What's this brat scheming now?

1094
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,940
He never acts without a motive.

1095
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,380
I still haven't spent all my war credits.

1096
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,650
Leaving now

1097
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,050
will mean a huge loss!

1098
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,650
I just won't feel right

1099
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,050
abandoning my post now.

1100
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,490
The Seven Sects are vast.

1101
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,780
Even if the battle gets bloody,

1102
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,380
they won't miss one Foundation Establishment cultivator.

1103
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,420
But Master,

1104
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,380
those demonic bastards are getting bolder.

1105
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,570
They think the Seven Sects are helpless!

1106
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,170
Enough!

1107
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,420
You're the most level-headed

1108
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,460
of my disciples.

1109
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,380
That's why I trust you with this task.

1110
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,210
It's settled.

1111
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,530
But honestly,

1112
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,860
I earned quite a bit of war credits

1113
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,050
at Golden Drum Plains.

1114
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,570
If I stay longer,

1115
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,090
I'll earn even more merits

1116
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,460
and trade them for great rewards.

1117
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,170
He really knows how to bargain

1118
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,260
at a time like this...

1119
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,900
Fine!

1120
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:27,860
Here's the deal.

1121
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,130
We'll consider

1122
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,860
this mission

1123
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,740
an official duty

1124
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,490
for the sect.

1125
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,340
As for your war credits,

1126
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,610
I'll handle it personally.

1127
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,690
You'll get your full share.

1128
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:36,490
Happy now?

1129
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,490
Master,

1130
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,660
you're so kind and generous,

1131
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:40,940
and you always keep your word.

1132
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,900
I won't let you down!

1133
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,300
Look at your little schemes.

1134
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,170
But I like that.

1135
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,570
That's why I trust you with this.

1136
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,610
I'll write a letter.

1137
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,820
Give it to the current head of the Qin family.

1138
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,900
If anyone asks you anything,

1139
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:01,940
don't explain.

1140
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,980
You've always been cautious.

1141
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,460
I don't need to say much more.

1142
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,170
Take this Telepathy Talisman.

1143
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:10,820

send me a message.

00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,090
Nangong of Moonshadow Sect

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,900
is passing through the area.

1147
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,900
I've already spoken to her.

1148
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,650
Take the Celestial Moon Ark with them.

1149
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,300
Act alongside them.

1150
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,460
It'll help you stay out of sight.

1151
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,130
