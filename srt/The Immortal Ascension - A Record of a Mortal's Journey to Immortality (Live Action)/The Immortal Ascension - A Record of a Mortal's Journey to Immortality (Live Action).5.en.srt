00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,180
But I study the Maiden Cycle Technique.

192
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,060
It requires me to be at peace.

193
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,700
I hate strife

194
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,250
so I must

195
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,340
leave to intervene.

196
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
You never listen to me.

197
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,220
The mortal affairs are the most potent venom.

198
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,180
Make sure you don't get too involved.

199
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,980
Don't worry, Nichang.

200
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,940
I'm planning

201
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,820
to visit the six other sects first.

202
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,980
Then,

203
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,620
I'll check if they are dark cultivators and demon sects roaming about.

204
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,570
I'll be back soon.

205
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,250
Do not forget

206
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,290
that we are to host

207
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,940
the next Immortal Ascension Trials.

208
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,220
Worry not, Nichang.

209
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,620
Cultivators

210
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,180
[Tainan Valley]
rarely appear in crowded places.

211
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,530
Where do they usually go?

212
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,860
Are there truly cultivators in Tainan Valley?

213
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,730
I want to see

214
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,770
what they see.

215
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,940
The valley a hundred li south of Jiayuan City

216
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,660
is shrouded by mists all year round.

217
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,220
According to the scroll, Tainan Valley

218
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,140
should be here.

219
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,420
[Wan Xiaoshan]

220
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,090
I am Wan Xiaoshan.

221
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,220
How may I address you?

222
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,570
Han Li.

223
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,530
Your name is Han Li, I see.

224
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,490
You're alone here.

225
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,140
You must be a rogue cultivator who wishes to enter Tainan Valley.

226
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,050
You know what?

227
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,220
Let's band up.

228
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,700
Band up?

229
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,460
Are you perhaps lost?

230
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,970
Han,

231
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,530
don't underestimate me.

232
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,380
Even though

233
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,420
I'm an elementary cultivator,

234
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,420
I know very well

235
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,980
how to get to Tainan Valley.

236
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,660
All right, then.

237
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,770
Let's travel together.

238
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,730
Lead the way.

239
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,770
Follow me.

240
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,530
What do you mean by a rogue cultivator?

241
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,530
Like us,

242
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,420
we do not belong to those seven sects like Moonshadow Sect

243
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,490
or hail from a cultivator clan like the Yans.

244
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,620
We cultivate alone

245
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,730
so we are the rogue cultivators.

246
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,420
He seems

247
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,660
to know quite a lot about cultivation.

248
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,660
Perhaps I can get more out of him.

249
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,570
Wan,

250
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,730
do you know of a way

251
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,460
to dispel the mist before us?

252
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,660
Han,

253
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,220
you must have only become a cultivator recently.

254
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,220
This misty barrier

255
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,770
only opens up once every 10 years.

256
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,860
If we can't enter the valley,

257
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,700
it means it is not the right moment yet.

258
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,530
Come.

259
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,770
Have some fruit.

260
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,090
They say

261
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,980
immortals do not eat rice.

262
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,770
They ingest wind and pebbles and drink morning dew.

263
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,940
That's not true then.

264
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,220
Only immortals

265
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,620
do that.

266
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,250
People like us

267
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,420
are called cultivators.

268
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,700
Immortals

269
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,620
live as long as the universe.

270
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,770
They live as long as the universe?

271
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,380
No wonder Physician Mo did everything to become one.

272
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,420
But considering our current cultivation progress,

273
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,940
we can only live a century at most.

274
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,900
That's not bad already.

275
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,810
It's open!

276
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,090
Wan.

277
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,810
Wan?

278
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,010
Come in.

279
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,180
Check out this Glacial Sword.

280
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,860
- Check out this Glacial Sword. - Advanced Ice Talisman.

281
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,460
Three gems for one talisman.

282
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,570
Check this out.

283
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,730
Wan,

284
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,660
this is...

285
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,460
This is Tainan Bazaar.

286
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,700
It

287
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,700
lasts for three days.

288
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,490
We're lucky

289
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,420
to run into its opening.

290
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,460
This is a fair price already.

291
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,730
20 gems.

292
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,900
Come. Take a look.

293
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,460
Come.

294
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,220
A century-old ironcoil snake.

295
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,330
It took me a lot to catch it.

296
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,660
Glacial Sword!

297
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,220
Check out my Glacial Sword.

298
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,090
20 gems for one.

299
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,050
Talisman.

300
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,010
Do you want any?

301
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,530
Take a look.

302
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,380
- Come. - Come take a look.

303
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,140
My friend,

304
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,490
come browse my wares.

305
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,700
- Come. - Advanced Ice...

306
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,940
Advanced Ice Talisman for three gems only.

307
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,940
Common items like these aren't very useful.

308
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,090
They are common?

309
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,250
You need gems to buy them. Do you have any?

310
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,490
Besides,

311
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,900
it's a rip-off.

312
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,900
Are gems

313
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,180
the currency

314
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,180
among cultivators?

315
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,660
Come on, Han.

316
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,810
As the name

317
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,660
suggests,

318
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,330
a gem is a stone filled with spiritual aura.

319
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,220
A good gem

320
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,090
is transparent and bright.

321
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,900
You can use it as a source of light.

322
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,140
This is already a very fair price.

323
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,570
Mine is not as good,

324
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,660
but it's

325
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,900
good enough to provide energy

326
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,980
for an array or to restore your spiritual power

327
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,810
after a battle.

328
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,090
Another rogue cultivator.

329
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,770
How many has it been?

330
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,250
Grandmaster,

331
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,290
this is the seventh.

332
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,980
Grandmaster,

333
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,180
I found this nearby.

334
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,120
Yan?

335
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,920
[Qing, Yu]

336
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,900
From the Yan Clan Stronghold?

337
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,640
[Yan]

338
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,770
Those clan disciples

339
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,900
love to bully rogue cultivators.

340
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,620
Enough.

341
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,860
Do not jump to conclusions before we investigate thoroughly.

342
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,010
Yes.

343
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,940
The barrier has been lifted.

344
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,290
The valley

345
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,700
is now filled with rogue and clan

346
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,700
disciples.

347
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,140
Both parties are not on good terms

348
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,460
so anything could happen.

349
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,490
Yu, Qing.

350
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,210
Dispatch more disciples

351
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,730
to guard the valley.

352
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,530
I don't want any accidents

353
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,980
before the Immortal Ascension Trials.

354
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,860
Understood.

355
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,220
Keen eyes, Miss.

356
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,220
The emerald stones embedded on the bracelet

357
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,940
come from

358
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,570
[Yan Ruyan]
the eyes of a Grade 2 Twinhead Raven.

359
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,460
Well,

360
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,330
it's a bit

361
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,940
expensive.

362
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,050
500 gems.

363
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,010
500?

364
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,620
You might as well commit robbery.

365
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,900
- Do you know we are... - Enough.

366
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,530
Scarcity brings up the price.

367
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,460
Father will like this.

368
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,700
Miss, this is...

369
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,010
Take it.

370
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,700
Thank you, Miss.

371
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,090
I...

372
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,330
Thank the maker!

373
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,420
Stay there.

374
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,660
They are the ones who killed Liu.

375
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,530
Nonsense.

376
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,090
Foundation Establishment Stage?

377
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,980
A Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator is her guard.

378
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,490
Just who exactly is that woman?

379
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,490
Feng,

380
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,570
who said you could intervene?

381
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,010
[Feng]
Forgive me, Miss Yan.

382
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,330
Your safety

383
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,660
dictates the continuity of Yan Clan Stronghold.

384
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,730
Master has instructed me

385
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,980
to prioritize your safety.

386
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,460
She's Yan Ruyan?

387
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,860
Yan Ruyan?

388
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,250
Is her family very famous?

389
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,860
Of course!

390
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,330
Her family is the top cultivation family in the Yue Kingdom.

391
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,810
The paterfamilias, Yan Yunshan,

392
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,180
is her father.

393
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,090
He's a cultivator in the Core Formation Stage.

394
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,140
Wan,

395
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,290
you know many things.

396
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,810
I'm so impressed.

397
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,220
He is so knowledgeable.

398
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,860
I should listen to him more.

399
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,140
Look.

400
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,250
I know everything about the cultivation world

401
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,050
in the Yue Kingdom.

402
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,380
Just ask me anything if you have questions.

403
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,140
Thank you,

404
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,860
Wan.

405
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,460
Just call me Xiaoshan.

406
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,380
Xiaoshan.

407
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,940
By the authority of the seven sects,

408
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,050
all troublemakers

409
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,180
will be disqualified from the trials

410
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,380
and expelled from Tainan Valley.

411
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,980
As this is your first offense,

412
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,420
I'll forgive you but don't do it again.

413
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,570
Leave right now.

414
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,140
She's holding the token

415
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,860
of a Core Formation Stage cultivator from the Moonshadow Sect.

416
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,140
Miss Ruyan,

417
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,810
Grandmaster Nangong would like to see you.

418
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,090
What is the meaning of this?

419
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,090
Grandmaster Nangong?

420
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,490
Is your sect challenging Yan Clan Stronghold

421
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,770
for a few rogue cultivators?

422
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,010
Cease your impertinence, Feng.

423
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,570
Withdraw for now.

424
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,490
I will be back in a moment.

425
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,730
Han,

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,530
come.

427
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,570
What a day.

428
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,010
I saw a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator serving as a guard

429
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,380
and also a token from a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

430
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,980
There is always

431
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,570
someone more powerful than the powerful ones.

432
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,770
If you see them

433
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,730
in the future, Han,

434
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,860
you run away.

435
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,050
Run away?

436
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,050
Let's go.

437
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,220
I'll show you around.

438
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,010
Thank you so much,

439
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,460
Xiaoshan.

440
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,420
No worries at all.

441
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,530
Rogue cultivators are like my brothers.

442
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,220
If you have further...

443
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,770
Are you all right?

444
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,900
Are you all right?

445
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,570
I'm fine.

446
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,380
Thank you.

447
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,180
Look where you're going.

448
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,660
Okay.

449
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,570
You sure are stealthy, my friend.

450
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,010
But

451
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,570
[Daoist Qingwen]
I suggest

452
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,860
you return the pouch to its owner.

453
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,900
[Hu Pinggu]
Didn't you promise

454
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,770
to stop stealing?

455
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,900
[Wu Jiuzhi]

456
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,530
Xiaoshan,

457
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,980
it seems like we have thieves among the cultivators too.

458
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,460
He took your pouch first.

459
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,050
I merely grabbed some interest on your behalf.

460
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,140
Isn't it fair?

461
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,770
You...

462
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,380
I

463
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,570
just wanted to borrow it.

464
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,250
I didn't say I wouldn't return it.

465
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,860
Give it back.

466
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,980
Give it back.

467
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,330
Give it back!

468
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,330
He took my things and won't give them back.

469
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,010
You two

470
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,810
should check if your personal effects are intact.

471
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,570
That's right.

472
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,090
This happens on the Azure Vein Society's territory.

473
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,140
Our leader

474
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,620
will intervene.

475
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,530
You belong to the Azure Vein Society?

476
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,980
Qingwen is my Dharma name.

477
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,980
This is my peer, Hu Pinggu.

478
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,980
My friend,

479
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,220
since you've heard of my society,

480
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,860
will you be so kind

481
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,050
as to look past what the thief did?

482
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,570
It feels like you're reciting lines.

483
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,490
Is this perhaps a premeditated ruse?

484
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,810
Han,

485
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,940
Daoist Qingwen is known for his heroic deeds

486
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,700
among the rogue cultivators.

487
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,330
We have not suffered any losses.

488
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,860
Let's just move on.

489
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:40,980
Everything's fine.

490
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,460
Everything's fine.

491
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,290
Let's go, Han.

492
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,140
Give back the pouch.

493
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,050
Thank you.

494
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,860
My friends,

495
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,330
Wu Jiuzhi is mischievous,

496
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,570
but he bears no ill intention.

497
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,490
If he did offend you,

498
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,220
I

499
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,330
apologize

500
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,140
on his behalf.

501
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,860
That's right.

502
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,090
- We crossed paths today. - These two

503
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,900
are either crooks...

504
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,620
How may I...

505
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,730
- or fraudsters. - address you two?

506
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,860
I should stay away from them.

507
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,570
You're too courteous, sir.

508
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,250
I am Wan Xiaoshan.

509
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,700
This is my friend, Han Li.

510
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,810
And he exposed my name just like that.

511
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,140
You look like

512
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,900
you're here for the trials.

513
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,900
Our society

514
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,380
has rented a venue nearby

515
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,010
to discuss the trials

516
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,220
with other rogue cultivators.

517
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,380
Would you like

518
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,490
to join us?

519
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,380
Of course.

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,420
Grandmaster,

521
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,940
Miss Ruyan from the Yan Clan Stronghold is here.

522
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,700
I'm Yan Ruyan of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

523
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,250
Greetings, Grandmaster Nangong.

524
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,050
I was told you brought a lot of guards

525
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,570
to Tainan with you.

526
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,980
Grandmaster Nangong,

527
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,420
while I can't speak for other prestigious families,

528
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,900
I can reassure you

529
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,620
that my guards have never left my side

530
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,050
ever since I set foot in Tainan.

531
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,010
My family has nothing to do

532
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,730
with the disappearance of rogue cultivators.

533
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,980
You keep yourself abreast with the goings-on.

534
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,090
But how do you explain this?

535
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,780
[Yan]

536
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,090
We found this

537
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,980
next to a dead rogue cultivator.

538
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,460
Grandmaster Nangong,

539
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,860
a female attendant of mine

540
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,420
had her token stolen

541
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,810
since we entered Tainan.

542
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,730
Someone is obviously trying to frame me.

543
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,860
Have you decided on which sect to join?

544
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,700
Grandfather recommended Spirit Beast Mountain many times.

545
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,660
But I prefer the Moonshadow Sect.

546
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,810
You have better taste than your grandfather.

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,050
All right. You may return.

548
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,940
Be prepared for the trials tomorrow.

549
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,530
Grandmaster,

550
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,010
judging from those brash rogue cultivators just now,

551
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,330
they were clearly manipulated by someone else.

552
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,860
Yet Yan Clan Stronghold

553
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,180
does not make enemies often.

554
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,220
Do you know

555
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,180
who is trying to frame us?

556
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,570
In my opinion,

557
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,290
Yan Clan Stronghold is not the only target.

558
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,180
Your behavior

559
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,810
does not merely represent your family,

560
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,050
but also other clan disciples

561
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,140
like you.

562
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,620
Someone is trying to exacerbate the divide

563
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,220
between the clan disciples and rogue cultivators.

564
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,010
I shall take my leave.

565
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,770
Grandmaster.

566
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,770
I can't let Spirit Beast Mountain

567
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,010
take away a smart girl like her.

568
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,250
My friends,

569
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,940
this is our base.

570
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,290
Welcome aboard!

571
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,050
We are a family of rogue cultivators.

572
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,460
Welcome!

573
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,570
Welcome!

574
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,660
Welcome.

575
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,330
Welcome.

576
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,620
- Welcome. - Welcome.

577
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,730
Welcome.

578
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,960
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

579
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,220
[Map]

580
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,980
This is a map of the Yue Kingdom.

581
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,940
I chanced upon this map

582
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,530
and found it intriguing.

583
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,220
You can find

584
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,490
all seven sects on it.

585
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,940
That's the Moonshadow Sect.

586
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,660
That's the Spirit Beast Mountain.

587
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,530
That's the Saber-Shearing Sect.

588
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,330
That's the Clear Void Sect.

589
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,980
Skyfort Castle.

590
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,050
That's the Yellow Maple Valley.

591
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,570
That's the Giant Sword Sect.

592
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,380
These seven cultivating sects

593
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,660
are generally abbreviated as the seven sects.

594
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,180
They survived a fierce battle

595
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,050
1,000 years ago

596
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,980
in the Yue Kingdom.

597
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:22,860
Then,

598
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,180
where is Yan Clan Stronghold?

599
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,090
Yan Clan Stronghold.

600
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,700
Here.

601
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,700
[Yan Clan Stronghold]
That's the Yan Clan Stronghold.

602
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,180
- Yes. - That's right.

603
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,660
There.

604
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,220
Yes.

605
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,620
There.

606
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,320
Then,

607
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,140
where do rogue cultivators belong?

608
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,620
We...

609
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,010
We're not on this map.

610
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,050
I might even say

611
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,220
that we won't have a place in the Yue Kingdom either.

612
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,140
Enough, Qingwen.

613
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,180
We brought them here

614
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,980
to discuss the trials.

615
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,330
Why bring this up?

616
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,700
I'm sorry.

617
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,810
Some rogue cultivators have gone missing lately.

618
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,900
Some are also left stranded...

619
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,620
Qingwen.

620
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,940
What are they trying to achieve?

621
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,940
They never finish their sentence,

622
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,380
and that only diverts more attention to them.

623
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,900
We're cultivating as well.

624
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,570
How come some were born

625
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,380
with access to so many resources,

626
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,420
while we

627
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,530
have to risk our lives

628
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,420
for a Foundation Pill?

629
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,460
Exactly.

630
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,220
That's unfair.

631
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,180
A Foundation Pill?

632
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,570
What is that?

633
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,620
You cannot not know this.

634
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,530
A Foundation Pill

635
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,730
can help a cultivator to get to the Foundation Establishment Stage

636
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,810
from the Qi Refining Stage.

637
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,220
Qi Refining Stage?

638
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,860
Which stage am I in?

639
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,940
If you're just starting out,

640
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,180
you're in the Qi Refining Stage.

641
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,490
And then?

642
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,420
Listen carefully.

643
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,810
In the world of cultivation,

644
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,380
all stages can be divided into

645
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,290
lower level, middle level,

646
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,220
and upper level.

647
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,290
The lower level stages include

648
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,570
the Qi Refining Stage,

649
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,330
the Foundation Establishment Stage,

650
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,090
the Core Formation Stage,

651
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,810
the Nascent Soul Stage,

652
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,900
and the Spirit Transformation Stage.

653
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,050
The middle level stages

654
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,730
are

655
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,980
the Void Refining Stage,

656
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,860
the Body Unity Stage,

657
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,860
and the Great Ascension Stage.

658
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,140
The upper level stage

659
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,220
only has

660
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,570
the Tribulation Transcendence Stage.

661
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,770
If you ascend from this stage,

662
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,420
you can

663
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,420
become an immortal

664
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,380
and live as long as the universe.

665
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,090
But these are just myths.

666
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,730
No one has seen anyone above

667
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,770
the Nascent Soul Stage.

668
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,730
Is it very difficult

669
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,770
to get a Foundation Pill?

670
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,620
It's not just difficult to get one.

671
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,250
The pill

672
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,250
determines the fate of a cultivator,

673
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,530
and by extension,

674
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,490
the future of a sect.

675
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,420
Therefore,

676
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,770
in the past, the seven sects

677
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,180
and the prestigious families

678
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,530
had a monopoly over the pills.

679
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,140
They have all the pills.

680
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,980
Until the trials came along.

681
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,290
Han,

682
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,770
at a glance, the trials

683
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,770
give you a chance

684
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,570
to enter the seven sects.

685
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,820
But in reality,

686
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,570
everyone is after the pills.

687
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,260
500 years ago,

688
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,650
a veteran rogue cultivator

689
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,380
gathered thousands of other rogue cultivators

690
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,740
to negotiate with the seven sects.

691
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,610
Thanks to them, we now have a chance to compete fairly

692
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,490
against disciples of prestigious clans

693
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,300
to enter the seven sects.

694
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,860
And as a result,

695
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,010
we also become their enemies.

696
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,530
But let's be frank.

697
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,010
We rogue cultivators do not have access to many things.

698
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,210
And those who hail from a prestigious clan

699
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,860
can feed their disciples with tons of elixirs.

700
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,210
How is this fair?

701
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,650
Yes, that's not fair.

702
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,090
Uneven distribution of resources.

703
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,530
No wonder

704
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,820
they hate

705
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,860
the clan disciples.

706
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,460
Have you found anything about the rogue cultivators?

707
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,050
Several men are following

708
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,460
the core members as we speak.

709
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,460
The leader is a man called Qingwen.

710
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,130
He has only attained Tier 11 of the Qi Refining Stage,

711
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,170
but he is a great speaker.

712
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,650
He has many followers

713
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,300
among the rogue cultivators.

714
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,380
Keep a close eye on him.

715
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,170
Let me know

716
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,300
if anything happens.

717
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,010
Yes.

718
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,860
My friends,

719
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,900
the seven sects will put us through two trials.

720
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,490
The first one

721
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,980
is the spirit root trial tomorrow.

722
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,820
The second one

723
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,860
is the Tianwu Arena trial tomorrow.

724
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,980
The Tianwu Arena trial

725
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,940
is very dangerous.

726
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,900
Therefore,

727
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,010
we must secure a spot

728
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,170
in tomorrow's trial first.

729
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,170
A spirit root

730
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,860
comes in

731
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,340
five elements: metal, wood, water,

732
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,210
fire, and earth.

733
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,170
You know it already.

734
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,050
- Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. - Mortals do not have a spirit root

735
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,170
so they cannot cultivate.

736
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,780
The more spirit roots you have,

737
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,380
the worse you progress.

738
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,740
Those who have four or five spirit root elements

739
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,050
can sense the spiritual aura around us.

740
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,090
Yet they can only reach

741
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,380
Tier 3 or Tier 4 in their lives at most.

742
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,130
We call this

743
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,490
a fake spirit root.

744
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,890
- Fake spirit root? - Fake spirit root?

745
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,420
Those who have two or three spirit root elements

746
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,900
have

747
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,090
a true spirit root.

748
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,650
Sir,

749
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,380
what if the spirit root comes with only one element?

750
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,650
Then, it is an exceptionally rare heavenly spirit root

751
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,650
A cultivator with that gift

752
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,940
has earned the favor of the maker.

753
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,860
His progress

754
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,860
will defy comprehension.

755
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,090
I see. Cultivation is deeply tied to one's talent.

756
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,690
In that case, do I have a true spirit root

757
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,980
or a fake spirit root?

758
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,460
Physician Mo never told me.

759
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,420
I hope I have the heavenly spirit root.

760
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,090
There are only limited spots

761
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,380
for those who wish to enroll in the seven sects

762
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,170
through the spirit root trial.

763
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,420
People from the prestigious clan

764
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,340
will do what they can to take our spots

765
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,420
in the seven sects.

766
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,940
They wish to impede our cultivation.

767
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,130
So, power speaks the loudest

768
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,090
in the cultivation world.

769
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,650
Tier 1 to Tier 13.

770
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,610
It is the complete set of Longevity Art.

771
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,610
Interested?

772
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,420
Pay up.

773
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,490
How much?

774
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,690
Nine gems.

775
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,220
[Meng Wu]

776
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,860
Nine gems?

777
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,820
That's too expensive.

778
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,900
Tier 10 of the Qi Refining Stage?

779
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,570
Now you've seen what I can do.

780
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,900
Pay up.

781
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,380
Little girl,

782
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,740
I do want to buy

783
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,900
this book.

784
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,780
But nine gems is too expensive.

785
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,210
Can I ask for a better price?

786
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,420
How much are you offering?

787
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,860
Two?

788
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,090
Da.

789
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,010
Er.

790
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,980
San.

791
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,650
Si.

792
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,860
Come!

793
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,210
Is this the guy?

794
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,340
That's right.

795
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,490
He read our book

796
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,650
but refused to pay.

797
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,900
I'm selling it for nine gems.

798
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,340
But he only offered two.

799
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
[Meng Da, Meng Si]

800
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,460
What in the daylight robbery!

801
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,940
[Meng San, Meng Er]

802
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,980
What?

803
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,820
How did you know we were robbers

804
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,780
before we started cultivating?

805
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,050
- How did you know? - How did you know?

806
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,740
We quit many years ago.

807
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,740
How did you know?

808
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,210
Speak up.

809
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,820
Everyone,

810
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,980
this sign means two

811
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,530
strengthening pills

812
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,940
for your book.

813
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,010
What do you think?

814
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,420
Give me

815
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,980
the book.

816
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,490
Stand there.

817
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,170
You can't leave.

818
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,260
I gave you the pills.

819
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,460
What else do you want?

820
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,740
Your pills...

821
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,340
You overpaid.

822
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,010
Yes.

823
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,650
Yes.

824
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,780
You can have the Longevity Art book.

825
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,690
This mega mystic pouch

826
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,170
is a gift for you as well.

827
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,690
It's a gift.

828
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,780
The Five Mengs

829
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,740
are righteous!

830
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:43,820
Indeed.

831
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,610
Indeed.

832
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,260
Farewell.

833
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,650
No need to see me off!

834
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,300
No need!

835
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,740
The pills

836
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,210
are more useful than gems.

837
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,340
Lucky for me, I brought extra when I left

838
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,210
Shenshou Valley.

839
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,210
And now,

840
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,010
I also have a mystic pouch.

841
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,570
I no longer have to bring many bags with me.

842
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,780
For your fragment of a magic item,

843
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,010
I'll buy it for five low-grade gems.

844
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,900
What do you think?

845
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,860
No.

846
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,380
[Han Yunzhi]
It is nonetheless

847
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,210
a fragment from a Core Formation Stage cultivator's magic item.

848
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,820
You keep promoting it.

849
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,090
What can it do

850
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,010
exactly?

851
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,940
It's very useful.

852
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,380
Look.

853
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,210
I...

854
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,900
I can use that fragment

855
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,860
to hide the Green Vial.

856
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,740
It is a fragment of a magic item, all right.

857
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,170
But it's

858
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,260
[Lu Mingyuan]
too small.

859
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,460
You know what?

860
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,900
Given you also have a cute face,

861
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,940
I will offer

862
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,650
one strengthening pill.

863
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,860
Mister Lu,

864
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,570
[Chen Qiaoqian, Chen Rong]
you're taking advantage of her.

865
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,010
I offer six gems.

866
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,170
Can I have it?

867
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,300
I offer seven gems.

868
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,210
Eight gems.

869
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,130
Okay.

870
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,250
Eight gems, it is.

871
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,130
Sorry.

872
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,740
I was just joking around.

873
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,300
[Chen Mu]
Me too.

874
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,940
Besides, Miss.

875
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,860
Your fragment

876
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,130
truly isn't worth that much.

877
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,460
Miss.

878
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,650
Don't go.

879
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,570
They don't want it, but I do.

880
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:24,610
One gem.

881
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,490
I offer one gem.

882
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,420
I'm asking for seven gems.

883
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,650
All of you...

884
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,380
Is anyone else interested?

885
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,690
I don't think anyone else is bidding.

886
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,980
Anyone?

887
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,820
Two vials of Golden Marrow Pill

888
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,530
for your fragment of a magic item, please.

889
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,940
Please don't tell me you're joking around too.

890
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,530
Deal.

891
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,530
My friend,

892
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:13,820
why are you doing this?

893
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,980
You ruined my negotiation for no reason at all.

894
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,170
You think you can leave?

895
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,300
But

896
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,210
I bought this fragment

897
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,780
with a fair price.

898
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,570
Isn't this a fair trade?

899

Fine.
