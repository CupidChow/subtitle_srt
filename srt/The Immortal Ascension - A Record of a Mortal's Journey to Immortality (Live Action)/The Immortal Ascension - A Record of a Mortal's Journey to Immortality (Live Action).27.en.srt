Where are you going?

I received a missive addressed to Mentor Li

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,420
from a cultivator in Yellow Maple Valley.

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,530
I'm on my way to deliver it.

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,500
You're abandoning your post.

36

Elder Han,

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,980
everyone else is preparing for the battle.

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,900
No one is available.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,090
Ridiculous.

42
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,690
Forget it.

43
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,260
I need to see Huayuan

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,010
this is not right.

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,380

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,100
Should I escalate this to Fu Yunzi?

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,100
Please don't.

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,570
Forgive me.

58
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,570
I appreciate

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,460
your help, Elder Han.

60

Everyone

61
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,850
has a job to complete.

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,660
If there is a lack of manpower,

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,820
I can ask Spirit Beast Mountain

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,180
to handle the internal communication.

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,740
Don't worry about it.

66
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,690
Go now.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,290
Yes.

68
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,210
He sure is cautious.

69
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,020
Congratulations, Grandmaster.

80
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,730
I'm done packing.

81
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,940
We should go now.

82
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,130
Sure.

87
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,170
He's Mentor Han now.

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,010
It was a force of habit.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,220
Mentor Han.

90
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,890
You're taller now.

91
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,010
Here.

92
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,820
Take this.

93
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,540
This

94
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,610
is a pill

95
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,820
to strengthen your base in the Qi Refining Stage.

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,220
Consider it

97
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,100
a gift for you.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,660
Thank you, Mentor Han.

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,780
I

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,820
won't let you down.

101
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,780
All you do

102
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,410
is talk to the girl.

103
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,890
You never come to visit me.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,940
Mentor Ma.

105
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,130
Who is that?

106
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,010
You, Mentor Ma.

107
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,850
Who is Mentor Ma?

108
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,380
Senior Ma.

109
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,170
Mentor Ma.

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,100
I'll do as you say.

111
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,820
All right?

112
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,540
It's been a while.

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,340
You brat.

114
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,610
I see you still know your way here,

115
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,610
and still remember me.

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,610
Stop teasing me.

117
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,170
When I first came here,

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,410
you took me in

119
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,450
and gave me pills.

120
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,340
I'm forever

121
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,570
grateful for that.

122
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,610
Good.

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,570
Come.

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,450
All right.

125
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,980
Go inside

126
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,410
and pack everything.

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,020
I need to speak

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,980
with him.

129
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:58,930
Yes.

130
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,610
You brat.

131
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,370
Don't hit on my disciple now.

132
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,290
It seems like you quite like the disciple

133
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,610
I found you.

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,050
She's decent.

135
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,730
Talented

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,540
but

137
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,540
easily distracted.

138
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,290
It's fine.

139
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,170
I can take my time to teach her.

140
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,700
Senior Ma,

141
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,410
will you

142
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,610
be gone for a long time?

143
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,370
We need to leave for a while.

144
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,370
There's

145
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,410
something wrong with our sect.

146
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,810
I plan

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,170
to go into hiding.

148
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,660
How so?

149
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,250
In the past two months,

150
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,780
many people

151
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,540
from Baiji Hall came

152
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,370
and bought all kinds

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,050
of herbs

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,140
that were aged.

155
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,140
It's not just the hundred-year spirit herb.

156
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,580
Even the decade-old ones

157
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,900
are gone.

158
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,020
What is happening?

159
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,250
Is the front line

160
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,780
in a dire situation?

161
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,250
I just returned from the Imperial Capital.

162
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,780
I'm not up to date

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,050
regarding the front line.

164
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,610
I tended this garden for many years.

165
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,570
Every plant here

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,610
contains our hard work.

167
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,170
I'd rather leave than watch them

168
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,610
squeeze this land dry.

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,220
Out of sight, out of mind.

170
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,340
You are smart.

171
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,410
This war

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,410
seems pointless.

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,930
It's always

174
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,340
about land disputes

175
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,220
or resource disputes.

176
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,340
It's been going on for so long.

177
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,980
Yet those cultivators in the Nascent Soul Stage

178
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,340
do not care.

179
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,370
And cultivators like us pay with our lives.

180
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,220
Listen to me.

181
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,980
If it becomes too much for you,

182
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,730
find an exit strategy.

183
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,050
Your life

184
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,170
is always more important.

185
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,850
Thank you for the advice,

186
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,170
Senior Ma.

187
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,460
I appreciate it.

188
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,370
I'm

189
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,170
old.

190
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,850
I nag

191
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,340
a lot.

192
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,170
Han,

193
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,290
you are a lucky man.

194
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,730
Perhaps you don't need my advice.

195
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,490
But I do not know when we'll meet again

196
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,290
after this departure.

197
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,140
I didn't let them

198
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,050
have

199
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,170
certain herbs.

200
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,910
We put in

201
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,900
a lot of effort

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,020
to grow these herbs.

203
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,020
You know what?

204
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,290
If you have use for them,

205
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,810
use them.

206
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,100
Han.

207
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,490
Take care.

208
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,580
Remember.

209
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,290
Don't die before me.

210
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,580
I won't die so soon.

211
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,980
Master.

212
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,660
Come.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,660
Who knows

214
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,370
if I'll see Mentor Ma again?

215
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,850
Has the situation

216
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,140
at the front line grown this dire?

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,460
If the Seven Sects are defeated,

218
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,810
will there still be

219
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,930
a peaceful place

220
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,490
for people

221
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,290
to cultivate?

Huayuan,

228
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,540
I've been having a bad feeling.

229
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,410
Something bad is about to happen.

230
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,610
Don't worry, Hongfu.

231
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,250
The Seven Sects are going

232
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,580
all out.

233
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,290
I estimate

234
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,420
a 50% chance of winning, at least.

235
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,580
You know what?

236
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,530
Why don't you observe from the side?

237
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,580
My disciples and I

238
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,940
will attack them first.

239
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:13,580
Let's go.

240
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,490

If I leave,

269
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,340
who knows when I can come back again?

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,180
Alas, I can't bring

271
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,610
this cavern and the spirit spring with me.

272
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,890
These are all the herbs required for the Core Formation Stage.

273
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,700
I planted them painstakingly.

274
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,250
None can go to waste.

275
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,100
81 tolls of the Dragonfell Bell?

276
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,940
Our sect has fallen.

277
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,460
Did something

278
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,530
happen at the front line?

279
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,300
81 tolls of Dragonfell Bell.

280
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,610
I suppose you know what this means.

281
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,730
That's right.

282
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,940
Several hours ago,

283
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,700
Spirit Beast Mountain and Skyfort Castle

284
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,100
turned against us.

285
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,980
The alliance collapsed.

286
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,770
More than half

287
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,820
of the Foundation Establishment cultivators are gone.

288
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,630
What in the world?

289
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,460
Yellow Maple Valley...

290
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,940
- What do we do? - ...has been defeated...

291
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,510
Defeated?

292
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,220
...in this war.

293
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,300
The demonic sects

294
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,850
continue to advance.

295
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,490
They will break through

296
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,010
the last line of defense soon.

297
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,460
The last line of defense?

298
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,650
Spirit Beast Mountain and Skyfort Castle...

299
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,100
- How could this be? - ...turned against us?

300
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,980
They defected?

301
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,940
They are scoundrels!

302
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,650
What happened to Master and the rest?

303
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,730
We're done for!

304
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,050
- We're done for! - Silence!

305
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,890
We're done for!

306
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,980
Those despicable scums.

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,750
We're done for!

308
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,730
- But I did warn them. - Silence!

309
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,460
But he never believed me.

310
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,890
Silence.

311
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,580
We're done for.

312
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,130
Silence!

313
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,610
Listen to me.

314
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,220
While our existence is indeed in a crisis,

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,850
it is not the moment to give up hope.

316
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,250
Although the Core Formation Stage elders are not here,

317
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,010
we can beseech

318
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,820
Grand Elder to intervene.

319
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,770
Please help us turn the tide,

320
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,460
Grandmaster!

321
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,130
Please help us turn the tide,

322
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,890
Grand Elder!

323
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,580
Please help us turn the tide,

324
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,100
Grand Elder!

325
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,820
Please help us turn the tide,

326
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,340
Grand Elder!

327
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,770
Please help us turn the tide,

328
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,250
Grand Elder!

329
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,700
Please help us turn the tide,

330
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,100
Grand Elder!

331
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,700
This is futile.

332
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,890
If those Nascent Soul elders were willing to intervene,

333
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,370
the war would have ended already.

334
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,300
Why intervene now then?

335
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,370
In this time of need,

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,300
relying on yourself is better

337
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,370
than relying on others.

338
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,700
Please help us turn the tide,

339
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,180
Grand Elder!

340
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,300
Please help us turn the tide,

341
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,890
Grand Elder!

342
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,100
Please help us turn the tide,

343
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,770
Grand Elder!

344
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,300
What is going on?

345
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,850
Did you ever study

346
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,250
some kind of soul technique?

347
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,770
Grandmaster,

348
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,820
I did

349
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,220
study one particular soul technique.

350
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,270
[Grandmaster Linghu]

351
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,650
Interesting.

352
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,130
Your foundation is solid.

353
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,820
You have the right mindset too.

354
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,420
Unfortunately,

355
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,340
your spirit root

356
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,770
is too weak.

357
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,130
So this is the power of a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator?

358
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,340
If I hadn't studied Great Deployment Art

359
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,300
to reinforce my soul,

360
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,420
I wouldn't even have been able to reply to him.

361
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,650
I hate to see people on their knees.

362
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,820
Everyone, get up now.

363
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,180
Please help us turn the tide,

364
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,980
Grand Elder!

365
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,490
Didn't I say

366
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,780
that I hated to see people on their knees?

367
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,250
Get up now!

368
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,770
Did you think

369
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,180
that I'll say yes

370
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,460
if you kneel?

371
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,490
As cultivators,

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,580
how could you forget

373
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,060
about the importance of easement?

374
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,770
As you can already see,

375
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,820
our sect

376
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,490
is probably no more.

377
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,460
So disperse now.

378
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,060
Don't bother me and my cultivation.

379
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,010
Grandmaster,

380
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,760
forgive our incompetence.

381
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,220
We deserve to be punished.

382
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,300
But our sect has centuries of legacy.

383
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,730
It can't go down now.

384
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,220
Please have mercy

385
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,610
and kill those demonic sects.

386
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,700
Save us from the impending doom!

387
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,610
Sect Master!

388
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,890
- You idiot. - Sect Master!

389
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,940
What makes you think

390
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,610
that I'll

391
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,010
risk my life for useless beings

392
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,770
like all of you here?

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,980
All I want is peace.

394
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,700
All of you are weak

395
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,890
yet you want me

396
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,530
to fight those powerful monsters for you.

397
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,060
I can do that.

398
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,100
But I...

399
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,060
I'm not strong enough.

400
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,490
A battle between

401
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,180
Nascent Soul Stage cultivators will be a grueling one.

402
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,420
People will die.

403
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,010
Die!

404
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,890
Grandmaster.

405
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,820
Grandmaster!

406
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,340
You want me

407
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,820
to die

408
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,850
for you?

409
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,220
Why? Because you

410
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,250
performed

411
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,850
a kowtow

412
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,820
and called me a grand elder?

413
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,010
How absurd!

414
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,580
Absurd!

415
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,730
- We're all alone. - Grandmaster left us.

416
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,370
What do we do?

417
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,460
He left us.

418
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,130
What do we do?

419
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,460
What do we do?

420
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,420
What do we do?

421
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,770
It's over for our sect.

422
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,700
What do we do?

423
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,340
Grandmaster.

424
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,140
Those Nascent Soul Stage cultivators

425
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,770
stay out of the war

426
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,010
and leave weak disciples to die.

427
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,490
How dare they?

428
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,250
What do we do?

429
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,810
Sect Master.

430
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,460
Sect Master.

431
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,250
Grandmaster does not care about us.

432
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,420
What do we do?

433
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,420
Everyone.

434
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,180
Do not panic.

435
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,980
We still have the Mountain Barrier.

436
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,220
If we work together,

437
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,940
we can defend this place.

438
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,290
I swear

439
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,940
to live and die

440
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,140
with this place.

441
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,180
He's right.

442
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,620
We have the Mountain Barrier.

443
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,570
We fear nothing.

444
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,330
We live or die with this sect!

445
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,460
At this juncture,

446
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,250
speeches that raise morale

447
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,730
serve no purpose.

448
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,140
I must find a way

449
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,220
to deal with the upcoming invasion.

450
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,190
Look at those fools.

451
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,490
If you hear this message

452
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,770
and want to live,

453
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,140
come to Qianji Hall

454
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,860
after 15 minutes.

455
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,490
Do not be late.

456
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,900
Am I chosen?

457
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,530
Is there

458
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,900
another plan?

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,660
Weiniang.

460
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,700
Are you all right?

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,490
I'm fine.

462
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,050
Oh, the infamous Hongfen

463
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,180
and Skull.

464
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,090
You are knowledgeable.

465
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,900
Elder Han,

466
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,700
you betrayed the Seven Sects

467
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,220
and turned on us.

468
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,700
You have killed many people.

469
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,660
My gullible juniors,

470
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,010
since your master and I are good friends,

471
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,660
I'll give you a second chance.

472
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,420
Join us now.

473
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,290
Elder Han,

474
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,810
while I may be weak,

475
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,290
I am not

476
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,090
a traitor.

477
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,420
I am Song Meng of Qingbo Cavern, Yellow Maple Valley,

478
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,010
the fourth disciple of Li Huayuan.

479
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,140
Take my life if you can.

480
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,660
Song Meng.

481
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,530
Song Meng.

482
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,180
Song Meng.

483
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,940
Song Meng.

484
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,090
Song Meng.

485
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,330
Song Meng.

486
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,290
Weiniang.

487
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,010
Why are you still here?

488
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,330
Jing is gone.

489
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,730
If you're gone too,

490
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,380
there's no reason for me to live in this world.

491
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,010
Darling,

492
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,290
I love to see this kind of story.

493
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,730
Those Seven Sects are weak.

494
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,810
But seeing these star-crossed lovers

495
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,530
navigating through the turmoil of war

496
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,700
can be so addictive.

497
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,380
I'm glad you like it.

498
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,640
But

499
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,500
our priority targets still roam.

500
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,220
We cannot dally.

501
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,940
Let's end them now.

502
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,700
I am Zhong Weiniang

503
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,380
of Qingbo Cavern, Yellow Maple Valley,

504
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,940
the seventh disciple of Li Huayuan.

505
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,900
Take my life if you can.

506
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,730
Insolence.

507
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,660
I shall grant you your wish

508
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,290
and take your life.

509
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,490
Don't bully them now.

510
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,010
I made it in time.

511
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,730
Zhong.

512
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,570
Song.

513
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,530
Your job is done.

514
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,620
Go back and rest up.

515
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,570
Oh.

516
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,220
Tell your master

517
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,700
that he owes me one.

518
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,620
Farewell.

519
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,420
Han and the perverted couple there,

520
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,460
the three of you

521
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,330
ganged up on those two disciples.

522
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,730
Have you no shame?

523
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,250
Fu Yunzi.

524
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,940
Your legs are trembling.

525
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,330
You look like you're dying.

526
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,860
One small mistake

527
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,660
and you might lose your life here.

528
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,770
Why don't you

529
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,490
join me to do great things together?

530
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,770
In your dreams.

531
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,980
Darling.

532
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,570
I don't like that old guy.

533
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,730
He ruined my show.

534
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,620
Kill him for me.

535
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,700
Kill him.

536
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,860
Fu Yunzi,

537
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,140
you made my wife angry.

538
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,900
You'll have

539
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,620
to pay the price today.

540
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,290
My friends,

541
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,140
let's see

542
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,900
if you have the ability

543
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,980
to kill me or not.

544
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,050
Go away!

545
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,940
You have quick reflexes.

546
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,050
Master.

547
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,220
It's been a while. Did you ascend again?

548
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,530
Thanks to your teachings.

549
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,250
Master,

550
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,010
are you all right?

551
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,090
I'm fine.

552
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,770
Were you hoping

553
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,220
for something to happen to me?

554
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,490
Of course, not.

555
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,620
I know...

556
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,090
- Mentor Li. - ...you are strong.

557
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,220
You will surely be safe.

558
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,900
Mentor Li.

559
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,900
Master.

560
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,900
Mentor Li.

561
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,220
Regarding the battle with the Black Fiend Cult,

562
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,460
I'm sorry.

563
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,530
Senior Wu and Senior Liu died because of me.

564
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,250
Please punish me.

565
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,940
- Mentor Li. - It's fine.

566
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,180
Song Meng and Weiniang

567
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,330
already told me everything.

568
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,140
Who would have thought that the cultists

569
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,090
had infiltrated the royalty this deeply?

570
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,570
And now that the demonic sects are invading,

571
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,530
we are indeed having trouble at two fronts.

572
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,810
Fortunately,

573
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,010
you returned here safely.

574
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,700
I am glad.

575
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:38,810
Oh,

576
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,220
I heard Senior Song and Senior Zhong

577
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,420
went to the front line.

578
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,010
Yes, they did.

579
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,490
Where are they now?

580
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,530
We split up.

581
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,810
I thought they would return.

582
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,860
But I guess

583
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,860
things aren't doing that well for them.

584
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,980
Mentor Li.

585
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,380
Mentor Li.

586
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,460
Han Li,

587
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,660
listen carefully.

588
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,330
The meeting later is crucial.

589
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,860
I begged for a while

590
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,860
to reserve a spot for you.

591
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,770
Don't squander it.

592
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,980
What do we do?

593
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,330
What do we do?

594
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,420
It's over.

595
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,140
They are all at least Mid Foundation Establishment.

596
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,090
It seems like

597
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,730
all of the capable fighters

598
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,730
are gathered here.

599
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,250
Grandmaster.

600
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,140
Grandmaster.

601
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,940
Grandmaster Linghu.

602
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,250
Grandmaster.

603
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,330
Good.

604
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,250
You're all here.

605
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,700
Then,

606
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,140
I

607
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,860
have no need to beat around the bush.

608
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,730
As you all

609
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,660
already know,

610
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,250
the front line

611
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,570
has crumbled.

612
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,050
The demonic sects

613
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,140
are heading toward us.

614
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,900
They say

615
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,660
to kill all

616
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,220
who resist.

617
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,380
I fear

618
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,900
all hope is lost.

619
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,290
Grandmaster,

620
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,980
don't frighten the younglings.

621
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,940
My fellow disciples,

622
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,730
you play key roles in our sect.

623
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,460
The legacy of Yellow Maple Valley

624
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,140
falls on your shoulders.

625
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,940
The act

626
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,490
Grandmaster put up earlier

627
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,730
before the hall

628
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,290
was to make those cowards

629
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,570
escape as soon as possible.

630
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,530
That way, our evacuation plan will proceed smoothly.

631
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,570
I see. Forgive us.

632
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,940
Where do we

633
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,460
go

634
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,490
from here?

635
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,900
Please instruct us.

636
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,010
I'll answer that on behalf of him.

637
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,810
Grand Elder

638
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,530
had previously contacted our allies

639
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,730
in the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

640
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,460
They promised

641
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,770
to provide refuge.

642
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,460
And now,

643
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,570
Mentor Li and I

644
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,460
will evacuate

645
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,050
all of you in batches.

646
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,460
Oh, the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

647
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,180
Wonderful.

648
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,010
It's one of the

649
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,050
strongest factions in Tiannan.

650
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:00,620
We

651
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,900
are all saved!

652
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,530
There's nothing such as a free favor.

653
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,980
We seek refuge.

654
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,180
We have to do

655
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,250
their bidding.

656
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,620
- We're saved. - The Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

657
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,050
Soul-Burning Spell.

658
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,940
I believe you know what it does.

659
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,810
I also added

660
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,770
a telepathic spell.

661
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,770
You may use

662
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,460
your energy

663
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,570
to communicate

664
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,490
within a radius of 100 li.

665
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,090
So long as the light still shines,

666
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,050
I will know

667
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,220
where you are!

668
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,010
Do note that this journey as refugees

669
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,730
will not be as peaceful as the life you have here.

670
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,010
All of you,

671
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,250
be cautious.

672
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,290
Thank you for your help, Grandmaster.

673
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,700
We will help each other

674
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,940
and not bring shame to our sect.

675
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,570
You bootlickers.

676
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,140
You are refugees now.

677
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,570
Quit...

678
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,660
Quit worrying about shame and reputation.

679
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,810
Now,

680
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,980
why are you standing there?

681
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,420
Waiting for food?

682
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,290
Get ready now.

683
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,770
We regroup

684
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,050
at the great hall later.

685
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,860
Yes!

686
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,250
Don't tell anyone.

687
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,770
Yes.

688
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,380
Hurry up.

689
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,180
- Yes. - Yes.

690
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,290
Master.

691
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,290
Go.

692
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,620
I don't want to leave,

693
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,700
but I can't stay here and face my fate either.

694
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,730
I should just get ready

695
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,220
for all eventualities.

696
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,810
This

697
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,290
isn't the place, it seems.

698
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,140
I need another place.

699
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,010
Truth be told,

700
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,490
I quite like the maple trees here.

701
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,620
Young Master,

702
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,700
we have now arrived at Yellow Maple Valley.

703
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,180
What is wrong with him this time?

704
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,460
I feel bad for the Seven Sects.

705
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,730
The Moonshadow Sect has shut its door to everyone.

706
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,290
The Clear Void Sect is almost annihilated.

707
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,660
Only three other sects

708
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,010
are still putting up resistance.

709
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,490
Success is not far from you,

710
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,570
Young Master.

711
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,530
I know what's bothering you, Young Master.

712
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,570
It's a person.

713
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,140
Li

714
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,810
Feiyu.

715
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,570
It's not Li Feiyu.

716
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,980
It's Han Li.

717
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,490
What?

718
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,140
[Han Li]

719
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,980
Han Li?

720
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,570
List of Yellow Maple Valley Disciples.

721
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,770
This is a treasure.

722
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,860
Where did you get it from?

723
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,330
Someone gave it to me.

724
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,380
His name is Han Li?

725
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,250
So I've been fooled by him

726
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,090
all this time.

727
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,570
Tell them

728
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,050
to invade Yellow Maple Valley.

729
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,970
Whoever captures Han Li alive

730
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,860
will be rewarded.

731
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,770
Invade Yellow Maple Valley.

732
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,810
Capture Han Li alive.

733
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,050
I don't want to leave either.

734
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,290
But now is not the moment to be sentimental.

735
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,050
The demonic sects

736
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,860
will arrive soon.

737
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,050
Please group up now.

738
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,010
It's a great cavern.

739
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,570
I can't let others have it.

740
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,740
Who knows

741
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,570
when I'll return to this place again?

742
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,170
It will be a dangerous journey.

743
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,650
I can't bring you with me.

744
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,260
Let's bid farewell here.

745
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,090
All right.

746
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,650
Don't do this.

747
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,780
If fate permits,

748
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,210
we'll meet in Yellow Maple Valley.

749
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,340
Greetings, Mentor Hongfu.

750
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,340
He is my attendant.

751
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,380
He is strong too.

752
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,690
He won't be a dead weight.

753
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,650
Have you packed everything?

754
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,980
After we leave,

755
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,090
we won't come back for the foreseeable future.

756
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,740
I appreciate your concern, Mentor Hongfu.

757
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,090
I've packed everything.

758
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,300
Where's Master?

759
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,740
He won't come with us?

760
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,860
Your master and Sect Master will evacuate

761
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,690
another batch of disciples alongside Sect Master Zhong later.

762
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,900
Otherwise,

763
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,980
a bigger party

764
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,380
might draw attention.

765
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,130
Mentor Hongfu.

766
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,460
Listen up.

767
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,090
It will be a dangerous trip.

768
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,420
We have to cut across the demonic sects' territory.

769
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,940
If we come across enemies, do not fight for too long.

770
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,570
Once you flee,

771
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,260
locate us with the Soul-Burning Spell

772
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,460
and regroup at the marked place.

773
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,170
Yes!

774
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,900
Let's go.

775
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,340
Han Li.

776
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,860
Mentor Hongfu.

777
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,210
You must be disappointed in us.

778
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,780
Your master and I are here,

779
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,900
yet we can't save ourselves from the defeat.

780
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,050
Mentor Hongfu,

781
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,130
in fact,

782
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,340
I came across

783
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,820
Spirit Beast Mountain's plan to betray us in advance.

784
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,300
I informed Sect Master Zhong

785
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,820
and even sent

786
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,980
a missive to warn Master.

787
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,210
Oh?

788
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,860
Yet your master and I

789
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,420
never received the missive

790
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,860
in our operation together.

791
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,170
No wonder.

792
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,650
Alas,

793
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,900
there's no point

794
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,820
in dwelling in the past anymore.

795
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,260
You let go easily

796
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,090
and are level-headed.

797
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,130
You stand out from the rest,

798
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,460
and I see why

799
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,010
your master paid you extra attention.

800
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,050
Even Grandmaster Linghu

801
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,210
asked me to specifically

802
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,170
bring you with us.

803
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,300
I think he likes you.

804
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,420
You flatter me.

805
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,260
I can't believe I have earned his favor.

806
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,300
Xuan'er isn't as fortunate as you.

807
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:46,980
And now,

808
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,900
I regret what I did very much.

809
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,690
Mentor Hongfu,

810
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,300
the frontline

811
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,610
has perhaps fallen to the demonic sects.

812
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,490
If they are there,

813
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,420
what is our plan?

814
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,940
This is called the Mist of Camouflage.

815
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,570
It'll help us.

816
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,340
Wait.

817
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:49,820
Mentor Li.

818
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,530
At ease.

819
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,420
Have you seen Mentor Hongfu?

820
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,340
She...

821
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,380
Did you not receive the message from Grandmaster Linghu?

822
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,820
He asked Mentor Hongfu

823
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,900
to evacuate some disciples first.

824
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,820
We

825
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,780
will follow suit soon.

826
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,090
What's wrong?

827
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,940
Did he give that order?

828
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,610
Yes.

829
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,170
What's the matter?

830
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,130
I need to verify one thing.

831
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,610
Leave without me.

832
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:48,780
What a coincidence.

833
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,460
I passed by here again.

834
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,260
Careful.

835
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,690
