00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,770
Nothing here

193
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,010
has caught your eye?

194
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,580
All right then.

195
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,610
Sir,

196
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,650
this way, please.

197
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,180
These arrays are really well drawn.

198
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,460
No, not this one either.

199
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,940
What's that?

200
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,700
Don't touch it!

201
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,850
It's for artifact crafting.

202
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,700
Did you draw all these arrays?

203
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,580
I specialize in crafting gear.

204
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,370
The arrays are someone else's work.

205
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,460
Sir,

206
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,460
wait a moment.

207
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,250
Sir,

208
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,460
what do you think of this Five Phases Reversing Array?

209
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,700
The Five Phases Reversing Array?

210
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,890
That's the one that just exploded.

211
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,250
Wait, that explosion

212
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,770
wasn't the array's fault.

213
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
I just didn't have enough gems

214
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,250
to power it up.

215
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,820
My array

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,010
is an incomplete work now.

217
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,490
It only runs at about 20% power.

218
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,490
But even like this,

219
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,610
it's still

220
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,300
a top-tier defense array.

221
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,370
It can block attacks

222
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,890
from a Mid Foundation Establishment cultivator.

223
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,580
What if you restore it?

224
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,100
Once it's fully restored,

225
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,010
it's more than enough

226
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,650
to protect a small sect

227
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,980
as the Mountain Barrier.

228
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,370
A Millennium Golden Glow Ganoderma

229
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,460
for a sect-level defense array?

230
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,770
Sounds like a fair trade.

231
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,490
But yours is still incomplete.

232
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,610
Sir!

233
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,460
Sir!

234
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,530
Sir, please wait!

235
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,220
Five years!

236
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,580
Give me five years,

237
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,850
and I swear I'll restore it to full form.

238
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,420
You won't trade a Millennium Golden Glow Ganoderma

239
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,700
for a broken array!

240
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,250
Sir,

241
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,820
are you interested

242
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,060
in artifact crafting?

243
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,100
You mean

244
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,100
you're offering to teach me?

245
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,490
To be honest,

246
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,980
my grandfather

247
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,820
was an elder in the Divine Arms Sect.

248
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,100
All my skills

249
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,490
came from him.

250
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,770
Crafting artifacts

251
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,340
is what I do best.

252
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,730
I've got something else too.

253
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,060
[Yunxiao Heart Technique]

254
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,730
This Yunxiao Heart Technique,

255
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,700
I compiled it myself

256
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,850
over many years of cultivation.

257
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,220
Besides this array,

258
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,010
I'm even willing to break family rules

259
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,580
and gift this technique

260
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,650
to you.

261
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,060
Because

262
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,820
I truly need that Millennium Herb

263
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,940
to save a life.

264
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,850
Well,

265
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,100
I happen to have a few materials to refine.

266
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,610
So how about you

267
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,700
forge a few sets of artifacts for me?

268
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,610
As for this technique,

269
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,250
if you can restore

270
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,580
the Five Phases Reversing Array,

271
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,820
I won't read a single page of this book.

272
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,370
What do you think?

273
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,370
And the Golden Glow Ganoderma?

274
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,580
You need that herb

275
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,250
to save someone?

276
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,820
You're willing to trade it

277
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,770
at any cost.

278
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,530
That shows your sincerity.

279
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,300
A life's on the line,

280
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,820
I won't say no.

281
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,620
[Yunxiao Heart Technique]

282
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,220
All right.

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,220
I've sealed the book.

284
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,860
If you've made up your mind,

285
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,660
just inject your spiritual power.

286
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,090
Even I

287
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,380
won't be able to open it.

288
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,460
If one day

289
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,220
you fulfill your promise,

290
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,250
I'll return the book

291
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,010
exactly as it is.

292
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,770
You trust me this much.

293
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,980
I'll give it everything I've got!

294
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,100
[Yunxiao Heart Technique]

295
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,700
Deal.

296
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,140
Sir!

297
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,180
Just follow the jade scroll's instructions

298
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,420
and you'll activate this array.

299
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,420
The sensory disruption feature

300
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,380
isn't fully developed yet,

301
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,860
but for pure defense,

302
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,940
it'll hold up just fine.

303
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,090
But...

304
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,980
What is it?

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,980
This array consists

306
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,420
of eighteen secondary disks and one core disk.

307
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,660
There are also

308
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,860
thirty-six positioning banners.

309
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,380
They're arranged in macrocosmic and microcosmic cycles,

310
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,010
calibrated with Hetu-Luoshu divination patterns,

311
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,860
and activated through the Primordial Eight Trigrams.

312
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,140
Setting it up takes serious effort.

313
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,220
If I had more time to refine it,

314
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,290
maybe

315
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,660
I could simplify it a bit.

316
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,940
No worries.

317
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,290
Next up,

318
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,140
let's talk

319
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,290
about artifact crafting.

320
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,860
These are

321
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,090
from a Level 2 Blackflood Drake?

322
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,530
Horns,

323

324
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,380
and venom!

325

every crafter dreams of!

327
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,980
You recognized them in a glance,

328
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,220
looks like I came to the right person.

329
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,570
How long will it take?

330
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,380
Half a month will do.

331
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,810
No problem, Han.

332
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,250
With these materials,

333
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,050
I can make several high-grade artifacts.

334
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,900
Oh yeah!

335
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,460

This one's good!

339
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,810
Done!

340
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,900
Not bad!

341
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,090
That's it!

342
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,810
Wait, did I mess up a step?

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,180
Guess I can't get careless with this.

344
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,250
I should've asked Qi Yunxiao for more details.

345
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,660
Now I'll have to wait

346
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,090
until I pick up the artifacts in two weeks.

347

[Ye Fei, meet me in the poplar woods. by Huang Long]

348

You should've just stayed buried.

351

Why drag your old crew back in?

352
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,810
Is my name something you can call so casually?

Back in Bamboo Sect,

354
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,660
you had to call me Young Master.

00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,090
Fine.

356
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,980

of the Great Deployment Art you stole,

359
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,090
I can convince the Master

360

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,900
All it does is control some puppets.

384
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,140
This technique enhances your spirit sense!

385
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,530
If cultivated properly,

386
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,620
you can control over a hundred puppets at once!

387
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,980
Over a hundred!

388
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,620
So what?

389
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,980
It also boosts your odds of forming a core!

390
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,180
It helps with forming a core...

391
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,010
Please, don't kill me!

392
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,660
No.

393
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,380
Tough luck for you.

394
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,900
In this life,

395
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,860
I'll never trust any body possessor.

396
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,980
So intricate.

397
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,530
Looks like it needs

398
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,090
Bamboo Sect's secret technique to work.

399
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,140
Could it be the Great Deployment Art?

400
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,620
If I ever get the chance,

401
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,530
I have to get my hands on it.

402
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,900
I'm the Master!

403
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,770
I am the rightful leader of Bamboo Sect!

404
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,290
I have the first four volumes

405
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,980
of the Great Deployment Art!

406
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,810
No.

407
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,900
If I don't remove this mark,

408
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,570
they'll find me sooner or later.

409
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,380
I need to figure something out.

410
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,490
That was clearly just a tree.

411
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,770
How is that the Young Master?

412
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,420
Greetings, Young Master!

413
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,250
Zhong Wu.

414
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,460
Zhong Shu.

415
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,770
You're with me now.

416
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,050
I will serve you to the death!

417
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,180
If I speak falsely,

418
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,420
may heaven strike me down!

419
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,570
May heaven strike me down!

420
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,010
Here,

421
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,140
take this.

422
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,010
This is the list

423
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,050
of Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Seven Sects.

424
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,660
Recruit every name

425
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,700
on this list for me.

426
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,380
Once it's done,

427
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,810
we'll meet at Yan Clan Stronghold.

428
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,660
Yan Clan Stronghold?

429
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,620
Congratulations, Young Master!

430
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,140
That means

431
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,570
Yue Kingdom is now

432
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,700
wide close for the taking!

433
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,380
Your grand plans are sure to succeed!

434
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,730
You mean "wide open," right?

435
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,180
Remember,

436
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,700
it's "wide open."

437
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,490
Shouldn't it

438
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,940
be "gate close"?

439
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,460
It really is just a tree...

440
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,300
[Yunxiao Pavilion]

441
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,980
Han!

442
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,010
You're right on time.

443
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,960
[Yunxiao Pavilion]

444
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,860
Take a look at this,

445
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,980
a flying artifact I forged

446
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,420
using Blackflood Drake fin and tail.

447
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,940
It doesn't offer much defense,

448
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,050
but it's incredibly fast.

449
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,140
I just

450
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,980
haven't had time to name it.

451
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,490
The fin contains

452
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,860
wind element power.

453
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,180
At this tier,

454
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,380
few artifacts can match its speed.

455
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,860
Wind Boat...

456
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,010
Let's call it Wind Boat!

457
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,810
What do you think?

458
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,140
Swift as the wind!

459
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,140
Great name!

460
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,570
Han,

461
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,460
check these out too.

462
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,900
These are Drake Daggers,

463
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,220
made from the Drake's fangs.

464
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,620
This is White Scale Shield,

465
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,250
crafted from its toughest outer scale.

466
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,660
And this one

467
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,010
is Azure Smoke,

468
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,420
condensed from the Drake's venom.

469
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,860
It should help you

470
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,010
catch your enemies off guard.

471
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,010
Qi,

472
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,570
you actually managed

473
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,980
to finish all this in fifteen days!

474
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,180
I'm seriously impressed.

475
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,860
I should be thanking you

476
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,770
to that Millennium Spirit Herb

477
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,090
Ruyin's condition has improved,

478
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,700
so I could focus on crafting these.

479
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,570
Ruyin?

480
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,620
You risked everything

481
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,810
just to save her.

482
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,530
She must be the one you love, right?

483
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,090
I bet you've got someone special too.

00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,460
[Yunxiao Pavilion]

485
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,380
Wind Boat...

486
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,490
A noble spirit within,

487
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,220
the wind carries me far and free!

488
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,730
You're the one

489
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,420
asking to see our young master?

490
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,010
Spit it out.

491
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,090
It's raining

492
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,730
and cold too!

493
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,460
Weather changes fast these days.

494
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,980
Bamboo Sect marked me with a tracking seal.

495
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,570
They'll keep hunting me down.

496
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,460
If Ghost Spirit Sect can shelter me,

497
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,010
I'll offer the Yellow Maple Valley map

498
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,010
in exchange!

499
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,570
Not bad.

500
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,980
You've come to the right place!

501
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,860
Bamboo Sect...

502
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,420
Boss!

503
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:44,940
Awesome!

504
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,010
My boss

505
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,940
is seriously amazing!

506
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,980
The hat.

507
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,770
You're not messing with me, right?

508
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,090
No way!

509
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,810
This issue is easy to handle.

510
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,620
Right?

511
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,290
So...

512
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,660
Relax, sir.

513
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,700
Someone's around. Run!

514
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,010
I didn't expect it.

515
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,220
You're not just a demonic spy,

516
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,050
you're with Bamboo Sect too!

517
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,810
Ye,

518
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,250
you've hidden too well all these years!

Wu,

520
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,810
you know too much!

521
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,420
All these years,

522
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,420
you've been blocking my profits.

523
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,010
I should've killed you long ago.

524
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,460
So this is who you really are.

525
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,700
I'll never let you off!

526
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,730
Kill him.

527
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,860
Kill him!

528
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,050
Die!

529
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,570

Han Li!

531
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,780
Go tell the Sect Leader

532
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,570
that he's a traitor!

533
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,530
He's working

534
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,420
with demonic cultivators disguised as Spirit Beast Mountain disciples!

535
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,820
Too late!

536
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,530
Die with him!

537
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,210

538
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,420
Grab me!

539
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,090
Take them down!

540
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,740
Mentor!

541
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,460
Hang in there!

542
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,820
My cavern's just ahead.

543
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,860
There are pills that can save you!

544
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,090
Forget about me.

545
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,300
There's no time...

546
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,130
Tell Master Zhong,

547
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,490
the demonic sects planted spies in the Seven Sects!

548
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,740
That Ye guy is one of them!

549
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,980
The other sects are probably infiltrated too.

550
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,570
Don't let them strike from inside and out!

551
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,570
And,

552
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,130
keep a close eye on Spirit Beast Mountain!

553
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,490
Enough talking.

554
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,610
Save your strength!

555
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,980
Mentor Wu!

556
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,170
Han Li!

557
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,300
Give it up.

558
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,010
That array won't protect you.

559
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,130
Today,

560
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,260
you won't make it out alive!

561
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,740
No matter how hidden this place is,

562
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,490
it's still Yellow Maple Valley territory,

563
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,780
full of powerful cultivators!

564
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,940
Aren't you afraid

565
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,090
someone might find out?

566
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,210
Still resisting on death's doorstep?

567
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,420
Kill him.

568
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,740
Blow it up!

569
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,980
Only running at 20% power,

570
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,490
and it's already this strong.

571
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,460
A fully restored array

572
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,820
will be perfect!

573
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,980
If I survive today,

574
