I'm here.

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,700
I won't let you die.

You...

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,810
Stop hugging me so tightly.

00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,010

Hurry.

40
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,370
She bites as well?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,060
Forget it.

42
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,340
Consider this my payment

43
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,780
for what I received from you that day.

44
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,060
It's him?

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,060
How come he has no power left?

46
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,850
Oh, no.

47
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,540
As my cultivation core was damaged,

48
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,500
I used Rebirth Art.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,980
I absorb power

50
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,170
from whoever touches me.

51
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,980
This is so embarrassing.

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,450
I need to make sure

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,660
he doesn't know I did it.

54
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,980
Perhaps

55
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,170
I can run away?

56
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,690
But he did save me.

57
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,890
If he tells everyone...

58
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,690
Whatever.

59
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,660
I'll just kill him later.

60
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,660
He sure

61
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,010
has many artifacts to save his life.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,100
That joke

63
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,380
somehow became a reality.

64
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,340
I wonder

65
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,690
if this is fortune or misfortune

66
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,100

Is this a dream?

70
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,900
Don't you always have a way to keep yourself alive?

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,490
Why did you get yourself into this state?

72
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,900
Master,

73
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:38,810
I'm fine.

74
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,220
Stop acting tough.

75
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,610
How old are you again?

76
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,700
You're acting tough like a grandfather.

77
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,780
What if

78
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,460
you can't find a partner because of this?

79
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,290
You don't have a partner either.

80
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,460
Excuse me?

81
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,170
I see you've grown

82
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,220
bold.

83
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,930
I learned it from you.

84
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,290
Brat.

85

87
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,490
that the one who understands me the most

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,660
would be you?

89
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,100
My last disciple.

90
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,780
Something is bothering you.

91
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,850
Tell me now.

92
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,140
What do you think

93
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,170
is more important

94
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,610
than one's life?

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,340
Our cultivators look for enlightenment

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,340
to achieve

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,460
immortality.

98
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,580
How should I put this?

99
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,020
Everything in this world

100
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,170
has a purpose.

101
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,540
The sun and the moon can exist for eons,

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,930
yet tiny creatures live and die within a day.

103
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,370
Enlightenment is formless.

104
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
It doesn't have one true answer.

105
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,340
For me,

106
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,410
enlightenment is achieving

107
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,610
true peace with myself.

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,460
Fu Yunzi

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,540

Liu Jing

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,140
wants absolute justice.

112
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,220
Our enlightenment

113
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,610
is defined by ourselves.

114
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,370
That's why they say if they find

115
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,930
enlightenment in the morning,

116
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,140
they are content to pass away in the same evening.

117
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,850
That's right.

118
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,700
You can enjoy your long life,

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,290
but don't lose yourself to time either.

120
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,050
Remember who you are

121
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,660
and your purpose.

122
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,100
Kid,

123
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,980
don't you still have many things to do?

124
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,370
Don't dally here.

125
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,020
Go now.

126
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,220
The world has many breathtaking views.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,370
Do admire them

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,290
on behalf of me.

129
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,420

130
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,460
What's happening?

131
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,130
Why is this happening?

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,850
You're awake.

133
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,010
Senior Nangong.

134
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,100
I saved you.

135
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,890
Why did you take my spiritual power?

136
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,180
What?

137
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,650
Who took your spiritual power?

138
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,610
You, Nangong Wan.

139
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,460
Nangong Wan?

140
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,890
You think I'm Nangong Wan?

141
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,980
You mistook me for my cousin.

142
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,010
I'm not Nangong Wan.

143
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,610
Who are you then?

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,220
I am

145
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,530
Nangong

146
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,490
Ping.

147
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,890
Nangong Ping.

148
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,890
You must be the man from Yellow Maple Valley.

149
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,890
Nangong Wan

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,010
told me everything.

151
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,130
Every...

152
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,130
Everything?

153
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,340
Yes.

154
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,340
Everything.

155
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,490
Not even a thick book

156
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,940
can contain the sins you've committed.

157
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,980
And the worst thing you did

158
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,180
is to give her an Ageless Pill.

159
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,340
Why?

160
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,980
Are you calling her old?

161
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,530
When I heard that, the first thing that came to my mind

162
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,220
was to capture you and feed you to a spiritual beast.

163
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,940
So you

164
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,460
repaid my kindness with vengeance,

165
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,010
and took away

166
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,820
my spiritual power?

167
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,490
You reap what you sow.

168
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,610
You did bad things

169
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,490
so it's on you.

170
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,850
This is just a lesson.

171
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,820
Don't play

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,340
hero again

173
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,180
and save a damsel in distress.

174
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,010
Her family

175
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,340
shares the same

176
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,850
complicated temper.

177
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,650
But she's right.

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,650
I can't be reckless.

179
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,700
Senior,

180
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,060
if you're her cousin,

181
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,850
then I suppose by saving her,

182
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,580
I have returned her the favor.

183
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,340
Please put your mind at ease.

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,820
But

185
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,180
I'm still a learning cultivator.

186
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,220
Whatever progress I made

187
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,300
is gone.

188
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,130
I don't know when my power

189
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,610
will come back.

190
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,460
Well, you aren't that bad.

191
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,180
You're quite smart.

192
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,980
You intervened yesterday

193
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,530
because you thought I was Nangong Wan.

194
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,490
Nonetheless, you came to my aid.

195
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,650
I will

196
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,980
repay this favor in the future.

197
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,130
Thank you.

198
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,770
I feel dizzy.

199
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,220
He fainted again?

200
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,130
I'm hungry.

201
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,890
I slept for a few days,

202
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,580
and my tummy is grumbling.

203
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,100
Is there any food here?

204
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,890
It's empty here.

205
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,250
Isn't there anything at all?

206
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,730
Do you

207
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,370
always bring these with you?

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,730
Thank you.

209
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,220
I have heard

210
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,300
that there was a gluttonous Core Formation Stage cultivator

211
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,250
who always brought cooking utensils with her.

212
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,850
It's her then?

213
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,700
I'm safe now.

214
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,850
However, my progress has regressed to the Qi Refining Stage.

215
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,940
Regardless,

216
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,610
it complements the Triple Cycle Core Rebirth nicely.

217
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,300
I guess it's meant to be.

218
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,340
Alas,

219
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,940
I have to do the same thing two more times

220
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,180
to reach the Core Formation Stage.

221
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,180
What is

222
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,610
that idiot cooking?

223
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,730
It smells good.

224
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,530
He can cook.

225
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,220
What?

226
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,300
Is he eating alone?

227
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,010
He won't invite me?

228
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,490
Senior Nangong.

229
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,100
This is an invigorating broth

230
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,370
made from spirit water and herbs.

231
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,490
Enjoy while it's warm.

232
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,420
What is this?

233
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,770
Flatbread.

234
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,460
Is it good?

235
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,340
It's my favorite.

236
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,850
I want one too.

237
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,530
I only made one.

238
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,420
Let me have a bite.

239
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,090
The mortals

240
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,090
believe cultivators don't need food.

241
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,660
We only take from nature.

242
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,290
Little do they know,

243
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,570
by combining

244
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,330
matching spirit water and herbs

245
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,980
and cooking them

246
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,980
over low heat,

247
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,420
we make a gourmet meal.

248
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,180
I didn't know you could cook.

249
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,460
You must have cooked a lot.

250
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm glad you like it.

251
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,420
Speak.

252
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,570
Why are you here?

253
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,940
What are you going to do next?

254
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,980
If she's not Nangong Wan,

255
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,860
I can't tell her

256
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,810
about the teleport array yet.

257
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,420
Yellow Maple Valley

258
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,090
has fallen into the demonic sects' hands.

259
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,700
I can't return.

260
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,140
Earlier,

261
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,530
I learned that there is

262
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,810
a gem quarry here owned

263
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,090
by the demonic sects.

264
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,290
However, it has weak security.

265
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,090
I wanted

266
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,730
to earn some easy gems

267
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,940
and go somewhere

268
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,810
remote and peaceful

269
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,730
for my cultivating.

270
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,090
But after this debacle,

271
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,250
my progress faded.

272
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,290
I'm afraid my plan will go to waste.

273
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,220
Is he trying to ask a favor from me?

274
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,660
Fine.

275
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,420
He did

276
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,420
help me.

277
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,860
I'll give him a second chance.

278
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,380
While it is indeed easy gems,

279
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,420
we're inside the demonic sects' territory.

280
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,460
You shouldn't take the risk.

281
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,620
You know what?

282
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,330
I can give you two options.

283
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,940
One, I'll give you some gems

284
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,620
and useful resources

285
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,010
to make up for your lost progress

286
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,050
and your timely intervention.

287
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,940
Two...

288
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,620
You come to the Moonshadow Sect with me.

289
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,940
Go to Moonshadow Sect with you?

290
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,290
Don't get the wrong idea.

291
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,250
I'm just thinking

292
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,730
that if you

293
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,290
study under our Core Formation Stage cultivators,

294
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,490
you may recover your progress

295
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,730
faster.

296
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,940
Our sect has a legacy of more than a thousand years.

297
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,180
We have secret arts

298
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,530
that outsiders do not know.

299
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,460
The technique

300
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,220
I used to absorb your power yesterday

301
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,900
is one of them.

302
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,620
Since you've helped me,

303
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,770
I'll put in some good words for you in front of Nangong Wan.

304
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,730
She won't object to this.

305
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,140
One option is so much better than the other.

306
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,290
Does she want me to go with her on purpose?

307
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,380
But to become her subordinate is...

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,730
So?

309
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,010
Have you made your decision?

310
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,980
Yes.

311
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,810
I appreciate your offer.

312
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,460
I'm used to autonomy,

313
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,810
so I'll have some gems with me.

314
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,330
As for my progress,

315
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,810
I

316
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,420
will find a way to recover it.

317
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,620
Don't worry.

318
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,940
That's a lot.

319
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,140
She sure

320
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,900
is generous.

321
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,180
All right.

322
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,330
It's too late for you to change your mind.

323
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,290
You've made up your mind.

324
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,090
I don't want to force you.

325
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,700
Just make sure

326
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,860
you won't regret

327
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,530
the decision you made today.

328
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,530
In that case,

329
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,620
I shall

330
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,010
take my leave.

331
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,770
Wait.

332
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,770
You're leaving like this?

333
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,250
Well,

334
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,460
you're weaker now.

335
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,730
You won't be able to fend those demonic cultivators off.

336
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,460
Let me eliminate them first

337
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,620
before you leave.

338
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,420
This array is decent.

339
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,420
You can trap enemies, hide away,

340
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,700
and do many things.

341
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,220
But you need something more offensive.

342
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,490
Thank you for the compliment.

343
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,660
It's made by a friend of mine.

344
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,700
That friend of yours

345
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,770
is probably a woman who hates fighting.

346
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,940
Kid,

347
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,220
I'll leave now.

348
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,380
Qi Refining Stage...

349
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,620
I have no choice but to go somewhere.

350
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,010
Young Master,

351
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,290
the fire in the stove was put out a while ago.

352
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,090
They must be far now.

353
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,490
How annoying.

354
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,220
That woman from Moonshadow Sect

355
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,530
recovered so quickly.

356
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,530
She even

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,940
had time to have a meal here.

358
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,770
She's mocking us.

359
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,730
How humiliating.

360
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,330
And I swear I knew

361
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,490
that masked man

362
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,660
who snuck into our team that day from somewhere.

363
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,940
Find out

364
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,460
where he came from.

365
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,220
Young Master,

366
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,220
I observed his technique

367
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,730
but I'm not sure what it was.

368
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,770
It's as if he knows

369
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,940
a bit of everything.

370
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,730
But why did Miss Xuan'er

371
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,490
help them?

372
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,140
Did she

373
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,980
know them?

374
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,420
She

375
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,250
knew them?

376
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,180
Moonshadow Sect.

377
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,730
Yellow Maple Valley.

378
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,490
Could it be

379
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,330
Han Li?

380
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,730
I knew it.

381
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,860
It's him.

382
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,940
That accursed man!

383
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,620
Young Master.

384
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,660
But you said

385
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,530
that

386
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,180
Han Li

387
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,810
had fled.

388
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,290
Why did he come back here?

389
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,290
I should have known

390
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,770
that he was close to that girl

391
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,180
from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

392
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,010
The Moonshadow Sect is meddling in now.

393
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,010
It's been a while.

394
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,140
And he's as cunning as ever,

395
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,220
sneaking around under my nose!

396
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,090
How perceptive of you, Young Master.

397
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,220
Think about it.

398
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,220
He came alone.

399
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,700
It'd be like catching an easy prey.

400
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,490
Congratulations, Young Master. You finally did it.

401
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,570
No,

402
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,380
your dream has finally come true.

403
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,980
He fled

404
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,700
before me today.

405
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,490
Do you find it funny?

406
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,140
No.

407
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,290
Tell everyone

408
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,810
to search for him within 500 li.

409
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,050
Dig deep underground if they have to

410
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,420
but I want him before me!

411
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,700
He has become my inner demon.

412
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,570
I need to torture him,

413
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,730
or I can't have peace of mind.

414
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,330
They won't expect me

415
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,700
to return to where it happened.

416
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,250
Now that

417
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,700
I'm in the Qi Refining Stage,

418
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,900
I need to repair the array quickly

419
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,770
before any undesirable changes take place.

420
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,420
I should make it quick.

421
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,420
Let's go.

422
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,940
It doesn't work.

423
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,770
Perhaps

424
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,290
it lacks charge?

425
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,290
All energy has been drained.

426
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,140
Seems like you have a big appetite too.

427
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,180
Forget it.

428
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,530
It's an emergency.

429
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,700
Young Master,

430
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,290
we have searched everywhere within 500 li.

431
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,730
This quarry is the only place left.

432
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,460
Young Master.

433
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:58,940
Young Master,

434
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,570
it's him.

435
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,250
He's there.

436
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,730
Han Li!

437
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,250
Young Master.

438
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,660
This is risky.

439
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,090
If I'm not wrong,

440
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,660
that

441
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,860
is an ancient teleport array.

442
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,980
Indeed.

443
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,420
Congratulations, Young Master.

444
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,460
Every sect is coveting

445
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,660
that ancient teleport array.

446
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,180
Offer it to the sect master

447
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,380
and you'll be rewarded.

448
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,180
So he

449
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,250
is a blessing in disguise.

450
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,490

451
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,980
Go.

452
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,810
Take him down.

453
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,460
Don't damage the teleport array.

454
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,250
Yes.

455
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,570

457
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,940
are leaving now.

458
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,140
It's him again.

459
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,010
Qu Hun.

460
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,660
Protect the array.

461
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,980
Careful.

462
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,420
Don't damage the array.

463
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,380
Of course.

464
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,620

465
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,420
Qu Hun,

466
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,570
offer your energy to the array!

467
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,730
What's taking them so long?

468
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,460
Young Master,

469
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,620
he has an array.

470
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,980
It can take hits

471
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,860
from Core Formation Stage cultivators.

472
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,460
Don't just stand there.

473
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,900
Break the array!

474
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,330
Desperate time

475
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,380
calls for desperate measures.

476
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,460
I'll use everything.

477

Puppets.

479
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,460
I didn't expect him to have so many tricks.

480
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,770
If he doesn't die,

481
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,180
he'll be a great threat.

482
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,050
Don't hold back.

483
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,570
Break the array immediately!

484
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,780

485
