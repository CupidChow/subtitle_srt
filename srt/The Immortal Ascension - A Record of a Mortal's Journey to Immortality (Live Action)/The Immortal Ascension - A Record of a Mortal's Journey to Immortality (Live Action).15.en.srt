Thank you for saving me, Mentor Hongfu.

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,620
Mentor Wu caught Ye

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,050
from the demonic sects.

33
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,620
He tried

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,410
to silence him.

35
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,180
I walked into it.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,770
I meant to escort Mentor Wu to my cavern.

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,290
However,

38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,570
that traitor still took his life.

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,770
Mentor Wu wanted me

42
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,930
to report it

43
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,980
to the Sect Master.

44

The demonic sects

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,100

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,460

53
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,410

I didn't expect

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,410
that after years apart,

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,380
you would become Huayuan's disciple

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,690
and reach the Foundation Establishment.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,220
I owe it to my master and mentors

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,820

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,730

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,700
are united as one.

194
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,980
We share glory and hardship.

195
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,530
The fight paid off.

196
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,650
I got the Great Deployment Art from Ye.

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,640
So all those wooden carvings of his

198
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,880
were actually puppets.

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,460
Don't move.

200
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,220
Something feels off.

201
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,940
You're jealous.

202
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,820
I'm carving you,

203
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,940
and you're jealous?

204
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,460
Play elsewhere.

205
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,060
Just go.

206
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,010
Go now.

207
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,460
Fine.

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,820
If you won't go,

209
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,610
I will.

210
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,130
I played the wrong tile.

211
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,580
Mine.

212
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,300
Hongfu.

213
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,980
West Wind.

214
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,980
West Wind.

215
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,610
Red Dragon.

216
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,650
Don't waste your time.

217
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,130
Four Characters.

218
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,490
This tile was carved from the bones of a Level 4

219
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,340
demon beast.

220
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,770
Specifically made to prevent cheaters like you.

221
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,700
No wonder I couldn't see anything.

222
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,130
Come on, old gambler,

223
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,700
we're betting on medicinal wine.

224
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,100
Do you have to be this guarded?

225
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,530
Look at you.

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,220
You live life

227
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,530
tight-fisted and stingy.

228
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,980
No wonder Fairy Nangong stopped coming.

229
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,100
Save it.

230
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,650
Nangong was unfortunately

231
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,610
injured.

232
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,460
Then, she fought

233
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,130
with that demonic spy.

234
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,060
Now she's healing.

235
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,420
Otherwise,

236
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,060
you wouldn't be sitting at this table.

237
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,980
You're just afraid I'll win.

238
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,580
Everyone knows in mahjong,

239
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,460
you feed the player before you,

240
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,460
block the one after you.

241
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,650
Stop the one across from you.

242
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,340
I wonder if Elder Han

243
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,530
thinks the same way about the three of us.

244
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,060
It was my failure to discipline the sect.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,130
I let a demonic spy slip into Spirit Beast Mountain.

246
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,650
So you're saying

247
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,060
you've already identified the spy?

248
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,420
A Qi Refining disciple named Zhong Wu.

249
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,220
He let the demonic sects

250
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,580
into the Bloody Trial Ground.

251
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,850
I wanted to interrogate him,

252
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,610
but he escaped

253
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,650
before I could catch him.

254
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,460
But I issued a wanted notice.

255
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,850
A Qi Refining disciple

256
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,850
managed to escape

257
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,060
from Spirit Beast Mountain?

258
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,820
And you still haven't found him?

259
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,700
Chick.

260
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,130
I'll do everything to find him

261
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,610
and clear the Spirit Beast Mountain's name.

262
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,650
You will have justice.

263
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,490
Draw a tile.

264
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,420
Nine Characters.

265
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,180
The name Zhong Wu reminded me

266
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,180
of something.

267
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,010
In my sect,

268
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,100
a Foundation Establishment cultivator

269
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,220
named Ye disappeared.

270
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,340
Before he vanished,

271
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,610
a disciple saw him

272
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,610
talking with two people

273
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,100
dressed like

274
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,700
Spirit Beast Mountain disciples.

275
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,730
Hurry up!

276
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,420
Come on!

277
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,460
Could it be

278
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,700
Zhong Wu again?

279
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,420
Sorry.

280
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,130
Self-draw.

281
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,580
Fu Yunzi, were you even listening?

282
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,300
I heard you.

283
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,420
But I was playing too.

284
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:21,980
Exactly.

285
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,650
We're discussing serious matters here.

286
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,060
It doesn't stop us from playing.

287
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,730
I won.

288
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,980
That was a winning hand.

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,010
You're cheating again.

290
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,980
What kind of...

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,490
Alright.

292
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,530
Just hurry up already.

293
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,180
You.

294
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,580
Come on.

295
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,100
Listen up.

296
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,650
Just like what Hongfu said,

297
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,580
that guy named Ye,

298
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,700
and also your guy,

299
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,490
Zhong Wu,

300
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,300
are lurking

301
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,100
all throughout the Seven Sects.

302
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,100
There are too many.

303
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,940
So,

304
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,530
we must all

305
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,060
stay alert.

306
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,130
Including against them.

307
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,610
What?

308
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,220
Can't I be a little sneaky at the game?

309
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,730
Hongfu,

310
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,580
Li,

311
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,490
and Fu Yunzi,

312
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,370
we've all been good friends for years.

313
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,700
The demonic sects are our sworn enemies.

314
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,300
I can't speak for others,

315
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,420
but as long as I live,

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,580
I won't let them take Spirit Beast Mountain.

317
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,940
Even though strange things have happened lately,

318
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,460
I, Hongfu,

319
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,220
have never once

320
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,300
doubted you.

321
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,490
Don't take

322
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,250
any offense.

323
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,700
Master.

324
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,010
- Xuan'er. - Just picked this for you.

325
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,610
I don't want it.

326
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,010
Mentor.

327
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,820
No.

328
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,010
We're busy here.

329
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,100
Off you go now.

330
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,250
Official business.

331
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,300
Go on.

332
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,220
Alright.

333
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,060
That kid

334
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,490
is sweet.

335
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,850
Yeah.

336
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,940
Given what happened today,

337
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,180
should we have the disciples leave the room?

338
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,730
Why?

339
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,980
She's fine.

340
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,700
She's not the type to care

341
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,650
about what we say.

342
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,220
Exactly.

343
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,890
My disciple just reached

344
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,770
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

345
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,180
Her progress has completely stalled.

346
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,100
It's driving me crazy.

347
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,700
That's easy, Hongfu.

348
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,770
Just find her a...

349
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,490
a companion.

350
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,460
A companion.

351
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:05,850
Master.

352
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,700
Mentor.

353
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,730
The Sect Master

354
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,820
wants you to have this.

355
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,060
What is it?

356
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,250
Blank tile.

357
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,580
[A wedding invitation from Yan Ruyan]

358
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,850
That's great news.

359
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,980
Hongfu, look.

360
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,250
Shouldn't Yellow Maple Valley send someone

361
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,340
with a gift as well?

362
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,460
They have a wedding.

363
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,460
Let me see it.

364
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,580
The Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold

365
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,940
is marrying off his daughter.

366
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,460
Ruyan is getting married.

367
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,690
Wonderful!

368
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,180
Oh, right,

369
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,850
Wu Xuan,

370
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,180
go gather the disciples.

371
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,250
Yes, Master.

372
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,730
Come on.

373
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,180
You sure you've got the right number of cards?

374
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,820
No.

375
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,370
This is all your fault.

376
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,420
The Great Deployment Art

377
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,940
can temper the spirit sense,

378
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,610
and help with the Projection Technique.

379
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,980
Even in battle,

380
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,530
it can control more puppets.

381
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,490
That's incredible.

382
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,770
I wonder what brilliant mind created this.

383
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,580
Get up!

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,940
I must expand my spirit sense a bit more.

385
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,420
Han Li.

386
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,130
Come over here.

387
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,490
Master is looking for me?

388
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,060
Over here.

389
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,820
Master.

390
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,770
You called?

391
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,010
We've been waiting.

392
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,890
Hurry.

393
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,580
Stand still.

394
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,100
Here's the thing.

395
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,060
The young Lord of Yan Clan Stronghold,

396
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,940
Yan Ruyan,

397
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,460
is getting married soon.

398
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,770
So,

399
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,580
the Lord of Yan Clan sent us an invitation.

400
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,530
Each sect needs to send representatives

401
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,980
to attend the wedding banquet.

402
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,890
Mentor Hongfu

403
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,370
is sending Xuan'er.

404
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,650
One more spot left.

405
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,820
Now tell me,

406
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,300
who wants to go?

407
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,180
Here, Hongfu.

408
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,140
Have some tea.

409
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,980
Never mind.

410
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,090
See?

411
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,570
Just as I thought.

412
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,980
Song Meng is too aggressive.

413
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,620
And Weiniang

414
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,730
is way too naive.

415
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,940
As for Jing,

416
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,050
he's too rigid.

417
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,220
Not very adaptable.

418
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,200
Now, you two...

419
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,180
Master.

420
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,330
My cultivation

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,940
is lacking.

422
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,010
I'm bad at socializing.

423
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,180
This mission is important.

424
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,530
You need proper etiquette,

425
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,250
and look after Senior Dong.

426
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,810
With all that,

427
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,530
Senior Wu is the best fit.

428
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,810
Get back here.

429
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,250
Who told you to leave?

430
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,660
What you just said was wrong.

431
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,620
Xuan'er reached her stage later than you.

432
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,380
By the rules,

433
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,530
she should be calling you senior.

434
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,700
Besides,

435
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,700
from what I've seen,

436
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,050
you two are the only ones

437
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,420
she really talks to.

438
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,380
So...

439
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,180
Hongfu,

440
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,810
you decide.

441
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,290
You want me to pick?

442
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,490
You make the call.

443
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,570
I pick Han Li.

444
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,940
That boy

445
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,250
isn't much to look at,

446
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,900
but he seems steady enough.

447
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,700
Hongfu, you have great eyes.

448
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,220
This kid

449
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,730
has always been levelheaded.

450
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,900
Reminds me of my younger days.

451
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,460
Alright then.

452
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,700
It's settled.

453
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,180
Indeed.

454
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,770
If there's nothing else, we'll go now.

455
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,570
Come on, Xuan'er.

456
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,900
We'll each prepare our gifts.

457
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,380
Sure.

458
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,940
Sure.

459
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,900
Han Li,

460
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,730
prepare

461
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,330
the gift.

462
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,380
Hongfu, I'll walk you out.

463
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,050
No need.

464
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,180
We're headed the same way.

465
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,700
Let's go.

466
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,420
Han,

467
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,860
it's a big responsibility

468
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,860
to protect Xuan'er.

469
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,660
Let's go.

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,420
Oh, right.

471
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,180
Prepare a proper gift.

472
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,530
- So naggy. - Let's move.

473
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,010
Just my luck.

474
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,140
Now I have to bring a gift too.

475
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,660
No way.

476
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,090
I must ask Master

477
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,180
for a reward in return.

478
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,810
I saw people from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

479
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,330
Does that mean Qing

480
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,250
came back too?

481
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,530
They delivered a wedding invite.

482
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,090
A wedding invite?

483
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,900
Yan Ruyan is getting married.

484
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,770
That is so sudden.

485
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,810
Lately, Ruyan has only been

486
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,330
focused on cultivating.

487
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,220
Marriage is the last thing on her mind.

488
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,250
Master,

489
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,380
about the wedding trip...

490
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,490
During this journey,

491
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,900
you must look after

492
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,900
your junior Xuan'er.

493
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,420
Do not give your Mentor Hongfu any reason to worry.

494
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,810
Your wish

495
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,860
is my command.

496
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,380
But the thing is,

497
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,570
I've only mastered one thing

498
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,050
that you taught me.

499
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,770
If something happens

500
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,420
on the road with Xuan'er,

501
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,900
I'm afraid I might not be much help.

502
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,140
You rascal.

503
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,570
You look so honest,

504
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,050
but you have plenty of schemes.

505
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,900
You sound like my disciple.

506
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,380
Come here.

507
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,140
I did promise to teach you

508
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,490
a new skill

509
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,090
upon reaching Foundation Establishment.

510
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,660
It's all here.

511
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,860
Pick one.

512
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,290
Thank you, Master.

513
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,140
Only one.

514
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,620
[Restoration Technique]

515
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,350
[Phantom Technique, Restoration Technique]

516
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,050
Restoration Technique.

517
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,490
Phantom Technique.

518
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,420
Both are pretty solid.

519
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,460
But they don't really

520
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,900
stand out in any special way.

521
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,250
The included techniques

522
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,900
are a shield and a phantom clone.

523
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,730
But those are part of the Cyan Sword Technique.

524
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
These two don't seem worth picking.

525
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,620
This silver page

526
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,140
looks a lot like

527
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,900
the golden one I found in the Trial Ground.

528
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,460
I wonder if

529
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,620
there's any connection.

530
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,570
Master,

531
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,180
I picked this one.

532
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,860
You've decided?

533
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,770
Are you sure?

534
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,180
I'm sure.

535
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,180
Out of all these techniques,

536
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,570
you picked none

537
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,250
and went straight for that one?

538
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,530
That's a surprise to me.

539
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,220
Do you have a sharp eye,

540
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,530
or just good luck?

541
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,330
Just lucky.

542
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,180
Alright then.

543
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,620
Hurry back and get ready.

544
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,770
Set out as soon as you can.

545
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,490
Yes, Master.

546
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,220
That's my disciple.

547
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,900
The golden page I got

548
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,660
and the silver one Master gave me...

549
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,730
This silver page

550
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,700
feels heavier than the gold one.

551
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,290
Channeling spiritual energy.

552
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,900
It's the complete Cyan Sword Technique!

553
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,290
Qingzhu Swarm Sword.

554
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,490
A Core Formation Stage treasure.

555
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,810
A full set has twelve swords.

556
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,380
Several sets can be

557
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,420
deployed at once.

558
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,180
If I can craft one too,

559
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,810
that will be amazing.

560
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,010
Triple Cycle Core Rebirth.

561
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,770
Is this an auxiliary art to the Cyan Sword Technique?

562
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,330
When I reach Tier 6,

563
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,620
as the peak of Foundation Establishment,

564
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,180
I must disperse my power.

565
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,810
Repeat this three times,

566
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,490
and Core Formation will be reached.

567
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,380
I started dispersing my power

568
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,330
at Tier 4.

569
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,810
So it was meant to compress spiritual power

570
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,860
and form cultivation core

571
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,220
Someone used this to overcome the Core Formation bottleneck...

572
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,570
The founder of the Cyan Sword Technique

573
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,140
was truly brilliant.

574
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,620
But then again,

575
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,250
this means I must redo it three times.

576
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,900
Can I really do that

577
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,250
in this lifetime?

578
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,530
You little rascal.

579
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,770
You should be

580
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,900
guarding the door.

581
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,860
Han!

582
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,700
It's us.

583
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,460
Han!

584
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,620
This cavern is huge.

585
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,810
What a nice place.

586
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,530
Really nice.

587
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,140
Han.

588
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,490
This cavern of yours is impressive.

589
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,700
Is that the spirit spring?

590
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,660
Spirit spring!

591
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,730
It really is.

592
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,660
Can't let them see my herb garden.

593
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,140
My seniors.

594
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,810
Look at this water.

595
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,620
Not bad, right?

596
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,050
I can't believe there is one here.

597
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,330
My seniors!

598
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,010
What brings you here?

599
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,420
Where is Senior Wu?

600
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,730
Wu Xuan is...

601
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,220
Han,

602
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,900
what gift are you bringing

603
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,980
to the wedding?

604
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,980
I almost forgot about that.

605
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,250
We're here

606
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,490
to help you brainstorm.

607
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,420
I heard the bride from the Yan Clan

608
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,660
is a cultivator from the Moonshadow Sect.

609
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,900
You're skilled in alchemy,

610
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,140
why not refine something

611
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,730
to aid in cultivation as a gift?

612
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,700
A gift

613
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,940
should be practical.

614
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,530
You're the one talking nonsense.

615
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,290
They are marrying off a daughter.

616
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,460
Han is skilled in medicine and herbs.

617
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,810
He should make

618
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,290
a nourishing beauty cream.

619
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,570
Now that's thoughtful.

620
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,420
Not everyone is staring

621
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,860
at the mirror all day like you.

622
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,660
I just saw you looking in the mirror.

623
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,090
Didn't I?

624
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,250
When did I look in a mirror?

625
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,860
Every day.

626
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,530
Alright.

627
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,530
We're trying to help Han.

628
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,620
Quit messing around.

629
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,290
Han.

630
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,940
No matter what you prepare,

631
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,810
just remember this.

632
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,620
You're representing Yellow Maple Valley.

633
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,570
I will keep that in mind.

634
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,460
One thing eludes me.

635
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,180
Seniors.

636
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,810
You seem very interested in this wedding,

637
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,620
so why did you dodge it

638
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,250
when Master asked?

639
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,090
Well...

640
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,730
Of course we want to go for fun.

641
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,900
But

642
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,140
didn't Mentor Hongfu name

643
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,180
Dong Xuan'er to attend?

644
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,140
It wouldn't

645
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,980
be right for us to go.

646
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,860
Since Dong Xuan'er is going,

647
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,050
Wu Xuan will go too.

648
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,660
Exactly.

649
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,660
- And they... - We don't want to see

650
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,770
them acting all lovey-dovey.

651
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,220
You know,

652
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,140
he'll be like this.

653
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,940
Yeah! Exactly.

654
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,730
Dong Xuan'er.

655
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,570
- Dong Xuan'er. - Right?

656
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,220
How many times have I told you guys

657
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,940
not to talk about Wu Xuan behind his back?

658
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,420
You bring him up every time.

659
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,940
He does this.

660
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,090
- Right? - That's exactly how he is.

661
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,000
- Am I wrong? - You shouldn't

662
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,730
badmouth him.

663
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,530
Come on.

664
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,530
Say it to his face, then.

665
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,810
Don't badmouth him

666
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,530
- behind his back. - Fine, I'll say it to his face!

667
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,010
Not this. I still need it.

668
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,570
The Mystic Shield.

669
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,330
That's my precious.

670
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,330
Where did you get it?

671
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,620
I really can't part with it.

672
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,770
It hurts my heart.

673
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,050
Those who want to go can't.

674
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,250
Those who don't still must cough up a treasure.

675
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,010
Maybe spirit herbs?

676
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,530
They aren't worth that much.

677
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,530
And I can grow more with the Green Vial.

678
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,220
You really don't waste any time.

679
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,570
You're giving it away?

680
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,330
Here.

681
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,290
Take a good look.

682
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,140
This spirit herb is over a hundred years old.

683
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,380
It's valuable.

684
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,020
And I'm just giving it away?

685
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,940
A barrier?

686
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,180
Han, are you there?

687
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,220
Open up and let me in!

688
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,980
It's me, Dong Xuan'er!

689
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,140
Come on, open the door!

690
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,850
Little guy,

691
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,610
you're way too cute.

692
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,700
Are you one of Han's friends too?

693
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,850
I'm also one of his friends.

694
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,980
My name is Dong Xuan'er.

695
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,420
Can you help me open the barrier?

696
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,570
Thank you.

697
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,140
Han?

698
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,460
Han!

699
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,770
How did you get in here?

700
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,220
Wow.

701
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,330
You'd betray your friends for a pretty face?

702
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:16,850
Come here.

703
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,740
Don't look.

704
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,330
She's got enchantment.

705
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,570
Don't look at her.

706
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,050
Come on.

707
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,380
Snap out of it.

708
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,050
Han,

709
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,660
I came to ask you for a spirit herb.

710
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,850
Every herb here has its purpose.

711
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,290
There are no extras.

712
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,330
Are you upset?

713
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,530
You're not happy going to the wedding

714
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,740
with me?

715
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,660
Don't think I don't know

716
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,610
what's on your mind.

717
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,140
You're annoyed with Senior Wu.

718
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,010
So, you're using me as a shield.

719
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,530
That's right.

720
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,140
You're the only one in this valley

721
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,460
who doesn't chase me around.

722
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,660
Of course I'm using you as a shield.

723
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,090
Since I don't chase you,

724
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,330
stay out of my business.

725
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,770
I'm not bothering you!

726
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,900
You're no fun.

727
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,180
Who'd want to go sightseeing with you?

728
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,010
It's just

729
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,140
no fun.

730
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,250
If my master hadn't said

731
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,530
it's safer with you,

732
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,010
I wouldn't want to travel with you at all.

733
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,700
Fine then.

734
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,530
Let's make some ground rules.

735
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,380
We each mind our own business

736
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,700
on the road.

737
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,700
Deal.

738
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,610
Can you really stick to that?

739
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,770
You spend all day with such a boring guy.

740
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,610
Poor little thing.

741
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,900
My master said we need to dress properly for the wedding.

742
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,380
Aren't you going to change?

743
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,220
I think this looks fine.

744
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,850
Guess I was too subtle.

745
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,610
I'll go get changed.

746
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,330
Alright, I'm off.

747
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,570
I'm leaving now.

748
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,930
I'll come play with you later.

749
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,740
Bye.

750
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,370
Look.

751
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,130
It's Han and Dong.

752
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,050
They are leaving for the Yan Clan Stronghold.

753
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,700
Han,

754
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,180
are you giving that spirit herb

755
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,370
to the bride?

756
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,290
Han,

757
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,980
do you know why I chose you

758
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,700
to come with me this time?

759
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,220
You already said it.

760
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,940
I'm your human shield.

761
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,330
That's true,

762
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,740
but there's another important reason.

763
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,740
Take a guess.

764
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,260
I have no idea.

765
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,940
Because you're the only one

766
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,460
who looks at me normally

767
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,260
and talks to me like a regular person.

768
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,890
Don't blame others for that.

769
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,460
Even dung beetles

770
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,660
are attracted to you.

771
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,220
It's not just dung beetles.

772
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,810
Look at the flowers, plants,

773
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,290
and your Treasure-Hunting Mouse.

774
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,370
They all like me too.

775
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,970
But still,

776
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,010
sometimes I really wish people

777
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,330
could treat me like they treat anyone else.

778
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,970
Ordinary life

779
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,100
is harder than you think.

780
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,810
Besides,

781
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,850
those seniors and juniors

782
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,700
try to please you

783
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,010
because of your enchantment.

784
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,810
They can't help it.

785
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,540
I see.

786
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,180
So in your eyes,

787
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,700
I'm someone who can't make friends

788
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,060
without using enchantment?

789
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,580
You know whether you used it or not.

790
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,290
Even my mouse

791
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,290
opened the gate for you.

792
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,890
I didn't use enchantment on it.

793
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,410
You didn't?

794
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,970
I'm done talking to you.

795
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,180
Right now, you just look plain and dull.

796
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,580
You're boring me.

797
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,740
Great.

798
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,450
But I have to warn you,

799
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,010
you shouldn't use enchantment carelessly.

800
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,580
You'll get yourself in trouble.

801
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,540
And how's that your business?

802
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,580
This enchantment is part of me.

803
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,540
It's not like I can choose to have it.

804
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm Feng Jun of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

805
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,660
Are you here for the wedding banquet?

806
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,410
Correct.

807
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,180
So it's Han and Dong from Yellow Maple Valley.

808
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,810
Wait here.

809
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,220
I'll register you and arrange your lodging.

810
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,260
Upper City.

811
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,970
Register them.

812
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,100
[Upper City]

813
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,700
Even the tokens are made of jade.

814
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,780
The Yan Clan Stronghold sure is extravagant.

815
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,620
Sorry for the wait.

816
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,330
This is your city access pass.

817
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,370
You can use it to stay at a designated inn.

818
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:36,850
Hold onto it.

819
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,850
Feng,

820
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,740
why are our tokens

821
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,780
different from theirs?

822
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,140
Apologies.

823
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,450
There are more guests

824
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,700
than we had expected.

825
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,450
Only the inns

826
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,100
in the Lower City still have rooms.

827
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,620
I see.

828
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,100
Why can't we stay in the Upper City?

829
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,660
Please don't worry.

830
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,890
Aside from the location,

831
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,220
all the inns were chosen

832
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,890
by the Lord of the Stronghold.

833
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,010
We've even arranged

834
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,540
a fireworks show tonight.

835
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,100
You'll both enjoy it.

836
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,850
Thank you, Feng.

837
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,850
Feng,

838
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,780
are the Upper City guest rooms really full?

839
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,620
Are

840
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,260
you

841
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,930
sure?

842
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,620
I'm such an idiot.

843
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,580
How could I let such a beautiful lady

844
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,580
stay in the Lower City?

845
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,290
Isn't there still one upper room left?

846
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,890
Let her have it.

847
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,540
Quick.

848
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,660
Here you go.

849
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,890
Thank you, Feng.

850
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,540
Who is that girl?

851
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,850
You're blaming me for using enchantment again, aren't you?

852
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,140
The gift of enchantment?

853
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,180
Could she be

854
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,740
connected to that old man?

855
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,370
Interesting.

856
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,290
Looks like it's about time someone taught that old man a lesson.

857
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,970
Mid Foundation Establishment Stage.

858
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:37,700
Don't look.

859
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,290
Let's go.

860
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,820
[Cloud Inn]

861
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,220
Shopkeeper.

862
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,290
One room.

863
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,490
Coming, sir.

864
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,490
Are you two staying together?

865
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,140
We'll stay separately.

866
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,700
Separately?

867
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,010
But I'm afraid we only

868
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,930
have one room left.

869
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,700
It's fine.

870
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,540
- Then... - You take it.

871
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,740
I'll stay elsewhere.

872
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,740
You're clearly avoiding me

873
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,850
to ditch me in any way you can.

874
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:04,930
Shopkeeper,

875
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,850
show me the room.

876
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,660
Right away.

877
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,330
Fine then.

878
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,970
Let's stick to the rules we agreed on.

879
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,060
We'll mind our own business.

880
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,810
Don't come looking for me.

881
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,060
All the guests here are from the Seven Sects.

882
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,850
There are even patrols outside.

883
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,540
It should be a safe place.

884
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,810
Let her calm down on her own.

885
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,410
I'll take a breather too.

886
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,810
Sir,

887
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,260
don't get upset.

888
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,410
Cheer her up.

889
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,660
She'll be fine.

890
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,060
No lasting grudges

891
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,660
between companions.

892
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,410
Exactly.

893
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,410
Sorry you had to witness that.

894
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,490
She's my junior,

895
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,890
not my companion.

896
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,890
Really not?

897
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,850
Are you sure?

898
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,620
Definitely not.

899
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,490
You lost the bet.

900
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,410
Hand over the gems.

901
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm Han Li.

902
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,660
May I know how to address you?

903
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,220
[Wuyouzi, Clear Void Sect]
Wuyouzi from Clear Void Sect.

904
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,010
[Ba Chushui, Giant Sword Sect]
Ba Chushui from the Giant Sword Sect.

905
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,100
You're

906
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,100
also here for the Yan Clan wedding?

907
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,010
Not exactly.

908
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,850
Han,

909
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,180
a word in private.

910
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,450
Please.

911
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,260
Han,

912
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,290
have you heard any rumors about the Yan Clan Stronghold lately?

913
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,970
They say this place

914
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,220
is haunted by an evil.

915
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,740
They feed on mortals and low-level cultivators,

916
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,010
killing for pleasure.

917
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,370
For the past three months,

918
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,890
people have died every night.

919
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,010
All while a Core Formation cultivator

920
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,850
was guarding this place?

921
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,540
The victims were mortals and low-level cultivators.

922
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,010
Lord Yan is too busy

923
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,970
marrying off his daughter.

924
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,930
But rumor has it

925
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,540
that to prevent evil from causing chaos,

926
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,780
during tomorrow's wedding,

927
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,370
Lord Yan will activate a powerful protective array.

928
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,260
As for the two of us,

929
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,330
we're here to catch the evil spirit.

930
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,660
If you're interested,

931
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,740
do join us, Han.

932
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,700
I just arrived,

933
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,620
and I need some rest tonight.

934
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,660
So I'll pass for now.

935
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,620
Goodbye.

936
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,660
Take care, Han.

937
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,450
Safe travels.

938
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,970
An evil spirit?

939
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,410
Feasting on mortals

940
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,810
and low-level cultivators?

941
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,580
I've never

942
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,850
heard of this before.

943
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,100
Just to be safe,

944
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,660
I'd better look around

945
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,330
and get a feel for the place.
