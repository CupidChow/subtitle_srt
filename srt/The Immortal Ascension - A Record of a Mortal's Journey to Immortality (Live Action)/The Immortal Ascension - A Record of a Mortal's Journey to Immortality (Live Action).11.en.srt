00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,730
You're looking for Solarflame Blossom?

193
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,490
Yeah.

194
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,850
That is

195
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
the whole reason I came here.

196
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,850
I'll take you.

197
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,580
That's great!

198
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,220
Thanks, Li!

199
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,340
Don't mention it.

200
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,420
It's on my way anyway.

201
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,610
Where can we find Solarflame Blossom?

202
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,940
It's not marked

203
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,700
on my map at all.

204
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,010
But they say

205
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,610
most spirit herbs in the Trial Ground

206
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,700
can be found near the central ring of mountains.

207
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,820
It shouldn't be a problem.

208
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,010
Something's off with that sound.

209
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,850
Cover your ears!

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,580
Run!

211
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,850
Jump!

212
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,330
Li,

213
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,200
that flying python looks strange.

214
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,810
It doesn't seem like a spirit beast here.

215
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,660
You're right.

216
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,010
That whistle earlier

217
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,220
must've come from its master.

218
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,220
He's hiding somewhere.

219
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,940
As far as I know,

220
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,290
in all of Spirit Beast Mountain,

221
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,180
only one senior raises that kind of beast.

222
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,290
His name's Zhong Wu.

223
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,140
Zhong Wu?

224
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,490
If he finds out

225
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,940
we killed his flying python,

226
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,330
he won't let us off easy.

227
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,180
Maybe...

228
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,140
we should...

229
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,660
just go around instead?

230
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,730
We're short on time.

231
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,050
You two've got some guts.

232
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,490
You killed my spirit python

233
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,050
and still dared to show up here?

234
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,530
Senior Zhong,

235
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,490
please let us pass.

236
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,050
We won't take a single herb from here.

237
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,010
It's all yours!

238
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,490
Spare me the sweet talk.

239
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,010
If you've got guts, come here.

240
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,860
Let's have a little duel.

241
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,420
Wait a second!

242
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,090
Are those shoes...

243
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,570
Cloud-Riding Boots?

244
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,620
Yeah.

245
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,420
Aren't those Feng Yue's?

246
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,330
Did he lose his mind and give them to you?

247
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,730
What's he wearing now then?

248
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,490
You know him,

249
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,980
so you should know

250
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,290
he'll never give them away.

251
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,900
So you're saying you killed that lunatic Feng Yue

252
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,620
and stole his boots?

253
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,570
What do you think?

254
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,250
That belt on you looks nice too.

255
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,700
Hey, hold on!

256
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm not done talking yet!

257
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,420
Step back!

258
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,050
Back off!

259
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,220
I said I'm not done!

260
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,460
I actually think my junior has a point.

261
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,860
It's fate we crossed paths.

262
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,420
Who knows? Maybe later,

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,010
we'll need each other.

264
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,460
So what are you offering?

265
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,090
A map.

266
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,900
Each sect's map of the Bloody Trial Ground

267
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,460
is unique.

268
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,090
I happen to have a version

269
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,090
from Spirit Beast Mountain.

270
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,010
You can consider

271
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,860
trading me Yellow Maple Valley's.

272
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,290
Not a bad deal, right?

273
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,730
Spirit Beast Mountain's map?

274
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,940
Miss Han already has one.

275
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,290
We don't need to see yours.

276
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,220
You do?

277
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,050
I forgot about that.

278
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,730
Then how about one

279
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,730
from the Saber-Shearing Sect?

280
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,770
How do I know it's real?

281
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,050
No deal.

282
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,050
How can I scam you?

283
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,900
Tell you what,

284
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,620
I'll throw in

285
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,460
Skyfort Castle's too.

286
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,700
Two for one.

287
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,090
There's no way

288
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,290
I can make so many different ones.

289
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,660
Am I right?

290
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,010
Deal?

291
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,570
Okay then.

292
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,460
I'll count to three,

293
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,290
and we exchange at the same time.

294
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,730
Three,

295
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,490
two,

296
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,290
one!

297
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,050
We agreed to do it together!

298
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,090
What kind of deal is this?

299
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,730
He got away again!

300
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,530
Yu,

301
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,330
where do you think he could've gone?

302
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,810
Who knows.

303
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,570
That kid sure runs fast.

304
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,730
Oh, it's you.

305
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,980
You scared us!

306
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,420
So,

307
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,460
where's my Blood Spirit Flower?

308
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,940
We did what you asked.

309
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,050
Now what else do you want?

310
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,700
Besides the flower,

311
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,620
we're also supposed to take out

312
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,140
elite disciples from the Seven Sects.

313
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,570
Did you forget about that?

314
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,090
The two of us

315
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,770
have already killed plenty of them.

316
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,730
What about you?

317
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,620
On the surface,

318
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,140
I'm still part of Spirit Beast Mountain.

319
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,620
It's hard for me to make a move directly.

320
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,050
That's why I need you two!

321
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,900
Just now,

322
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,460
I ran into a guy and a girl.

323
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,900
The girl's from Spirit Beast Mountain.

324
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,220
The guy's from Yellow Maple Valley.

325
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,860
I saw them both gathering

326
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,660
quite a few spirit herbs.

327
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,380
Now tell me,

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,330
you two got any ideas?

329
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,090
Need me to spell it out?

330
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,290
Why don't you

331
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,050
go take them out,

332
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,180
grab their herbs,

333
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,290
then we each get a cut.

334
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,250
You get it now?

335
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,530
What does he look like?

336
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,380
Tall and skinny,

337
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,010
pretty plain-looking.

338
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,810
Plain-looking?

339
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,810
Where are they now?

340
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,090
That girl

341
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,570
was looking for medicine for her brother.

342
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,490
So they're probably headed

343
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,770
to the Solarflame Cave

344
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,380
to hunt for spirit herbs.

345
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,250
Ambush them before they get there.

346
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,330
Their cultivation is weak,

347
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,050
weaker than you think!

348
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,940
That's all from me.

349
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,940
Everyone,

350
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,250
disciples are dying unusually fast.

351
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,900
Did none of you notice?

352
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,220
Now that the Trial Ground opens once every 60 years,

353
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,860
they'll fight tooth and nail for herbs.

354
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,660
The bloodshed this time

355
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,050
will be worse than ever.

356
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,980
Elder Han,

357
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,250
didn't we all go through this back in the day?

358
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,980
Relax, everyone!

359
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,860
They'll be fine!

360
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,820
[Bloody Trial Ground, Day 4]

361
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,810
It's so dark.

362
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,900
I can't see a thing.

363
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,570
In a place like this,

364
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,700
if we don't follow the stars and markings,

365
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,050
we're bound to get lost.

366
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,330
What do we do now?

367
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,530
It's the Solunar Purification Pearl!

368
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,090
Three days have passed.

369
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,570
That Pearl

370
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,380
was made specifically

371
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,860
to cut through the Trial Ground's mists.

372
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,620
With it,

373
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,010
we won't lose our way!

374
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,490
Found it!

375
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,090
That way!

376
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,620
Solarflame Blossoms!

377
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,980
A whole field of them!

378
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,940
Run!

379
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,140
Nowhere left to run, huh?

380
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,700
You want Solarflame Blossoms?

381
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,900
I won't let you have them!

382
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,810
No!

383
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,570
Solarflame Blossoms...

384
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,770
Solarflame Blossoms...

385
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,050
Not a single flower left...

386
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,940
They fought way too viciously.

387
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,140
And their techniques

388
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,700
aren't from the Seven Sects at all.

389
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,220
They're not from Spirit Beast Mountain.

390
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,220
Then who are they?

391
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,180
Stop crying.

392
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,010
There's still one left.

393
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,770
Thank you!

394
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,700
Li,

395
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,180
I saved this flatbread for you.

396
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,050
Take it!

397
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,140
It's dangerous here.

398
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,140
Let's go.

399
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,140
Li,

400
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,940
how can I ever thank you?

401
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,620
Once we're out of here,

402
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,140
make me a few flatbreads!

403
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,700
Flatbreads?

404
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,580
[Bloody Trial Ground, Day 5]

405
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,570
We're almost there.

406
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,290
Let's move.

407
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,290
I've gathered the Violet Monkey Blossom and Jade Marrow Mushroom.

408
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,900
Just need the Celestial Essence Fruit now.

409
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,050
According to the map,

410
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,420
it should be right around here.

411
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,810
But I don't see it anywhere.

412
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,250
Maybe someone else have picked it?

413
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,290
Time's running out.

414
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,810
Let me check this place

415
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,420
for any unripe sprouts.

416
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,140
Even spirit sense can't get through it!

417
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,420
I'll take a gamble.

418
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,380
This should be the stone temple mentioned in the records.

419
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,730
This place actually blocks spirit sense.

420
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,940
Everyone, stay alert.

421
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,530
We'll give it our all, Grandmaster!

422
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,660
Yu, Qing,

423
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,940
you two stay behind

424
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,180
and keep searching for the Blood Spirit Flower.

425
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,620
This concerns Yan Ruyan's life

426
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,290
and our relationship with the Yan Clan Stronghold.

427
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,660
We must not take it lightly.

428
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,140
Yes, Grandmaster!

429
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,620
All others,

430
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,570
stick close to me!

431
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,490
It's so strange.

432
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,490
I can't even scan this place with spirit sense.

433
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,860
There's only one path

434
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,220
all the way through.

435
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,860
If I'm surrounded here,

436
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,420
I'll have no way to escape.

437
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,090
No,

438
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,730
I can't take that risk.

439
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,860
I'll search elsewhere.

440
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,380
No!

441
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,220
Someone's here!

442
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,380
It's a dead end!

443
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,570
What is this?

444
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,050
Grandmaster,

445
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,730
they say the Blackscale Python here

446
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,660
is a Tier 1 demon beast.

447
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,180
Is this place even safe?

448
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,330
Stay calm.

449
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,730
Stick to the plan.

450
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,700
Leave everything to me.

451
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,700
Grandmaster?

452
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,180
A Core Formation cultivator's here?

453
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,900
It's her.

454
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,980
It really is here!

455
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,010
All of you, listen up!

456
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,010
From this moment on,

457
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,940
lock down the area.

458
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,980
Guard all sides.

459
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,980
Form the array!

460
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,700
Yes, Grandmaster!

461
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,730
There really is a Celestial Essence Fruit!

462
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,700
I have to find a way to get it.

463
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,570
Is that the Blackscale Python?

464
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,250
It doesn't quite match the illustrations.

465
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,860
What a fierce fight!

466
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,090
Tough luck

467
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,290
running into me!

468
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,570
I don't care which sect you're from.

469
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,420
If you miss the teleport window tomorrow,

470
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,050
you're stuck here for another sixty years!

471
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,330
This beast's scales are tough as nails.

472
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,330
Regular spells do nothing to it.

473
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,180
At my command!

474
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,940
Activate the array!

475
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,770
Yes, Grandmaster!

476
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,620
Impressive indeed!

477
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,380
It doesn't seem that hard to handle.

478
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,490
Grandmaster,

479
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,980
what kind of demon beast is that?

480
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,860
No...

481
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,980
It's not a Blackscale Python.

482
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,730
It can shed its skin and evolve

483
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,090
into a Blackflood Drake!

484
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,090
It's now Tier 2.

485
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,900
A Tier 2 demon beast?

486
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,130
That's about the Mid Foundation Establishment Stage!

487
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,090
Should I abandon the Celestial Essence Fruit?

488
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,940
No need to panic.

489
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,170
Form up!

490
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,460
Retreat!

491
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,860
You're no match for it!

492
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,780
Grandmaster!

493
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,940
The path is blocked!

494
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,340
We're sealed in!

495
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,260
There's no way out now!

496
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,780
You wretched beast!

497
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,650
Only one left?

498
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,090
Can she take it alone?

499
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,090
If you don't come out now,

500
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,380
you're not getting out at all!

501
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,900
Step outside and I'll die.

502
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,690
Stay hidden and you'll still die!

503
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,300
What are you waiting for?

504
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,010
Run!

505
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,650
You're pretty slick,

506
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,570
hiding all this time and not making a move?

507
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,260
I was afraid you'd kill me for my treasure.

508
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,260
You're so young,

509
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,340
but already this scheming?

510
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,210
Not afraid you'll end up friendless?

511
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,420
If I weren't this scheming,

512
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,210
I'd be dead ten times over by now.

513
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,820
There wouldn't be a later.

514
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,210
I'm low on spiritual power.

515
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,900
This won't hold it much longer.

516
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,010
If you've got something, use it now!

517
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,300
I do have

518
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,690
one more talisman treasure.

519
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,740
Then what are you waiting for?

520
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,460
Hurry!

521
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,130
Senior!

522
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,570
I need time to activate it!

523
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,650
You'll have to hold it off!

524
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,460
I'll do my best,

525
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,740
but you'll have to draw it away first!

526
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,740
You ready yet?

527
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,610
Do I look ready to you?

528
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,980
Why don't you take over?

529
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,010
Now you know how it feels to be left hanging?

530
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,260
Move it!

531
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,530
This is the Golden Brick Talisman,

532
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,820
my shop's finest treasure!

533
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,610
It's a bit slow

534
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,340
to activate,

535
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,490
but it's far

536
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,530
from ordinary.

537
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,570
Senior!

538
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,860
Bear with me!

539
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,380
This is all I've got left!

540
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,690
Faster!

541
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,980
You monster!

542
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,090
Get down!

543
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,340
It's insanely strong!

544
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,650
I can't hold on much longer!

545
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,570
Hurry!

546
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,170
I'm going as fast as I can!

547
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,380
Faster!

548
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,090
Faster!

549
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,050
Go!
