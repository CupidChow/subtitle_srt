00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,180
See that?

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,780
They are inside the cave.

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,890
I don't care if you

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,810
have to dig. Just bring him to me!

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,380
Young Master,

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,890
the cave system

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,860
is convoluted.

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,530
The tunnels are windy.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,000
The bends are sharp.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,690
Straight to the point!

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,260
It will be difficult to find them.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,020
It will be easy to find them.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,170
How can I say it's difficult

38
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,850
when I haven't tried?

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,780
But Young Master,

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,100
you see,

41
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,180
those vermin

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,370
are no threat.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,130
Just leave them be.

44
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,620
Vermin?

45
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,410
Zhong Wu,

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,090
you finally said something right for once.

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,770
Vermin.

48
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,130
We should

49
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,770
treat them

50
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,820
like vermin.

51
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,580
Right?

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,410
My friends,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,900
I suppose this is all the demonic sects could do.

54
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,850
They can't do anything

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,130
if we hide in this mountain.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,130
That's right.

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,850
Unless

58
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,050
they can move the mountain.

59
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,740
Or better yet,

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,210
blow the mountain up!

61
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,620
Earthquake Talisman?

62
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,380
Young Master, you can't do that.

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,930
If you use the Earthquake Talisman,

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,570
this quarry will be all gone.

65
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,900
Your aunt will be angry.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,660
She

67
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,260
will be angry?

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,980
More reason for me to blow it up, then.

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,980
But,

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,100
what about our people in there?

71
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,490
Die!

72
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,410
Quick!

73
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,330
Run inside the cave!

74
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,210
- Go! - Hurry!

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,380
- Quick! - Quick!

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,620
Hurry up!

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,850
Are those people out of their minds?

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,940
They used an Earthquake Talisman on their own quarry.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,170
Now that the quarry is destroyed,

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,730
no one will know we were ever here.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,540
We just have to survive until the earthquake is over.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,570
You're right.

83
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,940
Once we get out,

84
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,940
I'll buy you a drink.

85
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,380
Lv,

86
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,690
come.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,450
Let's go.

88
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,340
Who's there?

89
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,730
Show yourself now.

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,890
Oh, no.

91
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,850
I ran into them again.

92
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,130
It's me, Han Li.

93
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,380
Is this Senior Lv and Xuan?

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,260
Yes.

95
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,460
Han.

96
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,100
Come join us.

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,850
I have no choice but to meet them.

98
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,780
Seniors,

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,050
I'm so glad

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,610
you're safe.

101
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,900
I knew you could make it, Han.

102
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,020
What did I tell you?

103
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,140
Han

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,140
would surely make it out alive.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,540
Han,

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,020
did you

107
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,410
find any other cultivators?

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,850
Not at all.

109
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,490
The ground is shaking.

110
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,490
I'm fortunate enough to have escaped.

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,020
Luckily, Yellow Maple Valley

112
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,900
has a Soul-Burning Spell.

113
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,370
We can locate and help

114
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,900
each other

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,900
in times of need.

116
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,660
My senior, Chen,

117
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,700
is also very powerful.

118
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,020
She has many high-grade artifacts,

119
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,140
and I'm looking for her.

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,020
See you.

121
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,220
Hold on.

122
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,810
I've heard of your

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,900
Soul-Burning Spell,

124
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,050
but I've never witnessed it.

125
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,850
We are reunited here

126
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,980
by fate.

127
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,900
Why don't you join us?

128
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,140
We can

129
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,140
look after each other.

130
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,370
He's right.

131
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,930
Perhaps we should

132
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,700
find a way out together.

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,290
And then,

134
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,930
we can find your senior.

135
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,460
Staying together

136
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,580
makes it safer.

137
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,370
What do you think?

138
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,810
Sure.

139
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,020
Seniors,

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:14,930
you have

141
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,370
my gratitude.

142
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,250
Han.

143
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,290
Come.

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,100
Once we leave this place,

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,930
they will kill me to silence me.

146
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,700
I need to find a way

147
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,250
to get rid of them first.

148
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,050
It's not him.

149
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,140
There's one over there.

150
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,980
Young Master.

151
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,730
I...

152
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,810
I was just telling him

153
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,170
to look harder,

154
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,850
to think harder

155
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,900
about where he could be.

156
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,700
He's an idiot.

157
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,340
You there. Come here.

158
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,250
Did you see someone from Yellow Maple Valley?

159
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,050
He's this tall.

160
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,980
Wait. He's dead.

161
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,700
He should be this long on the ground.

162
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,290
He's just a plain guy. Did you run into

163
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,980
someone like him?

164
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,610
No?

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,610
Bugger off.

166
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,050
Young Master,

167
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,140
this robe

168
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,220
belongs to the Clear Void Sect,

169
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,610
not Yellow Maple Valley.

170
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,250
I know.

171
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,460
I couldn't find our target,

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,660
but I came across

173
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,330
a gem vault inside.

174
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,960
Young Master.

175
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,980
Young Master.

176
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,220
I can make you proud.

177
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,660
Young Master,

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,730
I know what you're looking for.

179
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,370
You're looking for a dead man by the name of Li.

180
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:58,930
Did I get it right?

181
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,100
No.

182
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,660
He's not here.

183
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,810
How did you know?

184
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,660
Someone like him

185
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,410
will never die

186
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,780
next to a fool.

187
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,810
You know him very well.

188
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,460
But this is not important.

189
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,050
I have great news.

190
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,580
You see, over there...

191
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,020
You found the place

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,020
where the Yan Clan hid their gems.

193
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,170
How did you know?

194
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,460
Knowing my father-in-law,

195
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,980
it would be odd if he didn't have

196
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,490
a hidden gem trove.

197
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,700
How wise of you, Young Master.

198
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,490
It will still do nicely.

Take everything.

They will be my wife's dowry.

202
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,660
That's what he gets for putting me

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,290
on clean up duty.

204
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,930
So he knew it wasn't here.

205
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,810
Yet he blew this place up.

206
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,490
He is heartless.

207
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,460
What's the matter, Han?

208
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,130
Nothing.

I'm just a bit paranoid.

Worry not, Han.

211
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,130

Come.

214
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,300
We should check it out.

It's Luo from Moonshadow Sect!

yet agile.

234
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,100
It is fast.

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,250
We can't run away from it.

236
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,940

to keep the spider trapped.

was the gems.

00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,490
Senior Chen,

389
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,380
you're awake.

390
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,050
Put me down.

391
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,250
Are there any survivors?

392
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,530
I didn't see anyone.

393
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,530
Xuan Yue and Lv Tianmeng

394
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,730
never appear.

395
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,010
They

396
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,290
must have snuck into the gem vault

397
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,620
and looted that place

398
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,700
before running away.

399
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,900
Even if they are alive,

400
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,010
they most probably

401
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,570
won't show their faces.

402
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,700
Her reasoning

403
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,730
saves me an explanation.

404
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,770
No one

405
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,700
knows they are both

406
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,900
dead.

407
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,570
Han.

408
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,820
Rinse yourself.

409
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,940
Is she thinking about what happened in the past?

410
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,900
Han,

411
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,900
I know you don't like me

412
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,010
because of Lu Mingyuan.

413
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,460
But I am the eldest daughter of my family.

414
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,780
I don't have a say in certain matters.

415
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,010
I met a bad person

416
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,340
and...

417
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,530
Anyway,

418
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,780
let's forget it.

419
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,780
Good.

420
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,490
She didn't recall everything.

421
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,900
It happened

422
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,570
a long time ago.

423
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,300
Besides, Lu Mingyuan started it first.

424
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,530
However, killing one of my own

425
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,740
is not exactly a good thing to do.

426
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,490
You've always impressed me.

427
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,460
As a rogue cultivator

428
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,860
with a fake spirit root,

429
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,650
you have mastered many techniques.

430
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,530
You must have trained very hard.

431
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,300
Senior Chen,

432
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,130
why are you talking about this?

433
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,490
I envy you.

434
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,300
I envy your freedom

435
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,740
and your defiant spirit.

436
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,130
I know

437
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,690
that coming from me, this may make you think

438
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,420
that I'm taking

439
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,780
my prestigious background for granted,

440
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,010
or that I'm diminishing your effort.

441
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,530
But...

442
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,380
What am I rambling about?

443
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,900
I hope

444
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,260
you don't find me weird.

445
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,380
Lu Mingyuan

446
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,530
bullied me many times.

447
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,740
You

448
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,780
intervened

449
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,090
many times as well.

450
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,940
I know

451
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,610
you're not like him.

452
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,380
What a relief.

453
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,050
I thought you didn't like me.

454
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,570
Why would I?

455
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,130
So why

456
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,650
do you want to be a cultivator?

457
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,090
Is it because of your family too?

458
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,170
You can say that.

459
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,090
But it's not the only reason.

460
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,570
So what's your reason then?

461
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,900
If I have to pick a reason...

462
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,860
It's probably because of some bread.

463
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,650
Bread?

464
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,130
Flatbread?

465
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,050
Do you like flatbread?

466
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,940
This is my first time

467
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,090
hearing that someone becomes a cultivator for flatbread.

468
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,210
You're intriguing.

469
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,530
Are you injured?

470
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,500
Come.

471
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,340
My brothers are quite naughty.

472
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,740
When they get hurt,

473
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,170
I'll

474
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,380
patch them up.

475
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,570
Do you have a sister?

476
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,050
I have a younger sister.

477
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,740
She loves flatbread more than I do.

478
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,010
Does it still hurt?

479
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,050
I appreciate your help.

480
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,980
Let's go.

481
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,010
I don't see

482
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,610
traces of demonic sects here.

483
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,460
We should be safe.

484
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,130
Just a bit more

485
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,050
and we will enter

486
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,530
the area guarded by the Seven Sects before nightfall.

487
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,530
We don't usually hang out,

488
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,340
but when we meet,

489
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,340
I see the determination in your eyes

490
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,690
as if nothing can sway you.

491
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,300
You

492
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,050
must have

493
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,650
an unwavering will.

494
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,210
I want that too.

495
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,980
But I don't even have the option.

496
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,050
I thought

497
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,460
I could gladly accept whatever my family arranged for me.

498
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,210
But after Lu Mingyuan,

499
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,340
I became afraid.

500
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,010
I'm afraid of not having a choice

501
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,090
and being ordered around.

502
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,130
Was that why you came to the front line?

503
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,340
I don't know if this is the right decision,

504
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,010
but I want to try.

505
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,340
Right decision

506
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,690
or not,

507
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,340
it's not important.

508
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,780
What is important then?

509
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,010
Being

510
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,780
yourself

511
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,690
is very important.

512
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,860
Being myself?

513
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,570
No one

514
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,300
gets to tell you what a right or wrong decision is.

515
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,300
Only you can do that.

516
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm hungry.

517
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,780
Han,

518
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,090
do you want some?

519
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,210
Is it edible?

520
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,940
It's delicious.

521
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,110
Han,

522
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,530
you've always been a lucky person.

523
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,760
I owe this escape to your warning.

524
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,610
Anyway,

525
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,340
how did you

526
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,260
escape from the quarry?

527
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,570
I remember

528
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,300
you have some puppet beasts.

529
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,180
Why is she asking so many questions

530
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,090
despite knowing all that?

531
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,130
Perhaps

532
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,530
we can travel together

533
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,940
and serve at the front line.

534
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,260
No way.

535
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,300
Sure.

536
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,570
If you wish.

537
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,170
Also,

538
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,460
your injury hasn't healed completely.

539
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,860
You should take some pills

540
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:31,690
and rest up.

541
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,460
Sure.

542
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,650
That's too much.

543
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:48,490
No worries.

544
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,010
I have

545
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,530
a lot of them.

546
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,650
They are extra potent Oblivion Pills.

547
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,340
Forgive me,

548
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,210
Senior Chen.

549
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,130
Please forget everything

550
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,740
that happened in the quarry.

551
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,820
I can't let anyone know about the teleport array

552
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,170
and the gem vault.

553
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,820
All right.

554
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,740
She should be safe now.

555
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,980
I've spent a lot

556
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,170
of power

557
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,050
after those grueling battles.

558
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,260
I need to find a place to recuperate

559
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,130
and reinforce my training

560
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,010
before I head into the war.

561
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,010
Returning to

562
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,740
Yellow Maple Valley right now isn't a great idea.

563
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,010
Golden Drum Plains it is.
