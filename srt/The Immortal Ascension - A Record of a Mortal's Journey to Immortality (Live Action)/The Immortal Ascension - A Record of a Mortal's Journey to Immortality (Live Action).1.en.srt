00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,980
Why do I

188
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,730
feel giddy?

189
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,060
What's wrong with the water...

190
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,650
Zhang Tie?

191
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,500
Wake up.

192
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,260
Wake up.

193
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,770
You guys are young indeed.

194
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,900
You regained consciousness already.

195
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,410
What have you

196
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,620
put in the water?

197
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,900
Divine Grass Dew.

198
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,180
It acts as a deodorant.

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,820
You guys can take a sniff.

200
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,260
See if you still smell.

201
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,130
The stench on you two

202
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,330
wasn't sweat.

203
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,940
You guys just reeked.

204
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,980
You two reeked of mortal stench.

205
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,900
Mortal stench?

206
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,100
Mortals consume grains.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,820
They cannot absorb the essence of Heaven and Earth.

208
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,930
Instead, they gather all the impurities in their bodies.

209
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,620
Of course they stink.

210
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,450
Don't you two

211
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,820
feel any different?

212
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,980
Don't you guys feel spirited and refreshed?

213
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,380
Blockhead.

214
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,620
I do think I smell nice now.

215
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,820
My head doesn't feel heavy anymore.

216
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,570
I suppose I feel much more better now.

217
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,260
Brat, I could tell that you came with a motive in mind

218
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,260
at first glance.

219
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,460
Was it that obvious?

220
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,350
I couldn't care less about

221
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,260
that little motive of yours.

222
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,740
I can save you or destroy you

223
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,930
with just a lift of my fingers.

224
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,850
Want to give it a try?

225
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,100
No.

226
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,540
He'll chase me away if I keep this up.

227
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,260
Physician Mo, thank you for taking us in.

228
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,690
You're our savior.

229
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,340
I promise, we'll do as you say.

230
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,570
We won't upset you.

231
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,610
Don't be scared.

232
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,940
I intimidated you guys

233
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,450
so that you two

234
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,610
would know

235
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,890
who calls the shots here.

236
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,410
There are only three rules here.

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,890
First rule,

238
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,540
you must be mindful of every matter

239
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,010
in this valley.

240
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,730
Second rule,

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,060
do not make contact with those fools outside.

242
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,290
Third rule,

243
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,100
and the most important rule,

244
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,890
I'll teach you guys a mantra.

245
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,340
You guys have to memorize it and practice it constantly.

246
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,410
I'm serious.

247
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,340
If you cannot follow these three rules,

248
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,540
you'd better scram

249
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,500
and don't waste my time.

250
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,890
I'll remember that.

251
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,220
You guys nodded without thinking, huh?

252
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,820
Very good.

253
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,460
I'll see

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,130
how you guys will keep your promise.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,730
There are only three of us,

256
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,060
but we have six dishes here.

257
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,220
Physician Mo.

258
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm not hungry.

259
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,820
You guys can go ahead.

260
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,580
How could we do this?

261
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,770
Of course you must eat before us.

262
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,850
Sit down.

263
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,730
Take your chopsticks.

264
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,820
Eat up.

265
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,180
From tomorrow onward,

266
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,820
you two will serve me.

267
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,850
Do not make me look after you two again.

268
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,250
What meat is this?

269
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,300
It tastes so nice.

270
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,770
That's not meat.

271
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,220
It's Chun root.

272
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,300
What's that?

273
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,220
Is it the root of a tree?

274
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,770
Chun wood has a firm and upright structure.

275
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,980
In traditional medicine, it is considered beneficial

276
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,890
for hair and skin.

277
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,730
After it's harvested,

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,730
mix with raw scallions and steam thoroughly.

279
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,370
After steaming for half a day,

280
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,420
saw it into fine shreds,

281
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,420
hang it in the southern corner of the house

282
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,610
to dry,

283
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,220
then drizzle with sesame oil.

284
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,650
It can then be used as filling.

285
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,060
I thought

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,100
tree roots were only eaten during times of famine.

287
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,300
You eat to fill your tummy.

288
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,010
I eat

289
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,220
to cultivate.

290
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,820
Cultivate?

291
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,580
You guys should rest after finishing your meal.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,490
Be sure to rise at dawn with the rooster's call,

293
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,100
cleanse yourself,

294
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,340
and light incense in preparation.

295
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,250
Get ready to learn the mantra.

296
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,130
What kind of mantra is it?

297
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,530
Why do we need to cleanse ourselves and light incense?

298
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,180
You still have time to prepare bathwater and cook for them?

299
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,460
Hurry and teach them the mantra.

300
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,980
See if they have a spirit root.

301
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,940
Don't get me blockheads again!

302
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,100
Fine...

303
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,980
Go away.

304
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,490
Go away!

305
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,890
Good morning, Physician Mo.

306
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,980
Time to wake up.

307
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,370
The sun's already high up in the sky.

308
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,300
But we just finished cleaning ourselves up.

309
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,180
The mantra

310
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,220
is divided into several tiers.

311
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,770
If you guys are able

312
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,820
to master Tier 1

313
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,650
in the next three months,

314
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,610
then you may formally take me as your master.

315
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,850
After that, you guys will receive the same monthly allowance as the rest

316
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,100
of the members of Seven Mysteries Sect.

317
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,580
There's actually money?

318
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,580
I spent a lot of effort

319
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,770
to procure this mantra.

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,820
I won't let you guys off

321
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,650
if you dare to tell anyone else about it.

322
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,340
Understood?

323
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,650
We won't tell anyone else about it!

324
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,490
We'll never do that.

325
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,580
Since you guys are illiterate,

326
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,060
just repeat what I mantra.

327
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,490
Attain ultimate emptiness.

328
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,700
Attain ultimate empathy...

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,530
This is driving me crazy.

330
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,610
Emptiness!

331
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,130
Emptiness.

332
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,420
Keep this up, and I'll go crazy.

333
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,010
My goodness.

334
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,980
Maintain.

335
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,370
Maintain.

336
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,530
Profound.

337
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,700
Profound.

338
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,180
Tranquility.

339
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,770
Tranquility?

340
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,490
That's your tummy.

341
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,850
It's tranquility.

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,370
All things

343
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,700
flourish.

344
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,770
Flourish.

345
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,370
And I watch their cycles of return.

346
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,980
And I watch their cycles of return.

347
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,300
Attain ultimate emptiness.

348
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,460
Maintain profound tranquility...

376
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,010
Show me how you circulate your energy.

377
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,530
Useless.

378
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,860
It's your turn.

379
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,770
Why is his hand

380
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,380
like a block of ice?

381
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,900
It's like a dead man's hand.

382
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,380
Attain ultimate emptiness.

383
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,900
Maintain profound tranquility.

384
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,140
All things flourish.

385
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,530
And I watch their cycles of return.

386
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,770
Attain ultimate emptiness.

387
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,330
Maintain profound tranquility.

388
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,010
All things flourish.

389
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,180
And I watch their cycles of return.

390
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,330
That hurts!

391
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,050
- Be quiet. - That hurts!

392
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,770
- That hurts! - Be quiet.

393
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,730
Be quiet!

394
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,660
This is great.

395
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,220
I finally found someone who isn't a blockhead.

396
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,330
This is great.

397
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,660
Keep up this level of effort in the future too.

398
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,660
From today onward,

399
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,660
you are my direct disciple.

400
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,530
Does that mean I can learn medicine

401
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,090
and learn how to read and write?

402
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,320
I'll teach you

403
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,250
everything you want to know.

404
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,490
I'll give you the best

405
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,330
of everything.

406
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,010
Master,

407
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,940
Zhang Tie spent a lot of effort practicing the mantra as well.

408
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,660
He's the same as all of the other blockheads.

409
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,220
He's useless.

410
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,490
He wakes up earlier

411
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,460
and sleeps later than me.

412
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,620
He never slacked off

413
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,050
when it came to practicing the mantra.

414
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,700
Please give him another chance.

415
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,490
He cannot do it.

416
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,250
Blockheads like him won't be enlightened

417
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,530
even if you give him an eternity to practice it.

418
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,670
Physician Mo,

419
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,860
don't chase me away!

420
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,490
I can endure hardships!

421
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,770
I can do chores!

422
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,240
I...

423
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,730
I can grow crops!

424
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,010
I can wash your feet on your behalf!

425
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,900
I...

426
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,770
I can also make flatbreads!

427
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,250
Physician Mo, I'm begging you!

428
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,380
Please don't chase me away!

429
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,250
Master,

430
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,530
if you're not willing to let Zhang Tie remain,

431
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,250
I shall leave together with him.

432
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,860
Zhang Tie.

433
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,250
Let me see

434
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,460
what else you can do.

435
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,900
I do have a technique that's suitable for you.

436
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,380
It's called

437
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,050
Mammoth Skin.

438
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,940
Even at the initial stage of mastery,

439
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,940
you'll gain the power to move mountains.

440
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,250
Is it that amazing? I'll do it!

441
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,180
However, one has to endure what other people cannot

442
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,050
in order to master the technique.

443
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,730
Can you do it?

444
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,730
I can endure

445
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,700
all the hardships in the world

446
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,700
as long as you don't chase me away.

447
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,660
Excellent.

448
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,090
Excellent.

449
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,530
What about this?

450
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,530
Both of you can remain here.

451
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,810
Let me guide you two

452
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,770
to the path of enlightenment.

453
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,250
Thank you, Master.

454
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,770
No.

455
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,980
Get up.

456
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,220
Listen.

457
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,250
From now on, concentrate on cultivating the mantra.

458
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,890
You have to

459
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,140
monitor him all the time.

460
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,380
Do not let him slack off.

461
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,380
Go now.

462
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,090
This is great.

463
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,460
We can finally stay here.

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,380
We're staying!

465
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,460
We're staying!

466
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,250
It's been so many years.

467
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,920
We've finally found a mortal

468
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,700
with a spirit root!

469
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,180
Old Fool!

470
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,220
Enough already.

471
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,290
Stop talking.

472
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,730
I need to prepare some prescriptions for him.

473
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,290
This won't do.

474
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,290
This won't do.

475
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,330
You have to follow my prescriptions.

476
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,620
Don't use these common goods.

477
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,660
You and I cannot recover

478
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,250
if you let this affect his cultivation progress.

479
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,660
Enough already.

480
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,460
That's enough!

481
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,530
I know what to do.

482
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,700
That smells great.

483
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,460
Master, we're back.

484
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,010
Master.

485
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,140
What are you doing?

486
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,220
Hurry and take off your clothes.

487
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,140
I wasn't talking to you.

488
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,220
Han Li.

489
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,660
Hurry and take off your clothes.

490
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,810
Come.

491
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,570
Zhang Tie.

492
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,730
Come and get some water with me.

493
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,660
Yes, Master.

494
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,490
How do you feel?

495
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,290
This is

496
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,700
the special herbal bath I've prepared for you.

497
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,810
It's filled with precious herbs.

498
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,380
You have to immerse yourself

499
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,460
for four hours.

500
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,940
Pay attention. It's four hours.

501
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,940
How do you feel?

502
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,730
Does your body feel unblocked and transparent?

503
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,660
Maybe

504
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,490
a little.

505
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,860
Just a little?

506
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,570
The herbs aren't strong enough.

507
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,900
You stingy fool!

508
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,900
You have to include more precious herbs.

509
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,330
Don't be so stingy.

510
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,490
Hurry!

511
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,330
Hurry up!

512
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,770
I've nearly given up all my treasured items

513
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,220
just to aid this boy in his cultivation.

514
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,980
Zhang Tie!

515
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,980
Mix it slowly.

516
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,180
Be careful with it!

517
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,420
Sorry, Master.

518
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,940
That's right.

519
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,900
For the next four hours,

520
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,250
regulate your breathing with the mantra I taught you.

521
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,860
Come.

522
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,180
Zhang Tie, keep an eye on it for me.

523
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,770
Maintain

524
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,570
the water temperature.

525
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,220
Make sure it's not too high or too low.

526
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,980
Attain ultimate emptiness.

527
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,720
What's wrong?

528
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,660
I can't take this.

529
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,460
It's so hot.

530
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,490
Master.

531
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,150
Han Li.

532
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,250
He's unwell.

533
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
What's wrong?

534
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,420
Master.

535
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,660
Please take him out of the bathtub.

536
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,620
Han Li!

537
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,760
Come! Hurry!

538
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,140
Don't move!

539
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,380
Keep your composure!

540
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,220
Good boy.

541
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,980
How is it?

542
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,180
How do you feel?

543
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,010
It's so hot.

544
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,380
It's so hot.

545
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,050
It's very

546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,900
hot.

547
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,770
That's more like it.

548
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,140
Remember the mantra I taught you.

549
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,660
Regulate your breathing slowly.

550
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,220
Zhang Tie.

551
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,290
Keep an eye on him.

552
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,900
Give him a reminder.

553
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,420
Attain ultimate emptiness.

554
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,010
Maintain profound tranquility.

555
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,810
Shut up.

556
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,490
All things flourish.

557
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,290
Shut up!

558
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,140
Master, he...

559
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,940
Recite the mantra.

560
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,860
Attain ultimate emptiness.

561
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,220
Attain ultimate emptiness.

562
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,380
Maintain profound tranquility.

563
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,900
Maintain...

564
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,730
Maintain what?

565
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,730
Maintain profound tranquility.

566
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,900

00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,300
there's something magical about the mantra indeed.

759
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,420
Back then,

760
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,780
Li Feiyu, who led us into the sect,

761
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,260
also known as Senior Li,

762
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,130
was also promoted from an ordinary steward

763
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,820
to the Deputy Hall Master of Outer Blade Hall.

764
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,210
He deals with the villainous and wicked bandit gang

765
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,780
called Wild Wolves Gang.

766
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,980
I was once envious of him.

767
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,900
I wanted to be like him.

768
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,490
I wanted to be a martial arts expert

769
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,340
and a pugilist.

770
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,170
I wanted to roam the world,

771
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,690
take revenge, and repay gratitude swiftly.

772
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,490
It's a shame

773
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,460
that there are no "what ifs" in life.

774
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,260
I could only practice and take herbal brews

775
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,460
day after day.

776
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,460
Unknowingly,

777
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,900
it seems that thought has already faded away.

778
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,170
Scram!

779
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,210
Tell the entire Wild Wolves Gang

780
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,980
that none of you better think of stepping into Seven Mysteries Sect.

781
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,050
If not,

782
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,900
you will end up like this.

783
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,610
Let's go!

784
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,570
Master.

785
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,860
[Two and a Half Years Later]
Look at the gardenia plants.

786
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,050
They're growing so well.

787
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,260
If we boil them

788
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,740
and mix it with powdered licorice root to make Duanmu tofu,

789
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,530
it'll turn into an exquisite vegetarian dish.

790
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,820
Child, plants are not the only edible food around here.

791
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,170
Within this boundless world,

792
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,690
even stone and sand,

793
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,460
dew at dawn and glow at dusk,

794
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,090
all may serve as sustenance.

795
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,460
Lately,

796
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,820
I've been wondering about

797
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,050
the mantra you taught me.

798
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,340
Tell me what's on your mind.

799
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,170
Attain ultimate emptiness.

800
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,460
Maintain profound tranquility.

801
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,340
Maybe it's because

802
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,900
nothing is perfect in the world.

803
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,980
Due to the imperfection,

804
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,420
mortals feel empty and lost.

805
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,690
Only by accepting such emptiness

806
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,690
will we be able to find tranquility.

807
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,460
Did I say something wrong?

808
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,130
From now on, you're only allowed to gather herbs.

809
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,130
Do not read

810
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,420
any books again.

811
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,170
But why?

812
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,650
Your cultivation progress

813
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,940
has been lagging behind for the past few months.

814
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,340
You have to focus on your cultivation.

815
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,940
Anything else other than that

816
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,570
has nothing to do with you.

817
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,490
It's all your fault!

818
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,650
Who told you to let him read books?

819
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,090
Now, he has formed his own thoughts.

820
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,610
How can we control him like this?

821
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,420
Shut up!

822
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,490
Did you think he'd stay in the valley

823
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,650
and do his cultivation training

824
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,650
had I not lured him with the teaching of medicine?

825
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,940
You're a pathetic excuse for an immortal.

826
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,130
You only nag people non-stop.

827
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,980
If you're that free,

828
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,260
you should keep a close eye on that child.

829
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,860
Master kept all of his books away.

830
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,300
He swapped them into herbs.

831
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,820
Why did Master's moods

832
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,050
shift so unpredictably?

833
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,460
It's as if he has suddenly turned into a different person.

834
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,530
I have to be careful in the future.

835
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,610
I mustn't tell people what's on my mind easily.

836
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,820
I've never encountered such a situation

837
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,210
ever since I reached Tier 2 of cultivation.

838
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,940
I have the feeling

839
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,340
that something bad is about to happen.

840
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,420
What is this?

841
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,980
This vial,

842
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,980
why is it glowing?

843
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,460
It can absorb moonlight?

844
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,940
Seems like my hypothesis was correct.

845
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,860
The closed door and windows

846
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,820
were obstructing the vial from absorbing the light rays.

847
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,690
The vial can absorb light rays better

848
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,130
at spacious areas with open space.

849
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,860
Only then

850
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,740
will the light orb be larger.

851
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,090
Although I don't know

852
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,740
where the light rays are coming from

853
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,050
or what the vial is doing

854
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,300
when it absorbs the light rays,

855
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,530
I suppose I'm getting much closer

856
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,130
to solving the riddle.

857
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,530
But why can't I open it?

858
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,570
Why are you only here now?

859
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,050
Weren't we supposed to meet on the third quarter of the Hour of Yin?

I went to the forest to meditate.

884

Why has he never shown his skills in front of us?
