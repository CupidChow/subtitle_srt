 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,260
How can you prove that you are the predatory murderer?
  Episode 8

5
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,660
You'll find out soon

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,420
 since you'll probably find a body today.

7
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,910
Hello. Hello.

8
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,630
Hello.

9
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,540
Yook Dong Sik.

10
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,010
You...

11
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,590
 Issues in Current Events

12
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,170
- Should we begin? 
 - Yes.

13
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,190
- For your husband as well, the isolation ward will be safer. 
 - Yes.

14
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,480
- Please move him carefully so that you don't wake him up. 
 - Yes.

15
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,730
Where's Yook Dong Sik right now?

16
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,650
How could you do this to me?

17
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,750
I was nice to you.

18
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,790
You were nice to me. You saved me from almost dying and comforted me. You dared to.

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,260
You dared ... you dared to pity me

20
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,530
as a pushover who doesn't even know my true identity.

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,480
You know now, right? I'm different from insect-like bastards like you.

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,390
I'm also a predator now.

23
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,440
Predator?

24
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,600
The Predator Murderer should know that we think alike.

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,640
He probably saw it on TV, right? Will he come find me?

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,630
Excuse me... To be honest, it's me.

27
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,780
- What is? 
 - I am...

28
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,610
I am that predator!

29
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, are you really? Just beg me to spare you instead

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,940
so that it's more fun to kill you.

31
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,820
How dare you use your head and bull*** me?

32
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm telling you the truth!

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,370
Seriously...

34
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,360
It's the truth!

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,110
Just like you, that wench used that dense head of hers to try desperately to live.

36
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,570
Do you know what kind of bitch she was?

37
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,200
When I earned money for us, she was fine,

38
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,120
but when I couldn't anymore, the look in her eyes completely changed.

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,140
When she looked at that punk from the pharmaceutical company, her eyes were dripping with honey.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,110
She dared to... like looking at an insect,

41
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,790
raise her eyes at me.

42
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,440
Every time she did that,

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,070
I beat her up a little, and then it would be calm again!

44
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,560
Do you know what she said to me while she died?

45
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,020
That I was a pitiful person.

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,920
How dare she, so rudely! Without recognizing a predator like me!

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,620
What?

48
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,110
You horrible...

49
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,980
The commercials are ending soon. Which direction should we take this broadcast?

50
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,530
Is that what's important right now?

51
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,930
- Did you track his phone? 
 - It's a burner cell.

52
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,800
We're trying to track his location, but not yet.

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,640
Exactly what kind of punk is this?

54
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,580
Where are you going?

55
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,800
There's something bothering me, so I need to go confirm it.

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,870
Hey, Sim Bo Gyeong. Sim Bo Gyeong!

57
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,480
Oh, Taek Soo, are you out on patrol right now?

58
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,880
It's good you're close by. Can you check something for me?

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,720
Huh? He's trying to kill Yook Dong Sik? Not the other way around?

60
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,710
What should I do? I don't like things getting complicated.

61
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,050
- Should I call the police? 
 - No.

62
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,540
Text me the location and leave.

63
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,550
Nam Seong Cheol!

64
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,840
Nam Seong Cheol isn't home right now. I think he left his car.

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,310
 What's is the situation right now?

66
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,810
That Nam could be the culprit.

67
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,430
What? No way! He even tried to kill himself!

68
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,480
That. Tell me in detail.

69
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,780
He said he lit up charcoal in his car or something. Anyway, he's really not the one.

70
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,500
By chance, what if it wasn't an attempted suicide but a test run?

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,780
There's a good chance charcoal will be used in a car, too, for a forewarned murder.

72
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,610
- What? What kind of ... 
 - Let's talk later.

73
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,170
Show-off tendency.

74
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,010
If he called the broadcast station in person and even forewarned about a murder...

75
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,900
he'll probably want to watch

76
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,470
the police who are panicked and confused about what to do.

77
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,760
He's close by.

78
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,060
I dozed off for a sec!

79
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,850
Where is this place?

80
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,250
Hyungnim, are you sleeping?

81
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,670
Hyung—

82
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,480
Hyungnim!

83
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,760
Oh!

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,100
What do I do?

85
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,600
Like years ago, just like how I used to do it.

86
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,080
One, two...

87
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,540
As expected.

88
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,430
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

89
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,710
Hyungnim!

90
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,780
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

91
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,480
Seriously... Oh!

92
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,670
B-Breathe. What do I do?

93
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,420
M-My lips are precious, too.

94
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,430
It isn't what you think, Hyungnim!

95
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,920
Are you coming to your senses?

96
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,370
S-Sim Bo Gyeong.

97
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,430
 010-0362-0896

98
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,610
This is Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong.

99
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,940
 Yes, Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong. Someone lit up charcoal to kill my hyungnim.

100
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,530
- Who did?
 - Whoever it was...

101
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,600
I didn't get a good look, so I'm not sure.

102
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,820
- Where are you? 
 - This is

103
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,080
the rooftop of a parking structure.

104
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,240
And it looks like it's near the TNN TV broadcasting company.

105
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,320
Where this is exactly, I'm not very—

106
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,530
Hello. Hello?!

107
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,500
 Where are you? We just got the location. It's within the 300-meter perimeter of the broadcast station.

108
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,390
I think it's Nakyeon parking structure.

109
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,270
I'll head over there, so please send backup.

110
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,810
I have to quickly finish this off.

111
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,180
I guess you wanted to copy me,

112
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,230
but to be honest, talking about being a predator and whatnot,

113
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,070
while hurting the weak, I've stopped doing that.

114
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,660
It's not fun, and it made me feel like I was becoming a loser the same as them.

115
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,100
So, I was going around looking for bastards like you.

116
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,050
Human trash who deserve to die!

117
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,610
No way. Are you really... the Predator Murderer?

118
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,940
I am. It's true.

119
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,050
I told you, didn't I?

120
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,320
How could you do something like that? When you were treated kindly!

121
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,900
I am... sorry.

122
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,710
Your wife, I meant!

123
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,410
I... just want to be like you.

124
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,840
I thought you'd understand.

125
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,770
No.

126
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,370
Even a psychopath like me

127
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,780
doesn't do something so... What did she ever do wrong?!

128
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,310
How agonized must she have felt?!

129
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:58,120
She was by your side her whole life and trusted you til the end!

130
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,710
How could you?!

131
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,770
I can't forgive bastards like you.

132
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,790
Never.

133
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,590
I'll show you... what a real predator looks like.

134
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,980
That's...

135
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,490
This is the proof that I'm the real deal.

136
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,260
You... It's you.

137
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,990
That's right. It's me.

138
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,810
You... What are you?

139
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,430
What are you, really?

140
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,470
You're laughing?

141
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,470
 Old Boy

142
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,510
I have something to tell you here!

143
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,560
No!

144
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,640
You're making a mistake right now!

145
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,660
Farewell.

146
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,910
Dong Sik! Are you here?!

147
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,900
Don't move! Dong Sik, are you okay?

148
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,940
Please save me!

149
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,730
That's not...

150
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,660
It's the rooftop! I've caught him trying to commit murder!

151
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,420
It was done by Nam Seong Cheol, as expected.

152
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,110
Are you okay?

153
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,420
Back up is coming, so stay right here.

154
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,070
Hey, Detective Jo, take the guys and go up, and Detective Lee and the rest of you, come with me.

155
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,120
 He knows too much about my identity. I can't let him get caught.

156
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,610
  Before that happens, I have to kill him.

157
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,280
He's there! He's there! Follow him!

158
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,650
Where did he go? Let's split here.

159
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,770
Half of you go that way, and Detective Lee and the rest, come with me.

160
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,580
 Hello? Is anyone there?

161
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,240
 Hello!

162
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,410
 Psychopath Diary

163
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,950
Are you okay?

164
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

165
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,600
Here, take the road to the suburbs.

166
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,560
 The police, in order to arrest Nam, who escaped,

167
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,580
 mobilized a large-scale military police force

168
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,520
 and have installed checkpoints on all connected roads.

169
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,010
 They have asked for the citizens to stay inside and to report Nam as soon as they see—

170
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,960
Damn it.

171
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,290
The news just now, that's you, isn't it?

172
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,650
That's right, so if you make a foolish move, know that you'll die.

173
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,230
Did you do that because someone told you to, or did you do it alone?

174
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,270
Shut up, and just drive.

175
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,690
I was just curious.

176
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,130
Look at this bastard. Do you think this is a joke right now?

177
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,250
I'm telling you I'm that Predator Murderer.

178
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,780
What... are you?

179
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,910
Ah, my apologies. It because I'm so scared.

180
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,610
But, if it's not something you did because someone told you to,

181
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,180
why did you do such thing?

182
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,260
It’s a welcome drink. You want some?

183
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,600
I knew you would come find me.

184
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:08,400
Yes. Yes, Mister Dong Sik, I think I'm almost ther— Oh!

185
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,610
Oh what a scare!

186
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,800
Hello? No no.

187
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,700
Whereabouts are you?

188
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,500
Mister Taek Soo. Here.

189
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,590
Right. So where is here?

190
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,790
 Here!

191
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,400
Mister Dong Sik?

192
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,850
 Yes. Here.

193
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,870
Mister Dong Sik!

194
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,150
Mister Dong Sik, why did you go in there?

195
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,810
Dong Sik, grab this!

196
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,840
Grab this! One, two!

197
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,620
So, in order to meet me,

198
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,910
you even killed your wife?

199
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,550
It's for you that I killed her.

200
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:58,380
Do you remember? That homeless scum you tried to kill but failed to do so.

201
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,160
He came to the hospital where that wench worked, you see.

202
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,770
What?

203
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,870
 He came because of his smashed head and a broken arm, saying that someone tried to kill him,

204
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,450
 that after stamping a blood print in the diary,

205
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,880
 he was in so much fear that he told everything!

206
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,180
  Even if it was the words of a drunken bum, she must have thought that something was weird.

207
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,810
  So that wench promised to contact the police,

208
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,560
 but in the short time that she was away, he disappeared, she said.

209
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,780
 Over there, the second bed.

210
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,370
 When you work in the emergency room, there are all sorts of people,

211
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,570
 so she didn't think much of it and let it go, but then saw the news...

212
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,100
If I had spared that wench's life, she would have told the police everything.

213
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,460
That's why I killed her!

214
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,600
- For our sake. 
 - Our?

215
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,280
I felt it when I saw the news articles about you. Someone had the same exact thoughts as me.

216
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,970
The world is full of insect-like bastards who make you want to vomit

217
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,070
just for the mere fact that they breathe the same air as you.

218
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,740
You can just kill them! Why didn't I think of that?

219
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,370
Thanks to you, I had a huge realization.

220
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,870
So me too, I took the resolution to become a predator just like you.

221
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,180
It's very moving.

222
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,570
If I followed exactly the things you did, I could meet you one day.

223
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,440
I did have that thought. But this fast?

224
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,380
As expected, the original is different.

225
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,450
You don't know how many things I want to ask.

226
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,740
Perhaps, about those murder dates,

227
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,880
KOSPI 300, inverse futures, I'm right, aren't I?

228
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,740
I've got a deep connection with that stock, you see.

229
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,890
The amount of money I lost—

230
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,670
What happened with Yook Dong Sik?

231
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,140
Oh, right!

232
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,590
I forgot to tell you that story! The funniest one.

233
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,640
That homeless guy said so, apparently.

234
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,590
That you were trying to kill him, but someone was hiding and watching,

235
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,780
and they ran away with the diary.

236
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,100
So the one who took the diary was not that homeless man, but—

237
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,960
I'm telling you it was that guy!

238
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,940
And do you know what he said? He said the diary is his!

239
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,010
And said that he's the real predator! That nutcase!

240
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,430
It must have been a lie.

241
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,200
A lie with some kind of intent.

242
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,910
No. It didn't seem like a lie.

243
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,890
Now that I think about it, that punk really is crazy!

244
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,420
He didn't even know I was trying to kill him and acted up like a fool!

245
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,400
Who does he think he is to call himself a predator?

246
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,370
Get off.

247
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,840
Everything is good, but you talk too much.

248
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,890
I ... I'm on your side.

249
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,220
I'm telling you I'm also a predator.

250
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,820
Really?

251
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,580
Then prove it.

252
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,200
If you flee by crossing here, I'll acknowledge you.

253
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,880
At night ... the highway?

254
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,190
Among the weak, there is one kind that I hate the most.

255
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,670
The weak ones who are delusional and think they are strong ones.

256
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,140
Isn't that sickening?

257
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,350
Don't tell me. You're not one of those, are you?

258
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,950
Who are you?

259
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,900
Why aren't you saying ...

260
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,530
Hyungnim! What happened?

261
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,450
Wh-What's wrong with your leg?!

262
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,670
- That is ... 
 - I took him out of a manhole he fell in.

263
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,920
M-Manhole?

264
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,070
- I have an urgent matter, so I'll go now. 
 - Oh no no, Mister Dong Sik!

265
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,410
What urgent matter, when you just almost got killed by a murderer? Get treatment,

266
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,450
and you should make a statement as well.

267
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,730
- It's really urgent. 
 - You can't.

268
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,930
Wait wait wait. Oh, oh!

269
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes, Sunbae! Ah, Mister Dong Sik, I—

270
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,900
What? Nam Seong Cheol?

271
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,150
What is it?

272
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,790
She said he died from a car accident.

273
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,920
How is your body?

274
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,900
I said you could get treated some more before coming.

275
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,950
Even if I'm still a bit dizzy, if I rest a bit, it'll be okay.

276
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,940
I told you to stay out of it because it was dangerous.

277
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,720
Why did you meet Mister Nam?

278
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:23,770
That is ... Because he even made a suicide attempt,

279
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,160
so I thought I could bring him some comfort, yes.

280
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,580
It isn't that Mister Nam contacted you first?

281
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,360
Of course. He contacted me asking to see me. Yes.

282
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,030
As of now, you are the last person to have seen Mister Nam,

283
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,230
so your testimony is extremely important.

284
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,510
In your opinion, is Mister Nam really a predator?

285
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,140
That is ...

286
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,010
He said he is indeed a predator.

287
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,440
And he admitted to the previous six murders?

288
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,360
Yes.

289
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,730
What did he say, specifically?

290
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,590
Today wasn't even a date that matched with the stock pattern.

291
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,320
Also, it doesn't make sense that he suddenly killed his wife after killing an unspecified number of people he chose.

292
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,120
If Mister Nam is really our guy, seeing how he has a tendency to show-off,

293
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,410
I would definitely think he told you all kinds of things like this.

294
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,000
That is, uhm ...

295
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,240
All of a sudden, feeling dizzy, ah ...

296
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,200
Let's stop and take him to the hospital quickly.

297
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,040
Come with us.

298
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,650
Careful, careful.

299
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,430
Careful.

300
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,170
As he was fleeing, he crossed the highway and was hit by a car. What about the black box?

301
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,100
The verification results didn't find other circumstances beside the car accident.

302
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,970
And on the site, we discovered Mister Nam's burner phone that he used to call the broadcast station.

303
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,250
So are you sure that this guy is the predator?

304
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,410
From the search of Mister Nam's house, we found numerous cutout articles on the predator murderer,

305
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,570
and the blood print of his wife whom he killed by disguising it as suicide.

306
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,340
And evidence for the other cases?

307
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,930
It seems like it was destroyed as the investigation started.

308
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,070
But he performed details that were not disclosed to the public, such as the blood thumbprint.

309
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:37,300
And moreover, judging from how he confessed himself that he was the predator murderer when calling the broadcast station,

310
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,160
I think that it is certain he is the predator murderer we are chasing.

311
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,200
But... it is still too early to conclude.

312
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,020
- What is this about? 
 - Ah, that is...

313
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,650
We can't exclude the possibility that Mister Nam was a copycat.

314
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,490
He almost doesn't fit the profiling at all and—

315
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,180
Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong is just making personal presumptions.

316
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,920
Also, eye witness Yook Dong Sik, who was the last target,

317
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,120
testified that the culprit admitted the other cases were his doing.

318
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,100
If he is a copycat who yearns to be a predator, he could also have been lying.

319
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,030
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

320
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,450
- Commissioner! 
 - The press is already making a fuss.

321
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,880
They say that the special team caught the serial killer and stopped additional murders.

322
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,280
The citizens who were insecure can now feel reassured and return to their normal life.

323
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,880
But you want to say that that guy is a fake, and there is another murderer?

324
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,840
It is only aggravating the anxiety of the citizens when you don't even have much basis.

325
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,600
Let's conclude it while we're at it.

326
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,530
- However— 
 - You all worked hard.

327
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,060
In a short while, the entire team will be given a reward,

328
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,200
so go somewhere today to fill your stomach and release your burden, alright?

329
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,970
- Good job! 
 - Thank you.

330
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,950
Thank you.

331
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:56,010
Bo Gyeong. It's true that we came all the way here thanks to you, but in the end, an investigation is teamwork.

332
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,320
If you get stuck in the profiling you made,

333
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,760
you end up disregarding the truth when it's obvious.

334
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,280
Yes.

335
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,440
You'll come with us, right?

336
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,550
Sorry. I have to go to Dad's hospital.

337
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:12,030
Not to the team dinner. I'm asking whether you have any thoughts of officially joining our team.

338
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm not sure...

339
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,430
whether I have the qualifications to do so.

340
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,450
  Cheongan Hospital

341
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,090
Ah B-Bo Gyeong.

342
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,810
Yeah Mom, where are you? Did Dad change rooms?

343
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,440
That is ...

344
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,010
We only followed the procedure.

345
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,150
"When the mental care patient is admitted at the request of the person who's responsible for his care,

346
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,780
"you have to receive consent from two people who are responsible for his care."

347
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,800
As for guardians, there are only my mom and I,

348
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,960
but I did not sign, I'm telling you.

349
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,610
Even if you ask us that—

350
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,900
You should talk with me.

351
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,710
As expected, it was you. Who let you decide to do this kind of thing?

352
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,350
I did it after discussing it with your mother.

353
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,620
That's enough. I'll take my dad away.

354
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,540
Last time, your father swung an injection syringe at you, didn't he?

355
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,360
You are a policewoman who received training, but what about your mother?

356
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,850
What will you do if he swings something even worse toward your mother?

357
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,970
There is no way my dad would do that!

358
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,500
Don't be stubborn.

359
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,670
What if a serious incident happens while you're somewhere else and only the two are together?

360
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,040
Then, truly, no one will be able to protect your mother.

361
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,340
Staying here will also be good for your father to receive treatment.

362
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,310
You can't close the coffee shop indefinitely and only stick by your father's bedside.

363
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,820
And you also need to think of your mother.

364
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,580
Staying in the hospital is bad for health. What are you going to do if your mother also falls ill?

365
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,160
Dad.

366
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,140
Dad? I'm here.

367
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,410
I'm sorry, Dad.

368
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,810
I'm sorry.

369
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,440
I'm sorry, Dad.

370
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,450
I'm sorry.

371
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,680
Do you really like that woman?

372
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah.

373
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,650
Her looks aren't too bad, but are you sure you'll be okay?

374
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,910
More than anything else, her father is the problem.

375
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,770
Make sure he doesn't cause any trouble.

376
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,180
Oh. I see what you're saying.

377
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,680
If anything happens, call me right away.

378
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:09,370
  The Predator Murderer who made many tremble in fear after his serial killings, is now dead.

379
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,130
  Mr. Nam, who predicted his death on a live broadcast,

380
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,590
  died during his escape in an auto accident.

381
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,030
  The suspected murders that were disguised as suicides, committed by Mr. Nam

382
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,210
  have been put to an end.

383
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:26,110
  Around 5 pm last night, Nam attempted to murder 'brave citizen' Yook Dong Sik,

384
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,950
  who played a crucial role in starting the official investigation.

385
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,690
  Thanks to the work of the task force lead by Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon, Nam's forewarned murder was prevented,

386
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,150
  and the team was able to rescue Yook with success.

387
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,390
  Following, is the report by Park Cheol Mi.

388
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,540
Dong Sik, are you alright?

389
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,110
Dong Sik! I knew you'd do it!

390
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,060
Will you take a picture with me?

391
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,150
- Sunbae, are you okay? 
 - Well ...

392
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,890
Why do you keep worrying me? If you keep doing this, I—

393
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,010
Dong Sik!

394
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,050
Dong Sik!

395
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,800
I shouldn't have asked you to attend that funeral in my place. What if something had happened to you?

396
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,860
It's not like you knew something like this would happen.

397
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,760
No. As expected, my friend.

398
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,110
You're a pushov-likeable (both words begin with the same syllable).

399
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,630
Really.

400
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,670
Don't be so tactless, you.

401
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,420
Take the picture. Hurry.

402
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,350
Hey, Mi J-Joo

403
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,820
Ji Yoon, you should come too.

404
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,920
Should I?

405
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
In the middle!

406
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,340
I'm taking it. One, two!

407
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,550
Team Leader, won't you come too?

408
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,510
What are you doing during working hours?

409
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,870
I said what are you doing and not working during working hours!?

410
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,650
- Come over. 
 - Come.

411
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,100
I said what are you doing and not working during working hours!?

412
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,220
  A 'Brave citizen' and now a victim who nearly died.

413
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,770
  It's a little over the top, but perfect.

414
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:11,930
  No murderer could hide his identity as well as I can.

415
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,060
The day after the Yuseong Biomedi incident, 13th of September.

416
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,750
Find out about Yook Dong Sik's whereabouts on that day.

417
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,760
Yes, sir.

418
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,110
  Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong

419
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,880
Here is the fruit juice you ordered. It took a long time, didn't it?

420
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,630
I thought you would never want to see me again.

421
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm sorry about last time. You were only trying to be considerate.

422
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,700
What's your relationship with Dong Sik?

423
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,240
Pardon? What do you mean by relationship?

424
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,600
No, it's just that... you wouldn't even tell me how you two met.

425
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,310
Why? Is it something I can't be curious about?

426
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,600
No, it's just that it's a long story.

427
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,790
I've got a lot of time.

428
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:00,620
Actually, I hit Dong Sik with my car while I was on patrol.

429
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:06,130
He wasn't hurt badly, but he lost his memory after the incident.

430
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,730
It must have been hard for him to adjust.

431
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,250
Memory loss?

432
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:20,140
Did that accident occur on September 13th?

433
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,450
Right, you two work together. Maybe I said something useless.

434
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh, no. That's not it. It's just that he did seem a little different since then.

435
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:43,060
It seemed like he tried to hide it as much as possible, but it must have shown through.

436
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,940
He's such a pure-hearted person, that's why.

437
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,950
Please don't let Dong Sik know that I know about this. I'll pretend not to know either.

438
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:56,510
Wouldn't Dong Sik be more comfortable with that too?

439
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,660
Okay. I'll do that.

440
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,710
  Seeing how Chief Park Jae Ho denies memory loss to such an extent,

441
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,210
  I think it's true.

442
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,330
Director?

443
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,230
Ah, okay.

444
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,050
So he read my diary while having memory loss.

445
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,630
That's why that ridiculous...

446
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,200
Why is a young man like you driving like this?

447
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,050
I'm sorry, I must have lost my mind—

448
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,800
This man... how can you laugh in a situation like this?

449
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,210
No, it's not that.

450
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,960
I'm sorry. I'm—

451
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,390
What a crazy...

452
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,940
Here.

453
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,260
 ₩5 million

454
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,120
Take it before I change my mind.

455
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,510
Why won't people just readily accept money when it's handed to them?

456
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,360
What's the matter, is it not enough?

457
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,220
No, I thought it's too much actually.

458
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,680
I've included severance pay, that's why.

459
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,440
We've never met, and we will never meet again.

460
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,850
Understood?

461
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,210
Yes, sir.

462
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,350
Aren't you a real celebrity if the restaurant owner recognizes you and won't accept your money?

463
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,850
People I know are begging me to set them up with you!

464
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,110
What do you think? Want me to?

465
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,140
A blind date?

466
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,700
- No! Now that I think about it, they're not your type. None of them. 
 - None?

467
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,160
Did you enjoy your lunch?

468
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,690
Hello, sir.

469
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,620
I was looking for you, Dong Sik, actually.

470
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,660
Me, why?

471
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,050
I was thinking we could use your current image for the company's advertising.

472
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,340
From marketing ideas, there's one that suggests inspirations from the Aesop Fables.

473
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,160
Do you know the story "The Donkey in the Lion's Skin"?

474
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,110
"The Donkey in the Lion's Skin"?

475
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,260
Oh, that. I think I've read it to Woo Ri before.

476
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,140
You know, it's about a donkey that finds a lion's skin and puts it on—

477
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,540
- Oh, then the animals must have fled from him, thinking he was a lion, right? 
 - Yeah.

478
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,980
But doesn't he get caught by the fox later in the story?

479
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,340
The donkey, who got excited scaring other animals,

480
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,410
tries to scare even the fox by roaring like a lion.

481
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,100
But the fox notices right away that he sounds like a donkey.

482
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,710
Oh, I think I may have heard that story somewhere too.

483
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,180
But... to use it in an advertisement?

484
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,660
Is it not good? Then what if we change the ending?

485
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,440
To one where the donkey gets ripped to pieces by the lion.

486
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,200
Sorry?

487
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,800
A horror theme!

488
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,410
Anyway, I've realized your true worth, Dong Sik.

489
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,580
It's nothing, sir.

490
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,620
- Exactly. 
 - Pardon?

491
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,080
- Anyway, you should look forward to it

492
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:48,100
since I'm giving serious thought as to how I should use you.

493
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,710
Yes, sir.

494
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,210
Right. Did you hear the news about Bo Gyeong's father?

495
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,210
- Sorry? 
 - Oh, I thought you two were close.

496
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,610
Goodbye, sir.

497
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,080
Sir, you shouldn't do this.

498
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,220
I don't want to!

499
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,650
You need to receive the injection so you can go home soon.

500
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,370
Home?

501
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,510
Of course. Your wife and daughter must be waiting for you.

502
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,440
Okay, now.

503
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,090
Oh!

504
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,690
Let go! I don't want it!

505
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,300
Let me go home!

506
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,430
Hurry up and hold him down!

507
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,600
What are you doing? Get him!

508
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,750
I'm sorry, we're still closed!

509
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,610
Dong Sik!

510
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:40,400
I was just passing by.

511
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,810
I... decided to go back to the Patrol Division.

512
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,040
You're not continuing to work in  Inspector Ryoo's team?

513
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,300
I think I'm still lacking a lot.

514
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,400
I get emotional first, so I keep saying useless things.

515
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,540
Still, you're the one I'm the most scared of.

516
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,070
- Pardon? 
 - Pardon?

517
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,630
Oh, I meant you seem very talented.

518
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm not. Nothing of the sort.

519
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:29,260
Dad isn't well, so I think it's best for everyone for me to go back to where I was.

520
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,670
Oh, about your dad—

521
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,700
Just a second.

522
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,130
Yes?

523
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:44,670
Pardon? Dad disappeared?

524
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,950
 Policeman Heo

525
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,730
What happened?!

526
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,840
 We checked the CCTV nearby, and it looks like he headed to a nearby town.

527
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,290
I got it. Keep checking and let me know!

528
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,790
- What? Escape? 
 - Wow.

529
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,880
What is it he used to do? He suddenly used his strength, and his physical strength was...

530
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,270
 Anyway, the hospital staff and the police are looking for him, so don't worry too much.

531
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,960
Where did he go exactly?

532
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,250
He couldn't have gone far, though. Let's go that way.

533
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,570
Just a minute.

534
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,950
Yeah. What happened?

535
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,260
What? The bus terminal?

536
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,040
Dad!

537
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,950
- Dad. 
 - Get away.

538
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,340
Dad, are you okay?

539
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,310
I have to go!

540
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,660
Dad. It's me.

541
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,900
Your daughter, Bo Gyeong.

542
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,650
- Daughter. 
 - That's right.

543
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,440
Me. I'm here.

544
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,790
It's okay. It's okay.

545
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,880
I'm here.

546
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,340
You're okay, Dad.

547
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,100
Are you his guardian?

548
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,220
I mean, I was trying to talk to him nicely because he seemed pitiful,  but without warning, he...

549
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,710
How can you neglect a dangerous man like this?

550
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,940
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

551
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,080
Seriously.

552
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,190
No!

553
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,240
Dad, are you okay?

554
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,410
I don't want it!

555
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,670
I don't want it!

556
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,540
I don't want it! I don't want it!

557
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,430
I don't want it!

558
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,900
I don't want it! I don't want it!

559
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,570
I don't want it!

560
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,400
I don't want it!

561
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:47,370
I might be overstepping my bounds in saying this, but is him staying here the best thing for him?

562
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:55,030
My dad... holds a fifth-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, third in Judo, and fourth in Hapkido.

563
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,220
A total of twelve.

564
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:04,240
Since most criminals were no match if they challenged dad,

565
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,780
it's dangerous. You saw earlier, too.

566
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,780
He wasn't that bad before. Why did he suddenly...?

567
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,080
I don't know why he's doing that.

568
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,580
Maybe we didn't realize his condition was getting worse.

569
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,310
If we had known a little earlier, things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

570
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,200
Oh, it's not your fault.

571
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,730
Still, it's a good thing we found him before he got on a bus.

572
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:37,440
If he had gotten on the bus and went all the way to Gwangju in Gyeonggi Province...

573
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,840
Gwangju in Gyeonggi Province?

574
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,870
Yes. Earlier, the driver...

575
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,660
- What is it? 
 - I told you once, right?

576
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,930
That he ended up in that state after an accident while investigating eight years ago?

577
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:59,300
Where we found him at that time was a hospital in Gwangju that had closed down.

578
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,730
By chance, could he have been trying to go there?

579
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,380
No way. Suddenly?

580
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,800
I mean... you said that he's started behaving strangely just recently.

581
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,510
He could be doing that because he thought of something.

582
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,400
Like he left something there.

583
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,390
  Notice of Closure

584
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,270
He was found fallen there,

585
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,500
barely breathing.

586
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,740
 A hospital in Gwangju, in Gyeonggi Province,

587
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,280
 an officer is hurt. An emergency situation has happened!

588
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,410
 Requesting 119 assistance!

589
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,900
Maybe someone pushed him?

590
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:18,580
I also was suspicious of that, but there weren't any clues leading to that.

591
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,750
At the time, the criminal was caught at a completely different place,

592
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,840
and the location being where it was, I thought he fell during while investigating.

593
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,800
But you said the investigation notebook wasn't on him when he was found?

594
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,640
Right. He used to keep it with him at all times, but he didn't have it.

595
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,890
I didn't think it was odd at the time since I couldn't even think about that kind of thing, given the situation.

596
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,880
What is it?

597
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,420
Nothing.

598
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:17,410
What's the matter? It's like you saw a ghost.

599
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,880
Seriously, in the middle of the night, in a closed hospital like this...

600
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,330
why would there be a ghost?

601
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,230
Oh, my god!

602
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,660
What's the matter?

603
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,160
I was looking at my feet and walking...

604
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,190
- The feet? 
 - Something brushed past!

605
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,840
I think there are mice.

606
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:23,060
There's nothing much, so let's go now.

607
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,730
Stop! What if you see a dead mouse or something?

608
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,100
I mean, I touched something solid.

609
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,740
Could this be

610
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,420
your father's notebook?

611
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,260
That's it.

612
00:56:56,550 --> 00:57:01,940
It's good. Although the culprit was caught a while ago,

613
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:07,090
it's meaningful for both your father and you.

614
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,570
What's the matter?

615
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,880
It's almost the same.

616
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,490
The profile that Dad wrote eight years ago.

617
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,900
Huh? What's that about?

618
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:26,370
Back then, Dad, at the hospital room earlier, had discovered the scene of a murder.

619
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,470
Damn it.

620
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:49,770
"Based on the blood on the floor, the murderer killed the victim here."

621
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,980
- "I don't think  he was experienced in killing."
 -  I don't think he was experienced in killing.

622
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,310
 He may have watched the person dying.

623
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:59,330
 And the bloodstain on the bedsheet

624
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:03,440
  appears to be the victim's right thumbprint.
(Son Ji Min; Sunam Girls' School)

625
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,080
 I don't think it happened accidentally. The fingerprint is so clear,

626
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,670
 it appears to be the result of a desire to collect.

627
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:15,960
 "And the bloodstain on the bedsheet

628
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,840
 appears to be the victim's right thumbprint."

629
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,150
The b-bloody thumbprint. Why is it turning up there?

630
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:32,940
Perhaps the murder of the girl eight years ago was his first.

631
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,050
He erased all the evidence my dad had found

632
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,650
and he was dormant for a long time,

633
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:48,830
and he reappeared as a more sophisticated and terrifying predatory killer.

634
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,940
I-I am sorry.

635
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,240
No way.

636
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,330
 What the heck is happening? This is ...

637
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,240
 There's nothing about what happened eight years ago.

638
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,630
 Detective Inspector Profiler Ryoo Jae Joon arrested a 17-year-old...

639
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,960
 If what is written in the notebook is true, the true culprit was not arrested then.

640
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,180
 Was that me again?

641
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,580
 It can't be.

642
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:50,590
 The detective's case book? Are you kidding?

643
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:54,670
 If it was eight years ago, I was very ordinary.

644
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,230
If it was during the winter eight years ago, you ran away.

645
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,250
You are saying I ran away from home?

646
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,080
Brother-in-law, you did something like that?

647
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,390
Yeah.  You said the president ( Dad ) made you so worried.

648
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,830
When did I ever?

649
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,450
A grown man needs to experience the world. You're talking nonsense.

650
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,350
Why in the world did I run away?

651
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:19,050
I'm not sure.

652
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,190
Ah. It was after your discharge from the army and you couldn't decide whether to go back to school

653
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,730
or what path to follow, and you were bumming around, probably.

654
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:30,260
Don't you happen to know where I was or what I did?

655
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,160
You don't know?

656
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,790
This is tasty. It ripened up well.

657
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,260
Mom, give me more rice.

658
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,390
Oh, our Dong Chan's appetite is back.

659
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,350
Dong Chan is ...

660
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,590
Why are you picking at your food? Is something wrong?

661
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,360
It's nothing.

662
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,600
Eat a lot, Dong Chan.

663
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,650
Our Dong Chan even asked for more rice.

664
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,370
 Officer Sim

665
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,440
So you're saying, the culprit from eight years ago hasn't been caught.

666
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,820
And that guy is the predator.

667
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,940
Then, what about Nam Seong Cheol?

668
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:25,180
When I looked into it, eight years ago, Mr. Nam was working overseas for a construction company.

669
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,060
He has nothing to do with that case.

670
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,760
Ah yes. But he definitely told me he was the predator.

671
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,730
He probably wanted to be.

672
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:38,590
The predator we're after is a very skilled killer.

673
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:41,120
But Mr. Nam was an amateur.

674
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:45,800
Even when he tried to kill you, he tested it out and almost died.

675
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,040
I don't know how he got his information about predators,

676
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,150
but it's highly likely he's a copycat.

677
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:56,940
So based on the notebook you found, you're going to start investigating the predator murderer again?

678
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,260
Yes.

679
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:04,120
I'm going to go back to the origin, assuming that the case from eight years ago was his first murder.

680
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,680
I'm going to investigate everything again.

681
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,400
Thank you. This is all because of you.

682
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,160
Ah, no.

683
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,830
I won't need to help with anything, right?

684
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:26,200
It just so happens that I was going to ask for your help.

685
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,300
So where are we going right now?

686
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,820
First, I was going to go show him, the owner of the notebook.

687
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,000
Visiting Sim Seok Goo?

688
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,070
Yes. During our visit, are we allowed to go out for a walk?

689
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,400
If the doctor approves ...

690
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,190
Oh, Sim Seok Goo already left for a walk.

691
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:52,120
What? My mom is at home.

692
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,130
Who is he with?

693
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,510
Director Seo.

694
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,390
Dad!

695
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:25,260
You two came together.

696
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:31,000
The weather was nice so I brought him out for a walk. I used my doctor connections.

697
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,560
Thank you.

698
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,970
Dad, how are you feeling today?

699
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:43,460
Dad, I found your old case notebook.

700
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,700
Take a look. It hasn't changed.

701
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,460
Dad, look carefully.

702
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,580
You don't remember?

703
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:03,560
What is that?

704
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,440
The legendary Detective Sim's case notebook.

705
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,130
She thought it might be helpful for her dad. You don't need to worry about it.

706
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:22,170
Case notebook?

707
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:30,350
Dad.

708
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:37,560
The culprit you were chasing, I promise I'll catch him.

709
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:49,520
Dad, we're leaving.

710
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:12,340
Ahjussi, your daughter keeps doing dangerous work. You must be worried.

711
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,550
She has no idea the kind of guy she's running around with.

712
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:25,780
That friend has killed six people.

713
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,030
Was it seven?

714
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,950
Oh, that's right. He's also the one who made you this way.

715
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:38,590
What did you say? He's not?

716
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,030
He is.

717
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,590
I'm going to make it that way.

718
01:05:54,510 --> 01:06:00,140
Your daughter may also be murdered. She should be careful.

719
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,960
I guess you can't speak.

720
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:25,320
 Psychopath Diary

721
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:33,960

722
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,170
 This may be my last diary.

723
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:42,390
 Hyungnim, a man like you is turning his back on the world!

724
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,100
 Tomorrow at 4 pm.
Get an undertaker ready and go out near the Kang River bridge.

725
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,780
 How does he know? Who exactly?

726
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,460
 Eventually he will become a real predator.

727
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,760
 He will be arrested by your daughter.

728
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,770
 I've received a text message from an unknown number.

729
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,960
 He wants to give me a tip as to the identity of the predator killer.

730
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,250
 Then, this time my trophy will be...

731
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,140
 I think I like you.

732
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,540
 Is that alright with you?
