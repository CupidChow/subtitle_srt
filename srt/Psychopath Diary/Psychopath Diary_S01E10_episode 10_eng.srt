 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,390
 By chance, have you contacted the police?

5
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,200
 I'm sure I warned you.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,870
 What can I do?

7
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,960
 I'm giving you 48 hours.

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,110
 If you can't get 10 billion by then,

9
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,210
 you're going to have to kill me.

10
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,000
 Psychopath Diary

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,720
Yes, I would like to get a loan. 
  Episode 10

12
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,320
I'm an office worker. An assistant manager in a securities company. A manager.

13
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,530
A manager.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,060
I need something as collateral?

15
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,520
A house or any real estate?

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,580
I don't have any.

17
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,800
That is, the amount I need is quite big, one billion  (≈ $860,000) .

18
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,940
One, billion. One—

19
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,530
Hello? Hel—

20
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,510
 A loan is impossible. Should I get my hands on the company's money?

21
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,760
I need collateral? But I don't have any?

22
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,330
Sunbae. Sunbae, aren't you going home?

23
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,210
I should.

24
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,740
Is there something worrying you?

25
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,710
Is it a dating problem?

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,100
If there's something wrong, just tell us. Go ahead and tell us.

27
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,850
That is ...

28
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,870
 Manager's husband is unemployed.

29
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,610
 Mi Joo, her home us buried in debts.

30
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,950
 And Seok Hyeon ...

31
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,650
It's nothing much.

32
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,760
We'll go first.

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,650
We're really going.

34
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,770
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,940
- Did you check the number? 
 - It's a burner phone.

36
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,360
And I think it was paid in advance using a foreign tourist's identity.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,250
Okay. Anyway, thank you.

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,720
Why exactly are you like that this time?

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,290
I'll let you know once it becomes certain.

40
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,760
No. I'm not asking out of curiosity.

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,060
It's because I was caught by the C\chief when making the demand for communication records analysis.

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,140
I knew you'd be like this.

43
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,220
Sim Bo Gyeong, what else are you doing outside of your duty?

44
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,390
My apologies. That is, it's a bit difficult to tell you now—

45
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,650
Never mind. Well, I guess you don't care anymore now that you're being transferred.

46
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,490
Just know that you're going to be reported for disobeying orders and abusing governmental authority.

47
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,370
Understood?

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,150
Won't you answer?

49
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,520
Who do we have here?

50
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,310
Please relax, and could I talk with Corporal Sim for a little bit?

51
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,750
An informant? Are you sure?

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,320
I will have to confirm it, but seeing how he's being more than careful than needed, I don't think it's a prank.

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,730
This important matter, were you thinking of taking care of it without even reporting to me?

54
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,650
You're saying you can't even trust me?

55
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,770
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,650
No. Maybe your judgment is the right one.

57
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,480
- Sorry? 
 - That I could be wrong.

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,120
That time, I was sure of myself when I did it,

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,610
but in hindsight, after Sunbae became like that, I think it was harder to admit.

60
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,360
If as you say, I am wrong,

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,640
then there was another real culprit that time, and if that culprit is the predator, I want to catch him with my own hands.

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,490
No. With you.

63
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,010
Uncle.

64
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,880
If you get contacted by the informant, can you perhaps let me know?

65
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,620
Yes, I will do so.

66
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,090
About you being transferred, I'll talk to the higher-ups and put it on hold until this case gets resolved.

67
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,490
I found out through my friends,

68
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,210
and they said Park Moo Seok is running a private detective agency after having been fired from the police.

69
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,980
Did you get caught having an affair with a married woman?

70
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,860
But then again, to demand that kind of money over something like that doesn't make sense.

71
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,200
Right, that's right!

72
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,810
They found out your identity, right?

73
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,420
Well, it's something similar.

74
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,590
This is not an ordinary thing. What should I do? Should I get my men out to the streets?

75
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,830
There are tons of guys whose lives are already in shambles anyway!

76
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,920
Or can't you just take care of it yourself?

77
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,960
I can't.

78
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,940
You're saying you won't draw blood but solve this situation with money.

79
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,190
Understood.

80
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,360
You must have some meaningful goal to be like this, I guess.

81
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,750
Trust only me.

82
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,860
Right man, I, uh? I consider him more than my real brother. Much higher.

83
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,230
He is the Hyungnim I am serving.

84
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,470
Ah, yes, yes.

85
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,590
So... why do you need 10 billion?

86
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,340
This bastard, you said you wouldn't ask but just give it!

87
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,170
You haven't been operated on, right?

88
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,990
I had a car accident, I was hurt badly,

89
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,060
- but my memories ... 
 - Ah, your brain?

90
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,360
Your brain, just put that aside.

91
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,290
You can sign a contract to give up your body, right?

92
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,560
Sorry?

93
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,700
Man, you're going too far! My Hyungnim, signing his body away?

94
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,910
It's not like I'm in the business to lose money. To be honest, this isn't enough for 10 billion.

95
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,880
I need collateral at least.

96
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,230
Then, it does look like you'll need something as collateral.

97
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,960
Let's see ...

98
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,230
Something like Meat Republic.

99
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,820
Father's shop?

100
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,810
Ten billion.

101
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,310
It is 89,500 won.

102
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,820
Thank you, Goodbye!

103
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,980
Goodbye!

104
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,200
Go safely!

105
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,020
Like this, today is gone as well.

106
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,670
What's with you at this hour?

107
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,610
I have something to tell you.

108
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,570
What is it?

109
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,370
That is ...

110
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,090
The shop is doing well, right?

111
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,330
Just today we had a lot of customers, didn't we?

112
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,410
Everyone is making a fuss that business isn't going well, so we are blessed.

113
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,890
I hope to get many more customers tomorrow than we did today.

114
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,740
I'll die if that's the case!

115
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,920
Why would you die? I'll work that much harder!

116
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,430
And our Dong Chan can help as well.

117
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,930
These days, although real estate is not so good, business here is going well in this shop.

118
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,500
The market value must have gone up a lot!

119
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,230
Right!

120
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,260
When we first came here, there was nothing around. Right?

121
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,240
Right. There was nothing around us,

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,330
and you and I were like Adam and Eve.

123
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,860
Seriously.

124
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,190
Dong Sik, you don't remember right?

125
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,730
Where should I start?

126
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,430
You should start by when we met, of course!

127
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,950
Right! Whoa, it's been eighteen years already.

128
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,030
Once you get to know him, President is a romantic.

129
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,700
He said he lived like a crippled person after the death of your mother.

130
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,470
Ji Yeon couldn't stand to see me like that, so she told me to go hiking.

131
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,460
But at that time, I wasn't hiking but was fighting with the mountain.

132
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,690
This distressed heart; either the mountain would win it or I would.

133
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,980
I could liken him to a wolf who was wounded.

134
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,380
The sight was so pitiful, I felt my heart being trampled every time I saw him.

135
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,740
I kept thinking of him, wondering if he was okay. And I wanted to comfort him.

136
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,120
After taking it out on the mountain that way for several years, I became the president of the hiking club.

137
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
But the mountain, no matter how evilly I rammed into it,

138
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,160
or how much I trampled on it, she took it all

139
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,110
without a complaint.

140
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,260
 Once I released it all and threw it all away ...

141
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:30,550
  President, it's arrowroot juice that's good for you.

142
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,620
 Thank you.

143
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,470
 Say ...

144
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,160
 Yes?

145
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,360
I can't hear, I can't hear.

146
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,960
I can't hear.

147
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,610
So, this shop—

148
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,490
I got rid of the clothes store I was running there,

149
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,380
and by combining the money with the president's pension, we bought this shop.

150
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,300
At first, it was desolate.

151
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,640
But still, thanks to withstanding all of it quietly and resolutely,

152
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,470
we managed to send all of you to school properly,

153
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,860
and now the business is doing really well. It's something to be really thankful for.

154
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,760
Ah, yes.

155
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,600
Even if I die, I will die here.

156
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,960
Even if someone gives me an enormous amount of money, I won't sell this shop.

157
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,710
But didn't you say you had something to ask?

158
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,370
It seems like I did, but as I was listening to you two talk,

159
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,890
I forgot about it.

160
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,950
This kid. So bland.

161
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,140
- And everything's fine at work? 
 - Yes.

162
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,850
Is the director you came here with doing well?

163
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,150
He looks like a pretty nice person.

164
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,990
He is a nice person. He treats me well.

165
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,580
Yeah, he seemed to really like you.

166
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,630
If you're ever having a hard time, make sure you discuss it with him.

167
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,980
If you have someone strong backing you up, no matter how difficult things may get,

168
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,700
you'll always have a way out.

169
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,610
Isn't it time for Ji Hoon to slowly return to work?

170
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,050
I'm looking for something easy he can do. Just tell him to rest for now.

171
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,600
Why are you treating him like a patient?

172
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,190
If you listen to him, something really did happen.

173
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,820
You didn't even look into it any further.

174
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,630
Given my personality, do you think I didn't look into it and just glossed it over?

175
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,030
Even still ...

176
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,390
You're here?

177
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,940
Yes, you're still up?

178
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,040
I should turn in now.

179
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,350
In Woo, just speak comfortably with the president.

180
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,010
Yes.

181
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm actually hearing your name come out of her mouth.

182
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,080
Even when you were younger and called her "mom,"

183
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,480
she would always respond with "hey" or  "you."

184
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,650
And when you got older it was Director Seo.

185
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,770
Did she?

186
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,470
She's smart enough to notice. I guess she caught a scent.

187
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,310
Ji Ho is still a space cadet and needs to snap out it.

188
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,870
Since you became the director, the asset management team has become pretty impressive.

189
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,640
If there are no problems, the company will soon be yours.

190
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,600
There won't be ... any sort of problem.

191
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,780
As it should be.

192
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,960
Have a glass.

193
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,680
We're one team now so if you have a hard time, don't try to solve it on your own.

194
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,610
Come talk to me about it anytime.

195
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,460
Understand?

196
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,280
 Director Seo In Woo

197
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,130
It's the 10 billion you requested.

198
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,020
I was trying to be discreet so it took some time.

199
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,140
You worked hard.

200
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:14,700
I wanted to invest it in something before it was too late. I asked for a difficult favor.

201
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,080
If it was something like that, then there was no need to hide it from me.

202
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,440
The real reason ...

203
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,350
Do you want to know it?

204
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,400
 Underworld

205
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,900
Only if it's something I must know.

206
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,000
Also when you suddenly sent me to the audit team when I was doing very well as a dealer...

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,100
Even when I jumped in while risking danger when you tried to kick out Director Seo Ji Hoon...

208
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,900
All this time, while serving you, I've never doubted you.

209
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,320
That you will take me to the top.

210
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,370
If it has nothing to do with that, I'll pretend not to know.

211
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,000
You really are smart, as I expected, Team Leader Jo.

212
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes, Mister Dong Sik. What is it at this late hour?

213
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,390
What is it that's making you so nervous?

214
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,390
That is ...

215
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,070
Is it money problems? Ah, that must be it.

216
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,010
How much do you need?

217
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,570
That ...

218
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,480
It doesn't have to be that difficult.

219
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,880
In our relationship, I could let you borrow at least 1 billion.

220
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,860
You don't need to be surprised. That is how much I value you.

221
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,670
I think I made a mistake.

222
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,100
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,270
No way ... do you need more than that?

224
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,180
How much? Like 10 billion?

225
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,070
Really? That much?

226
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,570
Is that possible?

227
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,560
What's going on? Are you being threatened?

228
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,270
No, that's not it. Threatened?

229
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,190
That's a relief if that's the case.

230
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:45,150
It seems like you can't talk about it. For now, I'll see what I can do.

231
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,930
But that's a lot of money so I don't think I can loan you that much.

232
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,470
 I asked him for nothing.

233
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,310
 How am I going to get that huge amount?

234
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,030
 Do you have the money ready?

235
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,440
 It's too much.

236
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,080
 If I can't pay in installments, can't you give me more time?

237
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,490
 You don't seem to be understanding the situation. If I go to the police ...

238
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,010
 No, if I open my mouth to Corporal Sim, it's the end for you.

239
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,430
 Tomorrow, 4 o'clock. Ten billion.

240
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,890
 The place, Number 12 Dosu-dong,  Seoin City, Gyeonggi-do.

241
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,020
 Basement of an abandoned factory.

242
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,850
Why isn't he responding?

243
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,680
It seems like you're waiting for an important answer.

244
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,100
It's something very important.

245
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,240
But I guess he can't decide whether to do it or not.

246
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,990
If the condition is right, wouldn't the other person do it?

247
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,900
It's not my style to make someone come to a decision.

248
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,850
Then?

249
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,870
I have to make the other person make a move.

250
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,790
However, I want him to.

251
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,790
Sir, if you fall asleep here, you'll be in trouble. You need to head home.

252
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,560
I called for a designated driver.

253
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,290
Why isn't the driver coming?

254
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,420
Where did you park your car?

255
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,700
Car? My car. Where did my car go?

256
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,480
What is your car model and plate number?

257
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,540
42 Do 5959.

258
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,320
Huh?

259
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,720
Wait, I sold my car. But where is the designated driver?

260
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,820
So why didn't you go to the PR team when they sent you and are suffering like this here?

261
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,100
Excuse me, can't you call my wife for me?

262
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,290
What about your wife?

263
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,330
  But I'm single.

264
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,600
 Tomorrow at 5. Place is Dosu-dong.

265
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,220
 I'll contact you again for specific location.

266
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,130
- What about siblings? 
 - I'm an only child.

267
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,170
He contacted you again?

268
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,810
 If it's 5 o'clock, it's the same time he agreed to meet with me.

269
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,850
 This is an ultimatum.

270
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,690
 If I don't keep my promise, he's going to reveal everything to Bo Gyeong.

271
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,260
I need to tell you. From now on, I'm going to be reporting to Captain Ryoo and working alongside him.

272
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,730
I feel bad since you've helped me throughout all of this but—

273
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,770
It's okay. I also had something come up.

274
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,650
Did something happen?

275
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,780
Your expression has been dark lately.

276
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,830
No, it's nothing.

277
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,230
I may not know what it is, but it will work out.

278
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,370
If I get some good news, I'll let you know, too.

279
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,910
Take care.

280
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,460
He hasn't been like this in a while, but he's at it again.

281
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,040
In the end... is the only option to kill?

282
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,970
I can't though.

283
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,640
But if I don't do anything... What do I do?

284
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,540
 I understand.

285
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,200
♫  Let's ride you ready?  ♫

286
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,140
♫  Damn.  ♫

287
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,090
♫  Now!  ♫

288
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,480
♫  Right now.  ♫

289
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
♫  Awaken me!!!  ♫

290
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,950
♫  I fly like a flake in the sky  ♫

291
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,330
♫  Just right now  ♫

292
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:50,200
♫  awaken me I walk in your pain all the time  ♫

293
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,230
♫  Cush! Blown away! Blown away!!  ♫

294
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,640
♫  Blown away!!  ♫

295
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,030
♫  I need to get up  ♫

296
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,620
♫  stick it on me  ♫

297
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,650
 The wild beast I was going to put away deep in my soul;

298
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,490
  in the end, must I set it loose?

299
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,330
 Even though I try to end the life of a predator,

300
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,460
 is it a shackle that I can't free myself of?

301
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,030
There's no way the drug still has an affect.

302
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,230
Don't be like this.

303
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,350
Seeing how you're dying to live, it makes me want to kill you.

304
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm sorry. Please save me once!

305
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,350
Then I'll live as though I'm dead!

306
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,450
I said I won't kill you.

307
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,460
You have all the evidence anyway, Director!

308
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,180
No matter what I say, no one will believe me!

309
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,090
The game's already over, isn't it?

310
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,160
Your game is indeed over, but mine is just starting.

311
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,030
I want to take care of you myself, but this time, I'm only going to set the table and leave.

312
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,590
Since Yook Dong Sik will be the one eating.

313
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,590
No. No.

314
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,810
Look at this, this doesn't work that well.

315
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,350
That's why you have to use the proper tool.

316
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,150
What? You want me to just lend you the car?

317
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,530
Did Park Moo Seok contact you again?

318
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,360
No. He didn't.

319
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Hyungnim, do you know how suspicious you've been lately?

320
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,010
You said you wouldn't ask or nitpick about anything!

321
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,240
If it wasn't for an urgent appointment coming up today, right now,

322
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,500
without asking or nitpicking about anything, I would have tagged along, but—

323
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,420
Thank you.

324
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,230
Be careful.

325
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,700
Hyungnim... what happened here is that

326
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,870
I... had an urgent appointment. And while I was on my way,

327
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,730
I met a junior who I used to have under me.

328
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,110
His name is Gyeong Sik, and he's a huge guy.

329
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,950
His hands are enormous, too!

330
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,480
And I said, "Hey, it's been a while!" and shook his hand,

331
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,360
and the moment I did, "Ouch!"

332
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,070
It really hurt!

333
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,510
He used to wrestle since he was young, you see? So once he gets a hold of you, you're done!

334
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,140
But still, when I grabbed his hand...

335
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,990
It's a little embarrassing to tell you,

336
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,100
but I fainted.

337
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,370
And when I opened my eyes,

338
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,390
I was in here!

339
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,940
It's ridiculous, isn't it? How do you think I feel?

340
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,930
When I opened my eyes,

341
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,570
I was here...

342
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,060
Eat well and live well, you predator!

343
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,210
He's cool.

344
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,120
 There's a traffic jam, so I think I'll be about 30 minutes late.

345
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,780
 I'm very sorry, but what can I do?

346
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,140
 I'll just wait 30 minutes. As long as you have the money.

347
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,630
He's going to resort to petty tricks?

348
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,550
Of course, he should.

349
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,800
When he's in a situation where he has to kill a person for the first time in his life.

350
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:59,090
 Really, truly, this is the last time.

351
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:17,130
 Wait. If he's expecting me to blindside him,

352
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,630
 walking through the door is a stupid thing to do.

353
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,230
Just open the door and go in!

354
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,980
 On the outside, it looks like he's defenseless.

355
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,500
 But if he's already figured out my identity as a predator and

356
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,930
 instead of being in fear, he threatens me...

357
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,360
  There's no way he would.

358
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,450
 Before the guy goes crazy and reacts,

359
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,400
  a way to kill him...

360
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,130
  As the result of researching all night...

361
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,480
  Godfather

362
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,140
 The scene that's known to be brutal in Godfather, how Luca Brasi's breath was cut off...

363
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,210
  that method...

364
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,630
Seriously...

365
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,950
 What happened? Is he sleeping?

366
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,190
 He really fell asleep.

367
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,260
 I thought ...

368
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,410
 It's time ... to do what I need to do.

369
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,180
I'm spoonfeeding him! Why can't he eat?

370
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,680
 I need to go quickly after him.

371
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,740
 If he meets Bo Gyeong, I'm finished.

372
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,960
There's still time before 5 o'clock so wait here for now.

373
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,250
Once you get in touch with the informant, make contact by yourself.

374
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,900
- Let's just keep each other informed about the situation while we're nearby.
 - Yes.

375
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,540
 What are you doing right now?

376
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,970
 The predator murderer is Seo In Woo.

377
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:58,220
 The one I threatened was also Seo In Woo.

378
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,500
I want to keep you alive, too...

379
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,410
But ...

380
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,920
 That's not it.

381
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,890
 Just untie me.

382
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,770
 I'll tell you everything.

383
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,700
I wouldn't have even thought about this if I had a choice.

384
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,250
But you're the one who made it like this.

385
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,130
Where am I supposed to get that large sum of money?

386
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,450
 I wasn't asking you for the money.

387
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,500
 Seo In Woo is the predator!

388
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,890
 Not you. Seo. In. Woo.

389
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,200
Do you know that? I quit killing people.

390
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,120
I'm a psychopath who has no tears or blood.

391
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I was really trying to live an ordinary life.

392
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,390
So why did you wake a sleeping beast?

393
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,500
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!

394
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,980
Why?!!

395
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,590
 This bastard.

396
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,260
 Are you crazy?

397
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,910
You're probably scared of me. You're regretting this.

398
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,100
But it can't be helped.

399
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,850
Now ...

400
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,880
 Hold on.

401
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,100
 Just untie me.

402
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,620
 I'll tell you everything. Untie me!

403
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,960
 C R Z Y!!!

404
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,190
 By chance... did Bo Gyeong ...

405
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,790
 Was it just the wind?

406
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,760
 Of course. Bo Gyeong doesn't know the exact location.

407
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,830
Just kill him already!

408
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,610
It's so frustrating, I can't watch.

409
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,630
 I'm near Dosu-dong. Where should I meet you?

410
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:59,100
 Yook Dong Sik

411
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,010
 Director Seo In Woo

412
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,350
 What are you doing right now?

413
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:19,210
That is ... I'm a little busy.

414
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,490
I don't think you're that busy.

415
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,330
No, I'm really—

416
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,540
I got the money.

417
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,260
What?

418
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,500
Let's meet.

419
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,510
Hello.

420
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,570
Have a drink.

421
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,820
Thank you.

422
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,800
This favor ... I'll properly thank you for it next time.

423
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,950
I'm in a bit of a rush right now.

424
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,000
Wait a minute.

425
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,710
You're being threatened, aren't you?

426
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,870
- That is... 
 - I'm loaning you 10 billion. I should at least know that much.

427
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,740
You're correct.

428
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,740
As expected. I've been through a similar situation, so I know.

429
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,910
Will it be solved with money?

430
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,040
What? What are you saying?

431
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,120
I mean, if this were an ordinary negotiation, that would be it.

432
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,700
But a person who manipulates someone's weakness for money; will this be enough for them to keep their promise?

433
00:45:53,930 --> 00:46:00,180
In any case, since it's the money I'm loaning you, you can decide what you want to do with it.

434
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,270
But just be careful.

435
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:07,370
Once you get dragged around once, you'll continue to be dragged around.

436
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,890
Then, what should I do?

437
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,410
You need to make it so you can't be threatened again.

438
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,810
Using whatever means necessary.

439
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,830
By any means necessary.

440
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,300
Yes, Bo Gyeong.

441
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,870
Oh, really? It can't be helped then. I understand.

442
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,240
What did she say?

443
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,360
It's nothing much.

444
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,280
I asked her if I could meet with her today.

445
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,220
The identity of an informant has been found and they're currently tracking him down.

446
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,130
I see.

447
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,480
Then I'll get going.

448
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,260
What's wrong, didn't you need money?

449
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,320
- That's right. 
 - Yes.

450
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,900
I'm sorry.

451
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,800
Don't be discouraged. Getting stood up by an informant happens quite often.

452
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,230
Let's get back for now, and...

453
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,130
  Things have gotten a little more complicated.

454
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,360
  What's wrong? I'll help.

455
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,780
  I was going to take a large amount of money from the guy by threatening him.

456
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,180
  Are you being pursued?

457
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,400
 9467B831

458
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,420
The culprit seems to have busted him.

459
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,250
But...

460
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,270
What's this?

461
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,520
 Danger Daesunggan 
 91R2  R1H1

462
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,890
It was information concerning the location of the telephone pole.

463
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,990
Let's go.

464
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:53,070
The way this world works is quite ... funny.

465
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,110
I somehow managed to get the money,

466
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,320
but it seems like,

467
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,920
I have to kill you.

468
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,490
  Identification Card

469
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,170
Park Moo Seok?

470
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,680
Do you know this person?

471
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,250
He was a former detective.

472
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,760
Request the location of the mobile phone as well as back up. And start searching the surrounding area.

473
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,300
- In groups of two. 
 - Yes, sir.

474
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,930
Who the hell are you?

475
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,740
Why are you doing this?

476
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,710
This guy was caught for taking bribes at an adult entertainment establishment and had to retire in disgrace.

477
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:05,410
It seems after that he worked in something like a private detective agency.

478
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,960
- Inspector Ryoo. 
 - Yes. Did you locate his cell phone?

479
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:14,450
  It's a 2G phone, and for now, the base station says we seem to be in the vicinity.

480
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:25,360
Uncle! Look over there.

481
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,380
Informant is dead. What about the suspect?

482
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,050
  I think he has already gotten away.

483
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,520
The Predator Murderer?

484
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,500
Wasn't he already dead? What's going on!

485
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,730
Nam was simply a copycat.

486
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,880
Of course, whether his death was an accident, or is this another predator killing,

487
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,160
we can't give you a definite answer right now.

488
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,150
What is certain, is a former detective who was trying to inform us about the Predator Murderer was murdered.

489
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:13,430
And the chances are high that the culprit is the Predator Murderer we've been looking for.

490
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,760
Corporate Sim's theory is plausible.

491
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,710
Moreover, if it's Park Moo Seok, he was in a dirty line of work.

492
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:24,220
Maybe even before we started our investigation, there is a possibility he was connected to the culprit.

493
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,820
This is an issue of the police department's reputation.

494
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,000
if you deal with it sloppily, and by chance it gets leaked to the press,  you know what will happen, right?

495
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,400
A controversy will erupt over the poor investigation of the special team,

496
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,140
and they will go crazy talking about the involvement of an ex-cop.

497
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,120
If you leave it to me, we will proceed quietly.

498
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,500
As soon as we learn anything definite,  I will let you know.

499
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,430
Do that.

500
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,140
After we capture the culprit, the connection to the case eight years ago is going to be a problem.

501
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,520
I think for now we should focus on the murder of the informant.

502
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,630
I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.

503
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,040
Trust me this time.

504
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,400
Thank you, Uncle.

505
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,430
 It's been a while, Chairman.

506
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,880
Who is this again?

507
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,770
This is Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon who was in charge of the murder case eight years ago

508
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,400
where a high school girl was killed.

509
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,970
So what is this about?

510
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,470
I think I should meet with you, Chairman.

511
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,420
 Exactly what's wrong with me?

512
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,640
 It's not even the first time.

513
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,830
 Is something broken somewhere?

514
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:34,320
 By chance, can I see you today?

515
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,590
 Corporal Sim

516
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,250
 The call cannot be connected, so you'll be forwarded to voicemail.

517
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,640
 You'll be charged once it beeps.

518
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,430
Maybe he's very busy working at the restaurant?

519
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,380
Something good must have happened overnight.

520
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,710
I had a killer night.

521
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,000
Right. About the personal investment matter I mentioned before,

522
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,590
it's a little slower to make a profit than expected, but it looks like it'll be fun to watch.

523
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,020
I'm glad.

524
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,490
Do you have something to report?

525
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,860
It's about Yook Dong Sik in asset management team 3.

526
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,560
Yeah, what is it?

527
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,920
He hasn't shown up for work. He's never done this before, apparently.

528
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,650
Really?

529
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,680
Maybe he has some tormenting matter or something.

530
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,540
 A 49-year-old former detective identified as Mr. Park. was found murdered.

531
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,250
Does he pick up or not?

532
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,260
He's not picking up and not reading the texts either.

533
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:33,740
Maybe he's sick somewhere? If not, from drinking?

534
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,870
Oh, Dong Sik Sunbae? No way.

535
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:36,150
Hey, do you know anything?

536
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,690
No, I don't really know anything specific.

537
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:41,770
What do you know then? You know nothing!

538
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,840
Seriously! Call him again! Hurry!

539
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,570
What happened to him? I'm so worried!

540
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,450
 Suicide Note

541
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,140
 In-office phone shortcut number change

542
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,340
- In-office phone— 
 - What is it?

543
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,490
Oh, no. It's nothing. Nothing.

544
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:05,120
What are you talking about?! Seriously!

545
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,400
Really, did something happen to him?

546
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,820
How could Yook Dong Sik not show up to work without notice? It doesn't make sense!

547
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,610
Dong Sik didn't come to work?

548
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:21,650
I couldn't get ahold of him at all, so I thought he'd be here at this hour.

549
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:25,140
I know.  He must have gone home after work.

550
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,160
Then I'll go directly there.

551
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,560
There is still some time left before I need to start my shift.

552
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:36,250
But, he sure did look as though something has been bothering him. Right?

553
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,680
Did you feel it, too?

554
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,810
The last time I saw him, I asked Sunbae.

555
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:43,810
Of course, he said it wasn’t a big deal, given his personality.

556
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,570
I know.

557
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:50,270
What is it? Could it be a romance problem?

558
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,010
Oh, by the way, why did you come to see Sunbae Dong Sik?

559
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:06,480
Just ... I need to talk to him.

560
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,460
Miss Bo Gyeong.

561
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,000
In Woo

562
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,040
In Woo?

563
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:23,540
Should I be jealous that you came to the company because you are worried about Dong Sik?

564
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,870
That's nothing like that—

565
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,120
Just kidding.

566
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,750
Actually,  I was going to contact you because I was worried.

567
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,710
Yesterday, he suddenly asked me for a large loan.

568
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,320
What?  How much is a large amount?

569
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:43,840
It’s not for me to tell you to that extent. Anyway, I think you need to talk to him.

570
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,140
Well, he didn’t go into the details, but he was very nervous.

571
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:55,450
- Maybe was being threatened by someone. 
 - Threatened?  That guy really. He didn't even tell me.

572
01:03:55,450 --> 01:04:01,010
Anyhow, seeing he's absent without notice, has something really happened to him?

573
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:04,420
I‘ll get going.

574
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:08,560
I don’t know what it’s about, but I’m sure he’s holed up at home, knowing his personality.

575
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,530
Are you going to visit him again? Then, I'll go with you since I'm worried.

576
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:15,650
It’s okay. I am worried too, so I’ll go.

577
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,530
It's you I am worried about.

578
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,470
It’s not like I'm going to catch a criminal.

579
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:27,580
I will update you once I see what situation he’s in.

580
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:50,580
 Except for a few lines, it hasn't appeared on the news

581
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,250
 thata person has died.

582
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,780
 Is that a relief?

583
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,560
 Is it really a relief?

584
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,420
 Dong Sik.  It's me.

585
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,020
 Dong Sik!

586
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,650
 Dong Sik. Are you listening?

587
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:19,610
 I know you are in there. Open the door. Please?

588
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,950
 Dong Sik!

589
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,610
I heard you were being threatened.

590
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,600
I heard everything from In Woo!

591
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,540
That’s why you're being like this now, right?

592
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,700
 I don't know the details but you can tell me everything.

593
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,540
 There must be a solution.

594
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:47,760
Are you going to continue being like this? I'm waiting until you come out.

595
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,600
Dong Sik!

596
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:57,010
Dong Sik!

597
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:09,100
Are you okay?

598
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,710
Umm ... a threat.  There's nothing like that.

599
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:17,780
You don't have to hide it. Tell me everything.  I will help you.

600
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,210
No.

601
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:26,250
I don't know what Director Seo said, but it's not like that.

602
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:30,560
Then, what are you doing now? Not going into the company like someone who can’t function.

603
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,830
Just ... Because my body hurts so much.

604
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:37,250
What do you mean you’re hurting? You can’t even lie well.

605
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:40,860
I’m telling you the truth. For real.

606
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,440
Dong Sik.  Are you okay?

607
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:52,470
You’ve got a temperature over 40℃. How can you be suffering all alone?

608
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,340
I'm sorry.

609
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:09,920
There's a lot I want to say, but let's do it next time.

610
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,570
I got you rice porridge and medicine, so make sure you have some.

611
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,280
Yes.

612
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,430
Then, I'll leave.

613
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,030
Dong Sik. Don't get up. It's okay.

614
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:25,450
No.

615
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,500
- I said it's okay. I can go.
- No.

616
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,490
Dong Sik. Really. It's okay. Get some rest.

617
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:34,460
I want to go to the bathroom.

618
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,720
Oh.

619
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:44,710
What the heck is all of this?

620
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:48,030
 He suddenly asked me for a large loan.

621
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:52,480
 He was so nervous. Maybe he’s been threatened or something.

622
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,720
 - What is happening? I’ll help.
- I was going to threaten the guy and get a large sum of money out of him.
- Are you being pursued?

623
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:35,930
 Psychopath Diary

624
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:44,020

625
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:52,140
  I think I need to quit working at the company.

626
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,530
 No way, did you run away?

627
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,850
 Do you think I killed Park Moo Seok?

628
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,670
 That sly old man.

629
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:01,400
  Just how much does he know?

630
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,870
 I'm going to burn it so no one can see it.

631
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,300
  Dong Sik, didn’t you lose something?

632
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,430
 I got a call from the bar. They will keep it in lost and found.

633
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,810
  To anyone's eyes he's a good man.

634
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:15,030
  But, is he really?
