 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,430
Heo Taek Soo, you're with the sergeant, right?

5
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,370
Yes.

6
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,240
Yook Dong Sik appeared nearby. I'm sure he's going after the sergeant. Where are you right now?

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,610
That's... Well, that's...

8
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,240
The south gate! We're at the south gate!

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,380
 South gate of the park?

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,440
He says they're at the park's south gate!

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,400
Over that way! Go!

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,360
 Jang Chil Seong

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,320
Yes, Chil Seong.

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,450
The police are on their way. They're here!

15
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,360
The police are headed this way. Let's get out of here first.

17
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,580
This way.

18
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,110
No, that way! Go! Not this way!

19
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,150
When they come, I'll stall them. Let's meet there.

20
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,020
You got it?

21
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,880
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,170
Hurry!

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,870
Let's go! Let's go!

24
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,180
 Psychopath Diary

25
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,220
 Episode 14

26
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,510
You're g-going there?

27
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,760
If I hide, that's the only place the police wouldn't suspect.

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,400
I don't know what you're talking about at all.

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,410
Let's go.

30
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,640
Go then, go. Let’s go.

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,040
I won't ask or nag you about it.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,330
So if you had told us your exact location, we could have caught him!

33
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,550
Well, we were there, but when I got off the walkie-talkie with you and looked around,

34
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,940
Yook Dong Sik was dragging away Sunbae already!

35
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,900
So you threw your whole body while protecting her, and you became like this?

36
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,090
You don't even know.

37
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,230
If you had come a little bit later with backup,

38
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,050
both of us, by that punk...

39
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,370
R-Right, Sunbae?

40
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,330
Anyway, we were inattentive this time, but don't worry.

41
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,250
We will make sure Yook Dong Sik doesn't appear near here again.

42
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,820
Of course. Just leave it to me.

43
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,560
Chief, you should go back now.

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,220
If your back is bad, leave the tough jobs to Officer Cha.

45
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,440
Don't worry.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,400
I'll see you out.

47
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,560
- Officer Cha, let's see them off. 
 - I can't.

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,430
Come with me!

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,940
You can come out now!

50
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:58,270
Th-The things is... where should I start explaining it to you?

51
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,150
You don't need to do that, Mr. Bingo-is-a-Dog's-Name.

52
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,640
Stay here comfortably. You know the saying, "It's the darkest under the lamp."

53
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,000
They'll never even dream that you'd be hiding out here.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Yes.

55
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,500
Just wait a second. I'll get you something to sleep in.

56
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,770
So this is Bo Gyeong's room.

57
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,760
The only men's clothes we have are Dad's.

58
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,420
Then the one who left the message at the escape cafe room is...

59
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,480
It must obviously have been him.

60
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,850
I'm certain he was watching us from nearby.

61
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,620
He's around us?

62
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,820
Then, since you know the contents of the diary thoroughly,

63
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,300
if we pare down and compare the people who correspond with the profiling—

64
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,580
There's no need for that.

65
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,810
- Pardon?
 - I... at the prison,

66
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,480
it was for a second, but I remembered it. In a flash.

67
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,040
R-Really?

68
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,320
Just when I was about to remember his face, it cut out, but

69
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,850
now, I've started to get my memory back,

70
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,260
so finding that guy is only a matter of time.

71
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,490
After he was arrested, I thought it would calm down, but an escape and a hostage situation on top of that?

72
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,040
I think there will be some damage to the company image as well.

73
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,380
The company is one thing, but maybe Ji Hoon nearly got attacked by that guy before, too?

74
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,420
That's right then! Now that I think about it, it gives me goosebumps! Right?

75
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,680
What's going on here?

76
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,820
We have stocks in the company, too, so we had some things to discuss.

77
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,100
Since the case has gotten bigger, it's starting to affect the sales for the company, too,

78
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,090
and there was a consensus that we may need some type of an emergency management system.

79
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,920
We wanted to see you over Ji Hoon's reinstatement matter.

80
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,460
He's also a victim when it comes down to it.

81
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,120
Being sent away when he's not a sinner is a little—

82
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,650
Yook Dong Sik and Yuseung Biomedi cases are separate issues.

83
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,480
Director Seo Ji Hoon's disciplinary action and personnel action was just,

84
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,700
and there won't be a reversal of the decision.

85
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,200
Well, we could call him back, depending on the atmosphere.

86
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:45,050
If problems continue to arise internally, it will be too much for you to manage alone.

87
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,150
That won’t happen.

88
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,070
Time will tell.

89
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,050
 Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong

90
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,390
 Seo In Woo

91
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,950
- Yes? 
 - Are you okay?

92
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,120
I saw the news. What happened?

93
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,920
Well, I'm okay.

94
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,550
Did Dong Sik really cause a hostage situation involving you?

95
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,140
Really?

96
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,390
Yes.

97
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,380
How could he do such...

98
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,160
But Bo Gyeong, to be honest,

99
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,890
I still find it really hard to believe that he's someone who could do something like that.

100
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,890
 The Dong Sik I know would never do that.

101
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,400
 Maybe there was a mistake?

102
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,630
If there's anything you know—

103
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,360
 No! (informally)

104
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,030
Pardon?

105
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,360
I'm a bit busy. Let's talk later.

106
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,370
 Bo Gyeong

107
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,330
Why don't you just advertise?!

108
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,050
- Dong Sik, red is not it.
 - Damn.

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,120
 Boring Day

110
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,880
What are you doing?

111
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,110
Huh? You never know, so...

112
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,730
Never know, my butt.

113
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,330
Oh! It's Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

114
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,220
- O-Over there, doesn't that look like Yook Dong Sik? 
 - I can't see.

115
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,360
- Over there, doesn't he look like him? 
 - I can't see him.

116
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,460
- Can't you see someone over there? 
 - No.

117
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,430
- What? 
 - I don't see anything.

118
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,730
How can you not see?

119
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,530
- What? Tell me again. 
 - I don't see anyone.

120
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,710
- What? 
 - I don't see. 
 - One more time!

121
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,830
- I don't see anything! 
 - That's your future.

122
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,930
Sunbae!

123
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,500
Did I tell you our house is drafty?

124
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,830
My mom got a cold. I'll go take her to the hospital quickly.

125
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,570
Then I'll take you.

126
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,390
Hey! What are you doing now?

127
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,070
You're working right now!

128
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,320
You should guard this place!

129
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,650
So what I'm saying is...

130
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,610
- Repeat after me. Invincible. 
 - Invincible!

131
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,630
- Alert! 
 - Alert.

132
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,750
- I'll never 
 - I'll never

133
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,540
- make the mistake of 
 - make the mistake of

134
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,370
- losing Yook Dong Sik 
 - losing Yook Dong Sik

135
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,700
- ever again! 
 - ever again!

136
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,770
- Never! 
 - Never!

137
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,610
- I'm Jeong Won.
 - I'm Jeong Won.

138
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,150
- I'm Jeong Won.
 - I'm Jeong Won!

139
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,030
You should keep a watch out there!

140
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,070
 Boring Day

141
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,360
I was so nervous I'd get caught.

142
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,170
Now, we can just head over there, right?

143
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,050
Yes. Since it's where everything began.

144
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:19,260
The construction site where I attempted to kill myself and witnessed that guy trying to kill the homeless man.

145
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,870
If we go there and reconstruct the situation back then, I'm sure I'll remember something.

146
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,290
The building already went up. It's been completed.

147
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,530
When did they finish building it?

148
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,540
I know! What do we do?

149
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,780
If my memory flashes back one more time, I'm sure I'd remember his face.

150
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,450
Then if we look for another location or people that can jog your past memory—

151
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,560
Seriously, we don't have that much time. We need to get it done in one go.

152
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,260
You could say this is my specialty.

153
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,450
Now, let's see. You said that when you got hit by the car,

154
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,510
you hit your head,

155
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,440
and your memory flew away, right?

156
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,210
Then you should just recreate the situation and... Whack!

157
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,370
"Huh? Huh?" Wouldn't you then

158
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,420
remember something in a flash while saying that?

159
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,500
What kind of solution is that?

160
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,690
Dong Sik, it's not a good idea.

161
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,180
No, right?

162
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,130
It's do or die anyway!

163
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,670
You have to catch that predator quickly and have him arrested!

164
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,250
Hyungnim! Let's get it!

165
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,180
What now?

166
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,250
Now, here.

167
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,820
Just watch me and follow.

168
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,100
Now, the car comes. It's here! It's here!

169
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,900
You don't need to be afraid. The car—

170
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,090
This is really not the way. You know that, right?

171
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,980
Oh, of course I do.

172
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,430
When it hits, you should just fly through the air a bit

173
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,440
and like this...

174
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,910
Hurry up and stop him!

175
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,320
Hyungnim! It's easy! Come on, let's get it!

176
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,330
It's crushed.

177
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,290
I'm sorry...

178
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,920
 Yook Republic

179
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,660
As expected, the police are keeping a watch.

180
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,670
By chance, if involving your family doesn't sit well with you—

181
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,910
If I think about what trouble I must have put them through all this time, I feel bad, so—

182
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,050
You left such an easy way

183
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,650
and you insist on taking the unpaved road. Seriously...

184
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:30,100
Still,  my family are the ones who know me best before I lost my memory.

185
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,540
I'm sure they'll be of some help in getting my memory back.

186
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,780
Also ...

187
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,890
I missed them, too.

188
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,610
Chil Seong, is there a place where Dong Sik can meet with his family in secret?

189
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,660
Let's see now...

190
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,120
Let's get it.

191
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,790
- Where? 
 - You know.

192
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,100
Please be comfortable. And sit comfortably, too, huh?

193
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,230
What kind of tea would you like?

194
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,520
Tea?

195
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,060
Oh, it's okay. It's fine.

196
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,310
I thought Sergeant Sim was no-nonsense. How come she called us to a place like this?

197
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,160
Dong Sik!

198
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,290
- Dong Sik! 
 - Noona!

199
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,470
Have you been... well?

200
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,260
Dong Sik!

201
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,260
Oh, Dong Sik...

202
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,710
Sorry. Sorry.

203
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,090
Sorry.

204
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,420
Go! Go!

205
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,030
Get out!

206
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,330
Get out!

207
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,030
- So... before your memory loss, you came upon the diary? 
 - Yes.

208
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,540
Did you see the culprit's face at the construction site?

209
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,260
Probably.

210
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,100
Well, sorry for butting in while you're talking,

211
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,470
but logically, what you physically lost, a physical shock

212
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,640
will bring it back is my personal opinion.

213
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,430
Don't worry about him.

214
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, right!

215
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,410
So as I requested,

216
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,550
is there anything that could bring his memory back?

217
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,790
So I did bring something with me,

218
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,850
but it's been a while since Dong Sik left to go live alone.

219
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,510
So I'm not sure he'll remember. These...

220
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,900
Take a look.

221
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,800
But at that time, why did you go to the construction site in the middle of the night?

222
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,670
- Pardon? 
 - That's right.

223
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,780
I thought you went straight home after the birthday party.

224
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,870
Oh, you went somewhere really odd!

225
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,780
That day, he was with you, you said, Dad.

226
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,300
 Give it back to me!

227
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,050
 What are you so sorry about all the time?

228
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:51,800
 Because you act like a nice person all the time, you get taken advantage of!

229
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
 What a pitiful punk.

230
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,110
You... you... No way, you tried to...

231
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,310
So what happened is...

232
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,010
I, I can't really remember well...

233
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,610
Were you having bad thoughts?

234
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,480
No, right?

235
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,830
Oh, n-not at all.

236
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,750
No. No.

237
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,460
That day, something bad happened at work,

238
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,740
so he probably went to get some air. Right?

239
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,840
Yes.

240
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,720
Oh, you could remember something if you look at this album.

241
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,910
Yes.

242
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,340
Look carefully.

243
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,890
It was all because of me.

244
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,750
All this trouble was because of me, a lacking father.

245
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,290
No, Father.

246
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,950
It's a new item.

247
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,810
Do you remember something now that you're looking through it?

248
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,930
This person is...

249
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,510
What happened because of me, I have to make right.

250
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,170
I'm sorry, Dong Sik.

251
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,770
Father...

252
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,470
 This parasite-like thing, how dare you?

253
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,880
 Please save me!

254
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,730
 Please save me!

255
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,510
 To be honest, I have a secret hobby.

256
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,740
 Whenever I see weak people, it makes me feel sick,

257
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,720
 so I want to get rid of them completely.

258
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,040
 Are you totally blank and unable to remember a thing?

259
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,430
 Is there any chance of it ever coming back?

260
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,180
 About the Yuseung Biomedi matter, you nearly took the fall for the whole thing.

261
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,780
 If something like that happens, it must make you feel helpless.

262
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,470
 I think I have the right to know at least that much while lending you 100 million.

263
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,950
 Will it get resolved by handing over money?

264
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,530
 You have to make sure the person can't threaten you again.

265
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,960
 Whatever it takes.

266
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,560
 I won't leave you alone... Seo In Woo.

267
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,670
Dong Sik?

268
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:49,200
 My... memory came back.

269
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,540
 Yook Republic

270
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,930
- Oh, hello. 
 - You came!

271
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,270
- Hello. 
 - Have you eaten?

272
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,600
If you haven't, we'll prepare you something quickly. What are you doing, Honey?

273
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,330
- Oh, yes, yes. 
 - No, it's okay.

274
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,870
I was on my way to work, and I stopped by to see how you were doing.

275
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,510
By chance, have you heard anything about Dong Sik?

276
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:55,020
We want to know, too, but it seems like knowing nothing might be better.

277
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,320
I don't know.

278
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,840
By chance, did Dong Sik...

279
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,910
Bo Gyeong.

280
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,340
I-In Woo.

281
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,330
I came because I was worried. What's going on?

282
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,270
Well, that is...

283
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,390
What is it? Did something happen to our Dong Sik?

284
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,420
Dong Sik left a letter.

285
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,930
Huh?

286
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,640
 My memory came back.

287
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,470
 But I just can't remember the guy's face.

288
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,280
 I must have not seen it.

289
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,940
 Now the only thing left of my memory is my years as a pushover...

290
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,300
 I only remember what a lacking person I was.

291
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,690
 How could someone like me go up against a predator?

292
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,220
 Please don't worry about what happens to me anymore.

293
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:15,210
 I'm just a fool who's weak, and on top of that, a very unlucky

294
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,160
 pushover, that's all.

295
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,320
 Yook Republic

296
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,030
Don't worry too much.

297
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,750
He might ask me for help like the last time.  If he does, I'll make sure to let you know.

298
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,730
I guess that could happen, too... Please call and let me know.

299
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,200
By chance, if he contacts you, let me know, too.

300
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,960
I understand you been hiding things from me until now, but it's because I really want to hear it.

301
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,020
Since Dong Sik is a precious person to me, too.

302
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,780
Yes.

303
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,540
Just now he left smirking.

304
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,740
But why do you want me to keep an eye on that guy?

305
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,580
It's a letter Dong Sik left behind.

306
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,540
Where is he?

307
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,690
Hyungnim!

308
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,880
Our Hyungnim isn't the type to run away like this.

309
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,600
That's right. Dong Sik wouldn't do that.

310
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,160
 Were you looking for me?

311
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,680
Actually, this letter is a fake.

312
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,280
Dong Sik found out

313
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,460
who the real culprit is.

314
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,060
Then... No way...

315
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,550
I'll go ruin that bastard immediately!

316
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,870
Finding evidence is first.

317
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:05,200
We put him at ease, so soon Dong Sik will make his move.

318
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,520
It turned out so much more boring than I thought it would be.

319
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:36,240
That's right, Yook Dong Sik. Like your usual self,

320
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,220
it wouldn't be all that bad to meet your fate while running away frightened.

321
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,390
Hello?

322
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,130
 By chance, is this Dong Sik?

323
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,750
Yes, Director.

324
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,950
I saw the letter through Bo Gyeong.

325
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,840
Oh, I can't imagine what you've been going through.

326
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,700
 That is... you’re the only one I can ask for help

327
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,570
 so I called you.

328
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,110
 Director S-Seo?

329
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,840
Yes, Dong Sik. Where are you right now?

330
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,180
I'll go to you.

331
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:51,270
Can I see you alone at that same bar?

332
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,340
I'm sorry, Dad.

333
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,490
I said I would capture the real culprit,

334
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,360
and it took me too long.

335
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:27,310
I took a long way around, but I'll make sure to catch him with Dong Sik.

336
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,980
Sleep some more, Dad.

337
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,380
I'll be back.

338
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,040
He just went in. Are you going to go in?

339
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,530
No. I have to make him wait

340
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,000
so that he can't bear to wait any longer.

341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,250
But what if he tries to kill you?

342
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,380
He won't.

343
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,790
As long as he believes Dong Sik doesn't know his true identity, there's no need to cause a huge issue.

344
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,180
What if he calls the police?

345
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,470
- I'll get the call right away, and—
 - He won't be right away.

346
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,670
He'll want to have his fun at my expense a little longer.

347
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,650
Even if I was delusional, I lived as a predator for a while.

348
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,850
Yes, of course. The one who knows how his mind works the best,

349
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,140
of course, you must be the only one.

350
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,840
I'll make sure to find the evidence no matter what,

351
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,430
so let's make sure Seo In Woo gets his punishment ourselves.

352
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,210
Fighting!

353
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,030
Why isn't he coming?

354
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sorry f-for being late.

355
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,350
Oh. I was worried something happened to you.

356
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:56,180
I wondered perhaps you might have re-reported me, so...

357
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,270
Dong Sik, do I look like that kind of a person?

358
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,900
I waited while having the restaurant emptied out.

359
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,550
Director Seo...

360
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,950
Sit down, first.

361
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,610
Since I haven't seen you in a while, I'll get you a nice drink.

362
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,370
- You want to borrow money so you can run away? 
 - Yes.

363
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,030
How much? Will 100 million do like the last time?

364
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,740
N-No. Not that much.

365
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,110
J-Just as much as you can.

366
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,930
But are you really going to run away like this?

367
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,700
You should find the real culprit and fight. And you should clear your name, too.

368
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,300
Could I... do that?

369
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,080
I'm just a pushover and a wuss.

370
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,070
How could I possibly

371
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,700
go up against a real psychopath murderer?

372
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,100
Also, even if I cleared my name,

373
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,720
the only place I can go back to when I have lost any sense of self,

374
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,190
for a pushover like me,

375
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,900
is probably a sewer-like reality which only makes me want to kill myself

376
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,140
because I’m not able to handle it.

377
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,540
Th-That's enough now. I understand.

378
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,710
But...

379
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,070
will you help me?

380
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,060
Well, yeah...

381
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,930
Thank you.

382
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,970
Director!

383
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,470
To me,

384
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,810
you're the only one I have left!

385
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,580
Right.

386
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,140
Will you have the last drink with me?

387
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,940
Yes, well...

388
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,710
just wait a bit.

389
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,090
I'll go ask to ready some cash.

390
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes.

391
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,460
What a pathetic bastard.

392
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,140
I thought I was going to die trying to keep from killing him.

393
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,350
 112

394
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,220
Yes, I would like to make a report.

395
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,500
That predator murderer, Yook Dong Sik, is right now...

396
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,530
What's the matter with me?

397
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:32,310
Yook Dong Sik, how dare you?

398
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,390
Why?

399
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,240
Are you angry that you got fooled by the pushover of all pushovers?

400
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,860
It was fun toying with me all this time, wasn't it?

401
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,070
I'll make it even more fun for you.

402
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,080
You can set your hopes high.

403
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,140
 Grand Open

404
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,170
- Be safe with your guns. 
 - Yes, sir.

405
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,080
Yook Dong Sik is going after whom now?

406
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,920
Why are you here when you're on leave?

407
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,110
That's not what's important right now!

408
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,810
A report just came in, but the person who reported is—

409
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:13,370
It's Seo In Woo!

410
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,760
He got disconnected, and we can't get him on the phone.

411
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,270
Wh-What's the location?

412
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,900
It looks like from tracking his cell phone, he's on his way home.

413
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,480
What? Oh, okay. I got it.

414
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,350
Yook Dong Sik was caught on a security camera kidnapping the victim with a car.

415
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,850
Huh?

416
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,500
First, we should go to his house, right?

417
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,650
Let's all equip ourselves and go.

418
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,470
Yes!

419
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,580
Is it this car?

420
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,500
Yes! It's Seo In Woo's car.

421
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,330
You checked the CCTV?

422
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,610
Well, that is, it's all off.

423
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,540
Could that guy have made his move already?

424
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,610
What do we do? I'm certain this is an emergency situation.

425
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:31,300
What do you mean what should we do? Yook Dong Sik could be killing Seo In Woo right now!

426
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,690
Let's go inspect his house. At times like this, we can go into the house without a warrant.

427
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,560
- Without a warrant? 
 - Yes.

428
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,650
Chief, promotion, promotion.

429
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,060
- Promotion? 
 - Yes!

430
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,630
By now, they should have started to investigate.

431
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,870
I thought my heart was going to burst.

432
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,210
Oh, why are you acting weak all of a sudden?

433
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,050
But the plan was amazing.

434
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:58,860
Now it's just a matter of time before Sergeant Sim finds evidence that he's the real predator.

435
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,110
I hope that's the case.

436
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,270
It'll end up that way.

437
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,740
I don't think they're here.

438
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,690
The car is obviously here, so something must have been done here.

439
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,950
- Yes. 
 - There could be evidence, so let's search thoroughly.

440
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,220
Evidence. Evidence!

441
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,800
Thoroughly?

442
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,000
Damn.

443
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,180
Ah, why aren't they calling?

444
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,670
In a little bit, that real culprit will wake up!

445
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,270
Should I just go and take care of him for hurting my Hyungnim!

446
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,210
Chil Seong.

447
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,560
In my heart, I did that same exact thing a hundred to a thousand times.

448
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,390
- Let's just wait a little more. 
 - Yes.

449
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,140
Hey, hey.

450
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,130
Look thoroughly.

451
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,990
 Escape Cafe

452
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,680
I think they failed to find any evidence.

453
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,110
Go out and get the car ready.

454
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,590
I'll be right there.

455
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,500
Hyungnim...

456
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,240
You killed people and...

457
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,660
you made Bo Gyeon's father like that...

458
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,030
and you put me in this situation?!

459
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,320
I just...

460
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,270
can't forgive you!

461
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,890
I have to... myself...

462
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,650
Hey!

463
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,500
 Let's leave for now.

464
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,060
Officer Cha, look around the house.

465
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,590
And Officer Heo, call for back up.

466
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,840
Let's leave for now.

467
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,530
It seems like you tried to set a trap of some kind,

468
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,880
but I guess it didn't go the way you planned.

469
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,820
I'm going to kill you!

470
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,030
We played enough now.

471
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,070
 Come... Seo In Woo.

472
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,540
 This will be your last murderous act.

473
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,100
 If there's no evidence, that we can have him create it  himself...

474
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,660
What are you talking about?

475
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,080
He'll make Seo In Woo kill him,

476
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,050
and he's going to film it so he can leave it as evidence.

477
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,250
Our Hyungnim!

478
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,180
 He's going to make himself into bait!

479
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,310
B-By killing me,

480
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,910
what are you going to do?

481
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,260
I'll tell the police that I was trying to defend myself

482
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,750
while the predator was trying to kill me.

483
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:39,710
To disguise it as a suicide as I always do,

484
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,470
I want to stab you too much right now.

485
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:19,350
Will you be able to pierce through the bodysuit with a dull knife that only looks like the real thing?

486
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,080
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

487
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,220
That car...

488
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,870
Hyungnim!

489
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,160
Ah, what's that now?

490
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,340
  - Hey, you crazy bastard! 
 - Sorry, hurry up and go.

491
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,380
 - Drive properly! 
 - Okay, good bye.

492
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,920
It's been a while, Yook Dong Sik.

493
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,120
Oh? You...

494
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,270
Oh, don't be surprised.

495
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,080
I came to get you, and the timing was perfect.

496
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,780
 Chil Seong

497
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,070
 Sergeant Sim, something bad happened again!

498
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,890
Someone took Hyungnim away in a car.

499
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,400
He was captured by Seo In Woo?

500
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,350
No, this time, it was someone else. I was going to follow right away,

501
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,640
but I lost them.

502
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,400
What was the license plate number?

503
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,570
Just thinking about how I suffered for no reason thanks to you,

504
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,680
I want to unburden myself completely,

505
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,250
but I'm holding it in because there's someone who wants to meet you.

506
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,630
Who is that?

507
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,240
Where are we going right now?

508
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,610
Don't worry. I'm trying to help you right now.

509
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,000
What?

510
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,440
- Seo Ji Hoon has returned to Korea? 
 - Yes.

511
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,520
He came back on the President's orders yesterday.

512
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,550
Are you certain?

513
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,510
Why are you telling me that now?

514
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,770
He did it secretly.

515
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:12,330
Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.

516
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,480
Don't stand there like that and sit.

517
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,410
Yes.

518
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:32,410
I'm sure you heard roughly from Director Seo, so I'll make this short.

519
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:38,690
I know what an unfair situation you were put in.

520
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:46,680
That means you know about Director Seo In Woo's identity...

521
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,690
Thank you for coming out. I'm Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong.

522
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,500
What was the urgent matter you needed to see me about?

523
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,020
It's about Mr. Yook Dong Sik.

524
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,830
That person hasn't been caught yet, right?

525
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:10,530
But what does that have to do with me?

526
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,470
Someone took him,

527
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:16,390
and when we checked the plates, it was Director Seo Ji Hoon's car.

528
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,950
Where is he right now? Director Seo seems to be out of the house, too.

529
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,750
You wanted to see me over that?

530
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,440
You should ask the company about things like this.

531
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,430
I heard from Chief Park that you were told to keep an eye on Yook Dong Sik.

532
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,520
It was part of my job at the audit team.

533
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,060
I didn't know Section Chief Yook Dong Sik was a murderer, but...

534
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,510
Well, he acted suspiciously enough at the office, too, and—

535
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,430
The murderer is someone else.

536
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:45,610
The one who killed the last victim, Park Moon Seok, was that guy, too.

537
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,470
You know something, don't you?

538
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:57,460
I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything I can help you with.

539
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,760
I'll catch the real culprit, so you don't need to help me.

540
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,860
Just tell me where Seo Ji Hoon is.

541
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:37,470
You know that your son, Seo In Woo, is the predator?

542
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,850
President, then it's not too late now to tell the police and...

543
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,490
I'm sorry.

544
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:51,680
I guess you misunderstood my intention to help.

545
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,990
I'll help you leave the country, Assistant ManagerYook.

546
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:01,330
So you can change your identity and start a new life.

547
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,530
N-New life?

548
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:07,040
If you want to play, play. Live however you wish.

549
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,010
There will be no shortage of financial support.

550
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:17,330
But, other than me, you must cut off all your relationships.

551
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,870
Given your situation, is this something you need to think about?

552
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:34,510
If you take this with you, you'll be able to live the kind of life you've only dreamed about.

553
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,730
If you reject it, while being chased like now,

554
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:41,250
you'll go back to prison and rot for the rest of your life.

555
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,560
Choose.

556
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,690
You're the one who should be making your choice.

557
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:17,070
- What? 
 - Let it be known that your son is a murderer, and stop him.

558
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:25,090
If not, while leaving him to keep on killing people, you can choose to end up suffering by his hands.

559
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:31,050
Just because you keep me under control, you think he will stop?

560
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,020
I know him well.

561
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,940
He will never be able to

562
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,370
stop killing others of his own volition.

563
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,360
President, the guards have all been...

564
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,750
What happened? No way, Seo In Woo didn't...

565
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,090
Just stay put.

566
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,030
Got it?

567
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,460
I asked if you got it!

568
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,470
Why did you summon Ji Hoon back?

569
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,060
Didn't I tell you?

570
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:59,950
That I'll call for him if I think you can't handle it by yourself?

571
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:03,050
I think I told you I'll take care of it myself.

572
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,830
I already gave you enough chances.

573
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:09,490
After killing some kid eight years ago,

574
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,590
you trembled like a leaf.

575
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:14,930
I thought you matured after all this time.

576
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:20,160
I might seem lacking to you, but then and now,

577
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,470
I've taken care of things well, and I will continue to do so.

578
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:27,060
The fundamental of business is lowering the risks.

579
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,780
So?

580
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,730
How will you lower a risk like me?

581
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:43,360
I heard everything from Father. That you're that serial murderer.

582
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Why are you bringing that out? Put it down.

583
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,380
I have to be careful. You don't know what he'll do.

584
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:04,250
We have Yook Dong Sik.

585
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:08,030
If you follow my orders quietly, nothing should happen.

586
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,470
So you want to hold something over my head?

587
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,570
What can you do? You have to follow his orders obediently.

588
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:02,540
Put it down! Put it down!

589
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:05,280
Let's hand him over to the police. If not, let's just kill him!

590
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,850
You can cover it up, right?

591
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:10,560
Really? You think you can kill me?

592
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,150
This bastard showing off just because he's killed a few people...

593
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,700
Hey. Do you think I can't do what the likes of you can?

594
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:24,180
Did you load it?

595
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,470
Don't do it. Hyung, don't do it!

596
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:40,480
You even begged Yook Dong Sik to spare your life. How dare you point a gun at me?

597
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,500
In Woo...

598
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:55,060
I, I'm sorry.

599
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,870
 Evil Nightmare

600
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:00,460
What are you doing now?

601
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,110
Please let Ji Hoon live.

602
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:07,770
Then I'll give you everything you want.

603
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,920
What is it that I want?

604
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,080
Daehan Securities, subsidiaries, real estate, and slush fund, everything.

605
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:25,570
All this time, what did you tell me I had to do in order to get what I want?

606
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,910
You told me I have to be stronger than everyone else,

607
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,090
that I should be able to step on anyone.

608
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:37,190
But because of a weak bastard like him, you want to hand me over everything?

609
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,450
That's right. Have everything.

610
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:44,550
Have whatever you want, and I won't bother with anything you choose to do,

611
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:48,330
so please... just let Ji Hoon...

612
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,540
 Evil Nightmare

613
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,970
Where did you hide Yook Dong Sik?

614
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,330
 Psychopath Diary

615
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:15,890
