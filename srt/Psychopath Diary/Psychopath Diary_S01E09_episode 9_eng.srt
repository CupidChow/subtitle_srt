 Psychopath Diary

3
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,400
Mister. You must be worried since your daughter keeps trying to do dangerous things...

4
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,680
while not knowing what type of person she's going around with.

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,770
That guy, he killed six people.

6
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,220
Is it seven? Ah right.

7
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,320
It's also that guy who made you like this.

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,700
What did you say? That's not true?

9
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,020
Come on, it's true.

10
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,770
Since I will make it so.

11
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,550
Tell your daughter to be careful, because if not, she might get killed too.

12
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,010
Ah, I guess you wouldn't be able to tell her.

13
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,510
 Psychopath Diary

14
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,100
 After solving the case of Miss Song Ji Min

15
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,620
 Episode 9 
  In Gwangju, Gyeonggi privince, eight years ago,

16
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,650
  you solved a multiple murder case and this time too you played a crucial role in apprehending a predator killer.

17
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,190
 Thank you for the compliment.

18
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,290
Ooh, Uncle is coming on the news often these days.

19
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,060
 I'd like to think we were able to solve the case thanks to the use of profiling, a scientific investigation method.

20
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,620
Seeing the news, it seems the entire task force is getting a promotion, so why did you leave?

21
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,940
About her ...

22
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,190
It's just that it seemed like the work at the patrol division fit me more.

23
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,700
Excuse me!

24
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,240
Yes!

25
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,460
You're off duty today, right? If you have time, what about dinner—

26
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,260
Oh, what to do? I have a prior engagement today.

27
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Aah, you're meeting Dong Sik again. A date?

28
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,630
Oh no, that's not it.

29
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,740
It's not a date?

30
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,750
Then what is it? Are you two investigating in secret or something?

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,410
Just earlier you were telling me that the patrol division was what fit you best?

32
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,070
But, why are you so curious about what I do with Dong Sik?

33
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,180
Ah, I don't know if you have a good instinct when it comes to investigation,

34
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,870
but regarding this, it's a complete fail.

35
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,870
Sorry?

36
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,300
I want to see you in a serious manner, Bo Gyeong.

37
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,740
Seeing you take care of your father,

38
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,780
I discovered myself wanting to help in some way, and it surprised me.

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,040
In reality, I'm an extremely selfish and cold person, you see.

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,230
You, In Woo? Not at all.

41
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,420
That's right. So I kept on thinking about it.

42
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,310
What could be the reason?

43
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,960
That reason is ...

44
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,740
No matter what, it looks like it's because I like you.

45
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,980
Oh, uh, that is ...

46
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,650
I, uh. Because of the cases these days, my head is in shambles.

47
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,150
Cases? There must be a lot of cases at the patrol division these days.

48
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,960
No, that's not it—

49
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,600
I'll give you some time, so take your time to think about it.

50
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,290
Ah yes, I'll do this.

51
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,900
I have to get rid of this while the police haven't figured it out yet.

52
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,310
Corporal Sim?

53
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,300
Yes? Ah.

54
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,820
So at that moment, Dad appeared.

55
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,900
And the guy, not having erased the traces, hides.

56
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,600
Hides.

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,980
Dad, confirming that this must indeed be a crime scene, started to write in his notepad.

58
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,250
"Looking at the blood stains on the floor,

59
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,450
the culprit must have killed the victim here.

60
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,780
"It doesn't seem like a guy used to killing,

61
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,690
he could have watched the dying process.

62
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,820
"And the blood stain on the bed sheet

63
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,630
looks like the victim's left thumb.

64
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,560
"The fingerprint stain is too clear to have been smeared accidentally.

65
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,210
"It could be the result of the desire to collect."

66
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,750
But, you didn't tell anyone that we are digging into this case, right?

67
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,620
Yes, well, I haven't had the time to do it.

68
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,230
It's because it is a bit sensitive since Inspector Ryoo is involved as well.

69
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,620
Anyway ... Where was I again?

70
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:51,650
The legendary detective Sim had discovered the fingerprint on the bedsheet.

71
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,700
At that time, the fight occurred.

72
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,190
A fight, a fight.

73
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,390
With that, the guy runs away.

74
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,060
And Dad goes after him.

75
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,520
The notepad gets left here.

76
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,650
And in the end, the guy makes Dad like this.

77
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,830
But, isn't it difficult to conclude?

78
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,220
Your father getting injured could also have been just an accident.

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,100
No. When I found Dad injured, it had only been two hours since he talked with me on the phone.

80
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,710
At that time I looked around, but it was already after all traces of murder had been erased.

81
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,430
The guy made Dad like that and cleaned the crime scene afterward.

82
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,070
The predator... It's that guy for sure.

83
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,820
A very cruel guy, second to none in being cunning, who is hiding his dirty desire.

84
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,100
Even now, he must be living among people deceiving them by pretending to be ordinary

85
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,530
without even a bristle of a guilty conscience.

86
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,240
To be honest, I'm not sure yet.

87
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,480
 Even if blood fingerprints were found, it was eight years ago,

88
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,970
 and if it were the same killer,  it was not disguised as a suicide.

89
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,350
 Wouldn't that be because it's his first murder?

90
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,080
 If at the time he did it because he couldn't repress his urge,

91
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,110
 now he must be preparing meticulously after deciding on the pattern.

92
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,850
 In a while I'll go to the field and look through the cases again.

93
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,900
 Would you like to look together?

94
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,720
Say you'll go. You have to know as well,

95
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,930
if it really is something you did.

96
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,170
Dong Sik?

97
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,990
Ah, yes. We have to confirm, of course,

98
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,740
if it really is the same guy or not.

99
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,010
 I don't have any memories, but people always leave traces.

100
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,890
 There could still be some clue.

101
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,790
 Eight years ago. 2011.

102
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,380
 2011.

103
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,880
 2011. 2011.

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,900
 I gathered coupons with my tenacious spirit and received a diary.

105
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,230
 With that spirit, I should spend this year meaningfully.

106
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,640
 Now, I will write a diary every day.

107
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,360
 Career, employment. If I write here the worries that make me struggle,

108
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,340
  an answer should come up, right?

109
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,310
What's? There's no answer.

110
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,200
 (A talisman)

111
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,450
 What the heck was I doing?

112
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,900
 On the assumption that Corporal Sim is right, if I synthesize, eight years ago,

113
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,690
 due to severe stress over career and employment,

114
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,260
 I left the house and committed my first murder.

115
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,460
 Then I lay dormant for some time.

116
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,200
 Last year in August, I started to murder again.

117
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,000
 Is that really right?

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,650
Ah really!

119
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,640
You know, I have a question to ask you.

120
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,370
Last year, around August, did something happen to me?

121
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,130
August of last year?

122
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,570
Whether it's due to work or whatever else, something I might have gotten really stressed over.

123
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,420
A year ago?

124
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,680
Something that you would have gotten very stressed out over...

125
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,840
There was something.

126
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,180
- What was it? 
 - I... 
 - Yeah?

127
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,400
became the assistant manager. You were really in shock.

128
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,430
Oh. Manager?

129
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,340
Well, it was an expected outcome.

130
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,110
I was more shocked that you were shocked.

131
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,100
Well, I understand it though. You thought of me as a rival.

132
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,290
At that time, I never even once thought that way.

133
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,490
Seriously.

134
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,320
Oh, our Dong Sik, you've matured a lot since then. You even became a manager.

135
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,450
Now you're a true rival now, huh?

136
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,070
Work hard. It's not enough to just work hard, though.

137
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,000
- If you want to be loved by your superiors— 
 - Yes, Director.

138
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,130
Dinner at our family's restaurant?

139
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,860
Well, no... Yes.

140
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,360
To tell you about our restaurant,

141
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,330
I go to the market every morning to get the best ingredients,

142
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,070
the best meat, with these great eyes, personally—

143
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,990
Um, Father...

144
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,910
Oh, I got it. I got it.

145
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,930
Look at the marbling.

146
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,450
Oh, our director is very handsome.

147
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,420
Oh, if you need anything, just tell us.

148
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,780
- Yes. 
 - We got it!

149
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,360
Have some sense.

150
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,880
Looking so happy with your family, I'm jealous.

151
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,820
Oh. Do I?

152
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,940
But, what did you want to see me about?

153
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,840
Oh. I heard you're suffering from memory loss.

154
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,240
The meat is burning.

155
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,500
That is... So...

156
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh, it's good.

157
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,570
It's not that I was trying to hide it on purpose.

158
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,590
Oh, I know that. Just that you can't remember the past must be

159
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,560
frustrating I thought.

160
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,200
Can you not remember anything at all from before?

161
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,340
- No. 
 - And the hospital is telling you there's no possibility of it coming back at all?

162
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,040
They said it's 50/50.

163
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,740
Fifty/fifty?

164
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,630
But seeing how there's no change still...

165
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,730
I thought I saw you once writing a diary.

166
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,120
At least you have that,

167
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,390
so it must be some help trying to recall your past.

168
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,950
R-Right. Yes.

169
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,500
But I didn't write down everything in the diary, so...

170
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,890
True. About the Yuseong Biomedi deal, too,

171
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,480
you nearly got blamed for everything when you weren't at fault.

172
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,110
If that kind of thing happens, you must feel at a loss.

173
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,690
Yes.

174
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,500
Right.

175
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,240
Our Dong Sik has finally become successful!

176
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm so proud of you, my son.

177
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,310
You brought the director with you!

178
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,530
I know! You two seem totally close!

179
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,250
Well, it's just...

180
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,660
Never mind that. But eight years ago, when I left home for a month,

181
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,190
seriously, no one knows what I was up to?

182
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,680
Why do you keep asking about that?

183
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,070
You're the one who left home, so how should we know?

184
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,770
Has something happened? You asked about it once before.

185
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,000
No, nothing.

186
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,750
Noona, you don't know anything?

187
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,630
Huh? Oh, well, I can't really seem to remember.

188
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,520
 - Excuse me! 
 - Yes, I'm coming!

189
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,350
- What?
 - You know something, don't you?

190
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,630
You don't even have the tiniest guess?

191
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,110
That is, you probably went there, Gwangju.

192
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,260
G-G-Gwangju?

193
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,390
Jeollado, Gwangju?

194
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,320
No, Gyeonggi-do.

195
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,510
Did I tell you what I was up to?

196
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,190
I know even if you don't tell me. Our mom is there.

197
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,070
Mom?

198
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,200
She's in Gwangju. Our biological mom's cinerarium.

199
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,290
Cinerarium?

200
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,660
 Cinerearium:  Where a dead person's ashes are stored. )

201
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,550
 That's right. Maybe the reason I left home eight years ago and went to Gwangju might have been

202
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,860
 not to kill someone, but to see Mom who died.

203
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,550
According to the case files, this is where Son Ji Min's body was found.

204
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,100
Mr. Oh who was arrested as the culprit is the one who reported that he found a body here.

205
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,900
At that time, there was no other suspect, so it was concluded that he was the culprit,

206
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,700
but if we go by our deduction, the true culprit killed her at the hospital

207
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,730
and then threw her away here.

208
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,090
But, that Mr. Oh or whomever,

209
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,520
he reported it, so why did he become the culprit?

210
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,670
Director Yoo's profiling was...

211
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,460
well, at that time, he was a sergeant,

212
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,010
but it matched Mr. Oh, and he had a record.

213
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,580
In the end,  Mr. Oh testified that he didn't know the victim,

214
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
but it became clear that it was a lie.

215
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,650
Then, he knew her?

216
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,510
It was discovered that Mr. Oh used to frequent the store

217
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,400
where the victim worked part-time.

218
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,130
Then, he could be the real culprit.

219
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,060
This, this red bean spicy beef soup is definitely a gift item.

220
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,460
That day, I left work a little late,

221
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,980
and he took something.

222
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,360
Ji Min, who was a part-timer, said it was expired so we should let it go.

223
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,560
I had a strange feeling. That's when I took it and checked.

224
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,580
I reported it because it was three minutes before it was to be discarded.

225
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,990
Oh, really!

226
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,210
So that was a theft?

227
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,500
Stealing from a convenience store is theft.

228
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,540
He should have gone to prison then but he was released with a suspended sentence or something.

229
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,350
The result was he did something horrific.

230
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,820
If he is killing for revenge, he would be after you.

231
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,850
Why would he go after the part-timer who was nice to him?

232
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,680
That is ...

233
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,040
That's how it is.

234
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,330
Incredible.  It's almost like Jean Valjean.

235
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,590
I know what you mean. He commits the murder in an isolated spot,

236
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,960
disposes of the body and erases all traces.

237
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,310
In my opinion, I don't think Mr. Oh is that meticulous.

238
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,190
Rather, he likes being identified as a perfect killer.

239
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,400
If that's so, that's might be why he was caught.  It was what he intended.

240
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,100
The killing was at a closed hospital and the body was moved to a vacant lot in the vicinity of Mr. Oh.

241
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,880
I don't think we can rule out that possibility.

242
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,990
Maybe he saw Miss Son and Mr. Oh at the convenience store together.

243
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,460
You are saying that Mr. Oh  might have seen him too?

244
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,660
Although he could have told the police he saw something suspicious,

245
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,990
they wouldn't have listened anyway.

246
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,110
Shall we go see him?

247
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,840
What?  Whom?

248
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,470
Mr. Oh.

249
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,640
Isn't he in jail?

250
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,000
Right.  If we leave right now, I think we can see him.

251
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,830
Excuse me, but I can't go that far.

252
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,940
While I'm here, I need to stop somewhere.

253
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,760
Where?

254
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,110
It happens that my mother's cinerarium  is in the vicinity.

255
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,920
It's the first time after the accident.

256
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,440
Then you should go. I would drop you off but visiting hours—

257
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,950
No. No.  I understand so hurry and go.

258
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,460
I'm sorry.

259
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,360
 Haeyeon Memorial Park

260
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,500
 Rest in Peace Bae Hye Sook

261
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,050
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

262
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,100
-  Are you the caretaker here? 
 - Yes, I am.

263
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,010
 Haeyeon Memorial Park

264
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,100
Haeyeon Memorial Park - 107,  Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province
49-23 Gangji-ri, Hoedeok-myeon

265
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,160
 What if Mr. Oh tells Officer Sim something?

266
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,560
 It's an eight year-old incident. Even if he saw me,

267
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,620
 it would be hard to remember.  And maybe he didn't see me.

268
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,180
We still don't know whether the reason I came to Gwangju eight years ago

269
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,470
was to commit murder or not.

270
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,360
 As it says in the diary, this is my real mother.

271
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,470
 So I am like the third wheel.

272
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,890
My dear mother.

273
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,830
It is the year 2011. It has already been ten years since Mom left to go to heaven.

274
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,570
 To my loving mom. It is the year 2011.

275
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,990
  It has already been ten years since you left to go to heaven.

276
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,310
 But this time, I came alone.

277
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,440
 It seems that Dad forgot your death date.

278
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
 I understand that he's busy because the restaurant is doing well,

279
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,760
 but Noona isn't saying anything even if she knows.

280
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,640
 I just left because I thought I would cry uselessly.

281
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,760
 I have a lot of worries these days.

282
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,240
 I'm not sure how to live properly.

283
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,000
 Dad keeps nagging that I have your personality.

284
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,150
 But I still remember what you told me before you left.

285
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,050
"Being nice is not bad."

286
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,930
 Bae Hae Sook

287
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,370
 You're proud of me, right?

288
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,700
 You don't need to worry too much. I'll be back.

289
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,370
 From your son who always misses you, Dong Sik.

290
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,210
I'm sorry.  I

291
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,800
have absolutely no memory.

292
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,420
Is she your mother?

293
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,930
Excuse me? Ah, yes. She is.

294
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,390
I really wanted to meet you, actually.

295
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,130
Me? You know me?

296
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,840
That's not it. How could you not come once?

297
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,490
You shouldn't be like that to the mother who gave birth to you and raised you!

298
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,400
 ₩1,000,000

299
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,260
Sim Bo Gyeong?

300
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,710
You requested a visit with inmate Oh Myeong Dal, correct?

301
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,190
Yes.

302
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,940
He refused the visit.

303
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,170
Excuse me?

304
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,140
Is there any other way? It's an important matter. I just need a moment.

305
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,160
Since the inmate refuses, there is nothing we can do.

306
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,970
Can I meet him personally to persuade him? If he listens to me—

307
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,780
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,470
 Visitation Room

309
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,000
Excuse me!

310
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,390
Excuse me. There is an inmate named Oh Myeong Dal, correct?

311
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,300
Please tell him this.

312
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,820
I can free him.

313
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,120
So please tell him to accept my visit request.

314
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,150
Please tell him!

315
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,850
I told them the story, so the issue shouldn't get bigger.

316
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,380
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,160
Is that all you have to say to me?

318
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,300
What is this? Why are you looking into this eight-year-old case again?

319
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,760
Why are you trying to meet Oh Myeong Dal?

320
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,110
Do you remember this? It's the case notebook that my dad used to use.

321
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,740
I found it not long ago in the place where my dad became how he is now.

322
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,590
Do you know what it says in here?

323
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,500
Eight years ago, the real Gwangju criminal—

324
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,180
So you've been looking into past cases because of this one notebook?

325
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,890
- What if they're not past cases? 
- What?

326
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,260
Oh Myeong Dal wasn't the real criminal.

327
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,380
Dad was at the hospital and found clues for Miss Son's murder.

328
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,450
And there's also the blood evidence.

329
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,640
Are you saying the person who killed Miss Son is the predator killer?

330
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,310
Yes.

331
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,550
It is as I told you.  That man is a copycat.

332
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,860
- Of course, this may sound like nonsense, but if we meet Oh Myeong Dal—

333
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,260
Stop it.  You're the same as your father.

334
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,300
Yes. I am the same.

335
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,890
Saving the police force's face is more important than catching the real culprit,

336
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,890
so no one listened to my father who told the real truth.

337
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,330
Do you know this? The truth which was ignored

338
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,700
- ultimately transformed into a monster and has returned! 
 -Sim Bo Gyeong.

339
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,640
Don't cross the line. This is your final warning.

340
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,500
You're not asking

341
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,510
to see the notebook.

342
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,660
You're either too confident in your thoughts

343
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,410
or you knew you were wrong from the very beginning.

344
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,770
Which side are you on?

345
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,110
You can't right now as it is not visitation hours.

346
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,640
I am a close friend and a police officer.

347
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,010
I'm sorry. I wish I could help you.

348
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,610
Perhaps, are you from TV?

349
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,940
Ah, yes.

350
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:36,520
It will get loud for nothing if I get official permission,

351
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,390
and the resting state of the patient is important. Can you please allow it?

352
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,620
I just need a quick moment.

353
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,770
It might be difficult to communicate because he is still on medication.

354
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,540
Ah, I see.

355
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,580
Thank you.

356
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,070
Hyung. Are you sleeping?

357
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,910
Your daughter Bo Gyeong

358
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,830
told me that there is another criminal to that case from eight years ago.

359
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,790
She said that he became a serial murderer because I put an innocent person behind bars.

360
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:41,080
What do you think? Do you agree?

361
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,330
Can you understand me?

362
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,440
Is that why you nodded your head?

363
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,140
Huh?

364
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,930
Bo Gyeong. Call her.

365
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,860
Are you positive that person is Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon?

366
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,400
Yes, he is.  That stuff about a warrant, is it because of an investigation?

367
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,140
What business do you have here?

368
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,590
Are you his head doctor?

369
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,250
Yes.

370
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,040
Is this the medication that you prescribed him?

371
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,540
Oh... Yes.

372
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,570
He did not take it and hid it. You should look after your patient better.

373
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,500
Sorry. I'll take care of it.

374
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,710
I should visit him.

375
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,790
Oh, okay.

376
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,050
Did you meet your mother?

377
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,160
Yes.

378
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,280
Did you meet Oh Myeong Dal?

379
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,600
He said he wouldn't meet me. Why wouldn't he?

380
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:22,640
If he really isn't the criminal, it's already been eight unfair years.

381
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,510
He might think, what is there left to change?

382
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,660
In the end, we have nothing.

383
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,520
 It is a relief, but my heart feels heavy.

384
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,660
  Perhaps because of me,

385
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,530
 both Bo Gyeong's father was injured and Mr. Oh went to prison.

386
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:52,360
It seems like you are more upset by this than I am.

387
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,130
It's not like that.

388
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:59,680
I will work harder. I will capture that guy,

389
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,810
so let's cheer up.

390
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,040
Okay.

391
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,110
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

392
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,500
- Louder! 
- Fighting!

393
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:25,460
Why did you do that? You knew that this would put Bo Gyeong in danger.

394
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,700
For the sake of both of you, I have to catch him soon.

395
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,670
Right?

396
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:55,400
 Yook Dong Sik. With his first murder eight years ago, he killed six, no,

397
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:02,370
 probably more. He is a dangerous psychopath.

398
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,550
The pushover is so foolish he is under the delusion that he is a psychopath.

399
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,880
 However, where did it all go wrong?

400
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,960
 The car accident? Or when I  thought about suicide?

401
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:29,580
 In any case, right now there's something wrong with me.

402
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,510
 My heart is heavy.

403
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,830
 And it's become harder.

404
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:40,030
 Why does a psychopath like me feel this way?

405
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,100
 Right now, it seems like this diary...

406
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,870
 is not mine.

407
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:04,470
That bastard's alibi from eight years ago has disappeared, because I got rid of it all.

408
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,680
Now, Yook Dong Sik killed that woman eight years ago.

409
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,530
And he probably believes he's the one who made you that way.

410
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,490
 This is probably going to be my last entry.

411
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,770
 I'm going to quit murdering.

412
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,920
 Even if someone calls me a pushover,

413
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,660
 I will live according to a predator's instincts.

414
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,430
Soon I'm going to make Yook Dong Sik write another murder entry.

415
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:05,630
In the end, he's going to become a real predator,

416
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,920
and he'll be caught instead of me.

417
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,010
So this time instead of a fingerprint, my trophy will be Sim Bo Gyeong.

418
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,990
I'm sorry. Yes.

419
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,230
But the inquiry is not about our team.

420
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,330
I'm sorry. Yes, yes.

421
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,430
Yes, yes. I apologize.

422
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,050
What are you so sorry about all of a sudden?

423
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,790
Is that so? Well, you know,

424
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,520
everyone lives this way.

425
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,760
It's true. Just look at our team leader.

426
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,400
The days of Daehan Securities' mustang are long past.

427
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,420
From below, everyone looks to our Dong Sik for performance.

428
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,500
From the top, people are saying they're reducing the number of team leaders.

429
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,270
On the outside, he can't even find other work because of the Yuseong Biomedi scandal.

430
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,080
On the inside,  his wife in America is always asking for money.

431
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,100
He can't die so he's barely hanging on. And even I—

432
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,950
Jae Ho, should I mix you some coffee?

433
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,800
I'll mix my own coffee. Speaking of me—

434
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,740
I'll mix you some.

435
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,910
- Who would like coffee? 
 - Me. - Me.

436
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,830
Okay.

437
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,410
Still, you're the team leader, so how about words of wisdom,

438
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,020
and how about you give us one cheer?

439
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,730
Do it yourself.

440
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,010
I'm just a team leader on my business card. What have I done really?

441
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,100
Team Leader, you love doing cheers. Everyone is waiting.

442
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,230
Show us one time. Let us hear it.

443
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,550
Stand up! Stand—

444
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,100
- Okay. You all worked hard during that time— 
 - Ah,  seriously.

445
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,670
You only live once. Let's die drinking!

446
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,990
Oh, you're going strong today.

447
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,590
What? Did something happen?

448
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,270
It's such a relief there's nothing wrong.

449
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,910
Sunbae, your glass is empty.

450
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,820
Sunbae, have some.

451
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,880
Thank you. I'm going to take it slow.

452
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,420
Sunbae, give us a cheer as our team's ace.

453
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,800
- What are you ... 
 - Oh, oh...

454
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,980
He's avoiding it again. He's trying to avoid it.

455
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,990
Then, should I do it?

456
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,230
In honor of Asset Management Team 3's Assistant Manager Yook.

457
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,760
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

458
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,410
Hey. Sim Seok Hyeon.

459
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,140
You bastard. Am I a joke to you?

460
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,260
Are you looking down on me right now?

461
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,550
The manager didn't even ask you to lead the toast. What kind of half-assed toast did you make, huh?

462
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:11,160
Am I laughable because I messed up and got into the wrong line?

463
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,250
N-N-No.

464
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,160
You little s***, you seem to be living well these days.

465
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,380
When you first started and no one wanted you, who took you in?

466
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,530
Who?

467
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,130
- Team Leader. 
 - It was me.

468
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,650
I ... why do you look like that?

469
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,520
Why? Do you feel wronged?

470
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,970
Are you mad? I'll make you even madder you punk!

471
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,240
Watch this, you punk!

472
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,720
Sunbaenim!

473
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,780
Hold on!

474
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,880
You son of a bitch.  You're making a living because of me.

475
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,750
Come here.

476
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,250
I raised you, you bastard!

477
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,110
- Let me go. Let go, you bastard. 
 - Yes, you raised him.

478
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,670
Let me go. That punk.

479
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,890
Hold on a little longer.

480
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,370
- I'll make sure he's punished. 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

481
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,080
Hey!

482
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,200
Let's have another drink.

483
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,850
Are you okay?

484
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,140
I ... guess it's me instead of you now.

485
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,210
Huh?

486
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,930
You know,

487
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:22,430
since you're in with Director Seo, he can't touch you so he's directing it at me.

488
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,730
Should I just go crazy like you?

489
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,890
What do I have to do to score some points?

490
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:37,070
But ... you have to have some courage for that, don't you?

491
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:43,220
Someone like me just needs to die. I want to die.

492
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,030
Even my girlfriend broke up with me.

493
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,440
You broke up? Weren't you going to get married soon?

494
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,650
I was complaining about how hard work was these days,

495
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:59,460
she said it's because I am incompetent.

496
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,390
She said it's because I'm worthless so what can she do?

497
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,800
Alright, I understand.

498
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,490
Sunbaenim, you don't know anything, how empty it is when there's nothing there,

499
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,380
because you haven't been there.

500
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,820
That's right.

501
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,580
This is all because of that nasty asshole Team Leader Gong.

502
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,950
I wish someone could come arrest him!

503
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:36,600
Sunbae, does it cost a lot to hire a hitman?

504
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,030
Well, i-it probably does.

505
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,580
So it costs a lot of money. I need to make more money. Ah, seriously.

506
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,310
Good night.  Sleep well.

507
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,380
Where would you like to go?

508
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,180
Come on, bastard. Yes, Seok Hyeon, jerk.  It's cold.

509
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,690
What?

510
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,880
- Where? 
 - No, no. Not there.

511
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,530
Seokchon-dong, Ji Dong Apartments.

512
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,080
You can take him there.

513
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,680
Yes, I understand.

514
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,580
I don't know if we should be sending him like this.

515
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,170
That's true. Do you want to go with him?

516
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm joking.

517
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,510
I'll escort him.

518
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,190
Okay, okay. Sit up front.

519
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,090
- Go. 
 - Go safely.

520
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,450
Be safe.

521
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,610
How can he be so nice?

522
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,610
But, they'll be okay, right? Those two?

523
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,220
They'll be fine. Fine.

524
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,760
Now that we've gotten rid of those headaches,

525
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,910
time for round two for the rest of us? Go, go, go.

526
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,470
- Go.  
 The boss is treating!

527
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,300
Go.

528
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,370
Don't do that!

529
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,820
Tell that bastard to come here. That punk.

530
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,200
I know the team leader very well.

531
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,610
That mean bastard is worse than shit.

532
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:43,370
I was speaking first.

533
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:48,210
How is he going to do cheers himself, that rat bastard?

534
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:51,410
Tell that bastard to come here.

535
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,770
The team leader's not picking up his phone?

536
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,640
Yes. He's not answering text messages either.

537
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,530
What do we do? It's already time for our meeting.

538
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,670
We can miss one little meeting. He'll come when he comes.

539
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,260
I wish he never comes back.

540
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,720
Last night, nothing could've happened, right?

541
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,530
- Last time— 
 - That's right.

542
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,490
Last time the team leader got drunk, he started saying Sunbae Dong Sik was trying to kill him.

543
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,140
That's right.

544
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:03,320
Yesterday, I told Sunbae I was having a hard time because of Team Leader.

545
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
I vented a little bit.

546
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,160
What did you say?

547
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,150
Ah, Dong Sik couldn't have ...

548
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,260
What about Dong Sik?

549
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,020
What's going on?

550
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,450
Well, that is, yesterday we had a work dinner.

551
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,990
I heard you had an end of the year party last night.

552
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,030
Hello.

553
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,970
Thank you.

554
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,720
Drink up.

555
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,990
Team Leader Gong still isn't here.

556
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,820
Is that so?

557
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,180
He did drink a lot yesterday.

558
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,740
I heard Team Leader Gong caused mayhem while he was drunk.

559
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,630
Well, not mayhem.

560
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,370
So not mayhem but abusing his power?

561
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,890
He was just ... a little drunk. Yes, well.

562
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,870
It wasn't anything big.

563
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,700
It didn't seem like nothing, according to Mister Seok Hyeon.

564
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,820
You even heard that?

565
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,420
With your personality, you just let that go? After seeing that happen?

566
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,760
Huh? I mean, well ...

567
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,290
I did escort him home.

568
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,060
You escorted Team Leader Gong home?

569
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,790
And then? Did you come out right away? Nothing else happened?

570
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,060
That is ... well ...

571
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,550
My stomach ...

572
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,280
I'm sorry. I need to go to the bathroom.

573
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,300
Ow, my head.

574
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,810
My head.

575
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,770
My head hurts!

576
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,390
My head.

577
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,510
All that drinking...

578
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,260
 There weren't a lot of ingredients so I didn't prepare much.

579
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,270
 Men who live alone are all like that.

580
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:57,950
 It's end of the year, so you must miss your wife and kids who are in the US a lot.

581
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,630
 Sober up and I'll see you at work.

582
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,110
Oh, Yook Dong Sik, that bastard. That little ...

583
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,340
Is he Baek Jong Won ( T.N. famous Korean chef and food writer )?

584
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,670
This bastard, why does this taste so good?

585
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,430
This bastard.

586
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,090
Why do I miss my mom so much?

587
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,910
Who is it?

588
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,730
This is Gong Chan Seok's home, correct?

589
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,050
Yes it is.

590
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,290
It's the police.

591
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,000
What?

592
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,510
Team Leader, we were so worried.

593
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,840
Tell me about it. I was so surprised when the police came.

594
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,010
Director Seo suddenly said we needed to send the police.

595
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,050
Director Seo?

596
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,840
It's because everyone was worried.

597
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,900
Is that so?

598
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,560
In any case, where did Sin Seok Hyeon, that bastard, go?

599
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,920
Is he skipping work again?!

600
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,590
I'm ...

601
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,680
right here.

602
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,400
Come over here. Come here!

603
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,730
Come closer. Closer.

604
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,560
I heard I threw a fit at you yesterday. Did I do that?

605
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,850
No. No, no.

606
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,570
I'm sorry.

607
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,650
Pardon?

608
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,500
I've been hard on you lately. I'm sorry.

609
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,580
I apologize.

610
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,030
It's okay.

611
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,980
I'm sorry.

612
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,550
Are you feeling better?

613
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,650
I'm feeling better, thanks to you.

614
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,250
It tasted good.

615
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,260
Sunbae, are you not growing a mustache lately?

616
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,190
- What? 
 - I mean, it's the end of the year,

617
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,930
so I was thinking of buying you a razor if you needed.

618
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,230
It's fine. You're so silly.

619
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,590
- It's time for shift change, so let's get back. 
 - Yes, sir!

620
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,210
Congratulations.

621
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,350
Corporal Sim, congratulations!

622
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,140
For what?

623
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,740
You've been transferred to the public relations department of the main office.

624
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,760
Your road to advancements has opened up!

625
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,740
Sunbae, you can't forget me. Once a partner, always a—

626
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,040
Is my transfer because of Inspector Ryoo?

627
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,950
Not sure. He could have recommended you.

628
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:03,090
In any case, isn't it a good thing?

629
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,270
Yook Dong Sik made hangover soup?

630
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,330
As my insides were warming up,

631
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:23,460
it seemed like my heart was getting mended and I felt such relief.

632
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,510
Why is there nothing you can't do?

633
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:30,930
Working and cooking, all of them.

634
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,620
When did you learn to cook?

635
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,260
Well, I'm not sure myself.

636
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,060
Maybe it just came naturally since I've lived alone so long.

637
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:45,020
Here's the special coffee Team Leader has bought us!

638
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Get in line.

639
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,570
Okay!

640
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,950
I got to give you some first, our Sunbae Dong Sik.

641
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,520
What is that situation?

642
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,130
It looks good to see them like that. Why?

643
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,180
No, nothing. What's going on?

644
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,860
You have a guest. They're waiting.

645
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,300
Guest? I didn't plan on meeting anyone.

646
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:28,000
He came forcefully and said if he gave his name, you'd meet him right away.

647
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,250
Who is it?

648
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,610
He says he's Park Moo Seok.

649
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,000
You have a nice office.

650
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,990
I'm sure I told you. We've never seen each other and have nothing to do with one another.

651
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,230
That's disappointing.

652
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:53,810
It's been a long time so I thought you would at least offer me tea.

653
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,270
When the homeless man you asked me to find in the beginning died,

654
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,410
I figured it was just a bad coincidence.

655
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:12,610
But to find out that the great Seo In Woo turns out to be the infamous predator murderer.

656
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,590
Do you want to die?

657
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:17,320
No way, you're going to kill me here?

658
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,450
Does anyone else know?

659
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,100
Then I wouldn't be able to collect my cut.

660
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,790
I'm not interested in being righteous. I came to do business.

661
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:31,510
I was wondering how a skilled person like you got fired from the police force.

662
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,030
It was for this reason.

663
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,150
If you help me this one time, I will retire completely.

664
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,530
Tomorrow by 4, ten big ones.

665
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,330
The location, where we always meet.

666
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:52,850
There's a plaza nearby, right? There are probably a lot of people passing by during that hour,

667
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,410
so it would be best not to think useless thoughts.

668
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:04,120
You can have this. I have the original.

669
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,500
Team Leader Jo, come right away.

670
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,360
Stocks being managed in my personal account, cash them out by tomorrow morning.

671
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,810
How much should the amount be?

672
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,830
Ten billion.

673
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,760
If it's that much, the president will also hear.

674
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,000
That's why you need to be discreet!

675
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,630
Just take care of it.

676
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,830
I understand.

677
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,580
He's here. He's here!

678
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:54,680
Hyungnim, did you get off work?

679
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,030
Yes. Were you working out?

680
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,920
Yes. I always need to keep my body in shape.

681
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,890
I don't know when I'll need to work.

682
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,090
Now I don't think there will be any need for that anymore.

683
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:08,750
Pardon?

684
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,830
Just that, like everyone else,

685
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:15,980
I think it would nice to live an ordinary life.

686
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,490
Hyungnim, what are talking about?

687
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,790
Would it be any fun to live that way?

688
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,230
I'm asking you to think about it one more time.

689
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,490
Hyungnim, when the bad guys are running this world,

690
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,580
it doesn't make sense for someone like you to

691
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,190
turn your back on the world!

692
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,560
What?

693
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:21,550
  Tomorrow, at 4 p.m. at the Reed Park Plaza near the Hangang Bridge.

694
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,770
  Come with ten Big Ones prepared.

695
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:30,960
 If you don't, the evidence that you're the predator,

696
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,900
 will be handed over to the police.

697
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,730
Hyungnim, what is this?

698
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,420
It's nothing.

699
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,580
Right. Looking at your expression ...

700
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,980
You fell for a phone scam, didn't you?

701
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,640
That's a kind of trashy thing even I don't do.

702
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,060
I want to be alone right now so please leave.

703
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,800
Could they have done that if they knew who you really were?

704
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,630
If they knew, they wouldn't do this. They'd get hurt.

705
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:20,360
Hyungnim! When bad guys are running the world like this—

706
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,580
Get some rest.

707
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,500
 Who on earth?

708
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,660
 How? What definitive evidence?

709
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,420
 Should I kill him? No.

710
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,000
 No murdering.

711
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,600
 But how do I get that kind of money by tomorrow?

712
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,120
Was it that, Hyungnim?

713
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:46,240
It's true. He really did get phone-scammed.

714
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,760
I might just call up the kids to come here and fight.

715
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,040
I'm so scared, gosh.

716
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,590
Why is he here?

717
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,540
It's 4 o'clock.

718
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,960
I'm here.

719
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,340
Hello? Hello?

720
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,820
Yook Dong Sik?

721
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:19,800
So, you are ...

722
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,520
Why are you there?

723
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,590
W-W-Was I supposed to just leave the money?

724
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,190
What?

725
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,970
What is this?

726
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,130
This is all I could get right now.

727
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,960
Can I pay in installments?

728
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,390
If you give me 20 months, I can get the one hundred million you asked for.

729
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:52,350
What? What is—

730
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,690
I know this makes no sense.

731
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,760
But I'm asking because you said you knew my identity.

732
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,090
I'm a salary man.

733
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,940
Damn it.

734
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,710
Wait, hold on.

735
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,550
Just take this for now.

736
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,850
Let go, you bastard.

737
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,960
Hyungnim!

738
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,610
Was asking for installments too much?

739
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,960
Wait, was 10 large ones not 100 million but 10 billion?

740
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,590
What happened?

741
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,700
That darn punk!

742
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,140
Why would you bother Hyungnim?

743
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,170
Why!

744
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,390
I take back what I said. That I won't be seeing you anymore.

745
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,820
I think things are going to get a lot more fun from now on, thanks to you, Woo Seok.

746
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,300
  ... please leave a message after the beep...

747
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,020
Can you tell me now?

748
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:31,740
Park Moo Seok, are you involved with him in some way?

749
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,070
Do you know him?

750
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,900
What is there to know? Former detective, he's a real slimeball.

751
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,890
I-I'm going to kill him.

752
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,160
Former detective?

753
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,110
He was fired for accepting bribes.

754
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,910
He was known for taking everything down to the last drop.

755
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,510
So much, that his nickname was 'Spin-dryer'!

756
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:57,100
Does he have something on you?

757
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,840
Why can't you speak?

758
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,140
That's great news. Right?

759
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:07,560
You're going to be able to come over and look after the shop, now that your office times are regular.

760
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,290
Will your salary go up a little too?

761
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,990
Mom, I'll be right back.

762
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:53,130
  Corporal Sim

763
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,550
Yes, Bo Gyeong. What going on?

764
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,750
I got a text message from an unfamiliar number.

765
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,520
What kind of text message?

766
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,230
They want to report the identity of the predator murderer.

767
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,480
I don't know who it is but I'm certain they know something.

768
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,220
If not, why would they have contacted me?

769
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:20,960
Hello?

770
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,340
Yes, I'm listening.

771
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,430
The signal just ... W-Was there anything else?

772
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:31,660
Not yet. He's not answering my calls.

773
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,220
I messaged him for more details but there's no response.

774
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,620
Hold on.

775
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,280
I'll give you a call in a little bit.

776
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,610
Hello? Dong Sik.

777
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:02,590
Dong Sik.

778
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:10,180
In the end ... to Bo Gyeong ...

779
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:32,650
 By chance, have you contacted the police?

780
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,720
 I'm sure I warned you.

781
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,260
 What can I do?

782
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,450
 I'm giving you 48 hours.

783
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:47,490
 If you can't get 10 billion by then,

784
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,770
 you're going to have to kill me.

785
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:05,660
 Psychopath Diary

786
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:13,980

787
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,960
 The wild beast I've hidden away deep within me,

788
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,910
 do I need to unleash it again?

789
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:26,000
 This time, I'm just going to set the table and leave.

790
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,660
 Yook Dong Sik will be the one eating.

791
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:33,980
 I think I'm going to have to kill you.

792
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:36,570
 A whistleblower? Are you sure?

793
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,780
 It's been a while, Chairman.

794
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,750
 I think I need to see you.

795
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:45,800
 I'll have to make it so that the opponent can never make a threat again. Whatever it takes.
