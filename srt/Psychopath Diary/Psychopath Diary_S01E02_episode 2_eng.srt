 Psychopath Diary

3
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,820
Hey! Hey! Dong Sik!

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,680
What is it?

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,360
  I am not a loser

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,420
  but I just pretended to be a loser

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,550
 to hide my identity.

8
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,920
 As expected... I was a psychopath.

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:12,970

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,720
Porcelain is weaker than I thought.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,510
If you're not careful, you could get cut.

12
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,580
Police, hurry!

13
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,140
Police.  Hey, call the police!

14
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,830
 Pychopath Diary

15
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,430
No, no, not that way.  Yes, right, right.

16
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,700
After you turn the corner in that direction, the bar at the corner, the bar.

17
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,200
Yes, come that way.  Okay.  Yes.

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,010
- Where are they? 
 - They are almost here. They are coming soon.

19
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Hey! You, you, you!  Don't budge an inch. You, you, you are dead meat!

20
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,060
 If that's the way I have always been, I'm sure I've handled situations like this.

21
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,160
 What should I do?

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,790
Why are you so still?

23
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,650
While shifting his eyes like before, he's getting ready to kill me,  you psychopath-like dude.

24
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,800
Why aren't they coming?

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,250
- We received a report and came. 
 - Here, here, over here.

26
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,370
We received a report of an assault and attempted murder.

27
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,560
Yes. I-It's him. He's really terrifying.

28
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,650
How terrifying?

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,060
Listen up.  I was peeing here like this.

30
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,720
- Suddenly, he entered. He came in with the door wide open. 
 - Right?

31
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
Then all of a sudden,

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,950
he locked the door tightly.

33
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,510
Then he asked if anyone was here or not and he checked each stall.

34
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,430
Then he was talking about crap and then... What was it?

35
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,180
This!  This!

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,350
This!

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
The toilet tank lid?

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,990
This is it. This. You tried to kill me with this, you son of a bitch.

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,700
Take a look.

40
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,120
To kill me with that. This is what he was trying to kill me with.

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,770
What do you think? He's a crimin—

42
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,010
He was going to hit me with it.

43
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,140
It's broken.  After he broke it, he took that piece and he was glaring at me.

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,000
He's just staring like that. Whack.  You said you were going to cut me open with this, you son of a bitch!

45
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,490
 The Usual Suspects

46
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,880
Tell the truth.  Hurry.

47
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,230
That is ... I came in here to do my business.

48
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,990
It was broken. I thought someone might get hurt.

49
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,610
I picked it up to clean up and when I brought it out,

50
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,840
suddenly the team manager saw me and started screaming so loud.

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,980
Hey, are you a psychopath? How can you tell a lie so naturally?

52
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,980
You had this, and you tried to kill me, you son of a bitch.

53
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,040
Dong Sik, sir.

54
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,320
Be honest.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,810
Yes.

56
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,050
Did the team leader break the lid of the toilet tank?

57
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,530
I think he is very drunk.  He is very agitated. He drank a lot, didn't he?

58
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,160
You asshole! Hey, you asshole, this is really ...

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,940
- Keep your voice down. 
 - This son of a bitch's eyes were glaring and he was going to hit me—

60
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,300
It looks like Dong Sik was actually the one who was assaulted.

61
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,420
No.   No, this is ...

62
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,250
He actually has evidence, so I think he can sue immediately.

63
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,630
What would you like to do?

64
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,000
In employment, if work isn't done right, you can scold the staff.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can make a mistake after drinking.  I think he just went a little overboard.

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,800
Me?

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,850
I don't want to sue him over this.

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,470
Then, an apology will settle this.

69
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,730
Or, you can go to the station with me.

70
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,580
I'm sorry, yes.

71
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,160
I had too much to drink.

72
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,560
I went too far. Dong Sik,

73
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,300
Wow.  I'm sorry.

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,540
Not at all. No. I'm fine.

75
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,420
Go home and sleep it off today.

76
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,220
I'll see you tomorrow at the office.

77
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,350
Tomorrow at the office?

78
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,630
- Jae Ho, get my briefcase. 
 - Yes.

79
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,260
Go home.

80
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,790
Taxi!  Taxi!

81
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,960
This, take this.

82
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,290
Stop. Have a safe trip.

83
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,590
Go, quickly. Make sure the door is shut.

84
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,500
Are you all right?

85
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,230
Didn't you tell the office about your amnesia?

86
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,110
I'm afraid they will say I'm deliberately faking to get a leave of absence.

87
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,080
True...

88
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,840
If something like this happens again, call me immediately. Okay?

89
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,380
Yes.

90
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,190
I  am grateful.

91
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,160
 Although there are a lot of bad guys in the world,

92
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,310
 I am the worst of them.

93
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,580
 In a word, I'm a killer.

94
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,570
Damn. Open your eyes!

95
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,370
Cute.

96
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
What are you? Hey!

97
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,390
I think he's crazy.  Let's just go.

98
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,120
Oppa, my oppa! I like you.

99
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,070
Okay, I got it.

100
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,200
Let's eat something yummy.

101
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,390
 Daehan Securities

102
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,250
Director Seo, what brings you here so late in the evening?

103
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,030
I need to look for something.

104
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,940
Yes.

105
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,320
He's alive.

106
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,340
His head, his head, his head.

107
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,080
Diary.

108
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,720
That freaking insect-like homeless bastard.

109
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,470
I need you to find someone.

110
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,420
Is this work-related?

111
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:43,260
Something like that. He's a homeless guy hanging around the construction site for our new building.

112
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,100
I believe he stole an important object so find him quickly

113
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,690
The object is?

114
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,720
 About that toilet tank lid. The last case of the homeless man.

115
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,740
 Nobody will clean up the bathroom that clean because one of the toilet tank lids was broken.

116
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,590
 But if it had been used as a weapon, if that's why he destroyed the evidence (by cleaning the scene)...

117
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,830
  That makes sense. Then, is the homeless man a perpetrator?  Or a victim?

118
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,980
 Whatever he is, it's for sure a violence case, right?

119
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,740
 Are you going to keep ignoring me?

120
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,710
 Thanks to a strange excitement and tension blanketing my body, I can't sleep.

121
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,890
 According to the diary, I am a psychopathic serial murderer.

122
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,270
 I, Yook Dong Sik, run about 5 km every morning

123
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,750
 and begins the day.

124
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,810
  It looks like I'm still suffering

125
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,410
  from the aftermath of the accident.

126
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,590
Are you okay?

127
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,460
I'm completely fine.

128
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,380
No, Lotto. No. Don't do that.

129
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,500
Oh my.  He's usually fierce tempered, though.

130
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,170
What a surprise.

131
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:37,610
 As expected, to ordinary humans, I might look exactly the same as them.

132
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,610
 But these animals recognize me by instinct.

133
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,140
 They smell it.

134
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,460
 The smell of a predator.

135
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,870
Aigoo!

136
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,420
Let's have one more drink.

137
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,150
I'm leaving then!

138
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,220
One more glass. Hey!

139
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,210
What, freaking jerk.

140
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,920
You're from apartment 608, right?

141
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,800
Why aren't you answering? Are you scared?

142
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,190
You're scared, eh.

143
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,380
Did I tell you this?

144
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,880
That I killed someone.

145
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,110
I was thinking of keeping a low profile after I got out of prison,

146
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,620
but my entire body is itchy.

147
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,200
 Silence of the Lambs

148
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,580
How did you kill them?

149
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,930
What?

150
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,150
I asked how you killed that person.

151
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,390
It's called sashimi, have you heard about it? It comes out a lot in the movie "Friend."

152
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:46,380
I took that sashimi knife, and I slit right here.

153
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,040
You can't kill people by doing that.

154
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,830
Did you just drop formalities with me?

155
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,630
Usually, our bones are protecting our vital organs.

156
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,810
The cranium for the brain, and the ribs for the lungs and heart.

157
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,120
Then in order to kill someone in one go, where do you have to aim?

158
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,840
Here.

159
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:21,150
The blood pumped by the heart and sent to the brain is gushing out through here.

160
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,360
Completely.

161
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,650
What? Completely?

162
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,750
This scum. What did you say his name was?

163
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,130
It's Yook Dong Sik.

164
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,570
Even his name is really...

165
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,500
Anyway, Yook Sashimi or whatever,

166
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,570
you couldn't get rid of one employee and make things get this out of hand?

167
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,950
Because of that, it looks like I'm going to get trampled by Seo In Woo!

168
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,370
He looked easy so I thought he was perfect for it, but it seems I was mistaken about that bastard.

169
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,750
No no, it looks like I was mistaken about you.

170
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,900
Are you going somewhere?

171
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,150
Father called me, so I'm going to the family home. Meanwhile, take good care of this issue.

172
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:41,800
If you don't, I'll fire the entire Assets Management Team 3 altogether.

173
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,780
Rather than Director Seo, I find Yook Dong Sik scarier.

174
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,490
I can't even look that jackass in the eyes without feeling weak in the knees. What am I going to do about the cross-examination?

175
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,220
Team Leader, yesterday you were indeed quite drunk,

176
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,630
and there must have been a big misunderstan—

177
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,020
 Good Morning!

178
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,400
What the heck? Which jerk is coming to work later than the team leader, huh?!

179
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,790
You! You, you! I'm talking to you!

180
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,330
When did you get here?

181
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,200
Excuse me? Me?

182
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
- I got here earlier. 
 - Earlier?

183
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,740
Earlier when? I didn't see you!

184
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,980
I even gave you my greetings.

185
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,360
Greetings? How half-assed your greeting must have been if I don't even remember it!

186
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,970
Really, I'm team leader and you guys are completely

187
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,480
looking down on me! Am I amusing? Am I easy?

188
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,450
Humans are quite something.

189
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:14,390
Even when they're weak themselves, they need to find the weaker and easier guy.

190
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,620
Thank you!

191
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,080
Take a lot of kimchi back with you.

192
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,200
I was going to ask you.

193
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,340
Did it show?

194
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,490
Yeah, it showed.

195
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,940
When he was this big, Dong Sik looked really bright.

196
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,680
Be it then or now, he's the same.

197
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,190
Soft and fair as tofu.

198
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,190
He was bright and pretty, isn't that right?

199
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:59,420
Indeed, since he resembles his deceased mother, he has a soft-hearted personality.

200
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,930
What did he say happened with work?

201
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,840
And did his head recover? Try to look after him a bit!

202
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,510
When did I not do that?

203
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,600
Dad, you should take care of him instead of telling people what to do every time.

204
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,580
- That's right. Why don't you try giving Dong Sik a call? 
 - Oh...

205
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,430
- Right now! 
 - Oh, please.

206
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,230
After reading this.

207
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,150
 The Yuseong BioMedi bomb explodes. A warning to the investors who invested without detailed check-up.

208
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,010
Father, about that...

209
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,160
How many times did I tell you to call me President?

210
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,800
I couldn't block all of the articles.

211
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,660
But our newspaper massaged the story as much as it could and then released it.

212
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,020
What "massage"? It made no difference.

213
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,460
Still, since it was branded as the market's failure and not our company's, it was alright.

214
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,390
The person who crapped all over should realize it.

215
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,100
What vulgarity, when we're at the dining table?

216
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,410
President kept saying he wanted to eat this so here it is: it's the liver of freshly killed beef.

218
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,580
It's good.

219
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,570
Try it.

220
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,110
It's delicious.

221
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,550
In Woo, this punk, he even has the same palate as me.

222
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,450
Ji Hoon, you should eat a bit, too.

223
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,210
Don't you know that I don't even touch this stuff?

224
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,590
So, how is the current issue being taken care of?

225
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,390
A minor employee made a mistake doing the work,

226
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,550
so it will get cleared up soon.

227
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,260
If you're going to cut the tail off, do it definitively so that there won't be any gossip.

228
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,740
Yes, sir.

229
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,420
How was the meal?

230
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,370
Well, it looks like the president kind of knows.

231
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,670
But he'll probably just keep watch for now.

232
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,650
And Director Seo?

233
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,560
He bluffed that it will soon be over.

234
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,610
It seems like he hasn't realized the situation when the proof that he made some secret deal is in our hands.

235
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,980
Now, we'll do the cross-examination, and according to the scenario, one by one...

236
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,730
Are you worried about something else?

237
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,370
It's nothing.

238
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,520
Anyway, you know that the president is extremely perceptive, right? Take care of it without causing a stink.

239
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,550
I understand.

240
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,690
- Don't violate the signal. 
 - I apologize.

241
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,780
Sunbae. You must be growing a beard these days.

242
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,990
Do you want me to lend you a razor?

243
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,150
It's so troublesome.

244
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,810
Do you have cash?

245
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, you shouldn't. You're talking about that Mr. Kim?

246
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,790
- The one who stayed there at the construction site? 
 - Yes.

247
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,880
Did that old man commit a crime?

248
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,560
Why are you all looking for him?

249
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,990
What? Looking for him?

250
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,540
Take this and go eat, okay?

251
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,710
Yesterday, someone was going around asking whether we had seen him.

252
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,870
Who? Why...

253
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,020
Ah, it must be a creditor.

254
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,220
If I knew it was a creditor, I wouldn't have told him.

255
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,630
What do I do? What should I do, Jae Ho? The cross-examination is soon.

256
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,540
At this rate, if I don't get beaten to death by Director Seo, that Yook Dong Sik will...

257
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,890
My son still hasn't finished his studies abroad.

258
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,170
If I'm fired, my wife will surely ask me for a divorce right away.

259
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,930
If I have to give alimony and send living expenses, what will I have to live off?

260
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,910
Jae Ho, what do I do? Huh?

261
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,760
Team Leader, actually I have something to tell you.

262
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,180
What?

263
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,490
Amnesia?

264
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,910
Yes. When I came to work on Monday, there was a suicide note on that prat's desk.

265
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,070
- A suicide note? 
 - Yes!

266
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,090
Maybe he hurt his head while attempting suicide during the weekend,

267
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,140
but he absolutely doesn't remember anything at all.

268
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,680
He thinks that I used to be his coffee errand boy.

269
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,720
No wonder. He was doing things he never did before.

270
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,050
So that's what happened...

271
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:09,640
Everything was done by the Team Leader and Assistant Manager Jae Ho Park. I'm just the victim.

272
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,300
As you heard, the statements don't match up. We need to investigate further.

273
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,360
Is that so? That's upsetting.

274
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:26,400
If you look at the time and attendance record of the day I supposedly received special treatment, Yook Dong Sik went home on time.

275
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,950
And what was I doing and where?

276
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,220
I was having a work dinner with the other team members.

277
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,450
And I also asked Yook Dong Sik to join us,

278
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,910
but he said he was meeting someone for drinks and left quickly. You remember, right?

279
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,930
This is ridiculous.

280
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,920
Excuse me? This is an audit.

281
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,760
If you make a false statement, all of your team members—

282
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,070
Speaking of, to save you the trouble,  I brought it myself.

283
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,980
If you take a look, these are handwritten statements from all the team members.

284
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,130
They wrote it themselves.

285
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,900
This is ridiculous, seriously.

286
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,470
 We are all in the same boat and share the same fate.

287
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,420
 We need to kick that jerk out of the boat

288
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,560
 in order for us to survive. Start writing.

289
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,910
Receiving a deal and writing that report, you're saying Yook Dong Sik acted alone.

290
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,840
Is this true?

291
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,070
It happens.

292
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,590
It's obvious Team Leader Gong and the team members made up the story together, so why aren't you doing anything?

293
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:09,040
 I can't even reveal the diary here. This is driving me crazy.

294
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,440
Look here. If you leave it like this, you're going to take all the responsibility.

295
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
 Here it is.

296
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:32,400
 September 12, once I complete my plan, I want to start a new hunt tomorrow.

297
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,110
 The hunting location? The construction site seems like a good place.

298
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,330
 After visiting, there isn't much security at night.

299
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,820
 And it's easy to get rid of the evidence.

300
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,120
 My alibi is certain.

301
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,840
 That night, I wasn't being bribed.

302
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,760
  I was planning a murder.

303
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,270
 This is driving me crazy.

304
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,930
 I know for a fact that Team Leader Gong received false statements.

305
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,530
Did you find him?

306
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,140
I didn't find the person but I found a house.

307
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,400
- A house? 
 - I heard it was where he lived before he became homeless.

308
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,980
It looks like he was here not too long ago. I'll look around.

309
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,000
He has a home so why did he become homeless?

310
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,320
Probably because of debt.

311
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,410
Sunbae. Sunbae, Sunbae!

312
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,970
Sunbae, Sunbae, Sunbae! Hurry! Sunbae.

313
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,300
Sunbae, hurry, hurry! Sunbae, Sunbae.

314
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,180
Look!  On those bandages, that's blood, right?

315
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,150
As expected, this smells like an important case.

316
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,000
Don't go overboard. He may have just gotten injured.

317
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,700
That's why he came home.

318
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,830
And I wanted to just to finish this up quickly.

319
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,090
If he was injured, he would probably be sleeping at home.

320
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,320
Where could he have gone?

321
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,520
Well, he could have gone to the hospital or to look for his cart.

322
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,070
Or he could have gone to eat meat.

323
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,660
Then, he probably would have taken the entire coupon.

324
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,520
Mr. Yook Republic.

325
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,830
I understand.

326
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,140
But the police also seem to be looking for that homeless man.

327
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,090
Is that so? So what?

328
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,160
Ah, it's nothing.

329
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,620
 Mr. Yook Republic

330
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,960
 So this is Mr. Yook's Republic.

331
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,860
 It's a meat restaurant. It's my father's.

332
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,460
 Yook Dong Sik. Just give them my name and you can get a free meal.

333
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,800
 Save me.

334
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:42,720
Will you have a bite of something to eat? Your luck is wasting away as you pick on your food.

335
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,340
Okay.

336
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,190
So, why did you call me?

337
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,710
You were hurt, and also because of your company. We were concerned.

338
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,040
Eat up.

339
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,730
Rather than seeing you beg, it's better to be inconspicuous.

340
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,790
Looking at you in this state, I don't even need to ask about your work.

341
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,400
You're not just going to just sit there and let them fire you, are you?

342
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,570
Don't you dare surrender to them. Just take them head on.

343
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,960
Your dad, since the day I was born,

344
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,380
I've never knelt to anyone. Do you know why?

345
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,890
As soon as they see a moment of weakness, then they think they can do as they wish.

346
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,760
That's how humans think.

347
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,620
That's how you become someone's meal, like you.

348
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,120
Who's a meal?

349
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,830
I'm actually a ...

350
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm sorry.

351
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,390
I'm leaving now.

352
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,150
There, there, there, there. He can't even finish a meal for 5 and he says he

353
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,660
Well,  ... is he going to say he is fed up?

354
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,680
Do you think he has an appetite when his company's like that?

355
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,530
Someone attacked the homeless man with the toilet lid.

356
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,920
But they cleaned the site.

357
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,090
It wasn't a simple fight. It seemed like it was carefully planned.

358
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,930
He didn't kill him.

359
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,630
Or he couldn't?

360
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,300
If that were true, why didn't he report it?

361
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,100
Well, he could have been running from loan sharks and was too afraid to go to the hospital or police.

362
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,130
And even if he reported it, he may have thought people wouldn't believe a drunken homeless man.

363
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,130
- Hey, you came because of the report I made, right? 
 - Pardon?

364
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,380
He left. But it still smells.

365
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,950
What did you report?

366
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,460
It's hard enough to run a business,

367
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,310
but then a homeless man just kept sitting over there.

368
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,670
Where did he go?

369
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,760
 As expected, Father is exactly the way he's written in the diary.

370
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,310
 This is the only thing I can believe.

371
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,380
 But I can't reveal it.

372
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,440
You!

373
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,760
 Save me.

374
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,600
Everything is written on that diary.

375
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Right?

376
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,090
Don't come any closer. You died.

377
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,040
Come with me, huh?

378
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,190
No. Why should I?

379
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,930
Look here.

380
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,160
Come with me!

381
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,310
Let's go to the police!

382
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,150
Look here.

383
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,080
Look here. Come with me.

384
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,170
Look here. Look here.

385
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,850
You go that way.

386
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,790
Let's just go back.

387
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,620
That way.

388
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,950
 Naksan Intersection. Report of a drunkard rioting.

389
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,560
 Dispatch requested. Dispatch requested.

390
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,760
 Finding that homeless man is the priority.

391
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,080
 There's a reason he was hovering around here.

392
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,190
I did what I could.

393
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,800
This is Officer Sim Bo Gyeong. I'm on my way.

394
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,970
 The homeless man may be in danger. This isn't the time to be dealing with a complaint.

395
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,270
I was caught up in the past for a little while,

396
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,860
but I have no intention of being a cop like you.

397
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,840
What happened when you went after a criminal alone?

398
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,200
You can't even use a pair of chopsticks.

399
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,350
I'm just going to quietly guard my police station and live receiving my pension.

400
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,930
So stop showing up. Stop trying to sway me.

401
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,330
Is your injury okay?

402
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,870
What would you have done if I hadn't saved you?

403
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,140
This is a welcome drink. Drink it.

404
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,600
O-Oh. It's okay.

405
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,180
Just drink it when I give it to you.

406
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,360
If you don't want your skull cracked open like last time.

407
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,980
I didn't call the cops.

408
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,380
Then why were they looking for your house?

409
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,580
I really don't know!

410
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,750
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,610
The diary. Where is it?

412
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,750
Wh-what diary? I don't know anything.

413
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,270
Tell me. If you didn't open it, I'll let you go unharmed.

414
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,370
The red diary about this big?

415
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,600
That's at my house. I'll get it for you.

416
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,050
Please just spare my life.

417
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:09,170
I won't tell anyone. Really!

418
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:02,220
Since it's a diary you touched with your dirty hands, it's a pity but I think I'll just burn it.

419
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,360
 Dad, you'll be okay. You'll be okay.

420
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,510
 You'll be fine. Dad, you hear my voice, right?

421
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,670
 It'll be okay. Dad!

422
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,020
 Dad, wake up!

423
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,990
 Can you hear me?

424
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,020
 I'm so sorry, Dad.

425
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,390
 Dad!

426
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,050
I'm sorry, Dad.

427
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,660
What's up, Taek Soo?

428
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,590
- What? 
 - It looks like a suicide by fire.

429
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,110
I thought something was weird, but I didn't think it would be the sign to prepare for suicide.

430
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,080
Pathetic.

431
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,390
How weak are you that you see hallucinations?

432
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,560
Hello, Officer. Are you here for a drink?

433
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,470
Yes, well...

434
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,130
Yes.

435
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,090
Yes.

436
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,780
- Sir, another soju here! 
 - Coming up.

437
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:24,550
You must not be sleeping well.

438
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,150
My mind is too confused.

439
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:33,220
It must be hard because your memories aren't coming back.

440
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,460
Yes.

441
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,070
 Alright, 36 people a day.

442
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,980
 One person commits suicide every 40 minutes.

443
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,770
 What's so special about a homeless man killing himself?

444
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,020
 No, it can't be.

445
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,480
Do you also have problems?

446
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,670
That is... You see, sometimes I have hallucinations.

447
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,250
- L-like ghosts? 
 - No.

448
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:21,900
Should I say, it's like illusions from my suppressed subconscious?

449
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,980
Illusions from your suppressed subconscious?

450
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,660
Yep.

451
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,220
Just forget what I said.

452
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,680
I said something weird for no reason.

453
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,840
So if it's your suppressed subconscious, it means that it has something to say, right?

454
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,700
If you don't ignore it and follow it, won't it stop popping up?

455
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,310
What?

456
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,320
Does it... work that way?

457
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,590
I think I'll have to go first.

458
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:04,110
What? Um, Dong Sik!

459
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:18,110
Actually, it's a lie that you ran in front of our patrol car.

460
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,420
Sorry? Then...

461
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:27,310
I... hit you with the car.

462
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:31,690
I'm sorry, I should've told you sooner. I'll correct the report tomorrow.

463
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,390
It's all on the black box, so —

464
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,430
No!

465
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,320
- Sorry? 
 - What?

466
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,890
I mean, you don't need to make a big deal out of it.

467
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:47,550
You were probably busy patrolling, so it's my fault I didn't avoid it.

468
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,050
I'm fine, so please don't worry about it.

469
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,060
Miss Bo Gyeong, pay attention to your suppressed subconscious.

470
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,530
Then, I'll be off.

471
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,850
Wait, Dong Sik!

472
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,930
How could you...

473
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,020
be so nice?

474
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,420
No, I'm not nice. I'm not nice at all.

475
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,400
You are.

476
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,890
Go, our subconscious!

477
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,030
Wait, Dong Sik!

478
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,190
Here you go. Thank you.

479
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,140
Here —

480
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:45,360
Don't suppress it, but listen to it?

481
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:17,820
Taek Soo, did you get any results from the fire scene?

482
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:22,680
Everything practically burned from the fire, so there wasn't much left.

483
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,540
Except for some traces of sleeping pills from the energy drink bottle.

484
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,680
Sleeping pills?

485
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,480
 Yes, he probably killed himself after taking them.

486
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,060
 Like Park Mal Soon.

487
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,830
 The hallucination of homeless man said that it's all in my diary.

488
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,340
 My subconscious is telling me.

489
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,600
 To read the diary, and accept myself entirely.

490
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,910
 If I am a true psychopath,

491
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:11,050
 someone the likes of Team Leader Gong is nothing.

492
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:26,450
She was old and sick. Her husband died first.

493
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:31,430
She was collecting recycling papers for living.

494
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,370
Why did that old woman

495
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,930
want to live so much?

496
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,850
 Let's make an assumption.

497
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,280
 Someone gave Park Mal Soon sleeping pills.

498
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:16,220
And that person turned on the gas right when she would wake up.

499
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:22,390
They locked all the doors

500
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,550
and left through the veranda window.

501
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,380
 But he waited until Park Mal Soon woke up from her sleep.

502
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,680
 How could that be?

503
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,800
  The most enjoyable thing about killing someone

504
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,540
 is watching their life fade away right before your eyes.

505
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,520
To personally watch her die.

506
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,570
 Then the porch window was locked from the inside.

507
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,530
Is that—?

508
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,230
Grandmother locked it herself. She was scared.

509
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,930
 Old bug (referring to Park Mal Soon) was hesitating a little.

510
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,560
 then had to make a choice.

511
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,450
 To die with the gas.

512
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,440
Whether I'll kill her ...

513
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,920
In the end, she locked the door herself.

514
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:41,350
The appropriate self-sacrifice of a stupid, weak person

515
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:44,350
is the best last scene.

516
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,200
 If a person disguises the death of people as a suicide,

517
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,520
 he must be a psychopath.

518
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,450
 It's the same person.

519
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,070
This is...  This is evidence of a serial murder.

520
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,840
 Before I lost my memories,

521
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,790
 I was a scary, precise, cruel psychopath.

522
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,230
  But you have to face it.

523
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:44,510
 If my original self is the real me,

524
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:49,010
 the innocent puppies who run straight into danger (me),

525
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,720
 I wouldn't have left them alone.

526
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,450
I'll have the same.

527
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,490
You must have taken care of the problems you had.

528
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,020
What?

529
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,430
It must be a girl problem.

530
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:29,950
What kind of girl is she? That she is able to shake up the director?

531
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:35,190
You don't need to know her name. We broke up.

532
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,610
Very cleanly.

533
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:40,180
That's a relief.

534
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,360
Should we toast? Since it is something to congratulate.

535
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,570
It is not time to celebrate. There is a problem with Yook Dong Sik.

536
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,270
What kind of problem is it?

537
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:56,000
Just post something anonymously on the bulletin, as Yook Dong Sik did.

538
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,460
"They are trying to pin the intentional management wrongdoing in the Yuseong Biomedi case

539
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,440
on a weak rank and file employee."

540
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,250
Soon I will reveal who is behind it.

541
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,810
Why?

542
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:12,850
If Yook Dong Sik is the problem, let's have Seo Ji Hoon be the incentive.

543
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:18,520
With his personality, he'll flip after he sees it.

544
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,720
It is already up.

545
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,720
Looks like it was uploaded recently.

546
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,700
 Facts of Yuseong BioMedi by Anonymous.  I'm exposing the corruption of the executives involved a while ago with Yuseong.

547
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,270
Who would upload this kind of thing other than us?

548
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,550
- No way... 
 - Was it Yook Dong Sik who did that?

549
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,500
He just won't get it.

550
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,840
He's an interesting guy.

551
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,290
 What do you think that pushover is thinking?

552
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,550
 Who knows.

553
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,880
 But if I were that guy, would I have started with a hunt?

554
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:12,080
We have a problem. There was an anonymous post.

555
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,250
- Let me see. 
 - Yes, sir.

556
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,160
D-Did he do this?

557
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,900
That punk really said he has amnesia but he has no fear at all.

558
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,590
That guy. We can't leave him like this.

559
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,620
What should we do?

560
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,630
You just report his whereabout. You guys stay out of it. I will take care of it myself.

561
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:39,120
With this kind of post, what if Sunbae bring his alibi?

562
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,170
]Won't we be at risk with the lies?

563
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,510
No, no. Your team leader is not that kind of person.

564
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:48,020
There is definitely something going on.

565
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,820
Something wrong? Like what?

566
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,070
Yeah.

567
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,220
Of that, I, myself, am not sure.

568
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,810
They think I have amnesia.

569
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,230
How long have you been standing there?

570
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,250
How long ago did I come up here?

571
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,200
From when Mi Joo said, "won't we be at risk with lies?"

572
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,960
I think before that point.

573
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:22,260
What do we do now? What do we do?

574
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,760
Have you guys had dinner yet?

575
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,120
We should go.

576
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,060
Oh, yes.

577
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,000
It's the first time our Dong Sik brings in a company dinner.

578
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,920
Anyhow, please enjoy the meal.

579
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,660
I'm so busy, where did my wife go?

580
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:05,180
- Dong Sik, about what we said earlier.
 - Oh.

581
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,980
Eat first. You must be so hungry.

582
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,230
Here, here.

583
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,530
Thank you for the food!

584
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,620
Okay!

585
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,120
He is eating dinner with three coworkers.

586
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,870
He met with petty coworkers to come up with something?

587
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,710
It's absurd.

588
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,920
How do we proceed?

589
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,910
Just enjoy your time.

590
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,480
Yes, I understand, Director Seo.

591
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,140
They're really pushing for it.

592
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:29,080
Hyungnim, let's get our heads on straight.

593
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,620
What? Ah, really? Sorry.

594
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,480
Let's go.

595
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,870
Welcome!

596
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,620
Korean beef might be too expensive.

597
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,220
Shut it.

598
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,170
Move over.

599
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,270
Let's switch seats.

600
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,300
Hello!

601
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,630
Please give us your best dish.

602
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,830
- Eat up! 
 - Yes, sir!

603
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,320
Let's have some meat. Have some more.

604
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,930
Dong Sik, I'm sorry.

605
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,650
It's not a problem.

606
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:25,990
Writing statements full of lies is a bit too much for us.

607
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,780
We said we can't!

608
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,490
But the managing director threatened to close down our department and have us all fired.

609
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,560
The Team Leader said that?

610
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,600
What power do we have?

611
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,580
That's right.

612
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:44,410
Amnesia.

613
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,390
Hey you. When did you get so hammered?

614
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:52,020
You told us before. The Team Leader thinks you lost your memory.

615
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,860
Then, did you not lose your memory?

616
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,620
Mi Joo, stop drinking.

617
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,680
Do you not have amnesia?

618
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,490
You can just tell them what you were doing that night.

619
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:07,520
Well. Is there something you're worried about?

620
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,030
Do you think I'm stupid?

621
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:20,050
We might get fired, so you're not saying anything, right?

622
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,550
For our own benefit.

623
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,620
- What? 
 - We lied,

624
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,060
and you're worried that we're going to get fired.

625
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:36,550
You're ... trying to take all the responsibility right now.

626
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,330
 I should just stay quiet.

627
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,200
Chil Seong, eh?

628
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,070
Let's not do that, okay?

629
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,860
Let's go.

630
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,410
I get it. I get it.

631
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,050
Yookhwi (raw beef dish) is expensive.

632
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,720
- Hyungnim! 
 - Hyungnim!

633
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,890
What happened, Hyungnim?

634
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:20,420
If you're going to drink, you should just drink nicely.

635
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,880
I wasn't doing anything.

636
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,050
Are you alright?

637
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,610
He looks fine.

638
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,770
He's fine and he's only pretending?

639
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,850
What are you talking about?  Was it self-inflicted?

640
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,260
Huh? What's going on here?

641
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:56,120
My business is with them, so stay out of it

642
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,860
if you don't want to see blood.

643
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,740
Today doesn't seem like the right time. so you should head home.

644
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,090
Will you be okay?

645
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:12,200
Yes. Don't worry; I'll see you at work tomorrow.

646
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,170
If you're going to leave, hurry up and leave.

647
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,850
As you go out, go ahead and report it to the police.

648
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,650
I'm going to remember all your faces.

649
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:38,910
Earlier my eyes met the most intimidating guy I've ever seen.

650
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,760
We're so pathetic.

651
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,200
First, let's leave.  Hurry up.

652
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,300
-  I can't. 
 - Wake up, wake up.

653
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,890
"Don't worry, I'll see you at work tomorrow"?

654
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,960
How cool of you!

655
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:12,290
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you afraid?

656
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:17,130
 What is this? My heart is going crazy.

657
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,040
 Am I really afraid?

658
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,180
This bastard is trying to ignore me.

659
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:29,850
If you messed up, you should apologize.

660
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,030
I-I'm sorry.

661
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:38,760
You should have done that before this got so big.

662
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,160
If someone makes a mistake, they should admit it and

663
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,160
leave their job nicely.

664
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,220
How can you go back to work again tomorrow?

665
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,560
Don't you think, Yook Dong Sik?

666
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,560
  No. I'm not afraid.

667
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,340
  This is my blood boiling inside me.

668
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:03,430
  My psychopath murderer blood.

669
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:07,820
Everyone here is a victim just because of you.

670
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,520
Look at that.

671
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,070
Our Hyungnim. Do you think he would like to be treated like that at his age?

672
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,880
Are you not going to answer me?

673
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:20,220
  I need to hold it in.

674
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,570
  Because everything is being recorded through the cellphone.

675
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:25,650
  Hold it in...

676
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:30,630
What is this bastard? Is he losing his mind?

677
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:33,100
I'm Dong Sik's father.

678
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:38,380
I don't know what wrong our Dong Sik did to you, but please just forgive us this once.

679
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:47,130
Father, you are going through lots of hardships because of having one wrong son.

680
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,490
You did wrong, didn't you?

681
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,120
Right you, bastard?

682
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,480
I'm so sorry!

683
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,780
I will accept the consequence of raising my son poorly.

684
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:13,100
Father. Stand up.

685
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,160
Why are you making this so sad?

686
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:24,070
This kid is usually weak. If he loses, he just loses.

687
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:27,610
He hates hurting others. He would rather die.

688
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:32,830
But I, his foolish father, didn't want to see that anymore. I wanted him to be stronger.

689
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:34,470
I told him to survive no matter what.

690
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:38,370
I was harsh on him. It's all my fault.

691
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,890
Yes.

692
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,860
I have a favor to ask.

693
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,430
I would like to just talk the two of us,

694
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:11,100
so could you please take Father out of here?

695
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,650
- Dong Sik. 
 - Okay.

696
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:17,110
We shouldn't show him his miserable form anymore.

697
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,840
Hey, Dong Sik!

698
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,820
Beg for forgiveness.

699
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,890
Tell them you're sorry! Hey!

700
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,660
Dong Sik! Dong Sik!

701
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,190
Dong Sik!

702
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,910
 The Merciless

703
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,920
What's that for?

704
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:32,120
A while back, there was a gang leader who controlled the prison.

705
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,860
Of all places, that old man happened to die in a restaurant.

706
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,560
Do you know how he died?

707
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:48,110
I  poured steaming hot oil down his throat.

708
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:50,410
Then what do you think happens?

709
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:55,160
His throat gets fried in hot oil.

710
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,540
Just like gopchang (cow intestine).

711
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:03,760
This bastard. It seems he's seen a few movies.

712
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,790
I did see a few movies.

713
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,830
This isn't a movie, you idiots.

714
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:15,580
This guy killed someone. I know it.

715
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:18,190
Killed someone?

716
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,560
Please, please.

717
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,260
Why are you saying that so loudly?

718
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:26,260
Ahjussi, did you see me killing a person?

719
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,930
No. Please save me.

720
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:33,300
Who ordered you to come here?

721
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,420
I don't know.

722
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,730
You won't be able to eat at all.

723
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:43,150
No. Before that, you will die from not being able to breathe.

724
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:48,890
It's Director! Director Seo! That's what I heard.

725
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:52,000
Please get rid of this.

726
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,700
Director Seo?

727
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,920
What happened?

728
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,530
Just come quickly!

729
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,930
  Jeongyook Sikdang (Fresh Meat Restaurant)

730
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,670
This little guy. What brings you here?

731
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,450
Long time, no see, Captain.

732
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:52,260
What do you mean Captain? You came here to ask a favor, right?

733
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:57,060
As expected, you're the best profiler in the nation.

734
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:04,480
Here. These are the files you are looking for.

735
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,770
Hold on. This database.

736
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:15,020
If you log into my ID, it will be easier to look for information that you need.

737
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,450
Wow.

738
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,290
Thank you, Uncle.

739
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:23,420
But, what incident is it? Are you sure you don't need my help?

740
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,860
Not yet.

741
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:28,450
Ah, right. Sunbae is doing good right?

742
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:35,260
 This bastard. Now you are asking how I'm doing.

743
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,580
Yes. He's doing well.

744
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:43,570
Anyway, you are just like your father, the way you make a case from nothing and investigate on them.

745
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:48,150
Father always said that in this world, there are two types of cases.

746
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:52,620
A case where a report has been made, and a case where a report has not been made yet.

747
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,950
Both kinds are our work.

748
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:58,770
- Okay. Do well, Detective Sim Bo Gyeong. 
 - Okay.

749
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,420
- Turn off the lights when you leave. 
 - Thank you, Uncle!

750
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,550
Work hard!

751
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:11,460
Now, shall we start?

752
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,170
 Try your best to dig into the case.

753
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:16,100
Why? You're not going to help?

754
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:19,160
From here, you have to do it yourself.

755
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,320
I'm doing all this because of someone—

756
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,870
Anyway, he's no help.

757
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,550
  They say it's suicide.

758
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:50,440
 Unfortunately the house burned to the ground, so I can't find whatever you were looking for.

759
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,590
That can't be helped.  You worked hard.

760
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:06,600
  It seems that Director Seo's side has made a move as you predicted.

761
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:14,060
  Now all puzzles have been solved.

762
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:19,270
  The puzzle of who tried to make me a scapegoat.

763
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,960
 Arrogant, born with a gold spoon in his mouth, trusting his father,

764
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,080
a ridiculous, badly behaving monkey-like jerk,

765
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,900
  Seo Ji Hoon.

766
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,250
Yook Dong Sik.

767
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,880
 My wounded hand has not fully recovered yet.

768
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,930
  However, I need to start writing in the diary.

769
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,650
  A new murder diary.

770
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,110
Seo Ji Hoon.

771
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,890
I shall kill you

772
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:48,580
because I'm a psychopathic serial killer.

773
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,150
 Psychopath Diary

774
01:16:56,450 --> 01:17:03,490

775
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,800
  How am I going to kill him?

776
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,160
 Something that makes your heart race. Do that.

777
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,720
 He might be holding onto something we don't know.

778
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,240
 I'll have to meet him. I have a pretty good source.

779
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,500
  - I'm a bit busy. 
 - No—

780
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,660
  The plan is perfect.

781
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,650
  Do you think I wouldn't know what you, Dong Sik, are trying to do?

782
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:26,180
 For some reason, this is really suspicious.

783
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,850
  I'm not nervous, I'm excited.

784
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:34,430
  Because you, Yook Dong Sik, are a brutal, cold, and meticulous psychopath.
