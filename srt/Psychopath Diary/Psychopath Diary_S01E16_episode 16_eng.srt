 Psychopath Diary

2
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:33,270

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,240
 Psychopath Diary

4
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,110
Seo In Woo!

5
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,900
 Episode 16 - Finale

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,350
Seo Ji Hoon... Didn't you kill him?

7
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,260
Who killed whom?

8
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,930
This is my blood.

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,210
Yook Dong Sik.

10
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,670
You had a lot of fun watching me get fooled by you, didn't you? I’m sure you did.

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,680
Because I know you a bit, you know?

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,470
"The euphoric feeling you get when you watch dying prey...," blah, blah, blah.

13
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,450
Those childish games are over now.

14
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,590
You think you won? Even if this b**** dies?

15
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,860
Seo In Woo!

16
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,090
Ah, stop.

17
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,740
Even if I shoot a hole through here, would you still be able to talk that way?

18
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,750
 The Outlaws

19
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,530
You’re going to get Sim Bo Gyeong killed this way.

20
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,360
Do you think those lousy things you learned from watching movies

21
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,860
will really work on me?

22
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,760
Know who you're dealing with first.

23
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,020
Why? Are you any different?

24
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,180
You're just a pitiful bastard with an inferiority complex.

25
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,050
What?

26
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,660
If you read your diary carefully, there's something strange.

27
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,370
You rant about getting revenge on the family you hate so much,

28
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,140
but your birth mother,

29
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,440
there's not a single word about her.

30
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,200
The letters I wrote at my mother's cinerarium. You got rid of them all, didn't you?

31
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,190
How did you feel when you read those?

32
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:16,350
Not being able to protect your mother who died a lonely, miserable death.

33
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,010
And you just mooched off a father and family who made her that way all your life, and what now?

34
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,270
Predator?

35
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,010
Yook Dong Sik!

36
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,110
 Nowhere to Hide

37
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,580
Dong Sik!

38
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,560
This place does great skin care!

39
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,020
Wow, I owe you for that!

40
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,050
Yes, it's unlucky.

41
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,470
Dong Sik...

42
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,970
Does it hurt a lot?

43
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,880
It probably does. So why did you provoke me?

44
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,610
Nothing but a pushover. How dare you?

45
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,090
What? Do what?

46
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,430
Okay. Let's see how much longer you can play predator.

47
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,690
Keep going!

48
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,050
 Code zero, code zero, all officers to Daehan Securities!

49
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,700
 The officer who arrived on scene after receiving the report is trapped, and Team One is on their way.

50
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,670
What are you going to do? There's not much time left.

51
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm going crazy, seriously. Step on it. Step on it!

52
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,870
Seriously.

53
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,680
Did you stow someone away in the trunk?!

54
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,790
- Who would I bring along? Why? 
 - Seriously!

55
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,740
You're laughing?

56
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,940
I mean, it's funny.

57
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,790
You laid the blame for everything on me,

58
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,380
and finally got the company you dreamed of in your hands.

59
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,190
But, wow, because of a pushover, Yook Dong Sik whom everyone looked down on,

60
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,510
you're about to lose everything.

61
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,280
So you were buying time this whole time?

62
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,470
Really? Then I'll end this quickly.

63
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,330
When the police arrive, they're going to arrest you and Sim Bo Gyeong.

64
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,170
Because I'll already have disappeared.

65
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,720
Forever.

66
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,020
You're going to run away like a rat? Then, we can always change the order.

67
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,670
Bo Gyeong.

68
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,940
Sorry. For making you wait.

69
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,180
Hey, In Woo! There's one right here!"

70
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,860
Hey!

71
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,520
Director, sign off on this document, please!

72
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,680
Damn it, this bastard! Hey!

73
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,990
Damn it.

74
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,800
Don't get anxious. Your turn will come soon.

75
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,860
I am anxious, you bastard!

76
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,740
Come on!

77
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,010
That crazy bastard.

78
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,900
That's a gunshot!

79
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Security guard! Information clerk!

80
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,930
This is always open.

81
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,800
Hurry.

82
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,850
Do you think that would work right now?

83
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,450
Take the stairs!

84
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,250
This is fun. It's been a while since I've hunted.

85
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,710
My father said this to me. "When hunting,

86
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,580
the thrilling moment

87
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,250
is when you stare into the eyes of the prey that expects death."

88
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,210
You're fired.

89
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,420
Drop the gun, Seo In Woo.

90
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,850
- Have you even shot a gun before? 
 - I have.

91
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,090
This time, it will be live ammunition, so drop the gun while I am speaking nicely.

92
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,140
I said drop the gun!

93
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,540
Oh! Stop holding onto me!

94
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,000
Hyungnim!

95
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,700
Bo Gyeong!

96
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,080
Dong Sik!

97
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,160
 Psychopath Diary

98
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,410
- Sunbae! 
 - Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

99
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,630
Oh, I see them.

100
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,760
Over there.

101
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,590
Dong Sik.

102
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,180
It's over now.

103
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,000
It's all over.

104
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,280
Dong Sik. Dong Sik!

105
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,240
Dong Sik!

106
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:52,070
♫  In the dark night  ♫

107
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,370
♫  You were the bright light in my heart  ♫

108
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,980
♫  Your face, your breath  ♫

109
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,660
 Mom.

110
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,300
 I told you not to move.

111
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,760
♫  Oh, can’t you stay the same?  ♫

112
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,250
 You smell nice.

113
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,260
 You have so much earwax.

114
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,810
  I guess that's why you never listened to what I said.

115
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,320
 No, I listened to you so well.

116
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,110
 I know. I know my Dong Sik is so sweet.

117
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:51,340
♫  If we are together, I can endure  ♫

118
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:59,470
♫  Don’t worry, oh oh  ♫

119
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,630
♫  I will love you  ♫

120
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,060
♫  I will love you  ♫

121
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,320
 The predator murderer who shook up the whole nation,

122
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,840
  the shocking truth about the escapee Yook Dong Sik's case has been finally revealed.

123
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,700
 The real culprit of the serial murders isn't Yook Dong Sik, as it has been reported,

124
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,490
 but the director of the securities company where Yook Dong Sik worked, Seo In Woo.

125
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,980
 The suspect, Seo In Woo, while holding Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong hostage and confronting Yook Dong Sik,

126
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,370
 fell out of the company building. But, somehow, at that moment,

127
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,040
  he fell onto a street cleaning truck that was collecting trash and barely managed to live.

128
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,440

I heard a sudden thud.

129
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,670
 And damn it. A real piece of trash had just fallen from the sky.

130
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,810
 You can't even recycle that kind of stuff. You have to bury it.

131
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,130
 Meanwhile, Seo In Woo was transported to the hospital right away

132
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,720
 and is now known to be in a vegetative state.

133
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,110
 Upon hearing the news, people are saying he received divine retribution.

134
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,150
Is it different than being brain dead?

135
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,310
It's basically the same as being in a vegetative state.

136
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,330
His brain is functioning but yet, he can't move.

137
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,240
It must be horrendous prison worse than any place in this world.

138
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,530
We're here again.

139
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,870
You're right. I didn't think I'd come here with you again.

140
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,780
Oh my! You've arrived.

141
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,760
You could have come a little later after resting up more.

142
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,940
Let's go then.

143
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,440
Straighten your shoulders. It's not like you committed a crime.

144
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,400
You could've made a different choice.

145
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,890
Was it because you were scared?

146
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,660
- Or... 
 - I'm sorry.

147
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,940
Let's go.

148
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,400
First, once we investigated Team Leader Jo Yoo Jin and Director Seo In Woo,

149
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,750
your testimony pretty much matched up with Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong's.

150
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,410
Also, when we searched Seo In Woo's hideout that you found,

151
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,880
including the murder of Director Joo Young Min of Shin Sung Securities as well as others, they were all found recorded in this.

152
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,480
And another thing.

153
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,800
This.

154
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,320
We found this on suspect Seo In Woo.

155
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,790
You worked hard.

156
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,820
It's embarrassing to hear you say we worked hard when we didn't do much.

157
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,750
You and Bo Gyeong were the ones who did all the work.

158
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,950
As for the crimes you were forced to commit, such as kidnapping, attempted murder,

159
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,830
escaping, breaking into a house, etc. Well, there are quite a few.

160
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,980
But they all should end up being ruled as extenuating circumstances.

161
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,150
And, this isn't an official statement from the police, but...

162
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,710
Thank you, sincerely. For not giving up until the end.

163
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,310
I'm telling you it'll be fine.

164
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,990
- I'm not doing this. 
 - Come on!

165
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,050
Look at all the people out there!

166
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,700
Just tell them the truth about what happened.

167
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,850
- I can't! 
 - Hold onto him.

168
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,990
I just can't!

169
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,730
There are so many people!

170
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,970
How do you feel about being exonerated?

171
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,230
We want to hear the details of the land-mine-like situation between you and Seo In Woo!

172
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,660
Do you personally prefer yourself before you recovered your memories or after?

173
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,770
When you thought you were a psychopath, did you feel pleasure in reality or not?

174
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,680
I am just ...

175
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,010
a pushover is all.

176
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,170
I am also extremely weak-hearted,

177
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:57,770
and I tend to believe that it's better for me to go through any trouble rather than someone else.

178
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:03,850
At one point, I felt I was such a fool and hated myself for that.

179
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,190
But now I feel it is a relief.

180
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,170
Because if it wasn't so, if I wasn't a pushover,

181
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:19,910
then at that time, I really could have killed someone.

182
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,860
For example ...

183
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,880
It's a joke, a joke!

184
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
It's a joke.

185
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,560
Why is the mood like this?

186
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,210
It's a joke!

187
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh, whoa.

188
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,470
The sunlight is nice.

189
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,660
 One year later  
   Mr. Yook Meat Republic

190
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,300
Are you saying that I'm lying right now?

191
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,710
Why would we?

192
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,000
But, that is, it happened two days ago already.

193
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,060
Whether it was two days or three, I'm telling you that I got an upset stomach after eating meat here!

194
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,160
But we really don't use any product that isn't fresh.

195
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,250
That's not my problem! I'm telling you I got an upset stomach anyway!

196
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,740
These people really, it wouldn't be enough to apologize!

197
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,900
Ah, my apologies. When you come again next time, I will—

198
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,190
What next time? I see now, you people, really.

199
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,370
You're only planning on settling this with words!

200
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,740
Sorry?

201
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,220
Even if you only considered my hospital fees and the hours I couldn't work—

202
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,930
What is it?

203
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,630
I came to my senses and stopped doing illegal things

204
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,990
and was going to try using the knife, making use of my specialty, but it's really hard.

205
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,490
Do you know who I am?

206
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,410
Who are you?

207
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,830
Forget it!

208
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,080
Master, this is the sirloin, right?

209
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,800
That's the chuck steak.

210
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,850
- Oh, that's right. The chuck. 
 - Put it further back.

211
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,060
That's precious.  I'll stick the knife here.

212
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,810
If you cut it up brutally with a knife, this is the sirloin?

213
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,950
That's right! It's the center of the back. The sirloin.

214
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,560
Right! And these ribs!

215
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,140
If you cut up the stomach like this,

216
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,930
you get the pork belly that Dong Sik likes so much!

217
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,300
- Oh, you have to get a few pieces of neck chain off of it first. 
 - Right!

218
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,150
What are you doing? These people, really. If you do this,

219
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,370
do you think I'll let it pass? I'll report it to the police.

220
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,610
- How are you, Mister? 
 - Welcome!

221
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,880
- How are you, Hyungnim! 
 - Who are you?!

222
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,840
I'm just a customer.

223
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,480
Obnoxious customers, out!

224
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,290
- Mister, are you doing well? 
 - You really.

225
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,110
Is work at the restaurant doable, Hyungnim?

226
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,900
Yeah. It's totally my style. Just wait and see. Within a few years,

227
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,750
I'll make Seven (Yook is homonym for six) Republic—

228
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,240
- You haven't eaten, right? 
 - Yes.

229
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,500
- Mister, please give us meat. 
 - Meat?

230
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,550
I got it.

231
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,200
Is Sergeant Sim doing well?

232
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,580
Ah, our legendary profiler Sergeant Sim? She's at the top of her form!

233
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,680
 Her beard is growing out rapidly, too.

234
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,970
You saw his response earlier during questioning, right?

235
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,750
The child is alive, for sure.

236
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,870
Looking at his tendency to think of his territory as highly important,

237
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,020
it should be within 300 meters of his residence.

238
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,760
And among these, this building seems the most likely.

239
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,500
This is the blueprint.

240
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,300
 Paper bin

241
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,930
Are you okay? You must have been scared.

242
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,610
Are you okay? Let's go to your mom.

243
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,430
 Didn't she even solve a kidnapping case recently?

244
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:58,350
K-Kid... Awesome! Whoa, really? Whoa!

245
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,240
How is Dong Sik doing?

246
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,840
My Hyungnim?

247
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,690
He's the same as always.

248
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,670
Hello!

249
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,960
As expected, in the morning, the newbie intern's coffee shop style coffee is the best.

250
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,840
Hey. There, there.

251
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,040
The desk next to mine. It's not somewhere just anyone can sit.

252
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,360
Ah, was this seat originally—

253
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,200
So you know!

254
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,410
I was Dong Sik's best friend.

255
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,840
Of course, I still am.

256
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,470
When he couldn't finish a report, I would go over it for him. I would do all sorts of things for him.

257
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,000
- Ah, yes. 
 - Ah, yes.

258
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,940
Hey, newbie. I have a report that's almost done, do you want to try to wrap it up?

259
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,740
You just have to submit it, that's all.

260
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,620
Team Leader! I'm watching over the newbie.

261
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,840
From looking at you, moron,

262
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,820
what would that newbie learn, you moron?

263
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,710
Ouch, that hurts!

264
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,580
Stronger, stronger!

265
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,110
What could he possibly learn?

266
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,810
Cheers!

267
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,310
Oh, he quit working for Daehan Securities early on.

268
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,850
Why didn't he go back there to work?

269
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,750
He didn't really have the aptitude for it.

270
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,630
But what's more amazing is that

271
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,660
Hyungnim ended up finding something that he has the perfect aptitude for.

272
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,770
That is...

273
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,390
All over this room, there's evidence of a murder.

274
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,720
Very secretly.

275
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,270
If you don't find them within the time allotted,

276
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,490
you two will both be killed by my hands.

277
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,440
- It's so realistic. 
 - I know! 
 - Let's ask for a commemorative photo.

278
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,910
Oh, can we take one photo with you?

279
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,120
Oh, should we?

280
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,930
One, two, three.

281
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,520
If you have a hard time escaping the room, just call me through the intercom.

282
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,590
Then... have a terrifying time!

283
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,100
It's so fun.

284
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,360
Start!

285
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,610
  Escape Room Cafe

286
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:13,460
Oh, that's a part-time job! Our Dong Sik writes now!

287
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,830
- You mean how he jots down stuff in his notebook every day? 
 - Didn't I tell you?

288
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,240
Dong Sik's book is getting published soon!

289
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,170
- So many publishers are fighting over who's going to get the rights claiming it'll be a best seller as soon as it's released! 
 - No way!

290
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,570
It's true, though.

291
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,160
 Psychopath Diary 
  - This is... Yook Dong Sik! Psycho...

292
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,300
- I told you! 
 - It's true! Wow!

293
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,870
There should be plenty of things written about me in here!

294
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,190
Oh, I'll be disappointed if he doesn't mention me!

295
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,030
- Dong Chan, did your entrance exam go well? 
 - Right! We have to take an order!

296
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,660
Oh my...

297
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,510
- He didn't take the exam. 
 - What?

298
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,850
What are you going to do?

299
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,540
I'm not going to college anyway. I want to find something that suits me like Hyung.

300
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,330
What do you plan on doing?

301
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,020
Idol.

302
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,470
Do you have plans on the weekend in the evening?

303
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,270
We were going to have a BBQ party after Dong Sik's publication ceremony. All of you will be there, right?

304
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,200
- Yes, yes, we will. 
 - It's going to be here again? 
 - Ouch!

305
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,230
Be careful next time.

306
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,010
If it were any other patient, they would have complained even over this little wound.

307
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,570
I'm sorry.

308
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,940
It's fine. It'll be alright.

309
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,520
Truthfully, I've done that while shaving someone, too.

310
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,550
But this patient's basic physique must be good.

311
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,170
- He still has pretty good muscle mass.
 - You think so?

312
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,700
 Psychopath Diary 
Meet the Best Selling Author

313
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:07,170
 Today, we will be introducing the book's author.

314
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:13,080
 I'd like to introduce today's special guest, author Yook Dong Sik.

315
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,580
In that place, he screamed, "Die!"

316
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,350
He was screaming, "Die." It hurt so much.

317
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:35,590
When you watch it in movies, it happens so easily. And according to the diary,

318
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,440
I should be watching the person dying coldly, but...  He's tall. His arms are long.

319
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,330
So if he just stretches them out, he can grab me.

320
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,510
A woman in the audience has raised her hand. Let's listen to her question.

321
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,470
If the real culprit of this case read your book, how do you think he would react?

322
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,020
I believe he probably ...

323
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,430
has already seen it.

324
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,820
And ...

325
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,910
he may even be here.

326
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,020
In this room,

327
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,780
Please close all the exits.

328
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,150
There's someone leaving in the back.

329
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,480
I was joking!

330
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:40,920
I heard Director Bong Joon Ho ( winner at Cannes )  did something like that in the past so I copied him a little.

331
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,400
As you know, the culprit of the real case that this book was based on,

332
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,840
is in the hospital in a vegetative state

333
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,540
in his own body,

334
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,470
which could be seen as the tiniest prison in the world

335
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,880
while locked up in it.

336
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,250
Yes.

337
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,740
Thank you. Yes, hello.

338
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,980
Are we done?

339
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,200
Yes, you've worked hard.

340
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,290
Oh, I had fun.

341
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,720
- Take care. 
 - Thank you.

342
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,250
- You came. 
 - Congratulations, Dong Sik.

343
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,280
I'm sorry I'm late.

344
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,490
I was organizing my case files and lost track of time.

345
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,480
It's okay.

346
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,790
The main event is just starting.

347
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,100
Let's go.

348
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,490
Did you do well?

349
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,400
Seriously. Calm down.

350
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,510
Alcohol is best on an empty stomach. Everyone have a drink!

351
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,410
In honor of Psychopath Diary.

352
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,740
Cheers!

353
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:01,260
Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

354
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,090
- Eat up.
 - We will.

355
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,280
So Assistant Manager Park, how old are you?

356
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,710
Oh me? There is an order to everything. Team Leader, how old are you?

357
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,340
Age? I just turned 45.

358
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,410
You're 45. I'm '86 so 35.

359
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,950
- I'm '87. 
 - Oh, friend.

360
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,660
He's my friend, my friend. Hyungnim. Hyungnim, how old are you, Hyungnim?

361
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,530
I was born in the Year of the Dragon.

362
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,420
If you're a dragon ... wait, then you're friends with our team leader. Two more friends over here.

363
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,760
Wow.

364
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,470
- We're the same age. 
 - I'm '88.

365
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,400
Eighty-eight... (you can have the same zodiac sign with someone 12 years younger or older)

366
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,320
Hey, bring your birth certificate. Are you sure you're '88?

367
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,310
You're '88? Not the same year?

368
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,360
Officer Choi, arrest him. He's a con artist.

369
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,410
- He's not very young looking. 
 - I know.

370
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,350
I called him Hyungnim all this time, though.

371
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,980
You sure you're not the class of '88?

372
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,830
If you're '88, what's with your face?

373
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,610
Not your graduation year? You sure?

374
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,610
His face is a bit...

375
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,110
It happens.

376
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,840
Eat a lot.

377
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,470
Here. Cheers.

378
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,740
Drink up.

379
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,790
- Cheers. 
 - She really drank a lot.

380
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,170
Why are you so red now?

381
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,770
- A third round would be nice. 
 - Third round. Third round.

382
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,840
Let's have another.

383
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,980
Where are you going by yourself?

384
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,100
Where shall we go?

385
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,080
I think I forgot to lock up the store. I was going to take care of it and come right back.

386
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,440
Do you want to go together?

387
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,610
Well ...

388
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,870
I don't think I need you to. Just have fun here.

389
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,240
- That punk was more manly when he was delusional. 
 - You don't know what you're saying!

390
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,060
As my master told me, Yook Dong Sik may look gentle on the outside,

391
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,460
but in his heart, he's raising a beast.

392
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,370
I get it, so stop talking informally to me. It's starting to annoy me.

393
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,020
You smell like alcohol. Go over there.

394
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,240
Ah, that startled me.

395
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,610
I don't know about a beast, but somehow the fact that he was delusional,

396
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,370
I do think it was a good thing that it happened to Dong Sik.

397
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:40,770
If it were someone else, more people might have gotten hurt or died.

398
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,050
That's true.

399
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,240
Oh, it's cold.

400
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,080
 Escape Room Cafe

401
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,610
What?

402
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,300
Did you sleep well?

403
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,090
Why did you make me wait for so long?

404
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm glad you've recovered. But you still need to pay for your crimes.

405
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,650
Starting now.

406
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,250
 Congratulations Dong Sik.

407
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,460
 Seo In Woo disappeared from the hospital.

408
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,990
 I'm sorry I'm late. I was organizing my case files and lost track of time.

409
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,150
 It's okay.

410
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,980
 The main event is just starting.

411
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,950
 Let's go.

412
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,150
 Dong Sik.

413
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,940
 Okay.

414
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,270
 There.

415
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,360
 Does it look like me?

416
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,320
 This is different.

417
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,440
 I feel like this curl right here is like my signature.

418
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,620
 A little like this.

419
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,470
 Like this. So detailed.

420
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,180
 All done.

421
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,800
 Shall we start the game?

422
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,340
What?

423
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,530
If you do what I tell you, I'll let you go.

424
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,520
 Apologize.

425
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,350
To that mannequin.

426
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,840
Who do you think you're playing with?

427
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,580
Do you have another solution?

428
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,530
Or you can stay trapped in there and get captured by the police.

429
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,530
 Dong Sik told me.

430
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,820
When he wakes up, he'll definitely come find him.

431
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,700
If you had a plan like that, you should have shared it sooner.

432
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,000
Seo In Woo, that punk.

433
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,060
He must have already lost his confidence while lying in the hospital for a year.

434
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,080
How much of a coward must he be now?

435
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,230
Given the tiniest of opportunities, he would have escaped.

436
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:38,520
Hey, let's go quick! I'm dying to see the stupefied expression on his face!

437
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,790
Don't be too excited.

438
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,840
You have to be more calm in these circumstances.

439
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,300
Tiring. Oh, so tiring!

440
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,700
 I should just close up and go back to Meat Republic.

441
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,450
I'm so—

442
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,280
What?

443
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,270
I'm sorry.

444
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,530
You're smiling?

445
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,370
Apology, my butt.

446
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,960
I was never going to accept an apology from you anyway.

447
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,380
On this earth that's full of beasts,

448
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,970
do you know how a human being was able to become the top predator?

449
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,810
It's because of...

450
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,130
this.

451
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,030
Okay, I'm sorry.

452
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,060
I said I'm sorry.

453
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,520
I told you I'm not accepting your apology.

454
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,770
And there's one other thing.

455
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,960
With this, people can imagine.

456
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,670
Like you said, those tacky values.

457
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,360
Thanks to that, people are able to trust and rely on each other.

458
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,240
But you. You're just a beast who only wanted to ridicule what

459
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,330
people believed in and hurt them.

460
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,950
A beast who hurt people should be locked up in a pen, no?

461
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:16,810
While rotting in jail for the rest of your life, you'll dwindle even more.

462
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,800
 Hansim Building

463
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,580
He's in front of Hansim Building!

464
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,040
 He is within a 50 meter radius.

465
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,770
Hurry up! If we don't get there to witness the scene of the arrest, I'll kill you!

466
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,660
We're almost there! Once we turn the corner here—

467
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,720
Really.

468
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,340
♫  In the dark night in my heart  ♫

469
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,330
♫  You have become the bright light  ♫

470
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,220
♫  Your image, your breath  ♫

471
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:43,300
♫  are still there  ♫

472
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:49,420
♫  Oh, can’t you stay the same?  ♫

473
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:57,000
♫  The days when I laughed and cried in your arms  ♫

474
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,180
♫  don't forget me.  ♫

475
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,550
♫  As you are.  As you are.  ♫

476
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,670
♫   Embrace me   ♫

477
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:18,170
♫  Both the hard days and sad days   ♫

478
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:24,660
♫   If we are togehter, we can withstand them.  ♫

479
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:31,400
♫   Don't worry now  ♫

480
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,580
♫   I will love you  ♫

481
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,150
♫  I will love you   ♫

482
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,940
Now that I think about it, when we first met Dong Sik,

483
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,710
we had him sitting in the back like this, too.

484
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:56,570
Back then was when we hit him with our car.

485
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,580
I know. We're sorry.

486
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,730
In my memory... that’s not true.

487
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,760
What?

488
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,100
Honestly, back then, I feel like I could have avoided getting hit,

489
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,850
but I might have just stood there intentionally

490
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:23,160
while the car was speeding toward me.

491
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,440
What did you say?

492
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:33,060
I didn't even have the courage to kill myself, so I saw that homeless man while coming back down.

493
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:39,980
There, too, since I thought of myself as being so pathetic that all I could do was run away

494
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,730
and thought, "I wish I could just disappear.”

495
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,620
Subconsciously, I think I had that thought during that moment.

496
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,120
Maybe that's also why you lost your memory?

497
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,630
Dong Sik, do you remember when we talked about our subconscious?

498
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:02,550
The illusion of my father that my subconscious made up was telling me all along

499
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:08,760
that I should live as someone I want to be, not how I am right now.

500
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,960
Your subconscious probably was like that, too.

501
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:19,700
To choose who you want to be rather than hate or throw yourself away.

502
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,430
Back then, that diary wasn't something you had wanted.

503
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:28,930
But in the end, you made a choice for yourself;

504
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,710
what kind of person you wanted to be.

505
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,390
It's tasty, I'm telling you.

506
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,820
It's on me.

507
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,600
Oh, thank you!

508
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,620
I'll take... Is the cafe latte good here?

509
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,780
- Yes, it is. 
 - I see.

510
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,030
I'll take an iced Americano then.

511
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:20,480
Stop drinking coffee every day with the excuse you're writing. Drink something that's good for you.

512
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,620
How about something like this?
  Honey-mong

513
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,970
Oh!

514
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,240
Then I'll take a cold one.

515
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,150
- Then two of these, one cold and one hot.
 - Yes.

516
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,510
- Then I'll go get seats for us. 
 - Okay.

517
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,620
Watch where you're going!

518
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,540
You're the one at fault!

519
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,920
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

520
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,000
Why are you so clumsy? Huh?

521
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,800
That time when...

522
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:59,380
We meet again here! Have you been well?

523
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,470
You must be on a date!

524
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,820
Wow, that lady from last time!

525
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,490
I guess you broke up. Sorry.

526
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,880
Cheer up! You're such a cool person!

527
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,300
Good-bye.

528
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,090
Cheer up! Fighting!

529
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:27,270
What are you so sorry about? You did nothing wrong.

530
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:30,110
Who cares who apologizes?

531
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,860
There's no point arguing and getting angry over it.

532
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,200
It's not like I'm going to kill him anyway.

533
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,940
It's good!

534
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,480
Maybe he's right.

535
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,710
Let go! Take your filthy hand off me!

536
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,000
These bastards. Do you know who I am?!

537
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,310
You really are too loud.

538
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,850
You insect-like bastards. I'm going to kill all of you.

539
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:23,010
I see. I guess that's why you got beat up for acting up and couldn't do anything?

540
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:27,610
If you want to stay alive here, know your place.

541
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,060
Hey, you bastard. What did you just say?

542
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,470
Come here. I said, come here!

543
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,220
 What a sight!

544
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:50,960
 Mr. Oh went back into prison?

545
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,570
He got caught while trying to pass on some cigarettes to a convict while outside.

546
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:58,640
He said he'd rather do time rather than pay a penalty.

547
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,850
That's what I heard.

548
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,380
He kept telling me he loved the food in there.

549
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,020
He really should get acclimated to society soon!

550
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:18,070
By the way, do you think Seo In Woo is self-reflecting at all?

551
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,240
Or having regrets at least?

552
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:28,640
Not sure. I don't think he will.

553
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:38,280
So you're that famous predator?

554
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,820
That's right. Now you're understanding me.

555
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,120
To be honest, I was waiting til the day I could meet you.

556
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,850
Me?

557
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,280
Why?

558
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,430
To beat you up.

559
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:01,080
During the fight earlier, the one who hit you with a shoe from behind

560
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,810
was me!

561
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,410
What?

562
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,100
I'm just kidding!

563
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,970
I heard a bit about you from a friend who used to occupy that room.

564
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:16,750
Who? No way, Yook Dong Sik?

565
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,200
Then this room is...

566
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,410
That's right! Now you're understanding me!

567
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,660
Do you want to get out of here, too?

568
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,720
Then try lifting that toilet bowl slightly.

569
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,330
- What? 
- It doesn't even budge, right?

570
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,890
That's your fate!

571
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:10,830
Locked up in there and dying while smelling crap all day.

572
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,610
 It was worth coming back in here!

573
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,380
It's going to be so much fun making fun of our Mr. Predator!

574
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,920
You shut up and listen!

575
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,540
 Whether you were a predator or not outside, from now on, you're just a feeble weakling in here.

576
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,070
Prey. Prey.

577
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,800
No.

578
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,130
Let me out!

579
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,270
Hurry up and open it!

580
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:09,730
He can't have gone back in to torment Seo In Woo?

581
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,110
What?

582
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:16,200
Nothing. Anyway, what's the new case about?

583
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,000
What? What do you mean?

584
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,810
When you're this nice to me, it means—

585
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:29,290
What? Am I someone who's only nice to you when I need something?

586
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,570
I even earnestly asked the director

587
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:35,700
and got you to consult on cases instead of doing community service!

588
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,840
Thanks to that, you also got material for the follow-up book. How well did it turn out?

589
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,410
Fine, so hurry up and tell me.

590
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,460
That is...

591
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:09,400

592
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,470
 Thank you to Channel Managers Joysprite and Cgwm808.

593
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:19,450

594
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,420

595
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,480

596
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:34,400

597
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,470

598
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,750

599
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,330
 Thank you to cover page designer: justine_desmoulins.

600
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,670
Bo Gyeong!

601
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:19,500
Here, suddenly, he stopped trying to kill the woman

602
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,820
and ran away.

603
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,050
Why did he do that?

604
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,810
Other victims had tattoos you said, right?

605
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,530
Yes. Except for this last victim.

606
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,870
The last victim probably had a tattoo, too.

607
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,830
Probably...

608
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,150
here.

609
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,490
How did you...

610
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:59,050
The moment he tried to confirm in this position that she had a tattoo on the back of the neck, he saw it had been removed.

611
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:04,610
When he found out that his seal was gone, his desire to kill probably disappeared.

612
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:11,540

613
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:17,530
According to my deduction, the culprit is a tattoo artist

614
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,700
who tattooed the victims.

615
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,620
Tattoo Killer.

616
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:33,780
Dong Sik, how do you know the mind of the criminal so well?

617
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:40,960
  Because I'm a... psychopath thriller writer.

618
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,010
Look here.

619
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,650
If you look, there are several questionable things.

620
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,540
If you look at the death certificate,

621
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,100
it only says that there's a sign of a laser procedure on the back of the neck.

622
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,510
I was wondering what that meant.

623
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,040
It aligns perfectly with that comment.

624
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,970
Wow, Dong Sik, should we do a high five?

625
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,940
♫  life doesn't flow like a script  ♫

626
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:04,060
♫  Today like yesterday  even if I have to find it  ♫

627
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,930
♫   want to live tomorrow differently than today  ♫

628
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,870
♫  Now different  ♫

629
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,460
This person made a mistake, so if you could properly deal with it,

630
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,110
it would be great, but—

631
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,090
I must be crazy! I'm sorry.

632
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,090
But you were...

633
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:19,810
What?

634
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,510
♫  I'm going to be re-born  ♫

635
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,240
♫  I just wanna be bad  ♫

636
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,270
Oh, why did you do that? Just one more time.

637
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,840
Why aren't we going fast?

638
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,080
Look at the road and say it!

639
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,060
Oh, right! Hurry up and drive!

640
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,060
- Hurry up! 
 - We went past it!

641
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,590
♫  I just wanna be bad  ♫

642
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,260
♫  I just wanna be ...  ♫

643
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,600
♫  In my forgotten heart  ♫

644
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,980
♫  the small burnt out embers  ♫

645
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:50,360
No way. Do you need more than that?

646
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,480
Sorry.

647
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,900
If it's urgent, let's take my car.

648
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:00,580
♫  I want to live tomorrow differently than today
  ♫

649
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,040
Stop! 
 ♫  I found myself  ♫

650
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,500
♫  Don't hesitate  ♫

651
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,780
Peekaboo! 
 ♫  You don’t have to be afraid  ♫

652
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,080
♫  Now it's going to be different.  ♫
