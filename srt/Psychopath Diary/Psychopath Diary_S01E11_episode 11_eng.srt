 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,550
Then, I'll leave.

5
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,430
Dong Sik. Don't get up.

6
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,550
- It's okay.
 - No.

7
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,310
- I said it's okay. I can go.
 - No.

8
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,110
Dong Sik. Really. It's okay.

9
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,500
Get some rest.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,870
I want to go to the bathroom.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,740
Oh my.  Sit up.  Be careful.

12
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,950
What the heck is all of this?

13
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,020
 He suddenly asked me for a large loan.

14
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,360
 He was so nervous. Maybe he’s been threatened or something.

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,810
  What is happening? I’ll help.

16
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,070
 Actually,  I was going to threaten the guy and get a large sum of money out of him.

17
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,330
What happened to the movies and posters?

18
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,310
Just ...  Now I don't want to look at them anymore.

19
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,030
What are you holding behind you?

20
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,910
Nothing.

21
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,490
What is it? What's there?

22
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,740
Dong Sik, what is it?

23
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,030
What is that?

24
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,010
Dong Sik!

25
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,830
The toilet is clogged, so ...

26
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,150
It could smell, so please go home.

27
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,590
Then, please rest.

28
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,930
 Episode 11

29
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,730
Mr. Chil Seong.

30
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,200
Hello, Officer Sim.

31
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,940
Wh-What are you doing here?

32
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,730
Ah, you c-c-came to see H-H-Hyungnim.

33
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,410
Yes,  I'm wondering if someone recently threatened Yook Dong Sik. I heard he was trying to get a big sum of money.

34
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,450
Didn't you hear anything?

35
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,490
I-I-I can't say.

36
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,530
Is that so?  Then, do you know anything about what he was doing last night?

37
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,180
I don't know.

38
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Have you ever head of someone named Park Moo Seok?

39
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,550
Wh-Who is that?

40
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,170
I've never heard of him. Did something happen to him?

41
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,390
He was killed. That man.

42
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,110
Well, I'm leaving.

43
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,180
Work hard.

44
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,450
Drive carefully.

45
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,340
Hyungnim  ...  he's so clumsy!

46
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,860
Nice.

47
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,310
This must be pretty expensive, obviously, right?

48
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,920
So ... what did you come to see me for?

49
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:15,400
Eight years ago in Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do, there was a murder of a high school girl.

50
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,160
I joined the investigation as a profiler.

51
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,870
We identified as the suspect, an ex-con who was acquainted with the victim.

52
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,460
Why are you talking about that now?

53
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,680
There was one witness who gave a statement.

54
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,500
He was in Gwangju accompanying his father in the purchase of Sijin Hospital.

55
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:37,100
The 28-year-old man, Seo In Woo, said he saw the suspect with the victim.

56
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,750
Well, even without your son's statement,  I was sure the suspect was the culprit.

57
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,860
However,  I was thinking of looking into the witness.

58
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,850
But, after you went to see the police commissioner,  the chief told me

59
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,040
to complete the investigation quickly.

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,760
I just thought it was the usual chaebol game.

61
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,470
At that time. But then ...

62
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,390
But then?

63
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,820
There's something you don't know about.

64
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:24,220
The real culprit then and in the recent predator murders case

65
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,750
may be the same person.

66
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:33,440
The guy recently even killed an ex-cop who was about to inform us about the identity of the predator.

67
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,590
It's only a matter of time before we will obtain his DNA or something else.

68
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,860
So, why are you telling me this?

69
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,420
I just thought you should know.

70
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,380
Thank you for the tea.

71
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,300
  Asset Management Team Director Seo In Woo.

72
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,500
 That I am a killer is a secret from Yook Dong Sik.

73
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,010
 You'll be able to keep your mouth shut forever this time, right?

74
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,410
 This way is a lot better.

75
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,870
Inspector Ryoo. 
   Forensics Investigator Police

76

 Psychopath Diary

77
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,240
Are you paying me back already?

78
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,500
Yes.  The interest—

79
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,780
What do you mean interest? Forget it.

80
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,840
Rather than that, did you do what I told you to do?

81
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,900
Instead of paying money, did you make sure you will never be blackmailed again?

82
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,740
Well... somehow, everything was settled nicely.

83
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,160
That's a relief. But why do you look so gloomy?

84
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,080
The problem has been resolved now, so you have to go back to work.

85
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,830
The good man, "Brave Citizen,"  Yook Dong Sik, who is on a roll, should return.

86
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,620
Here.

87
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,820
Bo Gyeong came looking for you, right?

88
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,780
Everyone's worried.

89
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,820
If you keep it up, they'll be even more worried.

90
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,720
Should I go there myself?

91
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,850
- No, I'll go. 
 - Wait.

92
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,660
D-Don't go. Since I'm his friend, I should—

93
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,440
The team leader is coming.

94
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,810
What is going on here?

95
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,320
What are you all doing right now?

96
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,520
All of you... your work.... your work!

97
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,740
How can you work right now?

98
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,130
We can't get in touch with Yook Dong Sik. We don't know if he's dead or alive,

99
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,350
yet you're all working right now? You can work?

100
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,650
I don't know how I work with such inhumane people.

101
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,960
There's no time to slack off just because you're excited that it's the end of the year.

102
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,620
You need to work as hard as you can til the end, okay?

103
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,070
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

104
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,990
You should learn to come in on time!

105
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,160
Or I'll just...

106
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,590
And pick up every once in a while.

107
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,330
Get back to work.

108
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,070
You want me to make you a cup of coffee? Your usual coffee-shop coffee you like.

109
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,970
Deal!

110
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,760
 Listen up.

111
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,050
 I was doing my business here, but he suddenly comes...

112
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,230
 and locks the door.

113
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,980
 Then, this! This thing!

114
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,420
 The toilet lid?

115
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,190
 Let go of me!

116
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,470
 Stop it!  Stop! Stop!

117
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,650
 Yesterday, this bastard dared to—

118
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,360
 What did you just say?

119
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,650
 That punk is a psycho.

120
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,490
 He's a murderer bastard.

121
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,350
Sunbae. Aren't you meeting with Dong Sik today?

122
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,170
You know,

123
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,780
in your eyes, what kind of person do you think Dong Sik is?

124
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,480
Sorry?

125
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:09,080
Well, he's obviously a good person in anyone's eyes.

126
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,150
Give it to me.

127
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,680
I'll do yours with mine.

128
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
You used to do stuff for us, too.

129
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,670
How many copies do you need?

130
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,670
Two each.

131
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,450
Yeah. Dong Sik is clearly a good person in anyone's eyes.

132
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,430
Say, that next year's market forecast report, I already have something organized for it,

133
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,950
- so why don't you use it as a reference?  
 - Oh. Yes.

134
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,180
Assistant Manager.  If you need to review stock performance,

135
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,300
would you like me to give you some pretty good information I've been looking at?

136
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,040
You worry about yourself!

137
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,180
I already made a portfolio for him as his friend!

138
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,070
What's wrong with everyone?

139
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,150
What?

140
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,170
Why are all of you being so good to me?

141
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,520
- Well... 
 - It's because you're a good guy. What's the problem?

142
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,350
As if it's out of the ordinary!

143
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,580
Tonight, all the drinks are on me!

144
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,690
Why? For Dong Sik!

145
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,320
- For Dong Sik! 
 - Yay!

146
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,160
Here, let's cheer for Dong Sik.

147
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,590
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

148
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,360
Why aren't you drinking?

149
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,850
- Take a drink. Take a drink. 
 - Take a drink. Take a drink.

150
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,880
- Take a drink. Take a drink. 
 - Take a drink. Take a drink.

151
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,460
- Take a drink. Take a drink. 
 - Take a drink.

152
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,590
Drink up, drink up.

153
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,680
 You're a really good person.

154
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,430
You're as warm-hearted as soup!

155
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:15,920
I am not as good of a person as you think I am.

156
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,690
That's the way social life is, isn't it?

157
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,820
When you're not doing well, you get disrespected as a pushover,

158
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,500
and you are taken advantage of, but when you do better,

159
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,850
they say you are a good guy, even though you haven't changed at all.

160
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,630
Right? Don't you all agree?

161
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,140
- That's not it— 
 - We know, we know.

162
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,180
You must feel betrayed. After receiving orders from my superiors, I also felt...

163
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,830
Well, I did a lot of bad things. It's maybe too late to say it now,

164
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,760
but Dong Sik, I'm sorry for the past.

165
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,150
Me, too, I stabbed you in the back while pretending to be your friend.

166
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,060
It's for the same for us as well.

167
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,100
While being in the same boat, we made you into our shield instead of fighting alongside you.

168
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,100
You were able to endure all this so well since it was you.

169
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,800
- Anyone else would've totally gone off. 
 - That's right.

170
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,090
From now on, you don't have to suffer alone.

171
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,030
That's right! You're forever the likeable person in our team, after all!

172
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,260
I'm not! I'm not a likeable person!

173
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,790
I'm not a good person!

174
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,170
People who are really nice people like you

175
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,310
usually say that they're not nice people.

176
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,240
No. I'm really not!

177
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,280
You're a good person.

178
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,870
Yeah, you are.

179
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,550
- I'm not! 
 - Fine, you're not!

180
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,260
- I'm not! 
 - If it makes you happy, you're not a nice person.

181
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,050
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

182
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,990
I'm not!

183
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,750
I wanted to take you out for something tastier.

184
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,910
I'm sorry. I don't have much of an appetite, anyway.

185
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,820
Oh, right. Did Dong Sik tell you he paid me back?

186
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,290
- Really? 
 - Yes.

187
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,020
He didn't seem to need it anymore. That must be a good thing, right?

188
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,050
Is something bothering you?

189
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,880
Um, In Woo,

190
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,420
if you know a person you really really trusted,

191
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,420
but starting on a random day,

192
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,390
you start to seriously suspect him,

193
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,460
what would you do?

194
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,550
There's no need to make it complicated.

195
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,730
I would suspect and investigate him as much as I'd trusted him.

196
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,430
If my suspicions are true, it will be a relief that I figured out sooner than later that he can't be trusted.

197
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,300
If my suspicions are wrong, it's a relief that I cleared my misunderstanding.

198
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,040
Don't you think so, too?

199
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,170
That's probably...

200
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,310
correct, right?

201
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,670
Don't cry like a fool!

202
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,730
You crazy psychopath murderer!

203
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,460
 Still,

204
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,790
  people look at me

205
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,110
 and call me a good person.

206
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,990
Can't you just live as if you're a good person?

207
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,500
You killed someone.

208
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,520
You can just stop killing from now on.

209
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,890
And if you're careful of Officer Sim, the police shouldn't find out, either.

210
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,960
Don't you even feel sorry toward Bo Gyeong?

211
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,200
How could you live the rest of your life fooling people?

212
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,230
 You were fine up until now.

213
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,460
 What's changed?

214
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,640
Stop!

215
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,370
I'm going to turn myself in.

216
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm going to go to the police on my own two feet

217
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,360
and tell them exactly what I did.

218
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,750
I'm going to tell them everything.

219
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,390
Have the results come out, yet?

220
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,630
Yeah. Other than the DNA of the victim, Park Moo Seok,

221
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,830
we obtained DNA from his hair, blood, etc. of an unidentified person we assume to be the suspect.

222
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,820
Have you cross-checked it with the criminal database?

223
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,690
For starters, we think we can rule out ex-cons.

224
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,000
There were no CCTVs and we have no suspects to check against, so we're not sure where to start.

225
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,990
Then, it means if we have a suspect, we just have to cross-check the DNA.

226
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,190
Is there anyone you suspect?

227
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,830
No, not yet.

228
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,970
 Police

229
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,850
When you go out on a sobriety checkpoint, be sure to use the hot packs.

230
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,750
Otherwise, you will catch a cold.

231
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,070
Dong Sik!

232
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,520
How did the brave citizen come to visit our patrol division?

233
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,800
- Sunbae Sim is working outside the office right now. 
 - Ah!

234
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,880
She's working outside the office. Haven't you tried contacting her?

235
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,600
I guess you didn't.

236
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,430
To be honest...

237
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,370
I have something to tell you.

238
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,560
I...

239
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,170
I am indeed the...

240
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,870
pr-pr-preda—

241
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,900
The delivery man is here!

242
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,250
- Here. 
 - Hey, be sure to check that we got jjamppong broth, too!

243
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,800
Hey! I am the pred— I am indeed the—

244
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,910
Okay, Dong Sik. First, let's eat.  We can talk and eat.

245
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,240
- I am— 
 - Have a seat.

246
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
- I am— Listen to me. 
  - The food is here.

247
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,150
No, I am—

248
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,700
Goodness, Dong Sik. We ordered enough to share since we ordered plenty!

249
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,070
- Taek Soo... 
 - Huh?

250
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,940
I, at this place, confess—

251
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,420
Confess? Confession! (about love) Yay! You wrote it down here! Okay, okay.

252
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,790
- This is the confession! 
 - Okay, okay.

253
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,620
You're going to become the family of the police now!

254
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,080
- Chief, I am— 
 -  But,

255
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,020
This is... It's okay. Love is—

256
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,200
- I...!  
 - There, eat! Eat!

257
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,070
Officer Cha just happens to be on a diet, so eat all that you want.

258
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,400
Are you on a diet? Don't eat then.

259
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,190
♫ If you stir it with your right hand, if you stir it with your left

260
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,320
Dong Sik, while saying you weren't going to eat, you ate the most!

261
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,840
But, what is all this...

262
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,600
You came just in time. Dong Sik said he needed to tell you something, so he's been waiting for a while!

263
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,420
Since we ate, let's get back to work.

264
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,490
Alright.

265
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,050
You two, go ahead and talk. Good luck!

266
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,330
I should get rid of all this.

267
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,780
You're not the one who ate, so why would you?

268
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,050
- Patrolman Cha! 
 - Yes!

269
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,250
- Let me help. 
-  Come quickly.  Clear it away, clear it.

270
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,720
One, two, one, two.

271
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,300
What is it? That you want to tell me?

272
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,350
The thing is... so...

273
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,550
Gosh, what an idiot.

274
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,250
What are you doing? Why aren't you following him? Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Hurry.

275
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,670
- What's the matter? 
 - Didn't you say you had something to tell me?

276
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,420
That is... I forgot.

277
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,240
Do you want to eat with me?

278
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,220
What?  I just ate.

279
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,140
Eat again.  With me.

280
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,770
Go, go, go.

281
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,150
- Why aren't you eating? 
 - Maybe, since it hasn't been long since I last ate,

282
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,450
- I'm not really hungry. 
  - Even so, eat...

283
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:05,050
You've gone though a lot of hardship helping me all of this time, so it's my treat.

284
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,300
What hardship?

285
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:15,570
 Dong Sik, tell her. Tell  Bo Gyeong everything.

286
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,230
  Right. For the sake of trusting him, I'm just checking.

287
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,830
 So I can get all of these foolish thoughts out of my head.

288
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,120
- Open up. 
 - What?

289
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,740
Since you're not eating anything. Here, say, "Ahh."

290
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,270
I'll eat it myself.

291
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,820
Don't be so uncomfortable with me. Here.

292
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sorry.

293
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,380
The atmosphere is heating up.

294
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,980
It sure is.  Don't they look exactly like us in the old days?

295
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,460
But, she is being assertive,

296
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,030
so why is our Dong Sik being so coy?

297
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,570
He might seem that way, but he's raising a beast inside his heart.

298
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,610
Just wait and see. If he just has a couple of drinks...

299
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,150
- Bam! 
 - Nice.

300
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,140
I'm sorry, but today, the business—

301
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,260
It's you, right? The one who caused a ruckus in our restaurant?

302
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,780
What do you mean a ruckus? I'm sorry about that time.

303
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,920
But I think my hyungnim is in there.

304
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,070
Why would your hyungnim be here?!

305
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,540
I don't know what other violence you're thinking of committing, but now is not the time. Beat it.

306
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,620
- But, over there ... 
 - I said to go! What's with the "over there"?

307
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,350
- Just once. 
 - I said you can't now.

308
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,100
- Father! Just one! 
 - What "Father"?

309
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,570
You know, Bo Gyeong...

310
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,340
Actually, I—

311
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,650
- Gosh, Dong Sik, you have a gray hair! 
 - A gray hair?  All of a sudden?

312
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,340
- I'll pluck it out for you. 
 - No.  It's okay.

313
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,850
I said I would pluck it for you. You can't pull it out by yourself.

314
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,080
You know, I—

315
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,500
- No. I'll pluck it for you. 
 - It's that, I—

316
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,720
Dong Sik, the gray hair!

317
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,540
Oh my! Hyungnim! What are you two doing? Oh, this is just too much!

318
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,850
Not at all, Dong Sik. I'll take care of this guy, so don't worry and continue what you were doing.

319
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,130
Yes. Continue, Hyungnim.

320
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,950
- "Hyungnim"? 
 - Yes, Father.

321
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,150
Who says I am your father?

322
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,750
What brings you here?

323
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,780
While I was just passing by here,

324
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,710
I wondered if you're here, so I stopped by for a little while.

325
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,360
Anyhow, I don't know if I tactlessly butted in

326
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,900
when you two are in a "some" relationship.  (Having feelings for each other but not yet in a dating relationship.)

327
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,700
- What?! 
 - What?!

328
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,950
What? What's with this response? Why is your face turning so red?

329
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,730
What, huh? Did you get caught doing something bad?

330
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,270
What are you talking about?

331
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,330
Right.  Jeez.

332
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm going to the restroom for a second.

333
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,300
Why?

334
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,250
You don't have to leave.  Why, all of sudden?

335
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,090
Hyungnim. Starting now, you need to listen carefully to what I'm saying.

336
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,510
Now what?

337
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,450
Did you... take care of Park Moo Seok?

338
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,410
What are you talking about?

339
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,050
You know that I said I wouldn't ask nor argue about whatever you do, right?

340
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,030
There must have been a good reason for everything.

341
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,510
Since you're my Hyungnim that I tend to, and you're a chivalrous fighter.

342
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,880
Anyway, whatever. Right now, that's not what's important.

343
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,580
Officer Sim... suspects you.

344
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,740
What do you mean?

345
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,660
The thing is, whether you were being threatened,

346
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,360
and what you were you doing the day before, she was prying and asking such things inquisitively!

347
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:29,700
Well, no, because since she couldn't contact me and I hadn't gone into work,

348
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,410
that's probably why she did that.

349
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,850
Just now, she tried to pluck your hair, right? She's trying to obtain your DNA.

350
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,700
Ah, no way!

351
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,570
It's also Corporal Sim who first coaxed you into having a meal, right? Hah!

352
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,960
I didn't think she was like that, but she's a sly fox!

353
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,570
I'm telling you that's not it!

354
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,460
It's because you didn't hear it earlier,

355
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,550
but Corporal Sim isn't suspecting me, not even in her dreams.

356
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,490
She says she's thankful toward me.

357
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,080
I see. Hyungnim? Did you drink?

358
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,530
Get to your senses! Wake up!

359
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,360
- It's delicious. 
 - Yes, this is delicious.

360
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,840
Dong Sik, it's been a while since we ate like this, so should we make a toast?

361
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,090
Oh, yes. Yes.

362
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,030
I quit drinking, but today I suddenly crave alcohol.

363
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,700
I didn't realize there were only two glasses.

364
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,040
Why do people drink? Really.

365
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,440
Shall we make a toast all together?

366
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,490
Cheers!

367
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,640
Let's go now.

368
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,350
Yes.

369
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:54,170
Shall we? Then Corporal Sim, you go first.

370
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,860
- Why? 
 - About what?

371
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,680
Why are you like this? Are you really drunk?

372
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,770
What drunk, I only drank two glasses!

373
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,550
Let go of this!

374
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,670
I have something to talk about with Bo Gyeong, so please step out for a bit.

375
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,100
- Hyungnim. 
 - I'm telling you to step out!

376
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,560
Go.

377
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,050
I'm sorry.

378
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,490
No, it's not like you did it on purpose.

379
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,740
There is something I would like to ask you.

380
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,100
Do you, um...

381
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:19,010
Do you really think I am a good person?

382
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:27,150
I would like it if you were.

383
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,160
Sincerely.

384
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,310
Understood.

413

Come in!

414
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,720
Did the results come out?

415
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,170
It doesn't match.

416
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,260
Right?

417
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,730
But what is the connection between Jang Chil Seong and this case?

418
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,910
- I saw he's an ex-convict. 
 - Sorry?

419
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,650
The database verified it. Isn't it Jang Chil Seong's DNA?

420
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,840
I saved you, Hyungnim.

421
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,450
When you held me like this,

422
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,470
I said, "Let go of this!"

423
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:02,170
While I did that, I exchanged your glass with mine!

424
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,920
Should I become an actor?

425
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,230
You didn't need to do that.

426
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,240
Since Bo Gyeong's always thought of me as a good person.

427
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,440
So, what? You emptied your apartment, and now you're planning on making a night escape. Is that it?

428
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,300
Since she believes in me that much,

429
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,480
I wanted to stay as a good person until the end.

430
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,920
Others might not know,

431
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,240
but I do.

432
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,940
You are indeed a good person, Hyungnim.

433
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,510
Right. With no one knowing my real self,

434
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,340
I wish everyone would believe me to be that way.

435
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,950
So, where do you plan on going?

436
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,110
I don't know.

437
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,550
For now, I plan on just disappearing.

438
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,390
I will take care of the things you entrusted me with

439
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,290
and will keep watch on the police.

440
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,600
But at least contact me later.

441
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,700
I'm sorry for calling you here on your day off.

442
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,130
It is alright.

443
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,940
May I ask why you asked to see me alone?

444
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,510
Did In Woo ever meet someone called Park Moo Seok?

445
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,420
If it is difficult for you to answer, you do not have to.

446
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,890
My apologies.

447
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,540
Money was recently moved from the bank account that In Woo handles personally, right?

448
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,380
Was it around one billion  (≈ $860,000) ?

449
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,370
Yes.

450
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,990
If In Woo asks later what we talked about when we met,

451
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,400
just tell him that I know everything.

452
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,340
There's no use in playing games, it'll just make each of us tired.

453
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,180
I understand.

454
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,170
Alright. You can go.

455
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,350
Sim Bo Gyeong!

456
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,740
So you compared the DNA?

457
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,480
It was negative.

458
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,140
What happened? Don't tell me you still don't trust me?

459
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,180
That's not it. I told you I would tell you once I get hold of clear evidence, but—

460
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,840
So who is it? Who is the one you're suspecting?

461
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,770
So it's someone you know, I see.

462
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:55,460
He was connected to all cases from the beginning. So I collected his DNA without him knowing,

463
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,540
but it had been changed to someone else's.

464
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,450
So you're saying that he sensed you were suspecting him and switched it?

465
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,230
I shouldn't have wavered in the first place.

466
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,970
What?

467
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,140
Hey, Sim Bo Gyeong!

468
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,760
 The person you are trying to reach cannot—

469
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,410
Dong Sik! Open the door please!

470
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,320
If you're home, please open the door!

471
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,440
Yook Dong Sik! If you're here, come out and explain yourself!

472
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,140
No way. No way! Did he run away?

473
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,250
 Mr. Yook Meat Republic

474
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,530
I don't know.

475
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,470
Right? It's really unexpected.

476
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,570
This is really delicious, isn't it?

477
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,730
Aah, eat a lot, President.

478
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,680
I am.

479
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,050
 In my diary, I wrote about my family like this:

480
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,060
 The sister who enjoys meddling while pretending to care for me.

481
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,670
 The brother-in-law who is cunning and only has eyes for profit.

482
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,930
What are you doing in front of the meal? Eat up, come on!

483
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,620
Eat a lot, Brother-in-law!

484
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,420
Your sister prepared it very thoughtfully because she said you became gaunt.

485
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,490
But Hyung, it's Christmas. Don't you have a date?

486
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:55,950
 The stepbrother who looks like if you peeled his skull, you'd find udon noodles instead of a brain.

487
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:00,370
What? I'm saying that because I'm happy you're here.

488
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,510
A man shouldn't be disheartened by that kind of thing.

489
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:11,690
Don't fill your stomach with japchae, eat some meat.

490
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,440
Ah President, it's too big!

491
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,580
 The patriarchal father who is being called President.

492
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,200
 And the step mother with whom I have mutual indifference.

493
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,020
Eat.

494
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,560
He has to eat this much to be considered a man of the Yook family!

495
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,970
Chew well, or you'll get indigestion.

496
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,150
 How come I only saw things in such a crooked way?

497
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:47,430
 At least if they were that kind of people, would I have been more at ease?

498
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,510
You're not uncomfortable, are you?

499
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,760
We gathered like this for a meal at Christmas every year.

500
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,740
I wonder when your memories will come back.

501
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:02,820
Well, so what if his memories don't come back?

502
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,420
He can just make good memories seeing us often from now on!

503
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,010
Isn't it so?

504
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,890
You're right.

505
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,380
You're crying?

506
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:33,060
Yeah. Why did you have to talk about that amnesia?

507
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,100
It's nothing.

508
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,400
It's nothing, just ... Just ...

509
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,050
Right, it must be frustrating.

510
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

511
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,630
Eat.

512
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,700
If I'm not here, you're the eldest son. You know, right?

513
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,500
Hyung, are you going somewhere?

514
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,630
Business trip?

515
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,420
Uh... yeah.

516
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,880
You really became successful! Bring me a gift when you come back.

517
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,370
Yeah. Okay.

518
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,480
Weren't we having a meal all together today? Did the others not arrive yet?

519
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,330
What is this?

520
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,510
It's the result of the comparison between the DNA from Park Moo Seok's murder scene

521
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,730
and your DNA.

522
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,610
Do you think I killed Park Moo Seok?

523
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,050
The issue is that you didn't kill only Park Moo Seok.

524
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,980
There are many enemies inside the company.

525
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,250
I needed someone to do some things secretly, so I only used him a couple of times.

526
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,980
Are you saying that guy found out about your true identity

527
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,740
and threatened you or something?

528
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,610
I knew you didn't trust me yet,

529
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,040
but I had no idea you were this suspicious of me.

530
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,610
I'll ask you before you reveal it.

531
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,470
Is it you?

532
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,450
Take a look.

533
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,270
  DNA Test
 The results of this test show that sample 1 and sample 2

534
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:36,170
   do not match each other in the tested STR gene coordinates.

535
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:48,970
Until when do I have to receive suspicion and provide evidence to disprove it?

536
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,620
The family meal seems to be canceled, so I'll get going.

537
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,440
By the way... have a Merry Christmas.

538
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,970
That serpent-like old man.

539
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,990
How much does he know?

540
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,570
  Corporal Sim

541
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,210
 Director Seo In Woo

542
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,890
Yes, Director.

543
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,170
What is it about?

544
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,650
Yes.

545
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:02,310
It's Christmas. Shouldn't you be having a party somewhere nice?

546
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:09,730
It's just... I seem to become lonelier when I'm surrounded by people.

547
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:14,750
And I was curious about what happened with your concerns.

548
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,270
Actually ...

549
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,960
I have something to tell you.

550
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:27,670
I think... I'll have to quit my job.

551
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,730
Su... Suddenly?

552
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,870
Yes. I'm sorry.

553
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,050
Why?

554
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,320
I feel like I've only just worked all this time,

555
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,580
so while taking a break, I want to go traveling,

556
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:51,600
and want to get my thoughts together as to how best to live.

557
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,800
Then why not just take time off?

558
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,370
You want to leave for good? Today? Right away?

559
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,780
I'm thinking to do that.

560
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,250
- I'm sorry. 
 - I see.

561
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,560
Well, no. I'm sure you have your reasons.

562
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,370
But, is that all of your belongings?

563
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,860
Yes.

564
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:20,680
Well, what you really need in life should all fit in that small bag.

565
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,360
But seeing how everyone tries so hard to live while trying to carrying so much load...

566
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,360
it also makes me want to leave everything behind and leave like you.

567
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,460
I haven't left everything behind yet.

568
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,450
Some things ...

569
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,550
are just so very dirty and evil

570
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:57,530
that I'm going to go to a place where there's no one around and burn them all up.

571
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,890
So no one will see.

572
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,050
Someone like you has secrets like that, too?

573
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:11,740
I... am actually a really bad guy.

574
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,940
You are?

575
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,940
Bad how?

576
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:27,530
Even if I tell you, someone like you probably wouldn't be able to understand.

577
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,970
Someone like me?

578
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,110
A good person.

579
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:41,180
You told me once that we have a lot of common traits.

580
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,000
No. We're complete opposites.

581
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,890
I'm... really a trash-like punk.

582
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,350
On the outside, I act like I'm nice and such a good person,

583
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:00,540
but my family and co-workers around me,

584
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,070
I look down on them like they're insects,

585
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:07,750
and inside, all I think about is how I'm going to step on them.

586
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,620
How can a human being be like this?

587
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,650
Is it from growing up without receiving any love?

588
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:19,780
Could it be because my father always told me I was weak

589
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,160
and told me off, telling me to become strong?

590
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,340
No way.

591
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,690
I only... chose that way of life.

592
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,760
Even now, too, for what I've done,

593
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,360
I don't want to take responsibility. That's why I'm trying to run away.

594
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,140
If my deceased mother saw me now,

595
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,890
I wonder what she would say.

596
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,920
Dong Sik.

597
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:07,950
I like everything about you, except you talk too much.

598
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,490
Pardon?

599
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,140
Why do you uselessly blabber?

600
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,590
It makes me want to kill you.

601
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,390
 This bastard!

602
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,820
 You know Yook Dong Sik is a pushover.

603
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,610
 This bastard! Try that once more!

604
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,410
 Please, let's use words.

605
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,230
 Dong Sik.

606
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:57,520
 Dong Sik! Dong Sik!

607
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,670
I'm sorry. I fell asleep for a second.

608
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:17,470
You blanked out, right?

609
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,210
Yes. After a few drinks...

610
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,680
Did I make any mistakes?

611
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,680
It seemed like you were dreaming about something.

612
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,150
- I guess you were very tired. 
 - Yes.

613
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,010
I'll get going now.

614
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,270
Okay.

615
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,930
You know that I'm always cheering you on, right?

616
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,800
Call me anytime you come back.

617
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:58,590
For everything... thank you.

618
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:35,620
Wait! Please rewind it.

619
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,570
Here. This person.

620
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:44,180
Taxi... the license number is...

621
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,410
Just a moment.

622
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,830
 In Woo

623
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,870
- Yes. 
 - Yes, Bo Gyeong.

624
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,240
I just met with Dong Sik. What happened?

625
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,090
Pardon? You met with Yook Dong Sik?

626
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,740
He said he's quitting his job suddenly.

627
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,830
So... So where is he right now?

628
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:09,080
 We said good-bye a moment ago. It seems like he's going somewhere far.

629
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,310
But, he left something behind.

630
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,450
What is it?

631
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,210
It looks like a diary, but I haven't opened it.

632
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,530
A diary?

633
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:30,040
 - This diary looks like it's yours. It must have been left in the car. 
 - Huh?

634
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,760
 What is it? Is something interesting written inside?

635
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,190
 This is...

636
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:37,790
 The writing is weird. Looks like it's backward.

637
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,600
 April 24th.

638
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,710
No way... the blood thumbprints were kept there?

639
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,300
Pardon?

640
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:53,020
It's nothing. You're telling me he can't be contacted right now, right?

641
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,940
Yes. His phone is off, so I was going to drop it off at the restaurant.

642
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,310
Where are you?

643
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:10,710
 Earlier... why did I have that kind of a nightmare?

644
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,040
 Dong Sik, have you lost anything?

645
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,080
 The bar called and said they would hold onto your lost item.

646
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,960
J-J-Just a second!

647
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,020
Since it's your request, Director, I'm allowing it specially.

648
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,860
You know we don't normally rent out our space, right?

649
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,460
What good is it having a regular customer? I've spent so much money here.

650
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,010
I don't know who she is, but she must be happy.

651
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,950
- Just introduce me to her later.
 - Yes.

652
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:06,050
 You fool. If someone sees the diary,

653
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,150
 there's only one way.

654
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:10,520
Taxi! Taxi!

655
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,550
 Bo Gyeong, do you really think I am a good person?

656
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,150
 I would like it if you were.

657
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,330
 Sincerely.

658
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:17,520
 Psychopath Diary

659
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:26,810

660
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:33,510
 Yook Dong Sik, I'm arresting you as a suspect in the predator serial murder case!

661
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:38,470
 That pushover bastard, he became a serial killer without having killed a single person.

662
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:42,260
 So this is the suicide note Dong Sik wrote in his own handwriting?

663
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,390
 It must mean that the identity

664
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:48,000
 of the predator will never be revealed as long as I keep my mouth shut.

665
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,770
 Do you know who it is?

666
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,370
 Who is the real culprit?!

667
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:58,210
 The diary owner is someone else?
