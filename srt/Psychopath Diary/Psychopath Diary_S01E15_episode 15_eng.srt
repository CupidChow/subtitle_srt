 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,910
Let's hand him over to the police. If not, let's just kill him!

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,580
You can cover this up, right?

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,250
Really? You think you can kill me?

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,730
This bastard showing off just because he's killed a few people?

8
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,350
Hey. Do you think I can't do whatever the likes of you can?

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,890
Did you load it?

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,100
Don't do it. Hyung, don't do it!

11
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,550
You even begged Yook Dong Sik to spare your life.

12
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,090
How dare you point a gun at me?

13
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,150
In Woo...

14
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,720
I... I'm sorry.

 Evil Nightmare

16
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,220
What are you doing now?

17
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,830
Please let Ji Hoon live.

18
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,380
Then I'll give you everything you want.

19
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,510
What is it that I want?

20
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,710
Daehan Securities, subsidiaries, real estate, and slush fund, everything.

21
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,250
All this time, what did you tell me I had to do in order to get what I want?

22
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,560
You told me I have to be stronger than everyone else,

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,540
that I should be able to step on anyone.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,960
But because of a weak bastard like him, you want to hand everything to me?

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,170
That's right. Take everything.

26
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,200
Have whatever you want, and I won't bother with anything you choose to do,

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,060
so please... just let Ji Hoon...

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
 Evil Nightmare

29
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,090
Where did you hide Yook Dong Sik?

30
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,420
Do you have anything you want to say to me?

31
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,390
P-Please spare me, Hyung. I'll do whatever you ask.

32
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,820
Really?

33
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,420
Then let's see how well you do.

34
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,270
 Evil Nightmare

35
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,780
You seem nervous, so drink this first.

 Episode 15

38
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,980
I mean, why would he have come to a mountainous area?

39
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,200
No way! To bury him?

40
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,840
I heard President Seo has a vacation home nearby.

41
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,650
What about President Seo?

42
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,350
Anyway, Seo In Woo probably came this way, so we have to find Dong Sik quickly.

43
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,330
Seriously... Where could he be?

44
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,770
Oh! Hyungnim! Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

45
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,120
Hurry, hurry!

46
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,880
What happened?

47
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,590
That's... What happened was...

48
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,360
Seo In Woo...

49
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,350
killed President Seo.

50
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,600
He sh-shot him? With a gun?

51
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,430
How could he? To his father? He finally did something more horrendous!

52
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,300
Sergeant, before it's too late, before he gets rid of all the evidence,

53
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,250
you should ask for back up.

54
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,070
Knowing him, he probably reported it himself.

55
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,820
What?

56
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah.

57
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,970
What? Seo In Woo reported an incident?

58
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,780
Oh!

59
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,370
Yook Dong Sik killed President Seo?

60
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,760
But all is not without hope.

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,620
Seo In Woo didn't know I took a video.

62
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,590
If he didn't discover it, it should still be there.

63
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,290
It's all recorded on it?

64
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,210
The part where he admits to being a predator and—

65
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,370
Including killing his father himself.

66
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,210
Oh yeah! Once we find that, it's game over!

67
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,820
What's the title of the book where the camera's hidden in?

68
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,890
Evil Nightmare.

69
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,010
So, Yook Dong Sik ran away with it?

70
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,050
The gun that he shot your father with.

71
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,490
I think he's in too much of a shock.

72
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,880
I'll tell you instead. When I got here too late, the guards were already dead.

73
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,490
When I ran in here, it was after Father had already been killed by Yook Dong Sik.

74
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,220
Right?

75
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,750
In Woo, you arrived last then?

76
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,670
Sergeant Sim, why are you here?

77
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,090
I happened to be nearby, so I thought I might be of some help.

78
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,590
As you all know, I was kidnapped by Yook Dong Sik,

79
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,120
and I came here right after a narrow escape.

80
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,410
I couldn't withstand his threats, so I told him Ji Hoon was at the vacation home.

81
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,540
I think he wanted to get revenge on the family of Daehan Securities.

82
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,090
Why didn't you report it first?

83
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,140
I did. Right before I got kidnapped by Yook Dong Sik.

84
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,780
Had the police responded a little quicker, the tragedy could have been avoided.

85
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,540
- Excuse me— 
 - What's wrong? Are you okay?

86
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,020
I think he's not in good shape. We should get him to the hospital first.

87
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,800
We're done for now. Escort him, please.

88
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,120
 Evil Nightmare

89
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,390
 Evil Nightmare?

90
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,780
 The escapee serial murderer, Yook Dong Sik, committed another murder.

91
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,650
 The victim is President Seo Choong Hyeon of Daehan Securities,

92
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,840
 who was found murdered at his vacation home last night.

93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,150
 According to police, Mr. Yook held a grudge against Daehan Securities while he was an employee there

94
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,310
 and was about to murder Director Seo Ji Hoon, the youngest son of President Seo,

95
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,720
 but was unable to do so.

96
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
 As soon as the investigation of the crime scene is completed, President Seo's funeral will be held,

97
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,980
 and Daehan Securities will hold an emergency board meeting and appoint Director Seo In Woo, the eldest son of President Seo.

98
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,860
The president always told us.

99
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,880
No matter what kind of ordeal comes your way, accept it as a challenge.

100
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,850
But don't try to withstand it, fight against it.

101
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,520
His death was a shock to us all

102
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,670
and gives us so much grief, but like my father said, we can't just continue to be sad.

103
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,840
Daehan Securities, which he spent his whole life cultivating,

104
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,300
the two of us will take care of it from now on.

105
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,020
To help my older brother

106
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,030
in the new step forward that Daehan Securities is taking,

107
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,070
I will give my all.

108
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,350
Good job.

109
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,620
Until Yook Dong Sik is caught, cooperate.

110
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,770
Then I'll let you live comfortably.

111
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,550
 Daehan Securities, Eldest Son Seo In Woo Succeeds to Leadership Role

112
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,770
Did you find the camera?

113
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,170
Oh yeah! That's it?

114
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,660
- It's not there. 
 - What?

115
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,310
When Bo Gyeong found it, the memory card was already gone.

116
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,930
I'm sure Seo Ji Hoon has it. That's probably why he gave me the clue.

117
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,060
We have to make contact with Seo Ji Hoon no matter what.

118
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,210
How will you do that when Seo In Woo is always around?

119
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,860
There are people who can help.

120
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,630
Happy, happy, we'll always be with you. Daehan Securities' Asset Management Team's Manager Park Jae Ho—

121
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,190
Dong Sik? Hey!

122
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,410
You! Where are you? Yeah.

123
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,090
Did he get a call from Sunbae Dong Sik?

124
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,450
Right? That's what you heard, too, right?

125
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,820
So Manager Park

126
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,970
seems to be trying to help Yook Dong Sik after a call came in from him?

127
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,320
He's not that type of person.

128
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,430
- Maybe he's being threatened? 
- What?

129
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,300
Let's go and see.

130
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,260
Hey, do you know you look more suspicious than me?

131
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
It's r-really Yook Dong Sik!

132
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,530
Is he stabbing him now with a knife?

133
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,460
What? No way.  They must just be hugging.

134
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,670
This punk.

135
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,480
Look at him! His face is distorted!

136
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,760
Let me look at your face.  Oh! You look so thin!

137
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,140
That stare while looking at the face of his friend who is about to kill him!

138
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,820
You're the one who's become thin!

139
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,600
You must have been so worried because of me all this time.

140
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,370
That strange arm, too!

141
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,970
Hey! Enough! They just seem to be happy to see each other!

142
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,440
Be quiet!

143
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,820
I don't think he's trying to kill him.

144
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,010
He's a psycho for a reason. We've been fooled so many times.

145
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,260
- You're going to report him? 
 - Stop, wait a minute!

146
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,970
Lower your voices! He'll hear us.

147
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,610
Right?

148
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,770
Oh!

149
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,990
Who are you? Why do you look like that?

150
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,030
Hello.

151
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,910
- I'm Jang Chil Seong of the Yook line, who takes care of my hyungnim, Yook Dong Sik. 
 - Yook line?!

152
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,550
Like attracts like!

153
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,110
Then what about me?

154
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,550
They got scared!

155
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,870
I mean, what kind of ridiculous thing are you saying?

156
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,200
S-So, Yook Dong Sik is a witness,

157
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,440
but he was delusional because of his memory loss, and the real culprit is Director Seo In Woo?

158
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,740
It must be hard for everyone to believe it, but it means the guy is that meticulous.

159
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,730
So if we're to catch him,

160
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,890
we need your help.

161
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,270
Hey,

162
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,860
don't be scared.

163
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,840
Now.

164
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,710
Our goal is getting evidence from Witness Seo Ji Hoon.

165
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,890
At this moment,

166
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,090
in this place,

167
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,260
we've gotten on the same boat. We have to help Yook Dong Sik and get justice.

168
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,390
And in order to save Daehan Securities, which has fallen into the murderer's hands,

169
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,920
- we're going to do our best, got it? 
 - Yes! 
 - Be quiet!

170
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,220
Now,

171
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,720
unity!

172
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,550
Director.

173
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,110
Hello.

174
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,690
Goodbye.

175
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,720
What are you doing?

176
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,410
Documents that need to be signed off on.

177
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,800
You can leave that here.

178
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,340
Here you go.

179
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,360
I can't believe it, seriously.

180
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,980
It's not possible to approach him.

181
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,540
He accompanies him whenever he comes to and leaves work.

182
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,720
He even goes to the bathroom with him!

183
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,540
Any phone calls or reports go through the secretary's office and get connected to Director Seo In Woo.

184
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,320
He's basically locked up in the director's office, but even the guards are—

185
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,990
You could say there's really no way.

186
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,910
Seriously...

187
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,530
it's not a company but prison!

188
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,020
Is there really no way to keep them apart?

189
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,670
There is one way.

190
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,470
It's to summon him to the police station.

191
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,720
With the excuse that we're doing a follow-up investigation of President Seo's murder.

192
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,230
Why would a murderer let him go freely?

193
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,620
But he'll come himself, right?

194
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,940
He wouldn't want you to meet with Seo Ji Hoon.

195
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,430
We should be able to keep them apart at least.

196
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,110
It's so frustrating. Do you think that's possible?

197
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
The conclusion probably drawn is that President Seo's case was Hyungnim's doing.

198
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
We have to make it happen.

199
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,360
Knowing him, he would have started it like this.

200
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,990
The hunt.

201
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,100
 Blind: The Mystery of President Seo's Unresolved Murder

202
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,850
 Section Chief Kim, have you seen this?

203
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,570
 Daebak, have you seen what's written on the Blind?

204
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,680
 I knew it. Something's fishy.

205
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,410
 Wow, I'm getting chills. It's a totally big incident!

206
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,440
 Section Chief Kim, I asked if you've seen it!

207
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,410
 Section Chief Park, you have to see it!

208
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,230
 Yook Dong Sik didn't kidnap Director Seo,

209
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,000
 but Yook Dong Sik made a deal with Director Seo?

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,520
 Now that I think about it, the Yuseong Biomedi matter too ...

211
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,190
What is this?

212
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,020
They're today's articles related to President Seo's case.

213
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,250
 There's another fact about the murder?

214
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,400
 Rumors spreading in the stock market.

215
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,350
And?

216
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,090
I think we need to do a follow-up investigation of Witnesses Seo In Woo and Seo Ji Hoon.

217
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,420
Because of articles like these?

218
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,890
Even if we summon them as witnesses,

219
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,560
if they don't turn up, we can't do anything since they're not the victims.

220
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,410
With respect to Seo In Woo for this case,

221
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,100
he won't be able to avoid coming since he's succeeded to the management rights.

222
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,760
He will need to keep these types of rumors from spreading.

223
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,150
Right now, shouldn't you be concentrating on arresting predator murderer Yook Dong Sik?

224
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:01,340
I'll catch the predator even if I have to put my job on the line.

225
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,010
Does Seo In Woo know something?

226
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,620
I just need an afternoon.

227
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,870
If you summon Seo In Woo here for me, I can catch the predator and finish up the case.

228
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,050
 Daehan Securities

229
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,000
- Are you okay? 
 - Huh?

230
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,350
Yeah.

231
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,540
What, what is it?

232
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,850
I lied to come to see you, saying it was the director's orders, since I wanted to ask you something.

233
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:09,610
There are rumors about the president's death, and I have a lot of doubts, too.

234
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,270
Wh-What about it? I said all there was to say.

235
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,790
What is this?

236
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,410
Oh, it-it's not mine. It belongs to a woman named Sim Bo Gyeong.

237
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,290
That's...

238
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,310
What is it? You two are planning something together?

239
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,660
The police have summoned the two of you for a follow-up investigation to testify.

240
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,920
They're here!

241
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,650
What do you think about the rumors on social media?

242
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,440
They're all baseless rumors not worth responding to.

243
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,140
But I can't have dirty rumors going around about my father's case, so I came here today.

244
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,560
Is Director Seo Ji Hoon not accepting the summons?

245
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,040
He was too shocked over the incident, so it doesn't seem he's physically well.

246
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,790
I will do my best to cooperate and speak on his behalf as well.

247
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,160
Seo In Woo, we need a clearer answer.

248
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,200
Please, a word!

249
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,140
When Seo In Woo goes to the police station, there's no way he would leave Seo Ji Hoon alone.

250
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,280
He'll hide Seo Ji Hoon where he thinks is the safest place.

251
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,210
As expected, at the company where there's thorough surveillance—

252
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,860
It could be his house, too.

253
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,730
Right, that's true.

254
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,840
But we've already searched his house before.

255
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,330
No way, that ward?

256
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,020
Only he would know.

257
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,820
But, there's a big chance it will be one of those places.

258
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,960
 Ocean's Eleven

259
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,810
The most time we have is half a day.

260
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,290
During that time, we have to find Seo Ji Hoon.

261
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,760
 While Seo In Woo is preoccupied with Bo Gyeong...

262
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,520
What is it?

263
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,800
There's a report that this hospital is over-medicating and over-treating the patients. Can we check?

264
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,850
Do you have a warrant?

265
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,700
Oh! Right?

266
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,380
By chance...

267
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,060
 Warrant

268
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,810
Seo Ji Hoon isn't at the hospital.

269
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,890
- What about the document? 
 - I sent the fax.

270
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,410
My father was being administered drugs that had nothing to do with his symptoms.

271
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,300
It's completely illegal.

272
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,630
Your father? You didn't summon me because of my father.

273
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm sure the two are related. As you already know.

274
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,410
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

275
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,300
I'm asking you to answer about this matter.

276
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,740
Is that something I should be answering?

277
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,880
I only introduced you to the hospital where my friend works.

278
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,190
I thought you might say that, so I applied pressure on your friend.

279
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,620
I heard he admitted very quickly that you ordered him to do it.

280
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,300
I guess he wasn't that trustworthy.

281
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,290
Why did he lie like that? I really don't know.

282
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,890
You didn't know? Then why would he do something like that to my father when he had nothing to do with him?

283
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,820
Exactly why?!

284
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,080
Ruining his mental state with drugs at a place that was like a prison, only without bars!

285
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,450
I didn't know that, and—

286
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,320
I just wanted to protect you, that's all.

287
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,160
From a dangerous convict.

288
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,190
Bring that in!

289
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,770
It's your first time seeing this, right?

290
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,820
It's a lie detector.

291
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:55,410
We've looked everywhere, but I don't think Seo Ji Hoon is at the company.

292
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,620
Let's go.

293
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,570
Stop.

294
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,050
You really want me to open it?

295
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,420
If we don't find him, it's over, so we have to.

296
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,690
There's no turning back, huh?

297
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,470
Okay, let's do it.

298
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,610
- Seo In Woo, you're 36, right? 
 - Yes.

299
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,210
- You've always called your father "President"? 
 - Yes.

300
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,820
Did you think of him as a patriarch and try hard to seek his approval?

301
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes, I did.

302
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,560
You and Seo Ji Hoon have different mothers, right?

303
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,380
How do you feel about your half-brother?

304
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:34,400
Have you ever thought his head would be filled with udon noodles instead of a brain?

305
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,790
Why?

306
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,100
Your question is a little odd.

307
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:00,400
Is it? I only asked before what you normally thought about your father and brother.

308
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,040
You recognize this, right?

309
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,830
Isn't that Yook Dong Sik's diary?

310
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,500
That's what you led everyone to believe.

311
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,270
You used this to manipulate Dong Sik so he would try to kill me.

312
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,700
When he was arrested, you were probably overjoyed.

313
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,840
But when you look at the entries closely,

314
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,460
the author calls his father "President."

315
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,530
A father who's an authoritative president. A half-brother who's a mutual enemy.

316
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,030
And a sister and brother-in-law who like to meddle.

317
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:50,030
Doesn't this sound similar to another family?

318
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,230
Do you believe I'm the predator murderer?

319
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,190
That's absurd.

320
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,680
Then, let me ask you a simple question.

321
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,290
Seo In Woo.

322
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,210
Does this diary ...

323
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,680
belong to you?

324
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,980
Answer!

325
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,140
No.

326
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,880
How are the results?

327
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,450
Are you satisfied?

328
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,900
As expected, it's what I thought.

329
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,890
Can we take a break? I have a headache.

331
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,510
 Sergeant Sim

332
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,440
- Yes, Bo Gyeong. 
 - Did you find anything?

333
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,140
It's not in his home.

334
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,120
Where in the world could it ...

335
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,300
By chance, could there be a separate hiding place somewhere?

336
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,900
A place to keep tools or collectibles.

337
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,720
If there were such a place, I would have read it in the diary.

338
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,070
Still, we didn't find anything when we searched his home.

339
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,600
If there isn't another hiding place...

340
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,040
No, I don't think he would have kept that somewhere else.

341
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,730
It would be burdensome and dangerous.

342
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:12,100
Then perhaps there's a hidden room in the house?

343
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,760
I may be able to find it.

344
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,770
We don't have much time. Maybe around 30 minutes from now.

345
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,200
I'll call you back shortly.

346
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,090
Seo In Woo may come this way, so continue to be on the lookout.

347
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,590
Yes.

348
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,420
 If I were Seo In Woo... If I were a predator ...

349
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,300
If it were Charles Darwin...  The Origin of Species?

350
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,660
He's not even a victim, yet you used a lie detector.

351
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,940
If it's going to be this type of intimidating atmosphere, we will not cooperate with the witness investigation.

352
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,510
We can call him a victim.

353
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,330
If you get a warrant, we can speak then.

354
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,060
I'd like to help you further, but my brother hasn't been feeling well.

355
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,100
I need to get going.

356
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,100
 Team Leader Jo Yoo Jin

357
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,650
- Yes 
 - This is Jo Yoo Jin.

358
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,350
- Why are you calling? 
 - That is...

359
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,770
Are you with the director right now?

360
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,770
- He just left. 
 -  Good.

361
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,780
Truthfully, Manager Seo Ji Hoon asked me for a favor.

362
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,990
To pass on a message to Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong.

363
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,320
Oh!

364
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,180
 Sergeant Sim

365
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,870
Yes, hello?

366
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,390
Is Dong Sik still inside? Hurry and get him.

367
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,150
Yes, hold on.

368
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,360
Hold on.

369
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,820
Hyungnim.

370
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,230
Hyungnim.

371
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,700
Hyungnim.

372
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,250
He disappeared like a ghost.

373
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,860
Where did he go? Did he go to the bathroom?

374
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,900
I don't see him.

375
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,970
He disappeared?

376
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,190
As expected, there must be a hidden room inside the house.

377
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,430
Hello?

378
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,730
 Sergeant Sim?

379
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,430
For now, I need you to look for a hidden room.

380
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,410
And Seo In Woo may be on his way home so I'll send Taek Soo that way.

381
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,830
- Be careful. 
 - Yes, I understand.

382
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,860
Hyungnim.

383
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,890
Are you pooping?

384
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,440
Seo Ji Hoon. Seo Ji Hoon.

385
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,930
Seo Ji Hoon. Seo Ji Hoon.

386
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,240
Wake up.

387
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,640
Seo Ji Hoon. Seo Ji Hoon!

388
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,270
It's Dong Sik.

389
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,460
You saw the camera I was holding, right?

390
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,490
Where is the memory card?

391
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,390
- Huh? 
 - Where is the memory card?

392
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,680
Ah...

393
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,570
That.

394
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,820
Seriously!

395
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,870
For now, let's get out of here.

396
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,750
You idiot.

397
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,320
How could you come here?

398
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,540
You're finished along with me, Punk.

399
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,390
 Hey, Yook Dong Sik. How is it in there?

400
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,660
 Seo In Woo!

401
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,070
Do you like it?

402
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,720
It's to die for, isn't it?

403
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,010
Hi. You're right on time.

404
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,220
Stop playing around. Where is Seo Ji Yoon?

405
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,510
Bo Gyeong.

406
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,990
What's with the gun? Put it away, please.

407
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,510
I was trying to make it look realistic but it's not working. Why don't you just have a seat?

408
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,400
Have some tea with me.

409
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:44,460
I knew you weren't in your right mind but I didn't know it was this bad.

410
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,900
Put your hands on your head and face the wall this instant.

411
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,640
Yes.

412
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,970
Where is Seo Ji Hoon?

413
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,350
I asked you where he is!

414
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,770
On top of my desk.

415
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,340
You really didn't think much of me.

416
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,720
Stay still.

417
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,210
Ji Hoon was being too suspicious.

418
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,790
So I asked Team Leader Jo to persuade him a little.

419
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,150
He was clenching this.

420
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,130
That moron.

421
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,680
But Yook Dong Sik and I had a special relationship at one point.

422
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,730
So I need to at least give him one last chance.

423
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:08,810
Untie me now. Untie me now, you bastard!

424
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,690
Crazy...

425
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,920
Bo-Bo Gyeong.

426
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,420
Bo Gyeong, what's going on?

427
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,130
Bo Gyeong. Bo Gyeong!

428
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,320
What are you up to?

429
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,710
Truthfully, it really bothered me. This person named Yook Dong Sik.

430
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:59,160
Even after reading my diary and mistaking himself for me, he couldn't kill one person.

431
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,610
So I wanted to play a game.

432
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,750
Game?

433
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:10,700
 I'll let you go. I'll even help you escape like the president promised.

434
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,800
 But you need to kill Seo Ji Hoon there.

435
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,170
What?

436
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,760
Otherwise, I'm going to kill Sim Bo Gyeong.

437
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,220
So choose. Will it be Seo Ji Yoon or Sim Bo Gyeong?

438
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,230
You ... What are you trying to do right now?

439
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,260
Sit still.

440
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm trying to save you both.

441
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,710
This deal will only work if I get something in return.

442
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,340
Stop talking nonsense.

443
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,120
Dong Sik, don't listen.

444
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,430
If you kill Seo Ji Hoon,

445
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:51,380
this bastard will still kill me and frame you.

446
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,400
I did think about that.

447
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,030
But if I kill you both, then it'll be harder for people to not suspect me.

448
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,910
But if I keep you alive, you won't stay quiet.

449
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,880
So I need insurance.

450
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,600
Do you think I'll fall for that crap?

451
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,560
I wonder. Do you think Yook Dong Sik has another solution?

452
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:18,340
Hurry up. We don't have much time.

453
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,090
How can I trust you?

454
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,390
Dong Sik.

455
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:10,920
Yook Dong Sik killed someone. Then, Sim Bo Gyeong won't be able to say anything.

456
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,090
Because then she'll have to reveal that you killed someone to save her.

457
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,740
Then Yook Dong Sik,

458
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,490
you and Sim Bo Gyeong will survive without being able to say anything.

459
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,360
And then all three of us can be happy.

460
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:31,630
 You may have already figured this out but the person I want to kill the most,

461
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,300
-  is you.  
 - I guess so.

462
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,090
But why did I leave you alone until now?

463
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:43,370
A scapegoat. To take the blame for your sins.

464
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,030
That's right.

465
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,590
I was able to become king because you became the sacrifice.

466
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,370
When my father was alive, he said this,

467
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:57,750
after you become king, you no longer shed blood for fun but out of necessity.

468
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,170
I should become an adult now. This is all part of the maturing process.

469
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,210
Dong Sik. You can't fall for it.

470
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,520
Sim Bo Gyeong. Do you not want him to become a murderer,

471
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,560
or do you not want to arrest him again?

472
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,390
- What? 
 - See. You can't do either.

473
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,760
So all you have to do is choose.

474
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,030
Then, you'll become an accomplice.

475
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,650
All of us. Forever.

476
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,880
I can't let him kill Bo Gyeong.

477
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,790
On top of that,

478
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,920
he's a bad guy anyway.

479
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,540
 What? Are you really going to kill me?

480
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,940
Snap out of it! You're normally just a pushover.

481
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:06,550
All of those people who looked down on you,

482
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,270
there was a time you wanted to kill them all.

483
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,550
Just do it. The first time is the hardest.

484
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,430
After that, it's nothing.

485
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,390
No, you can't!

486
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,970
Dong Sik. Dong Sik.

487
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,000
No!

488
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,200
You did well.

489
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,020
You see that bag over there, right?

490
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,910
It's everything the president prepared for you to escape.

491
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,950
Take it and disappear.

492
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,170
Hyungnim, Hyungnim.

493
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,680
Hyungnim, what... what is that?

494
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,800
What about Seo Ji Hoon?

495
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,890
Why? What?

496
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,790
Why... why are you looking at me like that?

497
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,010
Ouch, it hurts so much I could die.

498
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,490
Ah seriously.

499
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,040
What is this?

500
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,990
If I didn't do this much, I didn't think he would open it.

501
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,100
Ouch.

502
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,350
Ouch, it hurts. It hurts!

503
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,410
 No!

504
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,520
 Pretend like you're dying.

505
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,740
 Pretend you're dying, hurry.

506
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,910
I called an ambulance so hurry and change.

507
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,420
Let's go to the hospital.

508
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,190
Bo Gyeong is in danger. We need to tell the police quickly.

509
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,040
Yook Dong Sik killed Seo Ji Hoon.

510
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,640
During that time, he knew Sim Bo Gyeong was with Seo In Woo.

511
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,690
So he found her and killed her.

512
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,060
Seo In Woo, who managed to escape,

513
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:10,790
lost his brother and the woman he loved,

514
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,810
and was in shock.

515
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:18,240
You thought of this since the beginning.

516
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,940
Good business requires risk.

517
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,510
If you're going to kill me, hurry up and kill me.

518
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,210
That's not it. I told you, Yook Dong Sik comes here to kill you.

519
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,510
You need to get the timing right.

520
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,440
You crazy bastard.

521
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,010
I’m disappointed. You brought about this situation.

522
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:47,060
Actually, I had acknowledged you a lot

523
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:54,820
since you were the first and only person who discovered me and recognized who I was.

524
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:00,990
You don't know how many chances I gave you, do you?

525
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,420
That's why you should have stopped when you captured Yook Dong Sik.

526
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,900
You received a promotion, and people treated you like a hero.

527
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,570
A chaebol heir even asked you out. Why didn’t you accept it?

528
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,400
Wasn’t that enough of a reward to avoid this situation?

529
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,400
- Is that important? 
 - Then, what is important?

530
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,710
Truth? My conscience?

531
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,790
You're old-fashioned,  just like Yook Dong Sik.

532
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,700
I guess I can start now.

533
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,720
This is actually my father's gun.

534
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,690
But in this situation, Yook Dong Sik stole it and ran.

535
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,960
It's not easy to survive in today's world.

536
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,870
If you want to succeed, oh, it’s terribly difficult.

537
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:14,330
In the midst of it all, he’s lost in tacky feelings?

538
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:19,840
Then he’s the perfect prey for guys like me.

539
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,170
 Team Leader Jo Yoo Jin

540
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,110
What, the police?

541
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,290
Hold them up for now.

542
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,060
What's going on?

543
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,050
What happened here?

544
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,280
Mister Seo Ji Hoon. Are you okay?

545
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,850
Why is there so much blood?

546
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,940
It's not my blood.

547
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,890
Move.

548
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,930
Where is Seo In Woo?

549
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:13,850
Seo In Woo, you bastard. Now you're done for.

550
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,260
Yook Dong Sik, that bastard.

551
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,850
It's over now. Give up.

552
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,190
Seo In Woo!

553
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:12,400
 Psychopath Diary

554
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:23,520

555
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,470
 Dong Sik, it's over now. All of it.

556
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,060
 That's a gunshot.

557
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,120
 Wait!

558
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,230
 Oh!

559
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,270
 Put down your gun, Seo In Woo.

560
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,970
 The predator murderer who shook up the whole country,

561
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:53,330
 the shocking truth has come to light late.

562
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:57,050
 It must be a prison crueler than anywhere in this world.

563
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,930
 How does it feel to be exonerated?

564
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,200
 I'm still just a pushover.

565
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,530
 Our main event is just starting.
