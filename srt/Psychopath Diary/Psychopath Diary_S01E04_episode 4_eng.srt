00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,430
  Episode 4

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,280
Who are you, you bastard?!

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,590
Are you crazy? Do you even know who I am? Take this off me right now!

6
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,420
Wh-Who are you? What are you doing to me?

7
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,160
Let's start the game.

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,040
What?

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,380
Just quickly undo this!

10
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,200
  Saw

11
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,950

12
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,300
I will give you some questions. If you answer even one correctly, I will untie you.

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,880
However, every time you get an answer wrong, I will cut one leg off of the chair.

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,860
I told you to just quickly untie all of this!

15
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,330
You see this saw, right?

16
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,150
What?

17
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,150
Oh, I guess you can't see it.

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,380
You hear it, right?

19
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,390
Okay, I hear it so stop sawing!

20
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,500
Now, the question.

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,080
What is the name of the movie

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,990
- which has the line where I just said, 'Let's start the game'? 
 - Saw!

23
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,360
It's correct, right?

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,840
Yes. But that's not the question.

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,630
In that movie  Saw , there is a famous murderer.

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,200
Just like the situation right now, the murderer kidnaps a person, plays a game and kills the person.

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,760
What is the name of that murderer?

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,280
I don't know, bastard! Just take this off me!

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,290
The answer is Jigsaw.

30
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,880
Since you got the answer wrong,

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Wait, wait!

32
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,280
Stop it!

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,260
Just hold still.

34
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,800
Or you'll die.

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,500
What is it that you want?

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,140
Money? How much do you want?

37
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,420
I have lots of money!

38
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,240
The second question.

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,040
This time, it would be better for you to listen to the whole question and answer carefully.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,600
A farmer bought a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage and is trying to get back home.

41
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,060
He has to take a boat to get to his house, but he can take only one item at a time.

42
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,930
But, what would happen if there is no farmer?

43
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,560
The sheep would eat the cabbage, and the wolf would eat the sheep.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,200
Now, what is the strategy to take everything safely across the river?

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,710
What? Wolf and sheep, cabbage?

46
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,470
I'll give you 30 seconds.

47
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,440
Oh, wait, wait.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,570
I have to think, I have to think.

49
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,790
Twenty-five seconds left.

50
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,260
Wolf, sheep, and cabbage? Damn it.

51
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,640
Twenty seconds left. 
 - Ah! Wait!

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,230
First, if you bring the wolf across the river...

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,680
the sheep would eat the cabbage.

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,720
Ten seconds left.

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,180
Please, please!

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,550
Wait, wait!

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,610
  Father

58
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,060
I'll give you more time, so just wait and think more about it.

59
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,690
Oh, oh!

60
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,380
How can you just leave me here like this?

61
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,550
Yes, Father.

62
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,480
Where are you? Everyone is eagerly waiting for you.

63
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm on the way, but there's traffic.

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,030
It’s crazy here since they’re all insisting on treating because they did amazing with the stocks!

65
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,420
You, the hero, have to come.

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll come. Yes!

67
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,770
Now, let's start ...

68
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,420
Let's start the game.

69
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,210
Where did we leave off?

70
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,580
You had five seconds left.

71
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,950
Answer!

72
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,300
You first bring the sheep over, and then bring the wolf.

73
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,120
You drop off the wolf and bring the sheep with you again.

74
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,580
Then you drop off the sheep on the other side and drop the cabbage with the wolf.

75
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,720
Then you're left with the wolf and cabbage on one side.

76
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,380
Lastly, you can bring the sheep over.

77
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,310
Right, right? It's correct, isn't it? Hurry up and untie all of this!

78
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,410
Untie it, untie it!

79
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,170
No. You're wrong.

80
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,700
There was no strategy at all for them to safety cross the river to start with.

81
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,340
- What? 
 - Because, among them, the top predator isn’t the farmer but the wolf.

82
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,890
The correct answer is that the wolf would eat up everything, including the farmer!

83
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,010
That's not fair!

84
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,680
  It hurts.

85
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,710
  Just because you kill him doesn't mean what was his becomes yours.

86
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,030
  This was originally my room.

87
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,760
  So what? Life is always unfair.

88
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,180
  If you want it, prove that you're stronger and smarter than him.

89
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,760
You're wrong again.

90
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,070
Listen carefully. This is the last question.

91
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,000
Why ...

92
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,880
would I try to kill you?

93
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,830
Because you find it disgusting how I spend money like a bastard

94
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,780
thanks to having met good parents?

95
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,690
No.

96
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,110
Perhaps, did Seo In Woo order you?

97
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,830
Seo In Woo?

98
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,360
Right?

99
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,720
He thinks that if I die my position would be his,

100
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,840
but who would be suspected first if I die?

101
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,930
Damn it. This bastard!

102
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,720
That's not it either!

103
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,890
Then why are you killing me?

104
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,020
You've got the last answer wrong too,

105
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,360
so you're going to die now.

106
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,660
Please save me! I really don't want to die!

107
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,800
No! Damn it! I’ll be good from now on!

108
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,980
If you're going to kill me, kill me fast, you bastard!

109
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,060
I said kill me!

110
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,050
Hold still.

111
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,800
Kill me! Please!

112
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,460
You're really going to die if you do that!

113
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
Save me!

114
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,220
Please help me!

115
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,900
Stop right there!

116
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,350
  Psychopath Diary

117
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,260
That guy is probably getting ready to pounce on his prey.

118
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,490
He’s probably a man in his 30s, and seeing how his crime technique is very intelligent,

119
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,760
he probably has a high IQ and is highly-educated.

120
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,880
There’s a good chance he has a fairly free but very competitive job.

121
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,350
Okay. I'll go over it and contact you.

122
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,030
I did clean up the mess, but...

123
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,160
Dong Sik! Dong Sik!

124
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,050
Now, now, now.

125
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,850
Today's hero, my eldest son, everyone's superstar,

126
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,060
Yook Dong Sik has arrived!

127
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,980
Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

128
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,820
Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik! Come here!

129
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,610
Yook! Dong! Sik!

130
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,730
Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

131
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,870
  Everything was meticulously cleaned up, and even my alibis are perfect.

132
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,250
  But, in the end, I couldn't kill him.

133
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,720
  Why did I do that?

134
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,250
Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

135
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Saw! It was exactly like the movie!

136
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,430
I got the answer right but he told me I was wrong! He never told me that the wolf would eat the farmer.

137
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,180
He was planning to kill me from the start.

138
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,290
Thinking of it again is making me hyperventilate.

139
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,630
- Ji Hoon! 
 - Mom!

140
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,750
Nurse! Nurse!

141
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Did that bastard do drugs again?

142
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,480
We were restraining him after you gave him a good scolding the last time.

143
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,250
Shut everyone's mouth so this rumor does not spread.

144
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,390
Meanwhile, don't let him take even one step out of his room.

145
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,030
What do you think of this?

146
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,240
I heard he came drunk out of a bar he frequents.

147
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,110
It could have been because of alcohol or drugs, but

148
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,460
I think it's necessary to find out in case that isn't what happened.

149
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,590
Of course.

150
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,790
- Quietly find out what happened. 
 - Yes.

151
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,030
But,

152
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,010
where were you and what were you doing last night?

153
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,330
The audit team leader had something to discuss, so we met outside of the office.

154
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,460
Things are going to get complicated because of  that jerk.

155
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,710
- Pardon? 
 - Did Yook Dong Sik come in yet?

156
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,040
It's past the time for reporting to work, so he probably did.

157
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,050
He probably did? I'm asked whether he did or not.

158
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,480
I will check.

159
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,370
Crazy jerk. Why did he make this difficult by doing whatever he wants?

160
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,080
What are you talking about?

161
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,480
Never mind. If he's in the office, send him to my office immediately.

162
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,120
Okay. But should I tell him for what matter you are looking for him?

163
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,070
Just tell him not to ask anything, nor quibble, and that his life is in my hands.

164
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,460
I'm screwed.

165
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,350
Why did I do that? Why did you do that, Yook Dong Sik?

166
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,050
You're a psychopathic murderer!

167
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,570
Why couldn't you kill him? Why? Why?

168
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,950
Why? Why? Why!

169
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,890
  I don't even dare to go to the office.

170
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,820
 Still, if I want to avoid suspicion...

171
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,860
 Yook Dong Sik! We're arresting you under suspicion of serial murder!

172
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
 We'll kill you the moment you resist!

173
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,550
 Save me, please!

174
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,500
 If there were a devil in this world, it would be you.

175
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,460
 You couldn't even take care of human trash like Seo Ji Hoon.

176
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,860
 Mostly, humans were just trash.

177
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,820
 That's right. You only picked the easy target like us to kill.

178
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,640
 You're just trash that pretends to be tough.

179
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,110
 Die.

180
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,590
 You have to die!

181
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,660
 You should die!

182
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,450
 Die!

183
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,720
 Die!

184
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,490
 Die!

185
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,520
 No!

186
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,430
No!

187
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,880
Should I just confess?

188
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,550
Should I just ... go to the police station?

189
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,420
Would Dong Sik really do that?

190
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,950
No way.

191
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,040
I want to believe Dong Sik too but there's no choice but to check with him directly.

192
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,320
Yook Dong Sik!

193
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,270
Let's talk.

194
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,110
Did you really do it?

195
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,070
 How much do they know? They couldn't have seen my face.

196
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,510
 Did they find evidence?

197
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,550
Answer me, Yook Dong Sik!

198
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,390
Yook Dong Sik!

199
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,050
Well...

200
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,050
You're right. I did it.

201
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,490
I knew it.

202
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,190
What? Really?

203
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,840
 Well no matter what, I didn't kill him.

204
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,510
 I'll just patch things up saying I wanted to teach him a lesson, and that was all.

205
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,440
This person, really!

206
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,190
I'm sorry. I just...

207
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,550
Okay. You just confessed right? That you were the hidden camera culprit?

208
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,790
Yes.

209
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,730
What?

210
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,760
How far did we get?

211
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,220
The hostess bar employee came and gave you coffee.

212
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,570
Right! That hostess bar employee! Did you see his face?

213
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,020
Well ... he wore a mask so--

214
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,110
Mask? I mean anyone could see that it's suspicious but you just accepted it!

215
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,840
Well when I think about it ... when he turned around, it did come off for a second!

216
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,680
 It's tasty!

217
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,390
So what did he look like?

218
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,690
What should I say? Just a normal face.

219
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,490
That's it? And details? You don't even have any details?

220
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,680
Nothing special.

221
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,450
He looked nice!

222
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,550
Oh, he looked nice?

223
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,200
You don't even know what detail means? Your head is full of crap, that's why you live like this!

224
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,480
Still, I graduated from a four-year course!

225
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,150
Four years where? The driving university?

226
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,920
Daehan University. College of Fine Arts.

227
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,900
So what? Good for you, from Daehan University College of Fine Arts, and now you're driving—

228
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,030
What did you just say?

229
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,620
Dong Sik this jerk!

230
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,430
So this photo—you're sure that you took this photo?

231
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,830
Well, the thing is...

232
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,570
Sunbae, you were right.

233
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:43,170
Yook Dong Sik. This is also something that the Team Leader or somebody came up with, right?

234
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,100
Before you came in, I listened to the victim Miss Mi Joo and the team leader Mr. Jae Ho's stories.

235
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,860
There were a couple of things that didn't match up,

236
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,470
and the office's CCTV were—

237
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,610
After checking, they were only broken yesterday.

238
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,800
Something stinks badly.  It's a nasty odor.

239
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,360
If you assert your innocence, we'll do a further investigation.

240
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,990
We can recover the CCTV data through forensics.

241
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,810
 My family has a lot of debt, but I can just work hard and repay it.

242
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,460
 This isn't the only office in the world either.

243
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,420
 Why am I all of a sudden remembering this?

244
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,090
I'll ask you one last time.

245
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,860
Did you really do it?

246
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,460
I am really sorry to have caused trouble.

247
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,930
He just made a one-time mistake, so if you were to overlook it, that'd be great.

248
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,570
But since he will probably deny it til the end, it will probably be hard to let him off, right?

249
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,240
He admitted to it. He confessed without saying anything else.

250
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,540
What?

251
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,230
 Why did I do that?

252
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,550
 I'm a psychopath. When I'm the worst person?

253
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,830
- He was caught. 
 - Ah, yes.

254
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,040
What do you mean that the police were here?

255
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,820
They're taking Yook Dong Sik into custody right now.

256
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,360
- On charges of what? 
 - They said it's sexual harassment.

257
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,860
-  A hidden camera. 
 - What?

258
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,470
Sorry, we are going through.

259
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,930
Sorry, we are going through.

260
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,850
Sorry, sorry.

261
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,370
Please don't take pictures!

262
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,810
Sorry, mister, please don't take pictures.

263
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,810
Are they sure that Yook Dong Sik did it?

264
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,400
It looks like Director Seo laid a trap,

265
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,760
but they said he confessed so I'm also not sure what is what.

266
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,820
Yook Dong Sik!

267
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,660
Idiotic bastard, shit!

268
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,550
Let go! Ouch!

269
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,720
Quick, quick, quick!

270
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,730
He tried to kill me!

271
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,330
This bastard, last night!

272
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,370
Stop it!

273
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,450
The truth is ...

274
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,720
that person, Director Seo Ji Hoon, made me do it.

275
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,720
Sunbae Dong Sik isn't someone who would take secret photos.

276
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,000
Hey! The hidden camera isn't important. This jerk, to me, yesterday—

277
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,610
I said stop, you shitty scumbag!

278
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,780
That's not it. Shit.

279
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,830
- What are you filming? 
 - Ah, really!

280
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,950
Do you want to get fired, uh?

281
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,780
- Everyone, don't film! 
 - Shit, I said don't!

282
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,330
Don't film!

283
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,060
Do you want to die?

284
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,000
 The video of the director of a large investment company

285
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,040
 assaulting an employee in front of the staff has spread across the internet, and the controversy is spreading.

286
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,190
 The assailant is Mr. Seo, son of the group's president—

287
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,250
Someone put it up on social media. I'm sorry.

288
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,290
Release a group official letter of apology right away to the press.

289
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,820
And for now, make Ji Hoon self-reflect.

290
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,170
Yes.

291
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,930
Eat and go home to put Yeon Seok to bed.

292
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,230
Side dishes. Make sure you eat a lot, okay?

293
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,940
 The controversy is spreading.

294
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,520
Huh? 
  The assailant is Mr. Seo, son of the group's president—

295
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,440
Oh my gosh, what a jerk!

296
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,780
  'Abuse of power assault' director revealed to be Mr. Seo, son of the president ...

297
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,510
You know that employee ... at a glance,

298
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,710
 The culture of abusing one's power is still not resolved ...

299
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,980
that must really hurt.

300
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,830
That's so sad. He's just a salary worker, not a slave!

301
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,790
I know, right?

302
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,910
Still, our Dong Sik has a good performance score these days, since he's doing well.

303
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,030
He must have been treated as a pushover to be beaten like that.

304
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,740
Don't say that. His parents must be having such heartache.

305
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,620
Cram school.

306
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,860
Why does he look so weak recently?

307
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,680
How would he have strength when he's picking at his food like that?

308
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,140
You're supposed to be his mom!

309
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,420
Did you get beat up by someone?

310
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,320
Let go! You also go around getting beaten up.

311
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,030
- What? 
 - The original video spread all through the internet.

312
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,340
Worry about yourself, Hyung. You're even more of a pushover than me.

313
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,430
Move!

314
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,340
No no, we should have been the ones to handle it quietly, but things grew big for no reason so it's our regret.

315
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,480
Yes, yes. Please attend quietly once. Yes.

316
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,290
We witnessed an assault in front of our eyes and that video got on the news,

317
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,000
but does it make sense that it just get covered up like this?

318
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,610
I feel so bad for Dong Sik.

319
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,190
Severe stress, harsh competition, plus working at a stock firm

320
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,380
which doesn't suit his personality must be hard enough already.

321
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,780
How could this happen to him, too?

322
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,080
 Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon

323
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,820
I examined it carefully, but your profiling is a fail.

324
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,700
- Pardon? 
 - Since all of it is only presumptions.

325
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,220
The starting point of profiling is evidence.

326
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,980
But among the ones you talked about, there is no evidence that it was murder and not suicide.

327
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,520
We have to find it, of course. Among other doubtful suicides cases, there will be some other one that guy—

328
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,840
Bo Gyeong. Did you already forget your dad?

329
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,080
We are civil servants who enforce the law.

330
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,560
Our job is not to discover cases but to bring conclusions.

331
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,070
I know.

332
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,040
I know. But then, if he kills someone else,

333
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,430
are you saying that we can't do anything until there is definitive evidence that it wasn't suicide?

334
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,250
It sounds cold but it's true.

335
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,600
Every year, there are 13,000 people who commit suicide. They must have had a reason to die.

336
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,610
But you're saying to look at these, one by one, to find a serial murderer who might or might not be.

337
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,860
We don't have that kind of free time nor administrative power.

338
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,610
That's what that guy is aiming for!

339
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,060
Then bring evidence that the guy really exists. Not presumptions.

340
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,120
Corporal Sim.

341
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,160
Are you feeling okay where you were hit?

342
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,490
I didn't get beat up!

343
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,920
I blocked it right away.

344
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,750
Is there something wrong?

345
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:56,900
It's just that today, I have this feeling of helplessness for various reasons.

346
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:07,800
Uhm, Director Seo Ji Hoon's case ... It looks like it'll be quietly hushed up.

347
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,700
I think the influence of the president reached the police higher-ups and the prosecutor.

348
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,430
They don't intend on opening documents that even have the 'Seo' of Seo Ji Hoon written on it.

349
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,490
 Thanks to it, the kidnapping case will probably also get hushed up.

350
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,900
 Thank God!

351
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,600
Well, that can't be helped.

352
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,770
Aren't you upset? You're too nice.

353
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,620
How are you going to live in a world like this?

354
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,450
With the hidden camera as well! I do understand that you could want to protect Mi Joo,  but still.

355
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,560
It's not like I don't know how you're treated in the office.

356
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,170
And, I told you to tell me if these kinds of things happened!

357
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,090
I'm sorry.

358
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,050
Seo Ji Hoon. He should have gone to jail!

359
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,960
He not only made you into a heinous criminal but went as far as assaulting you!

360
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,580
How can a person be like that!

361
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,900
He thinks he's a predator.

362
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,260
Predator? Yeah, right.

363
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,830
The truly strong don't bother the weak like that.

364
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,820
Is that right?

365
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,790
You're really too innocent.

366
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,800
My father owns a Korean barbecue restaurant but he gave me too much.

367
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,700
You should take it and eat it.

368
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,960
You didn't have to.

369
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,180
My dad will love it.

370
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,790
Stay strong! Perhaps, because there are still people like you,

371
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,910
the world is still livable.

372
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,520
Let's stay strong, okay?

373
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,860
Thank you. I'll eat it well.

374
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,850
No wonder something was off.

375
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,300
I was wondering why he would flip over the table when the meal was all set.

376
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,870
But the build-up was a work of art.

377
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,400
The acting at the climax of the story.

378
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,510
So what you're saying is that everything was planned by Dong Sik?

379
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,250
What? You think this was all just a simple happening?

380
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,860
How many times have Yook Dong Sik's strange choices

381
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,660
resulted in a situation that we couldn't imagine?

382
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,360
It gives me goosebumps.

383
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,090
Yes. But still

384
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,370
The guy is scrupulous and careful.

385
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,990
Acting as an idiot and a pushover is a thorough disguise.

386
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,390
How can you be so sure?

387
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,440
We're cut from the same cloth.

388
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,840
I need to have him.

389
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,290
 A predator ... While loathing and hunting the weak,

390
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,530
 the guy could think of himself as a predator.

391
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,750
Why aren't you eating? What are you thinking about? Are you thinking about the case?

392
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,890
No, there's something that's bothering me.

393
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:39,420
What do you mean, no? You look just like your dad did when he was thinking about a complicated case.

394
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,820
But this meat is so good.

395
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,990
Someone I know has a restaurant and he gave it to me

396
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,040
Mister Yook Republic?

397
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,880
The name's so unique.

398
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,240
Wait. What?

399
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,020
 Mr. Yook Republic

400
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,980
 Mister Yook Republic.

401
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,020
- What? 
 - Nothing.

402
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,570
 The first murder I attempted, I failed.

403
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,860
 The plan was perfect.

404
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,620
 But at the last moment, why did I hesitate?

405
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,030
 Exactly why?

406
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,480
 Worry about yourself, Hyung. You're even more of a pushover than me.

407
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,210
Hello, Yook Dong Sik.

408
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,420
Why are you here again?

409
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,220
Probably because I have work to do here.

410
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,770
Yeah, right. Just stop coming and annoying everyone.

411
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,660
Yook Dong Sik, let go of him.

412
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,290
What?

413
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,360
No, he—

414
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,380
Are you laughing?

415
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,660
While Director Seo Ji Hoon is gone on sick leave,

416
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,200
I will be the temporary director of the assets management team. I'm Seo In Woo.

417
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,420
 This person...

418
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,570
To end up working with a legend in the trading world, Director Seo In Woo,

419
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,080
it's an honor.

420
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,440
I, too, prayed for the day I could work with you one day.

421
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,940
I was surprised when I first saw you. I thought a model had come in.

422
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,560
What about you, Yook Dong Sik? How do you feel about working with me?

423
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,330
Director... I... in the past, more or less—

424
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,830
Are you physically better?

425
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,870
Yes, well...

426
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,750
Since we're in one team, don't keep quiet if you're struggling,

427
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,420
and ask for help at any time, okay?

428
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,610
Yes.

429
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,940
Since when was he part of Director Seo's line?

430
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,940
I'm not sure when that started.

431
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,290
I will differ from my younger — no, from Director Seo Ji Hoon.

432
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,990
I don't care much for hierarchy based on positions.

433
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,120
I believe an autonomous and rational atmosphere is most favorable.

434
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,380
If you prove yourself with your skill sets, you will receive commensurate treatment.

435
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,930
 Did Seo In Woo order you to do this? It was him, wasn't it?

436
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,660
 He thinks that if I die my position would be his.

437
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,610
 I see. They're brothers, but in reality, they can't wait to kill each other.

438
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,160
 Giving me the source was also because Seo Ji Hoon will die if I live,

439
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,770
 so he helped me.

440
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,140
Team Leader Gong Chan Seok.

441
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,350
Assistant Manager Park Jae Ho.

442
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,050
I was so overwhelmed I felt tears come to my eyes.

443
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,020
Applause!

444
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,890
On such a good day like this, we should have a welcoming party for you!

445
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,650
That sounds great, though I think it should be

446
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,750
a celebration for Dong Sik's promotion to assistant manager instead of welcoming me.

447
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,870
Me?

448
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:20,720
Listen up! Now, you all know what day it is today, right?

449
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,560
It is the day of Director Seo In Woo's welcoming party.

450
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,000
Let's have a toast.

451
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,660
When I say "Director Seo In Woo," you all shout "Welcome!"

452
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,200
Everyone got that?

453
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,450
To our loving Director Seo In Woo.

454
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,850
Welcome!

455
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,540
I look forward to working with everyone.

456
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,800
- Director, let me pour you a glass. 
 - Oh, thank you.

457
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,260
After you showed up, I think the atmosphere at work just shot through the roof.

458
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,010
Assistant Manager Park, greet him.

459
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,930
Hello, I'm Assistant Manager Park. Please accept my gift.

460
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,790
Right here!

461
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,560
Here you go, Director.

462
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,460
Excuse me for a moment.

463
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,010
You.  I told you so many times.

464
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,100
Do you think the Director would like it if this came from your armpit?

465
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,640
- Should we have a glass? 
 - Oh, yes.

466
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,360
Yes.

467
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,410
I look forward to working with you.

468
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,790
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

469
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,850
 I need to figure it out quickly.

470
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,340
 Exactly what was

471
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,880
 the reason I couldn't kill Seo Ji Hoon is what I'm saying!

472
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,420
Sunbae Dong Sik.

473
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,260
I didn't apologize to you properly, right?

474
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,560
I couldn't bring myself to face you properly.

475
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,120
It's fine.

476
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,620
No, it's not. I really...

477
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,390
really felt sorry.

478
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,730
Also, thank you.

479
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,700
- What? 
 - For me, I heard from the lady officer

480
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,010
that you deliberately confessed to take the blame instead.

481
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,720
You knew that Director Seo Ji Hoon threatened me

482
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,230
with my household debt, right?

483
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,460
You knew, right?

484
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,990
Yeah, well.

485
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,380
This is the first time I met someone as nice as you.

486
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,350
Could you let this nice person go to the bathroom? My stomach hurts.

487
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,470
You have to come back quickly.

488
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,420
Nice? Me?

489
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,880
 Is this... because of sympathy?

490
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,760
Ridiculous.

491
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,690
Was it boring?

492
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,270
Well, for people like us, I suppose it could be boring.

493
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,260
People like us?

494
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,660
 Is what he said.

495
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:33,520
I know more about you than you think.

496
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,570
I don't think we have much in common.

497
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,890
Actually, we have a lot of things in common.

498
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,240
Different from others.

499
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,900
We know exactly what we want, and we make sure to get that.

500
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,050
I don't really understand what you're talking about.

501
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,820
No, you understand.

502
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,800
We're the same type of person.

503
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,930
Right! We have to go somewhere together tomorrow, so clear your schedule.

504
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:11,870
- Excuse me? 
 - if you reject me again, I'll kill you.

505
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,410
What the heck?

506
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,930
- I have enough things I'm confused about. 
 - Do you know why I respect you, Team Leader?

507
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,410
You're handsome, you're gentle.

508
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,600
Goodness. I love you.

509
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,750
Do you want to die?

510
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,970
Dong Sik.

511
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,030
Dong Sik. I'm so happy that you ended up so well.

512
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,350
Thanks.

513
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,980
It's because I spoke highly of you to Director Seo.

514
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,770
I'm really so happy! As a friend.

515
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,090
Someone who even wrote a suicide note to kill himself earned the love of the director.

516
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,630
You really never know what happens to people.

517
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,500
A suicide note?

518
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,050
What are you talking about?

519
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,510
Oh... uh... Fine, I read the thing on your desk.

520
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,100
The suicide note you wrote, the day you lost your memory and came to work.

521
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,690
Where is it?

522
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,060
Where is it?

523
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:34,000
It's... What does it matter? You probably wrote it out of impulse.

524
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,190
I also want to die several times a day. Every day!

525
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,910
What was in it? Huh?

526
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,990
That ...

527
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,930
- What was in the suicide note? 
 - You scared me.

528
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,260
What is there to say in a suicide note?

529
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,360
Just that you're sick and tired of everything and that you want to die.

530
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,820
Oh, taxi! Taxi! I'm going now.

531
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,610
Here! One person!

532
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,920
Jae Ho. Jae Ho! Park Jae Ho! Hey!

533
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,930
Park Jae Ho!

534
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:09,060
 I was going to kill myself?

535
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,960
 Me, a psychopathic serial killer?

536
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,790
 Yook Republic, A Place Where the Meat is Tasty

537
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,710
You must be busy. You could've just given it to Dong Sik but you came in person.

538
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:27,090
I ate it so well, so I thought I'd say hello as well on my way home from work.

539
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,280
But, how do you even know my Dong Sik?

540
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,300
Well... I just met him here and there.

541
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,680
Also, do you know if a homeless man came by the restaurant not long ago?

542
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,750
A homeless man?

543
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,670
Yes. He could've been hurt somewhere.

544
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,630
We received a complaint from a nearby store.

545
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,630
I don't know about homeless men, but about five gangsters came by.

546
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,290
Why are you talking about that?

547
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,660
What? Something that the police should have taken care of

548
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,620
our Dong Sik willingly stepped in and took care of it himself.

549
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:19,660
And she's an officer, so she should be aware of these things that happen in the neighborhood.

550
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,790
What happened?

551
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,900
Here, come here.

552
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,520
So, a few days ago, some gangsters came to our restaurant.

553
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,220
Suddenly, they started getting violent.

554
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,610
At that moment, Dong Sik, who had been sitting quietly,

555
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,960
he told everyone to go outside,

556
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,070
and in one go, bam!

557
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,010
Dong Sik did that to gangsters?

558
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,920
That's what I'm saying!

559
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,060
He may seem harmless, normally,

560
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:57,170
but he's someone who is, right in here, growing a beast inside!

561
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,120
At that time, even a few of his colleagues — Oh!

562
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,290
- They're here! These are the people! 
 - Hello!

563
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:03,700
Welcome! Wow,

564
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,930
talk about timing!

565
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,060
Hello.

566
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,240
During that time, too, it was all Director Seo Ji Hoon's doing.

567
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,530
Dong Sik got rid of the gangsters all on his own?

568
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,220
I'm not too sure, but didn't he come to work completely fine the day after?

569
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,940
He said that he scared them a little, and they backed down or something.

570
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,650
Some obvious talk like that.

571
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,190
He did it for us.

572
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,700
Anyway, his only sin is being too nice.

573
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:36,150
Last time, when there was a problem in the company, he tried to sort everything out on his own.

574
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,390
While pretending to have amnesia, even.

575
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,120
He pretended to have amnesia?

576
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,560
What are you talking about?

577
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,310
That day, before we came here, Dong Sik told us directly.

578
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,520
 They think I have amnesia.

579
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,230
 How long have you been ...

580
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,060
 Oh before when Mi Joo said "If we lie too, won't we be in danger?"

581
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,630
 I think it was before she said that.

582
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,760
Nonetheless, since that day, we come here.

583
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,450
The lunch special hangover soup is just ...

584
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,080
But Dong Sik didn't come with you?

585
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,630
Today is his monthly personal leave day.

586
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,820
He has a good performance record and has chosen the right line. Who is going to say anything?

587
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,000
 Naksan-dong serial murder case

588
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:39,830
 A relatively unconstrained but extremely competitive profession.

589
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,720
 While hunting the weak whom they loathe

590
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,440
 they may even think of themselves as predators,  
   Inherently violent

591
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,470
 They are inherently violent,

592
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,180
 skillful at lying and may possibly engage in phony relationships.

593
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,120
 No way...

594
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,150
That makes no sense.

595
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:35,170
 No matter how much I read the diary, there's nothing about suicide.

596
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,680
 I considered suicide enough to write a suicide note

597
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,120
 but there's no mention of it in the diary...

598
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,670
 It's so strange.

599
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,030
 My only option is to revisit what happened that day.

600
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,330
 Police Officer Sim Bo Gyeong

601
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,780
Hello? Yes, Officer Sim.

602
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,870
Dong Sik, where are you?

603
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,420
Are you busy today?

604
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,400
It's nothing really, but if you have time, I wanted to treat you to a meal.

605
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,800
We enjoyed the meat that you gave us so much

606
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,320
Oh no, I'm really not feeling well

607
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,360
so I think I should stay home and rest today.

608
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,370
Oh, okay. Get better!

609
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,210
 Society of Accountants

610
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,800
Have a good meal!

611
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,270
 September 13, 2019's Diary Entry

612
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,410
 I picked up an old homeless man.

613
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:18,340
 I found him in the Green Park restroom.

614
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,540
That's...

615
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,100
 That day, I kidnapped the homeless man

616
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,430
 and took him to the construction site to kill him.

617
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,310
 But on the same day, I wrote a suicide note

618
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,150
 and was going to commit suicide?

619
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,410
 How...

620
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,100
 Now it's becoming hard to hold my ground

621
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,860
Yes, Dong Sik. Are you feeling better?

622
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,210
I have something to ask you.

623
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,550
Could we meet for a moment?

624
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,260
You came so quickly.

625
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,820
Oh well, I was in the area patrolli— no, taking a walk.

626
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,460
But you said you were resting. What's going on?

627
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,350
Well, let's sit first.

628
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,020
Okay.

629
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,280
I have something that I have to check with you.

630
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,410
What is it?

631
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,860
The day I got into the accident,

632
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:21,190
are you sure that the diary that you found is mine?

633
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:25,420
Well, it's something you had with you so of course.

634
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,840
Is it possible for you to explain the accident in detail?

635
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,400
Dong Sik, is your memory coming back to you?

636
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,740
Pardon?

637
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,080
No, it's not that.

638
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,750
I was looking for a missing homeless person

639
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,230
the day that we got into the accident.

640
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,350
By any chance, do you remember this person?

641
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,620
I-I'm not sure.

642
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,120
If you have amnesia, you wouldn't remember his face but

643
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:15,510
is there anything about a homeless person in your diary?

644
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,350
Well...

645
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,140
 Right, she's a police officer.

646
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,350
Do you have your diary right now?

647
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,670
No.

648
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,570
It's at home.

649
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,000
What is that in your bag?

650
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,900
- Ah, that is ... 
 -  Do you mind if I check your bag?

651
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,860
Just for a moment.

652
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,580
Wait a moment.

653
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,740
 Seo In Woo.  
 I'm sorry.

654
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,570
H-H-Hello.

655
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:59,480
 Where are you? You didn't forget our appointment did you?

656
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,590
Oh, y-y-yes. I'm on my way. Yes.

657
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,710
I'm sorry but I forgot I had an urgent appointment in a short while.

658
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,350
Exc—

659
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:25,230
 Hotel Parc Chalet

660
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,680
♫  Baby, Listen to my heartbeat  ♫

661
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,290
♫  what am I telling you..!?  ♫

662
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:35,760
♫  pumping through my racing sprit  ♫

663
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,780
♫  I've been dreaming of someone  ♫

664
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,670
Oh, he's with me.

665
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,230
♫  caring loving sweet like chocolates  ♫

666
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:51,320
♫  Finally I have found you glancing  ♫

667
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,350
This place?

668
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,060
This is a place where things like the source I gave you last time couldn't even be considered an accompaniment to a drink.

669
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,560
Because any information or personal connections that's actually important in this field

670
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,940
doesn't leave this place.

671
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,770
If that's true, is it okay that I'm here?

672
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,860
You'll soon get used to it because you'll be coming often with me.

673
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,860
Ah, let the staff here take care of that.

674
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,200
No, don't bother.

675
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,190
I don't know why, but I feel empty if I'm not wearing it.

676
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,380
Shall we go in?

677
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,280
♫  I was just a fool confused longing for you..  ♫

678
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,840
♫  I was just a fool ...  ♫

679
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,570
If you're not a club member, you can't enter.

680
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,260
No, I came here with others, but while I left to go to the bathroom,

681
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,920
they went in first.

682
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,360
A guest must be accompanied by a member.

683
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,480
So he just entered a little while before, but he's not answering the phone now.

684
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,950
She's my guest so take good care of her.

685
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,390
♫  Hum.. my baby my babe  ♫

686
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:05,810
♫  now you are saying you love me more..more..more..  ♫

687
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,080
♫  let us be together ever  ♫

688
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,580
♫  evermore forever  ♫

689
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:18,930
♫  you'll be mine and I'll be yours  ♫

690
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,700
I appreciate your help there, but I have a party to join.

691
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,250
Why are you like that? If I give something, something has to come back.

692
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,230
- Pardon? 
 - I don't know from where you've heard a rumor and came here,

693
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:34,180
but there are exactly three kinds of kids like you hanging around the entrance here.

694
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,140
First, a call girl ("Ten Pro"), second, a reporter,

695
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,650
third a pretty girl who wants to change the kinds of people she hangs out with.

696
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,220
Which number are you?

697
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,720
Me?

698
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,100
- I'm off duty. 
 - What?

699
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,470
Because I want to continue to be off duty, if you don't mind, can you keep your paws off me?

700
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,370
Jo Yeong Min!

701
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,350
Yeah!

702
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:24,430
Long time no see!

703
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,850
- Who are you? 
 - This is In Woo's plus one, Yook someone...?

704
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,260
Anyway, Assistant Manager Yook.

705
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,220
Assistant Manager?

706
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:45,330
What's the occasion? You brought someone from your company, your subordinate at that.

707
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,740
He's my subordinate, not yours.

708
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,530
Be respectful. He is way more important to me than you.

709
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,360
Yeah? Fine.

710
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,290
He must be your lover or something.

711
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,920
The air is not good. There must be lots of fine dust.

712
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,440
Here, here! We're to congratulate you on becoming general manager!

713
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,180
So let's raise a glass!

714
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,020
Congrats!

715
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,540
Seo Ji Hoon, that bastard, he's a total lost cause.

716
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,690
Yeah, what happened?

717
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:28,150
There are so many rumors.

718
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,610
What kind of rumors?

719
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:33,030
Well they're obvious, right?

720
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,220
Did he start doing drugs again?

721
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,960
Well there are some rumors like that but the most absurd one is

722
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,360
that he got caught by some crazy psychopath who kidnapped and tortured him and nearly died.

723
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,320
That's why he kind of went crazy.

724
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,790
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

725
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,710
Daebak!

726
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,370
That really is absurd.

727
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,560
Isn't that right, Dong Sik?

728
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,040
Yes? Oh, yes.

729
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,030
Um, can you give me a second?

730
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:05,060
Enjoy this comfortably.

731
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:11,650
These people are only glamorous on the outside. They're not that great.

732
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,240
Yes.

733
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,810
Can you just give me anything strong?

734
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,060
 Let me get this straight.

735
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:45,740
 I killed a homeless man at a construction site. Before I ran into the police car,

736
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,790
 I was going to commit suicide.

737
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:53,210
 Exactly why? What was going on?

738
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,790
Why would you choose such a loser to play with?

739
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,130
Let's go. I'll change the people you hang out with for you.

740
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,690
Hey. Let go.

741
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,860
There's no need to refuse. You're number 3, aren't you?

742
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,380
I knew it from the beginning.

743
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,460
I said let go.

744
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,470
Hey, why are you doing this?

745
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,440
Guest, I'm sorry but you can't behave this way here.

746
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,380
Who are you that you can say what I can or can't do?

747
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:52,430
If you're sorry, just be sorry.

748
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:03,950
What are you doing? Aren't you going to bring it on again?

749
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,150
What are you doing!

750
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,940
Oh.

751
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:48,970
Be-before, you know the story you were curious about?

752
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:53,260
Well, I-I know something about it.

753
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,880
What?

754
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:03,860
But as you said, the air here isn't great.

755
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,600
My throat is so—

756
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,690
Just a second.

757
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,400
You said you were curious about what happened to Seo Ji Hoon, right?

758
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,040
I did it.

759
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,550
I was going to play with him a bit and then kill him, but

760
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,340
he begged me crying to spare his life.

761
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,520
Why did I do it?

762
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:42,040
I can't stand it when bastards think they're hard and act up.

763
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,290
Bastards like you and Seo Ji Hoon.

764
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,240
What are you talking about, you crazy bastard?

765
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,950
Sorry, but I'm not crazy at all.

766
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:04,490
I think you're not understanding so let me explain so you can understand.

767
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:11,410
"American Psycho"

768
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:19,590
Me? When I see guys like you, I think two things.

769
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:23,670
One is, "Wow, this guy must have it all."

770
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,610
"How much are his clothes?"

771
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:28,340
"And his watch? I wonder what car he drives."

772
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,580
"How many times more is his salary compared to mine?"

773
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,030
And you know what the other one is?

774
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:41,150
If I stab this into your head, how would you feel?

775
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,170
 A pathetic bastard who only growls at the weak.

776
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:07,030
 Not even worth dealing with.

777
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:11,130
 This is boring.

778
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,540
 Am I already sick of this?

779
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,570
 That's why I couldn't kill Seo Ji Hoon?

780
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:22,240
 No, that's why I didn't kill him.

781
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:28,090
Before, that guy, he's an executive at a company larger than ours.

782
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,890
I'm sorry.

783
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,710
There's no need to be sorry. I know that feeling.

784
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,840
Anger flared up.

785
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,900
Because someone who's worthless acted up without fear, not realizing who the real predator is.

786
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,270
You surprised me.

787
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,360
What? You want to move onto the second round with me or something?

788
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:14,920
Hey, I'm not in the mood so get lost.

789
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,340
I said get lost!

790
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,500
I told you before that I'm off duty.

791
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,320
I won't arrest you so I am skipping your Miranda rights.

792
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,040
Before, what did that guy say to you?

793
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,310
Well that... ah!

794
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,130
How do I know?

795
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,340
Because I felt the same.

796
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,960
Now I'm certain

797
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,450
that you and I are cut from the same cloth.

798
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:03,590
Perhaps, we could have some fun together.

799
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:19,720
You may not feel that way quite yet

800
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,850
because you don't know too much about me.

801
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:26,570
The truth is, I have a secret hobby.

802
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:31,960
When I see weak and pitiful creatures, I get nauseous,

803
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,940
so I want to get rid of them completely.

804
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:46,230
Just like when I kill the ants that are struggling to carry breadcrumbs by crushing them with my finger,

805
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:51,580
or set on fire a mayfly that's going around in circles

806
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:55,240
while living out its short-life.

807
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,630
The truth is, I too

808
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,560
used to be that way.

809
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:18,740
But now, I don't really have any interest.

810
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:21,150
How should I put it?

811
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:25,910
It feels like I'm also becoming pitiful.

812
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:36,780
I had a lot to drink so I'll be off.

813
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,040
Wait.

814
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:14,490
What? What did you just say?

815
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:18,790
That jerk is a psycho

816
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:21,610
murderous bastard.

817
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,020
 Psychopath Diary

818
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:07,000

819
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,060
 The serial murderer that you've been chasing after turns out to be Yook Dong Sik?

820
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,470
 That's why no one suspects him. He looks so kind and innocent!

821
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,690
 Is it okay to just stand back and watch?

822
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:23,190
 Let's just watch. I'm sure his true identity will be revealed.

823
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,520
 - Hyung-nim. 
 - Pardon?

824
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,090
 From now on, I'll regard you as my hyung-nim.

825
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:32,480
 The serial murderer who Officer Sim is chasing after, I wonder who that person really is.

826
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,140
 I'll tell you. What I'm hiding.
