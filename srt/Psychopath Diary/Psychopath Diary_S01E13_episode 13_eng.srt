 Psychopath Diary

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,030

3
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,920
 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,410
 Episode 13 
  You mean, there's someone who's been more wronged than me in this world?

5
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,540
 Because of that diary?

6
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,610
Oh, my stomach!

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,430
So, you're saying you and I are locked up in here because of that real predator!

8
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,860
Now... what do I do?

9
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,400
Lift that toilet slightly and try moving it.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,310
Do you know a movie called Shawshank Redemption?

11
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,430
I'm sure you've seen it, since it's a masterpiece.

12
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,590
There's a character just like me in it.

13
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,050
Someone who was falsely imprisoned and tries everything to clear his name,

14
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,490
but it doesn't work, so he chooses to escape.

15
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,590
This toilet?

16
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,320
That's right. Why my nickname became Poop Fly,

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,370
why I smell so bad, you get it now, right?

18
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,260
You dug this yourself?

19
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,900
When I came in here in the beginning, I was just like you.

20
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,490
I didn't do anything wrong. I was wronged,

21
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,330
so I believed I could get out.

22
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,330
But... "Wow, I don't think I'll be getting out."

23
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,220
It took me four years to realize that.

24
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,810
I was so angry and dejected that I picked any one person to fight with.

25
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,380
I got beat up to the point of near death, and got dragged into the penalty room.

26
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,400
I cried all night like you, but ...

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,890
But?

28
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,110
I discovered that toilet.

29
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,080
It was constructed really badly, so it didn't work too well.

30
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,500
It was from that moment on...

31
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,600
I dug a little at a time, and whenever I got out, I'd make it look perfectly normal.

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,570
Whenever I got a chance, I'd cause trouble and come back in.

33
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,120
I couldn't have dreamed that all the physical labor I got ridiculed for doing all my life

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,800
would help me this much.

35
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,440
Hey, young friend, listen well.

36
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,660
That hole follows the sewer pipe just big enough for one person.

37
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,490
I think the line here is a bit...

38
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,680
 The non-separable sewer pipe connects to the main drain pipe.

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,250
 In other words, if you go down the pipe,

40
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,900
 you'll get to the main drain pipe that leads to the outside.

41
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,020
 So I dug with just one spoon.

42
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,850
 I kept digging.

43
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,150
  And I excitedly dug the soil away.

44
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,110
 And it really came out.

45
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,820
If you break that pipe and go in, you should be able to get to the outside.

46
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,230
Of course, the process will be the most excruciating and painful, but deal with it. Freedom smells of blood...

47
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,960
Freedom naturally smells of blood, no, it stinks of shit!

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,640
- Wait a minute. 
 - Why?

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,170
You want me to escape?

50
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,290
Right!

51
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm already feeling victimized since I've been falsely accused, and you want me to be an escapee?

52
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,100
Then say to yourself, "Someone will get me out."

53
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,100
"Someone will clear my name," and try waiting day and night.

54
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,340
People soon forget the likes of you.

55
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,340
The police? Those are the people you can trust the least.

56
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,740
You'll find out after rotting in here for four, five years.

57
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,220
Wow, I threw away a lotto ticket that was given to me for free.

58
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,030
Well... then you should go out yourself.

59
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,710
Why do you ask me to escape?

60
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,590
Me?

61
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,350
I've gained weight now, so I can't go through that hole.

62
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,930
The food's become really good here these days, so dieting is harder than escaping.

63
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,310
Still, you saw that guy,

64
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,560
so if you get out, wouldn't there be a better chance of finding the real culprit?

65
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,510
From seeing just the back of him eight years ago?

66
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,260
Finding a needle in the white sandy beach would be faster.

67
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,240
You're the one who said your memory came back for a second.

68
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,470
Did you see that guy's face when you picked up that diary or not?

69
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,180
That's...

70
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:26,460
I don't know. I remembered just that I wasn't the one who tried to kill the homeless man.

71
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,690
The face of the culprit...

72
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,410
That's good then. It's only a matter of time before your memory comes back,

73
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,000
and you just have to catch that guy yourself.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,990
This is the only way you've got.

75
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,660
Go out that way. Find the real culprit yourself, and clear your name.

76
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,260
Oh, stop talking nonsense!

77
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,730
I'm already having difficult feelings. What do you mean, escape?

78
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,620
Hey, I'm giving away something I worked so hard to dig up for four years!

79
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,430
Never mind. To me...

80
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,730
I have someone who believes that I'm innocent.

81
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,670
Okay then.

82
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,670
Of course you do. Let's wait and see.

83
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,420
 Psychopath Diary

84
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,040
 Why? Just because you killed a few people you thought I'd throw you out or something?

85
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,560
 Well, if you hadn't cleaned up properly after yourself, I might have done that.

86
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,820
 But you took care of things perfectly.

87
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,270
Then, should I slowly finish things up?

88
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,510
I'm sure he went to a good place.

89
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,000
Please put your mind at ease.

90
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,930
To him ... he was no different than a biological brother.

91
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,860
Bo Gyeong also adored him so much...

92
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,590
- Taek Soo 
 - Yes?

93
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,470
That is ... You see ...

94
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,390
Sunbae, you must also be heartbroken.

95
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,420
Get some rest. Captain Ryoo was a really brave officer.

96
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,230
From such an unfortunate accident like this...

97
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,220
I wish that had been the case...

98
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,000
I know... What?

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,500
I don't think Captain Ryoo's death was an accident.

100
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,190
Can you help me?

101
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,410
  Until now, I was being played by that bastard.

102
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,810
What a good voice he has!

103
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,870
To think all of that was a delusion...

104
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,630
I'm so dumbfounded at my own stupidity, it makes me so angry!

105
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,250
On top of that, if I didn't kill Park Mu Seok either,

106
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,620
I was made a complete fool by the real culprit!

107
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm ...

108
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,190
getting out of here.

109
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,400
Have you decided?

110
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,010
Yes.

111
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,350
The smell inside the penalty room is pretty bad, isn't it?

112
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,320
Try not to end up back there again.

113
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,010
You told the guard you want to meet an attorney?

114
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,140
Yes.

115
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,800
You can speak comfortably.

116
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,350
Nowadays a corrections' position is also no different from a service job.

117
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,150
We frequently listen to prisoners and speak face-to-face like this, too.

118
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,050
I would like to request a retrial.

119
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,260
Retrial?

120
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,150
Truthfully,

121
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,750
the day I lost my memory in an accident, I found the diary.

122
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,210
I mistook the entries as something that I wrote.

123
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,490
The real criminal knew I was all out of sorts,

124
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,150
so he tried to frame me. And to frame me, he planted all the evidence as if I did it.

125
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,540
Then, you were completely framed.

126
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,270
And that predator serial killer is still running around out there.

127
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,720
That's what I'm saying!

128
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,130
That's serious. How could something like this ...

129
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,390
I know.

130
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,250
I'm really—

131
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,940
How can there be a worse bastard in this world?

132
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,350
What?

133
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,080
I've met some bad people in my life,

134
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,630
but none as evil a bastard as you.

135
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,340
I'm being serious!

136
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,900
You don't think I know you're trying to get out of here knowing Captain Ryoo is dead?

137
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,240
Who died?

138
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,820
See? Look at how you're lying without blinking an eye.

139
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,310
The investigator in charge of your case, Captain Ryoo, as soon as you heard he died in an accident,

140
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,320
you're trying to pull a stunt asking for a retrial or whatever!

141
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,700
Bastards like you should never see the light day of again.

142
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Why? Because until the day you die, you're not even human.

143
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,570
Never.

144
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,550
Drag him away!

145
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,210
  Just like you said, he's a really unbelievable bastard.

146
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,210
That's why I felt I needed to tell you, especially.

147
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,980
Our company's image has also suffered greatly due to him.

148
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,720
Just because he looks innocent, if you treat punks like him humanely,

149
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,710
you can suffer greatly.

150
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,870
Yes, you're quite right.

151
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,480
But Director, the 300 million fund matter you mentioned before ...

152
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,980
The payment has already been sent.

153
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,020
 It should be enough to buy a house for your daughter when she gets married.

154
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,650
Thank you.

155
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,860
It's nothing. I only wanted punks like Yook Dong Sik to be punished appropriately.

156
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,320
So I wanted to return the favor to you who think the same way.

157
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,510
Since we don't know what other tricks he might try,

158
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm also thinking of restricting his visitation and phone calls for a while.

159
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,170
That's a great idea.

160
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,710
Retrial?

161
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,790
Will that work without Sim Bo Gyeong?

162
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,130
I'm Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong from the Naksan District.

163
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,050
I'd like to meet the truck driver from Captain Ryoo's accident. He's in the back, right?

164
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,950
That man already went home.

165
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,300
What? It was an accident involving a death. Shouldn't he be in custody for investigation?

166
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,360
He had insurance. And it wasn't a hit and run or a DUI.

167
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,490
Even still—

168
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,680
Their attorneys said they would settle with the bereaved family,

169
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,590
so there's nothing left for us to do.

170
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,850
This quickly?

171
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,950
His attorneys must be good at their jobs.

172
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,820
Did you meet the driver?

173
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,680
He must make a pretty good living. It seems he hired a very good lawyer.

174
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,130
No matter how certain they are of the circumstances of the accident,

175
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,610
how could they settle it that rapidly?

176
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,090
Are you saying someone instigated it?

177
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,880
If we dig, we should be able to find out.

178
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,440
I got his address for now. Let's go.

179
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,150
Sunbae, hold on.

180
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,560
I still haven't, the things that you told me,

181
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,630
I still don't have a good grasp of it.

182
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,960
So, Yook Dong Sik was framed, and the real predator murderer is a different person.

183
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,910
Okay. I get that part.

184
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,640
But what about Captain Ryoo?

185
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,050
What does his accident have to do with this case?

186
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:04,530
I think Captain Ryoo knew who the real predator murderer was.

187
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,590
C-Captain Ryoo did?

188
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,930
Didn't he apply for a new trial?

189
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,310
Yes, he's got some nerve. He's shameless.

190
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,850
It seems like the fact that you went to see the chief and blabbered about everything has already spread.

191
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,210
Never mind the retrial, the atmosphere only became more menacing.

192
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,650
So what? You're going to tell me to escape again?

193
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,990
I'm just saying, take your time and think about it.

194
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,460
For about five years?

195
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,180
But I have Sergeant Sim.

196
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,710
The most untrustworthy people in the world are police officers, I said.

197
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,740
But she's different.

198
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,020
She said she'll visit again soon.

199
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,100
I was wondering where this smell was coming from. We have two pieces of crap now.

200
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,400
What did you just say? What did you say?

201
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,370
Were you saying that to us?

202
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,680
You said you hurt your head and can't remember anything.

203
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,270
We heard you said your killing people was all a delusion.

204
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,170
Well, what then? Should we help you remember?

205
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,120
Did you forget who I am?

206
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,320
Predator or whatever, no one man is strong when it comes to a gang fight!

207
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,190
Fellas!

208
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,310
What are you doing?

209
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,970
Hey, fellas.

210
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,330
What are you doing over there?

211
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,240
You got lucky today.

212
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,060
If she's visiting, she better hurry.

213
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,870
But she probably won't come.

214
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,750
Ah, seriously.

215
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,950
Anyone home?

216
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,230
Are you home? This is the police.

217
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,120
We have some questions regarding your recent accident.

218
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,600
Hello? Sir.

219
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,520
This is the police. Please step outside.

220
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,430
Sir, we know you're inside.

221
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,720
We can hear you.

222
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,130
No one lives there.

223
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,150
What? Why?

224
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,250
They said they were moving overseas all of a sudden.

225
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,870
Overseas? Where?

226
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,910
Oh, I don't know. They were taking a lot of stuff so it didn't seem like a vacation, so I asked.

227
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,290
They said they were looking into emmigrating while staying overseas several months or longer.

228
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,080
Said they may never return.

229
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,870
 Advanced Correction Implementing the Opening of the Future

230
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,920
Really?

231
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,860
Okay, I understand. Thanks.

232
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,610
It is true he left the country. Like it's some flight-by-night...

233
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,030
You were right. It's definitely suspicious.

234
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,960
Killing people by using someone else?

235
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,000
This isn't like the predator.

236
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,960
No, probably since Dong Sik is imprisoned instead, is he being more careful?

237
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,460
I can see very clearly what's going on.

238
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,720
Wouldn't it be worth requesting a retrial?

239
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,150
- Visitation request for Prisoner 9362, Yook Dong Sik. 
 - Yes.

240
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,350
He's under discipline so there will be no visitation this week.

241
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,560
Discipline? For what?

242
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,690
I'm unable to say. Please try again next week.

243
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,910
Whether she is a corporal or a sergeant, you still haven't heard from her I guess?

244
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,680
I think visitation has ended for today, too.

245
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,900
She'll probably come tomorrow.

246
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,200
See? You can't trust anyone.

247
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,480
There's only one solution.

248
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,400
Prison break. Prison break, prison break, prison break.

249
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,980
Stop talking about breaking out of prison!

250
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,240
B-B-Be quiet.

251
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,410
Then, why don't you escape?

252
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,790
I told you I'm too fat.

253
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,980
Then, lose some weight!

254
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,010
If I exercise for a few months, I could lose weight.

255
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,860
But in a year, I'm getting out of here anyway.

256
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,880
At first, it was so unfair, I started to dig out an escape route.

257
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,250
But once I finished digging, I realized I didn't have much time left here.

258
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,510
I started getting scared. There's not much time left of my sentence,

259
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,140
so if I recklessly escape and can't find the real culprit,

260
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,550
I'll be a murderer and escaped prisoner like you said.

261
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, at this stage,

262
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,510
even if I'm exonerated, it's not like my family will come back.

263
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,610
I can't even be compensated for the time that I wasted away in here.

264
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,780
But you at least have hope!

265
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:49,130
If there was even one person who believed I was innocent like there is for you,

266
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,940
I would have gotten out of here.

267
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,380
Ah, the weather is nice.

268
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,840
What in the world could have happened?

269
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,610
Still, we'll probably be able to see him next week, no?

270
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,660
In the meantime, we'll request a retrial and—

271
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,060
Unless we find the real culprit, it won't be easy.

272
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,610
Then, what do we do now?

273
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,250
- We shouldn't have focused only on the accident. 
 - What?

274
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,300
If Inspector Ryoo's death was not an accident,

275
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,360
then my uncle died because he knew something important about the real predator murderer.

276
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,570
He may have left something behind.

277
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,960
Bo Gyeong.

278
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,900
The only things left behind at the scene I received

279
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,870
were just these.

280
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,500
But why did you want to see them?

281
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,720
That is ...

282
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,850
The things Uncle left behind,

283
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,920
I wanted to take a look at them one more time.

284
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,580
Okay.

285
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,950
To him, you were very special.

286
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,650
Mom.

287
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,270
Yes, what?

288
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,730
Don't we have something similar to this?

289
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,790
Dad used to use it.

290
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,660
Yeah, we do.

291
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,280
Where would it be?

292
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,270
But do people still use this nowadays?

293
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,670
Not really. You can use your cellphone for everything.

294
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,620
But if you wanted to leave behind an original recording,

295
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,760
or in special cases, it's still used.

296
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,320
   The man is under a delusion about crimes he committed.

297
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,120
Is that Uncle's voice?

298
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,400
Hold on.

299
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,680
 If I don't open my mouth,

300
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,740
 no one will know the true identity of the predator murderer.

301
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,540
What does that mean?

302
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,400
Ah, you scared me.

303
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,520
Oh, Honey. No, it's nothing. I didn't get caught.

304
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,310
 Nothing bad could've happened, right?

305
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,210
We can keep talking.

306
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,720
I'm ready to stay up all night.

307
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
Yeah, I remember that time.

308
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,680
You were the one who flirted with me in the street, after seeing my face.

309
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,580
 Yes.

310
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,980
Do you restore cassette tapes?

311
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,910
 I'm in front of your store.

312
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,240
I'm currently out for a repair.

313
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
Is there anything that can be done? I'm in a rush.

314
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,960
It'll take me 2 to 3 hours to get back.

315
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm fine with that. More than that, the damage is pretty severe. Is it still able to be repaired?

316
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,060
I'll have to take a look at it but it should be fixable.

317
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,150
Nowadays, people may use digital forensics,

318
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,020
but for things like that, I'm an expert.

319
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,720
Then, I'll wait for you.

320
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,920
What?

321
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,940
Let me use your phone.

322
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,730
You're crazy.

323
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,700
- Get lost. 
 - It'll only be for moment.

324
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,280
I'm under discipline so they won't let me use the phone.

325
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,460
I told you to get lost.

326
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,630
Ah, this bastard.

327
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,960
If you're going to beat me,

328
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,440
then hit me right here.

329
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,300
But will you be okay?

330
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,360
Even if I tell them I was beaten after asking to borrow your phone?

331
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,930
Hello?

332
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,780
Corporal Sim.

333
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,980
 I was wondering if something's going on.

334
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,640
Corporal Sim?

335
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,850
Hello?

336
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,690
Who ... who are you?

337
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,010
I-It can't be.

338
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,210
You ... you ...

339
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,880
If you lay even a finger on Bo Gyeong,

340
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,330
I won't leave you—

341
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,620
 The phone is turned off ...

342
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,890
 Bo Gyeong is in danger.

343
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,390
- Loyalty! 
 -  Yes, this is the police.

344
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,900
This is 112, right? Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong ...

345
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,590
Is she a sergeant now? That person is in danger.

346
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,530
What? Can you tell me in more detail what the situation is?

347
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,980
Why don't you go over there?

348
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,010
That predator is planning to kill Officer Sim Bo Gyeong.

349
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,900
 Are you saying that Yook Dong Sik, who's in prison, is planning on killing someone?

350
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,880
That's not it! Anyway, right now,

351
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,420
you need to track down her phone or car—

352
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,880
Prisoner 9362, what do you think you're doing now?

353
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,350
Ah, that lunatic.

354
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,270
Hey you. Why are you coming this way?

355
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,430
Hey, why are you ... Why? Why? Why?

356
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,980
Did you finally decide? Did something happen?

357
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
How long did you say it will take?

358
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,980
You won't know til you try.

359
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,600
What if I try my hardest and crawl like crazy?

360
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
I guess that will make you get out faster then?

361
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,590
 Shawshank Redemption

362
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,590
What's going on?

363
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,930
Hey Yook.  Are you really going out?

364
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,200
Number 9362, Yook Dong Sik.

365
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,270
Yook Dong Sik!

366
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,850
My stomach! My stomach! My stomach!

367
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,100
Guard, my stomach hurts!

368
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,370
Guard! Oh, my stomach!

369
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,070
- Open the next cell! 
- Yes! 
  - I think I need to go to the hospital!

370
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,750
My stomach!

371
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,070
 My stomach! My stomach!

372
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,650
 Doctor! Father! Please help!

373
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,680
  The t-toilet!  Yook Dong Sik has vanished!

374
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,360
My stomach!

375
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,420
Crawl, Yook Dong Sik! Keep crawling!

376
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,110
Yook Dong Sik!

377
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,480
Ouch!

378
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,150
- No! Let go! 
 - Get up quickly, son of a bitch!

379
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,460
Don't be stubborn.  Get up you son of a bitch!

380
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,490
Get up!

381
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,770
The smell of crap!

382
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,490
Cold!

383
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,830
You... when Inspector Ryoo, whom you relied on since you were a child, died,

384
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,890
the shock made you decide to kill yourself.

385
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,750
 Code Zero. Code Zero.  It's an emergency.

386
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,310
 Code Zero.  Code Zero.

387
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,920
 Yook Dong Sik escaped. Yook Dong Sik escaped.

388
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,630
So you want to save Sim Bo Gyeong?

389
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,560
But what can you do? It's too late now.

390
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,500
 A call just came through to the 112 report center.

391
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,430
 An unidentified man claiming to be Yook Dong Sik said he will kill Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong.

392
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,940
- What? 
 -  I said I'm going to kill Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong!

393
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,510
If you are making a prank call, you will be punished.

394
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:23,540
 I told you, I am the predator Yook Dong Sik.

395
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,640
Whether I escaped or not, you can check and find out.

396
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,440
If I got out, who would be the first person I would look for?

397
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,870
I would kill Sim Bo Gyeong,

398
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,540
who arrested me and put me in there.

399
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,430
 Escapee Yook Dong Sik has threatened to kill Sim Bo Gyeong.

400
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,450
 Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong, where is your current location?

401
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,140
 Her cellphone is turned off.

402
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,710
 Her car was seen passing the Naksan River tollbooth several hours ago.

403
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,040
 Using all available personnel, we need to secure the safety of Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong.

404
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,480
That pushover bastard.

405
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,450
 Serial Killer Yook Dong Sik has escaped.

406
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:14,640
 On top of that, he called into 112 and threatened to kill the police officer who arrested him.

407
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,910
 The police have mobilized  the entire police force to search for her.

408
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,950
We're here. Are you sure this is the right place?

409
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,250
Hold on. I think she is close by.

410
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,350
- I think she is over there! 
 Let's go!

411
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,450
Come.  Approach from all sides.

412
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,050
- We need assistance. 
 - Yes!

413
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,910
Sunbae!

414
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,260
Sunbae?  Who?

415
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,340
Sim Bo Gyeong?  We have secured Sim Bo Gyeong.

416
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,780
What is this? Why?

417
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,710
Find Yook Dong Sik!

418
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,410
What is it?

419
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,940
What are you suddenly searching for?

420
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,830
- That guy.  That guy took it. 
 - What?

421
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,730
But... why didn't he kill me?

422
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,560
What on earth are you talking about now?

423
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,680
I really thought I was going to become insane.

424
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,790
You went missing, and Yook Dong  Sik—

425
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,470
Dong Sik?  What about Dong Sik?

426
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,550
  Yes, we just learned the police successfully secured the identity of Sergeant Sim Bo Gyeong.

427
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,330
 They have confirmed that the sergeant is unharmed and safe.

428
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,990
 According to what's been confirmed so far,

429
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,650
  just before the sergeant disappeared,

430
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,450
 a report that Yook Dong Sik was going to kill the officer

431
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,410
 was received by the 112 report center.

432
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,740
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,970
He said he was going to kill me after escaping?

434
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,810
Dong Sik... No way.  Because of me...

435
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,660
What happened?

436
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,320
What do you think that guy Yook Dong Sik is thinking?

437
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:17,550
I will take care of it. In my own way.

438
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,890
It's gotten this out of control. How will you?

439
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,090
I have an idea.

440
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,850
You should.

441
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,900
Is there something you are hiding in the bookshelf?

442
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,400
If you are going to hide something, you should hide it perfectly.  Don't get caught.

443
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,160
I'll come out after washing up.

444
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,040
It's me.  Where are you?

445
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,030
In any case, the police force is in an uproar because of that nut, Yook Dong Sik.

446
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,550
According to the precinct detectives, he looks to be on the move after stealing some clothing and a bicycle.

447
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,720
Since there's no other connection than this town,

448
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,340
our patrol division is on emergency duty as of right now.

449
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,250
I said Yook Dong Sik isn't the person who kidnapped me.  It was someone else.

450
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,000
Yook Dong Sik was in prison when I was abducted.

451
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,570
The investigation of my incident should be conducted as a separate matter.

452
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,650
Right now, we've received an order for you to focus your investigation on the arrest of the escaped Yook Dong Sik.

453
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,540
Furthermore, the guy you arrested broke out of prison!

454
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,210
You should quickly apprehend him again!

455
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,340
Anyway, I was going to tell you something.

456
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,550
We have to re-investigate the Yook Dong Sik's case, too.

457
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,300
Let's put out the fire first before we do a second investigation or whatever.

458
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,840
Then you can figure out whether he did it or not.

459
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,620
And, Sim Bo Gyeong, as of right now, you are on a temporary leave of absence.

460
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,600
What?  Why?

461
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,590
It's an order from the higher-ups. Until Yook Dong Sik is apprehended again,

462
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:16,140
know that I have been ordered to provide you with a police escort.

463
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,120
A police escort?

464
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,150
Reporting for duty!

465
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,660
I think this is going to be difficult.

466
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,640
No. I said you don't need to be here, too.

467
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,020
You don't know when that brutal Yook Dong Sik will reappear.

468
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,210
But please don't worry.

469
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,670
You really seem to have no sense.

470
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,710
- Huh? 
 - What?

471
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,800
No, no.  Good job.

472
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,830
Work hard.

473
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,290
I need your help.

474
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,030
 Interview with a work colleague of Predator Killer Yook Dong Sik.

475
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,180
 Realistically, people can't be that nice.

476
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,010
 I can't believe he had such a brutal aspect.

477
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,210
 But did he really escape from prison?

478
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,270
 But this isn't a hidden camera prank, right?

479
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,930
So it wasn't a hidden camera prank...

480
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,710
 I guess that's why you came to interview me.

481
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,890
It's phony news.  Phony news.

482
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,830
Sunbae. Don't say you still believe in that person?

483
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,910
"That person"? Hey!

484
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,880
Dong Sik took care of you, accepted scoldings on your behalf, and did everything.

485
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,290
- But what? 
 - Hey.

486
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:47,340
Stop, huh? It's not that I don't understand what you are feeling, but stop.

487
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:52,570
T-Team Leader, is that what you think, too? You really think Dong Sik—

488
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:58,490
To be honest, he escaped from prison and threatened to kill the police officer. You saw the news too.

489
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,810
I did.  I saw the news.

490
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:05,460
But I think something wrong must have happened.

491
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,500
Mi Joo. Do you also think the same?

492
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,080
Me?  As for me ...

493
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,870
I don't think I can trust anyone anymore.

494
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:22,340
I don't even know how I should live in this world anymore.

495
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,230
These days, just talking about this makes her cry.

496
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,360
I know it's difficult for everyone, but please  let's accept it.

497
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:49,750
What are you doing?

498
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,710
I know you are not customers.

499
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,300
If you're going to spend all day here like that, you should order something expensive at least.

500
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,500
 Yook's Meat Republic

501
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,510
That kid is now no longer my kid! Just try showing up! I'm going to kick his ass!

502
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,280
Oh, no, Detectives, sir!

503
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,000
I will make mincemeat out of him with my own hands!

504
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,730
Oh, President, what's the matter with you?

505
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,710
Just in case he comes this way, I'm saying it so he will hear.

506
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,460
Where else would that soft-hearted kid be able to go?

507
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,130
If perhaps he's hanging around, he shouldn't get caught.

508
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,270
You son of a bitch!

509
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,360
Detectives, you've gone through a lot of trouble since the official documents.

510
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,650
How about a serving of steamed eggs on the house?

511
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,240
No, that's okay.

512
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,920
All right.  Take your time. Eat a lot.

513
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,700
 Yook Dong Sik Get out of here murderer! 
 Go Bankrupt!

514
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:02,530
 There is only one person who can help me.

515
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,520
 Officer Heo

516
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,950
Yes. Tell me.

517
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,930
 The CCTVs in all the crucial locations were out of order.

518
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,410
And on those that were normally functioning, he didn't leave any trace at all.

519
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,140
Wow.  The guy is really meticulous.

520
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,090
Was my car checked too?

521
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,050
 Yes.  It was wiped spotless.

522
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,230
No DNA, fingerprints, nothing.

523
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,960
What about Dong Sik?

524
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,530
In contrast to the meticulous guy, he was captured here and there on CCTV.

525
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:41,150
It seems like he is in Seoul, but we still don't have an exact location.

526
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:46,180
If he came to Seoul, it means he wants to reveal the truth.

527
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,170
Maybe he is trying to meet you

528
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,110
since you are the only person Dong Sik can trust.

529
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,620
You've worked hard.  For now, come here.

530
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,440
 Dong Sik... wants to meet me?

531
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,420
Hello, Sunbae.  Good morning!

532
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,120
Don't tell me you stayed here all night!

533
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,670
Impenetrable! I'm fine!

534
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,340
Just take it easy.

535
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,650
  At Naksan-dong intersection, there is a witness report of a person presumed to be Yook Dong Sik.

536
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,150
  Disheveled hair, dressed like a farmworker. Mobile patrol in the vicinity please check.

537
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,220
That's right in front.

538
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,440
I'll go take a look. You stay here for a second.

539
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,280
Where are you going? Sunbae, you stay put.

540
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,740
But ...

541
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,680
 Boring Day

542
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,860
 The predator is closer than I thought.

543
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,570
 If I am to catch him, I need to see Bo Gyeong somehow.

544
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,720
Where is Yook Dong Sik?

545
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,750
Hey! Put your gun away.

546
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,820
Oh. There! There!

547
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,500
Yook Dong Sik!

548
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,280
 We just received breaking news.

549
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,210
 Yook Dong Sik, on the run since escaping from prison, was spotted in the middle of Seoul.

550
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:16,400
 He still seems to be targeting the officer who arrested him,

551
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,840
 and he was almost caught through a citizen's report.

552
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,520
 But in the end, he's continuing his escape after shaking off the police pursuit.

553
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,060
First, listen to wh-what I have to say.

554
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,040
To tell you the truth, what happened is—

555
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,090
When you are on the run, it's best not to stand out.

556
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,120
What's with those clothes?  What's with the baggy pants?

557
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,350
Put these on.

558
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:02,980
Whether you came out through the front or the back door, you're out of prison now,

559
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,230
so take a bite of this first.

560
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,580
 (T.N. Released prisoners traditionally eat tofu.  The white of tofu symbolizes purity.)

561
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,510
You didn't eat, did you?

562
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,870
This. This.

563
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,750
Choco-Pie, bread, these, eat everything!

564
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,130
Chil Seong...

565
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:35,170
Move over a little.

566
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:49,070
I mean, it's not like you're fool. Why did you go there?

567
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,900
There are tons of cops there.

568
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,700
You're lucky I was on standby.

569
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,920
Bo Gyeong is the only person I can trust.

570
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:07,250
What about me? Did you think I would be-betray you ?

571
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,350
We're brothers.

572
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,180
Chil Seong...

573
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,510
Such a fool!

574
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,310
Don't cry.

575
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,720
I'm sorry.

576
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,300
Chil Seong, I'm sorry.

577
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,360
How did you let him get away?!

578
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,230
What did the station say?

579
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:49,660
Yes, they're deploying additional personnel to the district and doubling their patrols in the area.

580
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,640
Anyway, Yook Dong Sik must be holding a strong grudge.

581
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,000
Trying to enter into the very tiger's den!

582
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,400
- We had a situation, so...  
 - You're talking about a situation?

583
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,880
  A Boring Day

584
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,850
But... you're under such tight observation.

585
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,930
Could there be a way we could secretly have contact with him?

586
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,950
Like at a place only the two of you would know, for example.

587
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,140
You're right.

588
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,840
Wait a minute.

589
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,770
That 'beard'!

590
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,720
Why am I so happy to see that?

591
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,880
Ah! I've got a cramp!

592
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,800
Got a cramp!

593
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,720
That's so much like you, Hyungnim. That's so you.

594
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,560
Even after you've figured out my identity, you still call me Hyungnim.

595
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Well, once a Hyungnim, always a Hyungnim.

596
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,190
Still. Weren't you following me around because you thought I was a tough guy?

597
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:15,000
That's so childish. As if you're a child.

598
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,950
To be honest, I may look like a complete thug, but my fist is too soft.

599
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,060
That's why I was known as 
Beomil-dong's Water Fist 
   ('Water fist' is a way of saying a person is weak at fighting)

600
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:30,470
You see, a slight punch like this should be enough to kill them.

601
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,720
But throwing a punch like this makes my fist go like this...

602
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:39,090
And the hit is as gentle as a facial for the opponent.

603
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,330
That's why ... I was too embarrassed.

604
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,840
Do you know what I tell my guys?

605
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,910
I don't use my fist unless it's for something righteous.

606
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,010
I'm sorry.

607
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,800
It's nothing. Everyone laughed at me like that.

608
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:07,250
We're living in a time where you must be able to backstab your family as well as your brothers to succeed.

609
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:12,870
So that's why I was wondering whether I should leave this field. And, klop!

610
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:20,130
I met you. Strong to the strong and knows how to care for the weak, a real chivalrous fighter.

611
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:24,170
But I'm telling you, I was like that because I thought I was the Predator.

612
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,920
Hyungnim. Real strength,

613
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,500
does not come from there,

614
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,430
but from right here.

615
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,840
Just like you.

616
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:43,560
But anyway, we have to meet Corporal— I mean Sergeant Sim.

617
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,470
Should I secretly try to contact her?

618
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,570
The police watch is too strong, it will be dangerous.

619
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:54,880
And didn't you say you were even investigated as an accomplice?

620
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,140
So that only Sergeant Sim will know.

621
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,110
could there be a way to secretly leave a message for her?

622
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:32,660
Where was the light switch again?

623
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,570
Just a moment.

624
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:48,780
Hyungnim, after you were arrested, rumors spread that this was where a killer practiced his murders.

625
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,740
Why did we come here again?

626
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,890
You've just escaped the prison. Why are you trying to escape another room?

627
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,670
Are you hooked?

628
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,580
If Bo Gyeong were looking for me and trying to contact me in some way,

629
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,080
I thought she would come by here at least once.

630
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,710
A perfect crime.

631
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,900
I think that if I were to leave a message here, Bo Gyeong might see it.

632
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,260
  January 2nd, 14:00. Seorim Park.

633
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,380
I was right. She had the same thought.

634
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,110
  A Boring Day

635
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,620
A walk?

636
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:38,110
My father seems stifled being cooped up in the house. We'll just go get some air.

637
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,550
- But the situation at hand is not good. 
 - Hey!

638
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,070
Yes?

639
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:48,080
I'm going to go with her, so please stop worrying, I beg you!

640
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,310
But the situation at hand is not good!

641
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,670
You, really..

642
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,120
Sunbae, I'll stay here and keep watch.

643
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,790
Okay.

644
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,490
Taek Soo!

645
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,400
Please take my father with you.

646
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,060
Dong Sik!

647
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,060
Bo Gyeong!

648
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,780
What were you thinking, breaking out of prison?

649
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,400
The thing is that ...

650
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,770
Death threat? Do you know how much things have gotten worse because of that?

651
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:21,740
I had no other choice. I was afraid something bad would happen to you.

652
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,660
Why is your hit so painful? Gosh.

653
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,600
You're insane, really.

654
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,320
Why do all that for me?

655
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,970
Still, I'm glad you're okay.

656
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,780
I'm sorry. Because of me ...

657
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,330
you were arrested and even broke out of jail.

658
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,820
Thanks to you, I was able to get away from that terrible delusion.

659
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:11,790
Since things have ended up like this, let's make sure to catch the real culprit

660
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,690
with our own hands.

661
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:21,190
But then again, it's what we've been doing since before.

662
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:25,730
It's the two of us who know best about the predator.

663
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,000
Anyway, it's so like you.

664
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,710
How did you come up with the idea of how to contact me?

665
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:47,170
You said we should meet here.

666
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,150
At the escape cafe room.

667
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,590
What? Weren't you the one who left that note?

668
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,540
Hyungnim.

669
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,890
What again?  What should I do?

670
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,310
Yes.

671
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,780
Then this is ...

672
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,280
It's a trap.

673
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:05,710
 Psychopath Diary

674
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:14,900

675
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,170
 The memory was evoked. In a flash.

676
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,750
  You're the only one I can ask for help now.

677
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,210
 Where are you?  I'll go to you.

678
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:27,970
 Right. It wouldn't be all that bad to meet your fate while running away frightened.

679
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,540
 Sergeant Sim, something bad happened again!

680
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,350
  Dong Sik figured out who the real killer is.

681
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:37,850
  Dong Sik and I will make sure we capture him. 
  Evil Nightmare

682
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:42,150
  Will you be able to pierce through the bodysuit with a dull knife that only looks like the real thing?

683
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,950
  I will get you yet, Seo In Woo.
