 Psychopath Diary

3
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,990
 A serial murderer who terrorized people has finally been arrested.

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,650
 The suspect, Yook Dong Sik', has admitted to committing total seven murders,

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,830
 including six of which were conclusively identified in a diary,

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,800
 plus one additional murder.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,460
He's coming. He's coming.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,950
 Welcome. We work for the safety of the citizens.

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,390
- Why did you kill them?
- Why did you record the details of the murders in a diary?

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,350
How do you feel now? Do you feel any guilt?

11
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,460
Do you intend to request a psychological evaluation?

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,040
Will you be claiming temporary insanity?

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,280
We will make a further announcement after the investigation.

14
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,180
I'm not a crazy person.

15
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,650
I'm just a psychopath.

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,860
I'm a murderer.

17
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,410
Are you on your own...

18

23
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,750
It that starting again today?

24
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,180
For several days now, what's the matter?

25
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,610
 Yook Dong Sik, 3 months before the arrest

26
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,670
What the?

27
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,420
What's with your head on my threshold?

28
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,440
Ah ... that is ...

29
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,660
Isn't this apartment 608?

30
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh.  It's 708. I'm sorry.

31
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,010
Where do you work?

32
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,010
Daehan Securities Company.

33
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,050
A stockbroker.

34
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,960
Work hard.   But If I ever see you here again,

35
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm tossing your ass.

36
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,530
I-I'm sorry.

37

 Episode 1

38
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,300
Hello.

39
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,470
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

40
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,790
Hello.

41
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,920
 Employee Yook Dong Sik

42
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,260
Yes, if you try to do it on the 17th and the 18th, that will be fine. Yes,

43
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,170
Yes.  It's Yook Dong Sik from asset management team 3.

44
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes. Assistant Manager Park Jae Ho.  I think he's gone out for a while.

45
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,400
The report?  I'll tell him to submitted it right away.

46
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,660
Yes.

47
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,550
Jeez.

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,090
Dong Sik!

49
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,660
I knew our Dong Sik's Coffeeshop coffee is best for a hangover.

50
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,890
Hey, you just came? What if the boss find it out?

51
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,370
With whom do you think I drank till dawn?

52
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,790
Boss is not coming in until this afternoon.

53
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,190
We drank like whales last night. With whom? With  the guys from Yuseong Medi.

54
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,660
Yuseong Bio?

55
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,520
Hey, the audit department called to submit a report.

56
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,600
What?

57
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,140
Don't freak out.  Don't freak out.  You can take your time. What a chicken.

58
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,380
 Yuseong Biomedi 
Expectations of clinical advancements in the 2nd half of the year for Saui Pharamaceuticals

59
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,180
Was it really suicide?

60
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,690
Are you going to talk nonsense? It's not a time to play detective.

61
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,140
The trash-collecting old lady who was weighed down by living left the gas on to commit suicide.

62
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,590
On top of that, her body was just discovered after months because she had nobody to check up on her.

63
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,470
I also feel so sorry too.

64
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,300
The old lady even took sleeping pills.

65
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,180
Sleeping pills?

66
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,430
You can't go in. Come here.

67
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,870
- Let me in quickly. 
 - You can't go in.

68
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,290
What?

69
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,700
I can't see anything.

70
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,940
That's your future.

71
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,520
 Isn't it strange?

72
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,100
 What is strange? There could be ...

73
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,810
 Even others believe so, a true detective can't be like that.

74
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,300
 If the grandmother was thinking of dying when she took the sleeping pills,

75
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,200
 why did she come all the way here to do it?

76
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,720
 I'm not a detective.

77
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,280
 And, here ...

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,470
 Isn't this fingerprint a thumbprint?

79
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,990
 On top of that,

80
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,580
 it's blood splatter.

81
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,500
 What's this?  Maybe her finger was injured.

82
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,490
 There's something strange with this scene.

83
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,050
 There's nothing strange. Please stop saying useless things.

84
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,470
Sunbae.

85
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,390
What are you saying to yourself?

86
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,930
No.  It's nothing.

87
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Sunbae, perhaps ...  I'm just saying, what if.

88
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,030
- Do you see ghosts? 
 - What?

89
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,230
No. No.  The thing is...

90
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,880
Whenever you go to the scene where someone died,

91
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,110
- you talk to yourself a lot.  
 - It's nothing.

92
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,020
How would it be if you looked at the ghost?

93
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,290
You might see a ghost.

94
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,870
(The scene) reminds me of the past.

95
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,260
I used to talk to my dad about his cases, from the time I was a kid.

96
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,220
Dad's case book was more interesting then than reading fairy tales.

97
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,120
The legendary Detective Sim.

98
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,530
What legend?

99
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,500
Dad! 
  Boring Day.

100
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,830
 Boring  Day

101
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,470
 Daehan Securities

102
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,510
What should I do?  I'm in big trouble.

103
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,770
What is it?

104
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,000
Today is Song Hui's birthday but I couldn't buy a present.

105
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,330
This report is nearly done.  It jut needs to be finished and submitted.

106
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,860
I've gotten something to do.

107
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,200
Did I tell you do anything?

108
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,650
And what's the rush? You don't have a date. Where do you go every day?

109
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,000
Whatever.

110
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,330
Hey, what kind of good colleague are you?

111
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,930
I really have done most of it, so I'm asking a small favor.

112
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,200
Hey. I really can't do it.

113
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,030
I really can't either. I already sent everything by e-mail. Go confirm it.

114
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,450
You don't know what it takes to raise a child. Turn off my computer please.

115
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.  Good job.

116
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,790
 Yuseong Biomedi

117
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,450
 Chief of Asset Management Team #3 Gong Chan Seok

118
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,130
Oh.  What is it?

119
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,200
- Here. 
 - The report?

120
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,100
-Yes. 
 - Oh.

121
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,230
I finished it, but something doesn't sit right.

122
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,680
What, I heard Park finished it.

123
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,270
The thing is... the new drug clinical trial results are vague,

124
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,340
but it says here, "The FDA will definitely approve the drug."

125
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,000
It's been approved already.

126
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,970
Shouldn't we still look into this more?

127
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,880
Aish, what a frustrating punk?!

128
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,440
It was a direct order from the higher-ups. Just submit it quickly!

129
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,170
- But— 
 - Just hurry up and submit it!

130
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,450
You're stressing me out.

131
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,880
That dumbass is killing me.

132
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,750
What?

133
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,800
- It's nothing. 
 - Hey!

134
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,180
- Come here. 
 - Sorry?

135
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,540
Come over here.

136
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,060
This bastard, you...

137
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,020
You're unbelievable, you know that?

138
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,170
You little bastard. Hey!

139
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
Stand straight, stand straight.

140
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,490
Attention.

141
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,630
Even the pet dogs we raise at home freeze up out of fear

142
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,480
when they see a tiger for the first time.

143
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,750
You know why? Because it's part of their instinct.

144
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,520
They know they'll die if they act up.

145
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,750
Don't you have any sense like that?

146
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,240
Do you think it's okay that you're less than a dog or not?

147
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,880
No, right?

148
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,040
If you want to live, crawl accordingly. Now go.

149
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,690
Go.

150
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,180
That fumbling bastard.

151
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,620
He's a bit late today.

152
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,670
- Who? 
 - Oh.

153
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,260
I found someone to take the dogs on a walk.

154
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,520
There's no one in this world who does stuff like that for free.

155
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,920
There is. He's nice.

156
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,610
Your dad says the dogs listen to him well because he's nice.

157
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,020
He's really nice. Extremely nice.

158
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,250
Okay, okay.

159
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,610
But I guess he has no sense of time, this nice person.

160
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,150
Mom. Should I help out at the store? Your back isn't so good.

161
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,190
Forget it. If you're done eating, just go back to your work.

162
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,700
Go already.

163
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,990
- Thank you for the food. 
 - It was no problem.

164
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,810
I've got to run. Noona is leaving.

165
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,650
I'm going now.

166
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,450
 A Boring Day

167
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,420
They're just so full of fat.

168
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,410
How lucky they are.

169
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,000
Come here. Come here!

170
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,030
These little!

171
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,470
Are you looking down on me, you sons of bitches?

172
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,520
These little!

173
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,380
I'm sorry. He was abandoned, so he's easily scared.

174
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,880
You tiny little thing, you shouldn't be like that. Don't look down on me.

175
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,970
I did well back in the day.

176
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,670
The dogs look down on me.

177
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,880
- Let's go. 
 - Aish!

178
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,810
The dogs are dissing me.

179
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,290
Excuse me. If you haven't eaten...

180
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,920
you should take this.

181
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,900
Is this money?

182
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,550
Thank y—

183
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,140
This sobered me right up.

184
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,580
So this is a restaurant and it's my  father's.

185
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,990
If you give my name, Yook Dong Sik, you could get a meal.

186
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,980
What do I do with this beggar-like thing?

187
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm getting annoyed.

188
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,770
That rude punk.

189
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,480
 Yuseong Biomedi, which led the pharmaceutical industry's speculation frenzy,

190
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 was revealed to have hidden the fact that a death occurred during the clinical trial.

191
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,120
 It is a great shock.

192
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,650
 As they recorded their lowest daily stock price of the year,

193
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,630
 some investment companies who gave a positive opinion on the investments

194
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,820
  are under a rain of fierce complaints from their investors.

195
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,710
 The investors are asking that the companies be liable for the lax analysis of the business.

196
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,590
They're going crazy about this.

197
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,660
I had my worries after the team leader kept pushing us to do this.

198
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,750
 In some parts of the financial district as well...

199
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,740
What if this affects us, too?

200
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,430
We need to stay as quiet as a mouse, of course.

201
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,320
If we get caught like this, we're dead.

202
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,360
Hello, Team Leader!

203
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,620
I think you might be discharged for disciplinary reasons.

204
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,350
But, I'll talk to the higher-ups and make sure you get your severance pay.

205
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,470
Wait, but I — Assistant Manager Park...

206
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,490
He asked for my help so I just —

207
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,430
I know! I understand you so well.

208
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,160
But the higher-ups only care about who submitted this in the end.

209
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,800
They only looked at that.

210
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,090
Things like this can happen in the workplace, so don't worry too much. Oh!

211
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,090
You know Shinsung Securities, right? My college sunbae is an executive director there.

212
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,940
I'll tell him you're very trustworthy, I'll put in a good word for you.

213
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,170
I'm sorry, Dong Sik.

214
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,940
Since it ended up like this, can you just say you wrote the entire report?

215
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,180
Please? You know I'm having my second child soon.

216
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,550
We already signed the lease for our new home.

217
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,370
Please help me this once.

218
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,950
This is what friends are for, right?

219
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,880
Here. Here, have a shot. Okay?

220
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,100
Ahjumma! Bring us the menu!

221
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,230
You nice  kid.

222
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,130
Yes, Team Leader. Yes, of course.

223
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,620
Yes, it's all set up for you very nicely.

224
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,210
You know Yoon Dong Sik's our scapegoat.

225
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,200
Yes, there won't be any problems.

226
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,180
Yes, thank you!

227
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,120
 Daehan Securities - Office Construction Site

228
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,460
 By the time that building was completed, I wished that I would get to work as a Assistant manager,

229
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,800
 and buy a house nearby and walk to work,

230
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,860
 find a girlfriend, and pester her about getting married.

231
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,380
 That's what I thought.

232
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,970
Oh, how precious!

233
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,860
What's with the mic?

234
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,870
Now, please enjoy your meals, everyone.

235
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,730
Thank you! Thank you!

236
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,540
You worked so hard.

237
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,520
Please eat a lot.

238
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,480
It's good.

239
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,230
It tastes great.

240
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,380
Yes.

241
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,460
Why aren't you coming in?

242
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,360
It's delicious.

243
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,090
I heard it tastes good.

244
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,650
Please have a lot.

245
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,640
Why were you so late? Eat.

246
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,210
- This is expensive. 
 - Yeah.

247
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,000
What did you say you do for a living?

248
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,010
You know Daehan Securities, right?

249
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,390
He is a deputy section chief there, but he'll soon become team leader.

250
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,660
- Really? 
 - At such a young age too! How impressive.

251
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, it's nothing.

252
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,840
Oh, that--

253
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,750
Daehan Securities Firm? If your last name is Yook, then are you Yook Dong Sik?

254
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,100
Oh you know!

255
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,730
Of course, I know him. He's the one who is losing the entire severance package.

256
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,260
The pharmaceutical company that went bankrupt this time, he put up a false tip that their stocks would  multiply.

257
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,040
Were you fired for that?

258
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,670
I heard he wasn't even a manager. He was just a regular employee.

259
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,020
That's not true, right?

260
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,820
I'm sorry.

261
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,960
Do you think that apology is enough? How much bribe did you get?

262
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,220
Please stop!

263
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,360
Someone stop him!

264
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,200
Why are you doing this?

265
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,810
Still, don't you know?

266
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,970
I'm sorry but we have another reservation.

267
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,980
I'm sorry, we'll leave.

268
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,490
We paid money to rent this! If we sit or leave, what's the big deal?

269
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,230
And why are you always sorry?

270
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,200
You always bumble around like a fool, acting nice.

271
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,110
That's why people are taking advantage over you!

272
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,020
You fool.

273
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,570
  I didn't want to be taken advantage, either,

274
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,100
 but I thought that if I pretended to be a good person,

275
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,600
 at least someone would tell me.

276
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,480
  That it's not my fault.

277
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,640
  But as expected,

278
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,400
 it didn't happen.

279
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,930
 Daehan Securities

280
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,560
  I can't do this anymore.

281
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,100
  I'm sorry

282
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,180
 That's all that I'm capable of

283
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,790
 I'm truly sorry.

284
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,280
 Suicide note

285
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,170
I don't even have anything to eat,

286
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,080
but it comes out all the time!

287
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,170
It's hard, right? You must be tired.

288
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,360
Drink this at least.

289
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,470
It's fine.

290
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,150
I told you to drink it.

291
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,340
Oh, what is this?

292
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Look here! Someone!

293
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,540
Open the door, please!

294
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,190
Open the door!

295
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,570
Help! Help!

296
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,560
Save me!

297
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,670
Look here, open the door!

298
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,480
Help me!

299
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,540
You should have just chugged it down obediently. Now I'll even have to clean the bathroom...

300
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,550
How annoying.

301
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,680
Help me! Someone!

302
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,810
Open the door!

303
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,590
Please open the door!

304
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,720
Save me!

305
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,380
Spare me. Save me!

306
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,520
Spare me.

307
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,690
Please spare me!

308
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,500
Ah, I feel better. Let's go.

309
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,560
There's a homeless man inside, right? Tell him to answer the phone, it keeps ringing.

310
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,760
A homeless man?

311
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,690
He must have had something urgent to do.

312
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,110
 Leaving his entire fortune like this?

313
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,240
Right. Well, he must have had something urgent come up.

314
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,040
Let's go.

315
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,530
But, were these bathrooms always this clean?

316
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,470
Now that you say it ...

317
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,100
It does smell a bit like a violent crime.

318
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,400
 For sure something happened here.

319
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,630
 Something so dirty that it had to be cleaned spotlessly.

320
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,410
 Bo Gyeong, first we need to find the homeless man.

321
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,790
That car wasn't there when I came in, though?

322
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,450
Did someone come?

323
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,650
 Right. I'm not stopping because I'm scared.

324
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,310
 It's because it would be troublesome if were to be caught.

325
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,830
Record of September 13, 2019.

326
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,870
I killed an old homeless man,

327
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,890
Kim Myeong Gook, fifty-two years old.

328
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,710
He is a parasite-like guy who was using the new office building

329
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:02,380
and the  neighborhood park bathroom as if they were his house.

330
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,140
Crazy bastard.

331
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,000
Save me.

332
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,840
Vermin like you? Why would I?

333
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,020
Save me. Please save me.

334
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,610
Spare me.

335
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,200
Save me.

336
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,370
I beg you.

337
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,110
Spare me.

338
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,190
Save me!

339
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,430
Spare me.

340
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,180
Save me.

341
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,200
Sav— Ah!

342
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,140
Why this way?

343
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,060
I knew it! Sunbae you also smell something fishy, right?

344
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,580
I told you not to play detective.

345
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,390
Something is bothering me.

346
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,780
Could it be he was disguising himself as homeless, and he's actually a drug dealer?

347
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,010
- A wanted criminal? 
 - Don't overdo it, you're distracting me!

348
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,840
One-one-two (112, police number)!

349
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,370
One-one-two! Ah shit!

350
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,530
What do we do, what do we do?

351
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,440
Are you alright? Yes,

352
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,590
yes, yes!

353
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,780
Sunbae your foot, your foot! Your foot!

354
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,380
Oh I'm sorry! Oh what should I do?

355
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,390
Are you okay? Oh!

356
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,250
Are you alright?

357
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,520
Oh what do I do? Mister!

358
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,490
Mister! Open your eyes!

359
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,360
Mister!

360
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,340
Hurry! Hurry!

361
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,390
I got it, shut up.

362
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,950
It's a police car! People will move, right?

363
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,100
Sir, are you okay?

364
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,170
What are we going to do? I think he's unconscious!

365
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,440
Emergency Medical Center

366
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,150
I overreacted.

367
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,110
What do we say to the captain?

368
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,350
We should report this, right?

369
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,210
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

370
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,220
I heard that an acquaintance got hurt. By chance, are there any patients that were just admitted?

371
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,370
Over there, the second bed.

372
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,590
Yook Dong Sik, have you come to your senses?

373
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,740
But is my name Dong Shik?

374
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,430
It's retrograde memory loss.

375
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,400
Memory loss?

376
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,730
He doesn't seem to have any personal memories from before the accident.

377
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:23,930
Everything seems to be fine with his procedural memory and operational memory.

378
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:30,260
To put it simply, intellectual things and things he's learned through his body,

379
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,670
He can do things like solve math problems and ride a bike.

380
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,800
But he can't remember the past?

381
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:47,220
Then, he wouldn't remember why he suddenly ran in front of our car

382
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,700
while we were diligently doing our rounds, right?

383
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,420
I did that?

384
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,350
I'm so sorry.

385
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,970
No, it happens.

386
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,270
Well, that's fine, but his guardian...

387
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,540
It could be because it's so late but I couldn't (reach)...

388
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,490
One moment, please.

389
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,840
Hello, I am Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong, from Naksan district police.

390
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,740
Are you Yook Dong Sik's older sister?

391
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,530
Your younger brother got into a car accident.

392
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,100
Is he badly hurt?

393
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,010
No, that's not it.

394
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,480
The ligament in his left hand was strained but—

395
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,500
So you're saying he's not badly hurt? I'll come by tomorrow. Thanks!

396
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,650
Oh, my baby.

397
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,220
Hello? Hello?

398
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,490
Everything's finished.

399
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,950
Right.

400
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,760
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you

401
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,840
Goodbye.

402
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,220
Your taste is killer!

403
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,560
Dong Sik, I see you like this kind of thing.

404
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,890
It looks like it.

405
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,590
Do you remember anything after coming home?

406
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,750
That's a shame.

407
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,150
If you and I keep our mouths shut, there will be no problems.

408
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,780
Look! You can't even tell.

409
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,980
But what if he regains his memory!

410
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,190
It's all in this black box.

411
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,150
Sunbae, no way.

412
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,480
 As a police officer, are you trying to destroy evidence?

413
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,250
 Please stop!

414
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,230
 To me, this is just a job. It's just everyday life.

415
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,060
 Do you think it's easy to babysit you and take care of the household, Dad?

416
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,840
 They raised the rent for the shop and we might have to leave.

417
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,310
 If I can't get promoted this time, do you even know what will happen?

418
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:33,260
 Our family will have to starve!

419
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,740
That's true. That's true.

420
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,570
Me too. My parents and siblings are all relying on me.

421
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,980
This was left in the backseat.

422
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,650
If I give this back, I thought it might help him get his memory back but

423
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,410
I think it'd be better if you kept this.

424
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,260
 Like he said, returning it could help him regain his memory.

425
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,000
 - Why would I do that? 
 - Because you're my daughter.

426
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,410
 The daughter that wanted to be just like her detective father when she grew up.

427
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,590
Would it be better if I read it?

428
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,030
Who knows? They might be some weakness I can use against him?

429
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,320
 You aren't going to do that.

430
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,990
I liked this kind of stuff?

431
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,760
Dong Sik! Open the door!

432
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,900
Dong Sik!

433
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:23,920
I think this diary is yours. You must have dropped it in the car.

434
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
Oh, thank you.

435
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,030
By chance, if you regain your memory after reading this,

436
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,730
don't forget that I gave this to you!

437
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,580
Why? Is there anything funny?

438
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,600
Wait this—

439
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,210
The writing is written strangely

440
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,550
This. It looks like it was reversed.

441
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,870
April 24

442
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,150
And...

443
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,230
I think I know what this is.

444
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,220
It's here it's here it's here!

445
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,800
I think I saw this in these books.

446
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,020
Leonardo Da Vinci wrote like this.

447
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,360
He wrote it with his left hand. You need to look at it in the mirror in order to read it.

448
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,080
Wow, you can actually remember things you learned!

449
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,620
If I read this diary in the mirror.

450
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,590
April 24. Today—

451
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,860
 I killed another person

452
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:23,450
 The thrill of murder can't be compared to anything else.

453
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,330
 When someone begs for me to save him,

454
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,080
 when the blood pours out and the moment I stab him

455
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,120
 is the most thrilling.

456
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,310
What? Have you remembered something?

457
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,350
No.

458
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,350
No.  Even if I look carefully, I don't know.

459
00:48:51,760 --> 00:49:00,400
But,  your book collection, and writing the diary in code, show that

460
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,050
our tastes are similar. Let's be friends!

461
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,990
If you, perhaps, remember anything, let me know right away.

462
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,100
Because I'm worried.

463
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,550
 The only clue that will explain

464
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,590
 what kind of human being I was...

465
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,630
 This diary is telling me.

466
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:55,220
 I am a psychopathic serial murderer.

467
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,250
 Reservoir suicide

468
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,940
 Mister A, self-employed head of household with a pessimistic view on his livelihood, presumed to have jumped into a reservoir.

469
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,160
 Aspiring Entertainer Commits Suicide

470
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,270
 Aspiring Entertainer Miss L Found Dead in Her Home

471
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,880
 Even worse, while referring to myself as a predator,

472
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,720
 I killed no less than six innocent people.

473
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,670
 And I wrote down that process minutely to a point it is horrifying.

474
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:06,430
 I want to believe it's fiction but it is not.

475
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,220
 They are real incidents that have already happened,

476
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,160
 and the last murder victim was that night.

477
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,270
 I can't believe I'm a murderer.

478
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:23,850
 What's more, a serial killer who murdered six people!

479
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,480
What's that? He changed his door code?

480
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,190
Hey Yook Dong Sik! Open the door!

481
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,560
Yook Dong Sik!

482
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,720
Why don't you open the door?

483
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,200
Oh why is your face this gaunt? Was the accident a big one?

484
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,410
Let me look!

485
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,680
Look at this!

486
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,650
Who are you?

487
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,000
 Mr. Yook Meat Republic

488
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,680
Amnesia?

489
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,610
That's what they say. He couldn't even recognize me.

490
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:17,390
And Mom? Do you recognize her?

491
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,660
Is this person my mother?

492
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,910
OMG, daebak. He says you're his mother.

493
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,820
I'm your stepmother.

494
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,320
And he is my youngest.

495
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,860
Then my biological mother, where...

496
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,380
You punk. Your mom left this world twenty years ago!

497
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,940
You don't even remember that?

498
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,020
 Now that I think about it, there were parts about family in the diary.

499
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,460
Why didn't you answer your phone?

500
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,890
He must have lost it during the accident.

501
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,460
Really? That's great, Brother-in-law! There is a promotional event on the latest phone—

502
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,830
Hyung. You don't remember borrowing 100 000 won  (~$85 USD)  from me, right?

503
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,490
 The sister who enjoys meddling while pretending to care for me.

504
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,830
 The brother-in-law who's cunning and has a quick eye for profit.

505
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:15,070
 And even the step brother who looks like if you peeled his skull, you'd find udon noodles instead of a brain.

506
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,340
It's because this guy is feeble, that's why.

507
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,930
Honey. Go and get some drinks.

508
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,040
 But the mystery is,

509
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,330
 the patriarchal father who is being called President.

510
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,510
 In the diary, after the death of my mother,

511
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,030
 I struggled n order to be acknowledged by my father.

512
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,980
In broad daylight, what drinks?

513
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,380
Hey, if I tell you to bring it, just bring it! Why do you have so much to say?

514
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,780
 He absolutely doesn't look like a president...

515
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,110
Yes, yes, understood, President.

516
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,930
Pre-President?

517
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,400
I met your father when he was president of the neighborhood hiking club.

518
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,520
We call him that from time to time. It's not only me.

519
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:04,140
 No. It can't be.

520
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:10,150
 It's a coincidence. When it comes to family relations, it could match by chance.

521
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,980
 There should be another person who knows me.

522
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,290
 Even if it's not family.

523
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,630
 Daehan Securities Firm 
 Yook Dong Sik

524
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,760
Good morning. Good morning!

525
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,980
Dong Sik, Dong Sik. He hasn't come? My morning coffee...

526
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,400
 Suicide note

527
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,400
What is this?

528
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,120
Wait, wait.

529
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,100
 My friend Yook Dong Sik

530
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,620
 The person you are calling is not answering...  
 - Oh this Yook Dong Sik, shit!

531
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,600
I'm screwed.

532
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,420
Oh, Team Leader! Good morning!

533
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,030
- Good Morning. 
 - Oh oh, hi.

534
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:35,450
Seeing how Yook Dong Sik hasn't come yet, it looks like he won't come at all, right?

535
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,550
That is, it looks like he can't co— I mean!

536
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,970
It looks like he won't come.

537
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:47,690
Then report well to the audit team and go directly into the dismissal procedure.

538
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,590
Yes, Execute.

539
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,510
Yes,  I took care of it, so you don't have to worry.

540
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:57,370
Yes, of course! It's me. Of course, I took care of it well.

541
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,300
Right. I don't know anything.

542
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,390
The only thing I know is that this jerk didn't come,

543
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,810
and per Team Leader's instructions, the dismissal procedure...

544
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,220
Right, that's it.

545
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,400
Excuse me, is the Asset Management Team 3 here mayb—

546
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,350
Aaah, Yook Dong Sik!

547
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,510
I-I-I'm sorry! This I'll, I...

548
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,990
I didn't do it on purpose.

549
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,180
Perhaps, do you know me?

550
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,800
What?

551
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,360
Amnesia? So before the day of your suici— No, I mean,

552
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,030
your accident, you have absolutely no memory?

553
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,400
No.

554
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,800
Really? Really...

555
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,900
But are you going to keep talking to me this formally, with our relationship?

556
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,460
Were we very close?

557
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,440
Hey, I'm seriously disappointed!

558
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,010
We weren't just close, we were totally best friends!

559
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,650
Ah, is that so?

560
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,980
My apologies for not recognizing you.

561
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,350
I told you to drop these formalities. Why are you like this? Talk comfortably, comfortably.

562
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:23,500
But you know, I think it would be best if you don't say to anyone else that you have amnesia.

563
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,170
Why?

564
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,760
My friend, that is...

565
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:45,220
This task or whatever, I'll take care of it for now, so you just stay seated

566
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,210
as if there was nothing.

567
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:53,220
C-Coffee. It is the one you always enjoyed drinking, coffeeshop style.

568
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,360
Why is there so much, really.

569
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,360
 That is such a nice and gentle person.

570
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,330
 Could there be such a friend to a psychopath serial murderer?

571
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:14,190
 I don't think there was anything about this friend in the diary, though.

572
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,190
 No way!

573
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,780
 He does look like the perfect pushover to make use of.

574
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,310
Did you often make me my coffee, Jae Ho?

575
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:37,650
Of course! Between friends, is coffee such a big deal?

576
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,860
You're quite something.

577
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,530
 Was I using this naive friend as my coffee errand boy?

578
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,310
 As expected, I am... No.

579
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,480
 It can't be.

580
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,340
 The employees are being watchful with me.

581
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,880
- He's coming here. 
 - Uh?

582
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,520
- He's coming. 
 - He's coming?

583
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,890
To us?

584
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,820
- Should we go for coffee? 
 - Ah, coffee!

585
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,160
Good.

586
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,010
 They all look at me fearfully.

587
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,490
Section Chief, coffee!

588
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,350
- Iced Americano for me. 
 - Yes.

589
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,810
What is that? You said he wasn't coming! Shit, making it uncomfortable.

590
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:35,480
He should have known not to come, shit. When did the audit team say they'll be coming?

591
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,750
Tomorrow. But it looks like you don't have much to worry about.

592
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:43,080
I talked with him, and it doesn't look like he did that because he has something else in mind.

593
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,090
- Really? 
 - Yes. 
 - That jackass.

594
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,550
Why are you like this?

595
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,160
Is he glowering at me right now? Uh?

596
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,590
 Even my immediate superior is on guard with me.

597
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,750
He's even scowling!

598
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,680
He is thinking of screwing me over.

599
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,130
Why would he?

600
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,430
But then why else would he be pulling such a face?

601
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,510
What, where did that jerk go?

602
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,690
Team Leader, it's Yook Dong Sik.

603
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:16,100
C-Come in!

604
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,920
Why? What?

605
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,550
I want to leave early.

606
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,120
- What? 
 - What?

607
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,850
 At any rate, it won't do.

608
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:35,550
 If I want to get a sure answer, I'll have to go back to that place.

609
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:41,790
I was going to go slowly after seeing the traffic light change,

610
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:45,130
but you suddenly, like this...

611
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,090
 Daehan Securities - Office Construction Site

612
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,980
 Of all things, even the place...

613
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,530
Ah, you can go now.

614
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:04,900
No, it looks like it'll rain soon, so when you leave later, I'll bring you back.

615
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,760
- No. 
 - I'm fine, so go and come back.

616
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,520
I'll be on standby right here.

617
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,920
 Spare me.

618
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,120
 Save me...

619
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,470
 Please spare me! Save me.

620
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:56,360
 Spare me!

621
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,530
No.

622
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,730
 Record of September 13, 2019.

623
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:06,520
 I killed an old homeless man.

624
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,960
No!

625
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,480
 I'm a murderer?

626
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,710
  I'm a psychopathic murderer?

627
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,660
Dong Sik!

628
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,240
Wh-What's the matter?

629
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,830
Did you remember something?

630
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,370
No!

631
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,760
No!

632
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:42,200
Dong Sik. Seriously, what's going on?

633
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,220
Okay, okay. Well, first off that's a bit dangerous, so why don't you get in the car?

634
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,420
What's wrong! Dong Sik!

635
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,230
Did he remember something or not?

636
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,480
How frustrated he must feel...

637
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,170
Why do you look blank?

638
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:18,610
But then again, this is the time when we feel sleepy. I'll get you a cup of coffee, okay?

639
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:24,950
Jae Ho? What kind of person was I?

640
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,750
- What? 
 - Oh.

641
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:31,830
I just don't have any memories at all. I could remember more easily if you just tell me.

642
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:37,300
As my best friend, what kind of person was I?

643
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,110
Do you want me to be honest?

644
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,400
Yeah.

645
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,180
You were, well, a pushov-

646
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,270
I mean, like...

647
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,290
Yeah. Likable.

648
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,170
That's right. Likable.

649
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:55,570
Yeah, because you were so kind!

650
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,870
Kind? Me?

651
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,630
Of course. You were responsible and loyal.

652
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:07,730
Like what happened with Yuseong Bio.

653
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,100
Yuseong Bio?

654
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:14,370
Yeah, you were going to take responsibility for our entire team.

655
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:16,530
For our team members?

656
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:20,260
 Don't Ask Yuseong Biomedi Not to Explode. 
The Sound of An Investment

657
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,730
 Such a thing happened.

658
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:27,580
 If this went wrong, it would have put the whole team in jeopardy.

659
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:30,940
 They said I took responsibility for this, right?

660
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:37,450
 There's no way someone who sacrifices himself for others could be a psychopath.

661
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:42,730
- Yook Dong Sik. 
 - Yes?

662
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:47,250
We're from the audit team. Please, follow us.

663
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,630
I take responsibility for everything related to Yuseong Bio.

664
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:22,510
Why are you like this all of a sudden? Like you're being framed.

665
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:24,980
How much did Team Leader Gong promise you?

666
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,630
I'm sorry? Oh.

667
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,440
T-Take care of what?

668
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,020
You must be receiving money for taking the fall.

669
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,830
Oh, no! I didn't receive any money.

670
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:41,550
I guess it's true.

671
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:49,120
Yook Dong Sik, you really are as they say you are.

672
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,050
As they say? What do you mean?

673
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:54,320
A fool who is timid and an easy mark.

674
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,750
A person who can't refuse and does whatever someone asks, a pushover.

675
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:06,820
Somebody like that made a deal and wrote a fraudulent report all by himself?

676
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:12,040
Do you even have the guts to do that?

677
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:16,000
Team Leader Gong and Assistant Manager Jae Ho Park pushed for Yuseong Bio after making a deal,

678
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,830
and they asked you to take the fall for it all.

679
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,680
I don't know what you've heard from other people, but get it together.

680
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,480
You're totally being used.

681
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,330
I'll ask one more time.

682
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,920
Is it true that it was all your responsibility?

683
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,520
That—

684
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:43,100
I don't know.

685
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:47,970
I... don't remember.

686
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,690
To our beloved Dong Sik!

687
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,630
For Dong Sik!

688
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:01,450
Yook Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

689
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:04,200
- One shot! 
 - Okay!

690
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,950
While you're at it, sing us a song! How about it?

691
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:20,140
- Sing! Sing! Sing! 
 - I'll just go.

692
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,760
- Sing! 
- I'll go.

693
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,560
Nine-two-seven-six.

694
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,280
- To the front, to the front. 
 - Go up, go up.

695
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:37,650
 An idiotic, timid pushover. A person who can't refuse

696
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,260
 and does whatever someone asks, a fool.

697
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:44,210
 Those people weren't afraid of me.

698
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,390
 They didn't want anything to do with me.

699
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,250
Hah...

700
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,980
This can't be my diary.

701
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:20,050
Because I'm not a predator or a psycho murderer.

702
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,830
In fact, a human like me...

703
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,200
  Manager Seo Ji Hoon  
- Turn off the song! Turn it off!

704
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,500
Turn it off!

705
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,300
Be quiet!

706
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,530
Yes, Managing Director. Yes, well actually, Yook Dong Sik is with us and...

707
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,330
Yes, we're throwing him a farewell party.

708
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:38,220
Excuse me? There's— There's no way.

709
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,790
Yes. Yes, I understand.

710
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:43,030
I'm sorry.

711
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,820
Hey, stupid. Did you do that on purpose?

712
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,170
I was going to wrap it up nicely for you, but now you're trying to screw me over?

713
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,300
What?  What are you saying?

714
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,560
I heard you played innocent.

715
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,170
The audit team is returning tomorrow to speak to me and you to compare our stories.

716
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,890
Ah seriously, I just can't believe this right now.

717
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:22,300
Hey, you fool who's not even worthy of being a dog,

718
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,580
are you going to try and pull one over on me or what?

719
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,820
- Fool. 
 - Yes, you foolish pushover.

720
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,180
Yeah, you're not even worthy of being a dog, you fool.

721
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:39,050
 Is that how it is? It must be.

722
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:43,530
 I ... was a pushover.

723
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:48,330
What? You think you're something?

724
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:54,020
I'm sure you think you are. But you should try to think some too, huh?

725
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,830
If you make an issue of everything, our whole team is going to fly out the window.

726
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:00,190
Are you going to take responsibility for all these guys forever, you bastard?

727
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:05,020
This bastard, now that I think about it, you're a selfish bastard, aren't you?

728
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:09,680
Yeah, you bastard. Are you going to take responsibility for all of them?

729
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:17,660
I'm sorry.

730
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:22,420
You're sorry? That's not what I want to hear anymore, get it?

731
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,390
See what happens if you try something again tomorrow.

732
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:29,520
Try something with that smug head of yours.

733
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,080
I'm going to make it so you can't step foot in this industry again. You understand?

734
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,610
I really! I'm astonished. This bastard. What?

735
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,560
Move!

736
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,610
Ah, go, go inside, go inside.

737
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:53,380
I'm appalled. That— Honestly.

738
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:13,750
 Daehan heads to the world.

739
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:35,670
I was going to treat him nicely and now he's trying to screw me over.

740
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,060
Honestly, that bastard.

741
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,630
- Team Leader 
 - You scared me!

742
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,820
What do you want, punk?

743
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,150
Can I tell you something funny?

744
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,620
What are you saying? That bastard.

745
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,020
You know our company is building a new construction site, right?

746
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:09,030
There was a homeless man that wandered around there.

747
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,620
What are you doing? Huh?

748
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,390
Hey.

749
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:28,940
Someone went and opened the doors one-by-one, like this.

750
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:32,910
Are people here or not?

751
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,860
Even while I was checking,

752
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,030
he just stood there.

753
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:46,100
It's idiotic, isn't it?

754
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,350
Hey, what are you  doing? Huh?

755
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:57,060
If you made the crap, you should clean it up.

756
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,360
Hey, Dong Sik! Hey!

757
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,260
If I'm treating you nicely, just leave.

758
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,970
Dong Sik! Dong—!

759
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,330
Dong Sik. What are you doing? Huh?

760
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:19,990
Use words, you bastard! Hey, hey, hey!

761
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,740
What's wrong with you? Hey!

762
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,970
Please! Over here!

763
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,980
That man ... also couldn't open the locked door.

764
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,620
D-D-Dong Sik.

765
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:37,170
Like this, the toilet lid ...

766
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,260
Over here!

767
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,570
He stood there listening to the lid hitting the wall, like this.

768
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,030
Hurry open the door! Open the door!

769
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,400
And he had a feeling he was going to die.

770
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,120
Dong Sik! Let's... let's just talk this out, okay?

771
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,320
Dong Sik! Hey!

772
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,730
Hey, hey!

773
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58,610
Dong Sik!

774
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:01,700
Dong Sik!

775
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:07,450
 It's not that I'm a loser. I was just pretending,

776
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:11,150
 to hide my identity.

777
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:16,550
 I really was a psychopath.

778
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:23,900
 Psychopath Diary

779
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:32,220

780
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,260
 Thanks to this strange tension and excitement,

781
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:39,980
 I haven't been sleeping.

782
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:42,110
 - There's something different about Sunbae Dong Sik, right? 
 - Thank you.

783
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:44,930
 Someone attacked the homeless man with a toilet lid.

784
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,290
 Mr. Yook Republic

785
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:50,110
 If you leave it like this, you're going to take all the blame.

786
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:53,420
 I wrote everything in that diary, you know.

787
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,950
 If they didn't follow us, I won't kill you.

788
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:57,420
 Where's the diary?

789
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,270
 I'm very sorry! I will take the punishment for raising my child wrong.

790
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,590
 Did you see that, Ahjussi? Did you see me kill that person?
