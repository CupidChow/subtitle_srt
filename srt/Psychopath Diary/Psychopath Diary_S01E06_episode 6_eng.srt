  Psychopath Diary

4
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,720
Coporal Sim.

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,280
You haven't found your cellphone?

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,130
You called? I couldn't sleep so I was watching a movie.

7
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,740
What are you doing here this late?

8
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,140
I found something out.

9
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,680
Come in first.

10
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,710
Allagha?

11
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,600
At first, I thought it was that foreign laborer's name.

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,340
But in Mongolian, it meant murder.

13
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,870
That means...

14
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,760
That person could be the witness.

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,930
Are you okay?

16
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,780
Yes. It's nothing serious.

17
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:12,950
Do you perhaps have any thoughts of meeting the witness?

18
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,620
Yes. I'm going to go one more time tomorrow.

19
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,000
I must've gotten too excited.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,750
I felt like I should let you know right away.

21
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,120
Then, let's go together, just like last time.

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,820
- Will you be okay? Work is not busy? 
 - Not at all.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,790
The new general manager isn't strict.

24
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,070
So, when you go tomorrow, please give me a call.

25
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,670
Okay.

26
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,270
Thank you for helping like it's your problem.

27
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,340
Well, I'm doing it because I like it.

28
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,060
Go ahead.

29
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,450
  Psychopath Diary

30
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,290
  According to the diary, July 8th Sunday.

31
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,150
  Eleven pm.

32
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,430
  After using sleeping medicine to kidnap factory worker Hong Jin Goo,

33
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,390
  I dragged him to an empty factory to kill him.

34
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,970
  If somebody was watching that whole scene,

35
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,310
I have to get rid of him.

36
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,170
 Episode 6

37
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,040
Where are you going in such a hurry, Hyungnim?

38
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,110
Get in.

39
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,620
- I'm oka—
 - I'll give you a ride.

40
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,140
I'm the best driver when it comes to driving.

41
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,820
Ah, seriously, I didn't even have a drop to drink! Last time I made a mistake, so with that opportunity,

42
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,350
I stopped everything! Seriously, you need a lot of care!

43
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,700
- Let's go. 
 - Wait.

44
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,900
Are you starting an operation?

45
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,290
Pardon? No!

46
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,650
If by chance you need tools or something, tell me.

47
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,550
In the trunk, I have a complete set of—

48
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,430
- I think there is a misunderstanding. 
 - Misunderstanding?

49
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,210
Hyungnim, we're brothers.

50
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,250
We're brothers, so what misunderstanding or whatever would there be?

51
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,290
It's okay, Hyungnim.

52
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,230
I know your real identity, Hyungnim.

53
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,050
If you put your mind to it, killing a person is easier than blowing your nose,

54
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,690
but how should I say this? Without touching the weak,

55
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,960
and living while constantly hiding his frightening identity,

56
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,590
that type of righteous killer?!

57
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,730
Before, they used to call those people knights-errant.

58
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,010
You're, you're talking nonsense!

59
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,310
It's nonsense, I know.

60
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,970
Just keep denying it.

61
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,880
You're so chic, it's making me crazy.

62
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,290
Hyungnim. Where are you going?

63
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,000
I came because I just have something to do. Go on your way.

64
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,910
It's getting late.

65
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,240
Go, go go!

66
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,030
Hurry!

67
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,470
Hyungnim!

68
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,380
Come on!

69
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,800
The entrance is that way.

70
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,960
Really.

71
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,960
I... have to meet someone...

72
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,160
but...

73
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,320
I have to be quiet...

74
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,770
Whether you rob the place

75
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,190
or slash someone's throat, it doesn't matter to me!

76
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,670
Hyungnim.

77
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,230
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim!

78
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,830
I'll be of great use if he takes me.

79
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,780
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim!

80
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,420
The door is open.

81
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,220
It's so dark I can't see anything.

82
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,360
You, you're police.

83
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Bastard!

84
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,320
How dare you do this to Hyungnim!

85
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,150
Bastard!

86
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,590
Just keep quiet and leave!

87
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,220
This is not our doing.

88
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,130
It's going to sting here.

89
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,250
Allagha means murder, right?

90
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,750
Do you know something? Did you see something?

91
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,530
I came to work early that day

92
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,420
because a person fell into the chemical tank.

93
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,430
Hong Jin Goo, my friend,

94
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,530
wrote a letter and died.

95
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,820
 I told the boss while crying.

96
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,630
 Boss read the letter and said there were a lot of bad things written about him.

97
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,380
 He said the factory could be shut down,

98
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,420
 and he said we had to hide the fact that he committed suicide.

99
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,980
 He asked me to move the dead body with him.

100
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,710
 I had no choice but to do what he asked.

101
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,690
 Together they abandoned the body which I had disguised as a suicide.

102
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,280
If I lose my job here,

103
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,010
my family that's in Mongolia will starve.

104
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,510
So I did what I was asked.

105
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,980
So why did you say "allagha"?

106
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,590
Since he didn't commit suicide.

107
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,800
Why? Why do you think that?

108
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,130
My friend was kind.

109
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:54,660
He taught me Korean writing and speaking.

110
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,050
The boss' abuse and abusive language.

111
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,390
I can't bear being treated unfairly anymore.

112
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,310
Please, with my death as an opportunity,

113
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,660
I wish for the boss' wicked acts to be exposed to the world.

114
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,900
My friend doesn't write this 'ㅂ' letter this way.

115
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,470
He told me how to write this one all the time.

116
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,320
I know my friend's handwriting.

117
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,670
This was intentionally written this way.

118
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,730
  He left a dying message!

119
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,840
Please help.

120
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,210
- M-Me? 
 - You're police.

121
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,130
The lady before told me.

122
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,800
That's...

123
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,360
T-to be honest, we are doing a secret investigation.

124
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,850
But after hearing what you said, if we're not careful,

125
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,090
you could end up being a suspect.

126
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,910
So I'm worried.

127
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,630
It's not me.

128
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,090
I know. I believe you, that's why.

129
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,720
But not the lady officer, probably.

130
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,510
Now, for now, until I expose the culprit,

131
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,760
don't tell anyone else what you just told me.

132
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,810
Do you have a cellphone?

133
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,460
It's my number.

134
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:55,120
If anything happens, instead of someone else, call me right away, okay?

135
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,250
Thank you. Thank you.

136
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,380
Well, that's...

137
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,530
Also, this is important evidence, so I'll keep it.

138
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:17,100
Please make sure to c-catch the culprit who killed my friend.

139
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,410
That boss is the bad guy!

140
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,440
You saw! He almost beat to death a young kid who came to make some money from overseas!

141
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,660
That bastard wouldn't have a chance if you got a hold of him!

142
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,870
Am I not right?

143
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,710
 I have to stop Corporal Sim's investigation, no matter what.

144
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,430
 If I don't...

145
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,960
What?

146
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,010
 Asset Management Team 3 Manager's Office

147
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,420
Did I give you the report?

148
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,060
Huh? What?

149
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,500
Oh, no. I was mistaken.

150
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,420
Oh! Yes?

151
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,240
He suddenly took the day off saying he wanted to do a field inquiry?

152
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,630
Well, it's not a strange thing for an employee from a stock firm to check investor relations.

153
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,340
Did he have a source or something?

154
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,120
Well, I'm not sure.

155
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,540
Even looking at the chief financial officer's report, the fundamentals are lousy.

156
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,250
It's not really a company with positive factors or anything.

157
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,720
- Which company is it? 
 - A company I'm hearing about for the first time.

158
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,700
 Goseong Chemical

159
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,230
Goseong Chemical?

160
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,000
Director, are you o—

161
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm fine, so go back to work.

162
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,120
Predator murderer?

163
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,460
It's the guy I'm chasing.

164
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:03,250
A psychopath who kills only the weak and disguises it as a suicide.

165
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,380
So,

166
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,210
instead of a suicide, this incident could also be a crime he committed?

167
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,260
Allagha. What is it?

168
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,770
Couldn't you have misheard it?

169
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,650
So, it could have been another word that sounds similar.

170
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,220
I definitely asked him for his name, but he said that instead of his name, Nehrukkui.

171
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm certain he was trying to tell me something.

172
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,930
 Sim Bo Gyeong

173
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,990
I'll ask just a few questions for a few minutes.

174
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,630
I get that you're a police officer, but we can't help you without a warrant.

175
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,590
Then could you call the boss? I'll tell him directly.

176
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,530
He didn't come to work today.

177
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,340
Let's go for now. It looks like this place doesn't really have anything to do with it, either.

178
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,850
Seriously, that...

179
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,330
You're in danger!

180
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,050
No!

181
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,040
Dong Sik, I'm okay.

182
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,970
Come on.

183
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,860
What are you doing?! Are you crazy?

184
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,770
I'm Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong from Naksan Patrol Division.

185
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,170
We're investing the disappearance of Hong Jin Goo.

186
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,390
I ask for your cooperation.

187
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,120
I also have incurred damages because of his disappearance.

188
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,980
I'm saying I'm the victim!

189
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,430
About 15 days after the disappearance, his family contacted the company when they couldn't get in touch with him

190
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,590
and a missing person's case was filed. Why had you not reported it till then?

191
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,830
Well, he's not the only one who disappeared in the middle or work without a word.

192
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,700
Who are other employees who were close to Hong Jin Goo?

193
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,130
How would I know that?

194
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,450
Nehrukkui, was it? He seemed to know something.

195
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,480
Could I speak to him for a minute?

196
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,920
He got a little hurt yesterday while working, so he's not at the factory.

197
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,550
Are you sure he got hurt while working?

198
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,410
Then are you saying I hit him or something?

199
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,060
Where is he right now?

200
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,760
I don't know! The Hong Jin Goo incident has already been investigated by the police!

201
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,120
If you keep bothering me, I'll report you for business interference!

202
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,190
Thank you for your cooperation.

203
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,990
Let's go.

204
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,400
What are you doing? He said he'd report you for business interference.

205
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,410
Then we won't interfere with the business. I just need a second.

206
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,420
I think it was over here.

207
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:16,500
Excuse me, you're Nehrukkui, right?

208
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,140
Excuse me!

209
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,190
Wait a minute! I'll just ask a few things!

210
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,080
Excuse me! Excuse me!

211
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,220
Excuse me!

212
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,820
Nehrukkui, are you okay?

213
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,290
No.

214
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,180
If you know something, please tell me.

215
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,070
So we can find the real culprit who killed Jin Goo—

216
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,830
Dong Sik!

217
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,530
Are you okay?

218
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,880
Yes. I wasn't paying attention and...

219
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,300
Get up.

220
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,390
Okay.

221
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,060
Exactly why did you go there?

222
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:41,370
While I was passing by, it seemed like a foreign laborer was being assaulted, so...

223
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,410
It's not even in our jurisdiction.

224
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,280
This punk... Won't you tell me honestly?

225
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,020
Chief, don't be too harsh on her.

226
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,860
To be honest, she was just doing her duty as an officer.

227
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,570
What?

228
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,760
To catch the serial killer, in the morning she went out on patrol,

229
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,820
and at night, she rummaged through the files. Hold on!

230
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,640
She went out to investigate on scene. Do you know how hard it's been for her?

231
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,190
You... What is he talking about?

232
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,730
Won't you tell me the truth?!

233
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,550
 Incident Report

234
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,090
I was investigating a serial killer who was disguising murder as suicide.

235
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,930
There are already three suspicious suicide cases that seem to be this culprit's doing.

236
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,800
- Also—
 -  No wonder that I was thinking you seemed to be distracted these days.

237
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,860
You were writing fiction like this?

238
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,250
Why don't you change your job description to author?

239
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,560
- But— 
 - Your father got into an accident while working.

240
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,050
It's not that you don't realize why he's not able to collect on his pension from an officially recognized disaster, right?

241
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,290
Pardon?

242
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:49,040
He ended up like that from playing Sherlock by himself while ignoring all procedures and the organization!

243
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,560
Just like you are now!

244
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,430
What my father told me was true.

245
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,500
- What? 
 - I heard that your old nickname was sloth.

246
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,090
The icon of complacency.

247
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,940
Until told otherwise, you're on probation.

248
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,230
Also, if anyone sees her doing anything out of line, report to me!

249
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,540
Don't try to protect her or you'll get in serious trouble, along with her as a group, got it?!

250
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,000
Especially you, punk! Damn it!

251
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,820
Move aside, punk.

252
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,010
You got put on probation even because of me.

253
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,890
It's not because of you.

254
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,570
I shouldn't have gotten upset over what he said about my dad.

255
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:01,190
I mean... can I ask how your father ended up like that?

256
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,840
Eight years ago, there was a case in which a young girl got murdered.

257
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,730
The police pinpointed a jobless 40-something-year-old Mr. Oh with prior convictions.

258
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,360
But my dad alone insisted that he wasn't the culprit.

259
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,150
Even when a special operation was under way,

260
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,100
he was elsewhere trying to catch the true culprit.

261
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,940
But...

262
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,470
he got into an accident there.

263
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,960
After that, he ended up in the state you see him in now.

264
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,140
I see.

265
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,720
He told me that he found evidence

266
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,020
and told me to hurry over to where he was.

267
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,630
If I had gotten there a little bit sooner—

268
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,350
Oh, it's not your fault.

269
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,780
What happened to my dad, my mom suffering while caring for him...

270
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:19,150
While watching them, I thought, "I'll never end up like that."

271
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,400
I had made a resolution.

272
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,670
Bo Gyeong, just...

273
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,220
Can't you just live as a neighborhood police officer?

274
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,540
What is a police officer? The cane of the people.

275
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,460
It's not like resolving a murder case is the only way to help the citizens.

276
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:49,730
Those kinds of things, the detectives and profilers of the serious crime squad will handle them well.

277
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,700
Do you think so?

278
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,580
Of course.

279
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,490
Sim Bo Gyeong, corporal for 8 years.

280
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,500
Her father was also a police officer, but he retired due to an accident.

281
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,910
She got nosy trying to investigate some murder case

282
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,500
and she's now on probation.

283
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,190
 But what's interesting is that

284
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,640
 that officer is the one who went to the homeless man's place before.

285
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,330
What? They went together to Goseong Chemical, too?

286
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,130
How did you know that it was Goseong Chemical?

287
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,280
So what happened?

288
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,850
Well, it seems like she got chased out without much gain after asking various things.

289
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,920
I'll be in touch again.

290
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,390
Yook Dong Sik, who got a hold of that diary,

291
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,680
is chasing after my cases with the police.

292
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,020
Then that means...

293
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,970
He doesn't yet know that the owner of that diary is me?

294
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,400
 Goseong Chemical

295
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,320
B-Boss.

296
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,410
Where are you going without getting paid?

297
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:00,750
Th-That is, I really

298
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,030
didn't say anything.

299
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,180
Welcome!

300
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,890
You have to wait a little for the coffee.

301
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,020
My parents went out to walk the dogs.

302
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,250
Is fruit juice available then?

303
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,020
Yes. I'll make it for you quickly.

304
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,970
Where's the knife?

305
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,830
It was on the counter by the entrance.

306
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,320
I've been a little distracted.

307
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,410
Thank you.

308
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,910
- You came back? 
 - Oh, we have a customer!

309
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,890
You come out. I'll do it.

310
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,090
It's okay, I'm almost finished.

311
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,010
The dogs are cute.

312
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,700
This man keeps bringing all the abandoned dogs in the neighborhood.

313
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,440
If you're uncomfortable, should we leave them outside?

314
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
No, it's fine.

315
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,600
They're abandoned dogs,

316
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,080
so they're not very comfortable with strangers.

317
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,130
It's too bad.

318
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,020
Honey. Honey!

319
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,690
Honey! Honey!

320
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,120
- What's the matter?! 
 - Dad!

321
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,380
Honey! What's the matter?!

322
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,270
What's wrong?!

323
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,410
Dad! Dad!

324
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,240
Honey!

325
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,460
What's wrong?!

326
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,780
What's the matter?!

327
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,990
Let's hurry!

328
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,160
We didn't find any special cranial nerve issues from the MRI, but

329
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,020
did something happen that could have shocked him or given him extreme stress?

330
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,000
No. Nothing like that.

331
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,790
This sometimes happens with patients with brain damage.

332
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,260
But you never know, so he should stay here under observation for a few days.

333
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,190
Please take good care of him.

334
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,680
Of course. You're Director Seo's acquaintances, so of course I will.

335
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,390
Then.

336
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,360
We're already grateful you helped bring him to the hospital, but doing this much is...

337
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,940
Oh, it's nothing. I only did what I was able to.

338
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:30,220
Also, I took care of the hospital expenses, so you don't need to worry about that.

339
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,020
Thank you. Thank you so much. How can we repay you?

340
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:42,180
I thought he needed to quickly get better in order for me to have the fruit drink I ordered before.

341
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,080
Oh, I wasn't all there so... I'm sorry.

342
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,760
The cafe will be closed for a short while, but if you come when we're there, we'll make you as many as you'd like.

343
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,340
Dong Sik, there's already a rumor going around that you're looking into Goseong Chemical.

344
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,750
You got a whiff of something, right?

345
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,260
 I think I took care of Corporal Sim well.

346
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,380
 The only problem left is Nehrukui.

347
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,740
Do you not want to even talk to a nobody like me

348
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,810
now that you're hanging out with the director and doing well these days?

349
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,760
I'm very disappointed!

350
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,810
It's not that. I have some stuff to think about.

351
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,500
Think? Tell me.

352
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I'm your friend. Tell me, huh?

353
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
Hey, what are you doing after you get off work? You want to get a drink?

354
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,600
If that's too much, some coffee maybe? I'll get that.

355
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,340
- I was lying about being disappointed! 
 - Hyungnim!

356
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,560
Are you getting off work? I'll drive you.

357
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,740
Hyung-Hyungnim?

358
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,370
Oh! You're my hyungnim's colleague from work!

359
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,720
It's nice to meet you. I'm Jang Chi Seong.

360
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,530
Hold on!

361
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,890
I have something urgent to take care of, so I'll be leaving first. Sorry.

362
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,780
I'll leave first. Oh, why am I bowing to you?

363
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,040
- Do you want to get a drink? 
 - Oh, I don't like alcohol.

364
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,990
You said you like getting drinks.

365
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,510
Wait, hold on.

366
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,310
Wow, Hyungnim, you're really impressive.

367
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,920
After thinking about this carefully,

368
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,970
you're like that... Batman.

369
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,020
In the morning, an office worker, and at night...

370
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,240
Why did you come here?

371
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,740
Why did I... Oh, we have to go finish off that boss bastard.

372
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,930
Finish off? Finish off what?!

373
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,400
Oh, you're being like this again. I came knowing where you were headed.

374
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,700
I mean, where Batman goes, Sebastian has to go, too.

375
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,080
Oh, it's Alfred!

376
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,320
What's Sebastian from?

377
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,770
 Nehrukkui

378
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,020
Hello? Nehrukkui,

379
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,710
Has something happened?

380
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,090
 Yook Dong Sik

381
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,040
This punk...

382
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,090
 This is why I can't trust you.

383
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,320
This is all your fault. If you had listened to me well, it wouldn't have turned out like this!

384
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,980
 Why do you think these kinds of things happen to me?

385
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,400
 What did I do so wrong?!

386
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,280
That's right. Just because one foreign worker like you dies,

387
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,190
no one would be suspicious!

388
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,160
 Bad things happen all the time while working at a factory.

389
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,390
 That's right. You will die, too.

390
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,710
 You die, too.

391
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,820
 If the boss kills Nehrukkui like this, I'll be grateful.

392
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,380
What are you doing? Let's hurry over there.

393
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,210
That's right. The team leader asked for a report.

394
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,260
I forgot.

395
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,780
A report? I mean, right now, the boss is trying to kill a kid, so how can you say such a thing?

396
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,000
Do you think he really would? I'm sure he was just saying it.

397
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,320
- Hyungnim. 
 - Go in then.

398
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,100
I think I have to stay late today.

399
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:44,290
That kid called you because you're the only person he could trust!

400
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:50,400
If he dies on foreign land like this, how hurt would his family back home be?!

401
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,010
I didn't see him that way, seriously...

402
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,760
Now that I'm about to go in, I'm a little scared.

403
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,590
You'll distract me, so wait out here.

404
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,550
But still...

405
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,810
- Wait here. 
 - Yes.

406
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,210
 The boss jerk can't make stupid mistakes,

407
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,430
 so I'll just watch to see if he kills him properly.

408
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,340
But... where did you say the open door was?

409
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,960
Now, it's time for you to die.

410
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,320
Go in then. Huh?

411
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,880
Go in now. Go in!

412
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,620
What?

413
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,560
Stay right there!

414
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,520
Nehrukkui! Where are you?

415
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,670
 I won't hurt you, so come out, huh?

416
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,430
 I'm very sorry.

417
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,450
  I guess I lost it for a second.

418
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,540
  You know how everyone gets like that sometimes.

419
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,870
If it becomes known that Jin Goo committed suicide because of me, this factory that already has issues as it is

420
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,450
will end up shutting.

421
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,360
Why do you think I did that?

422
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,630
Nehrukkui! Where are you?

423
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,610
 Nehrukkui

424
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,930
 Nehrukkui.

425
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,750
You little rat.

426
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,300
Please don't hurt me!

427
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,200
Come with me, you bastard. Come with me.

428
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,390
Please save me!

429
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,200
That's right.

430
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,070
Please save me!

431
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,870
 Please save me...

432
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,700
Come with me!

433
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,160
Please save me!

434
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,830
Please save me!

435
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,040
 Don't do anything, Yook Dong Sik.

436
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,560
 You're a bloodless and tearless psychopath, aren't you?

437
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,320
 The Shining

438
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,820
 Nehrukkui really ended up dying while

439
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,270
 working like crazy without any time to play.

440
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,960
 Nehrukkui didn't even get to play and only worked like crazy,

441
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,020
 so why should he die?

442
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,580
I'm here!

443
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,700
Who are you? How are you here?

444
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,990
It's really difficult to kill someone, isn't it?

445
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:39,250
What method to use to kill and where it should be done, and how you will take care of the dead body.

446
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,690
There are more than a few things you have to worry about.

447
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,960
If you don't make your choices cautiously, not only the victim's life,

448
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,190
but your life could also go down in flames.

449
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:55,010
Don't come close. If you take another step—

450
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,900
What are you going to do? Right!

451
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,550
You're going to kill him? If you can, do it.

452
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,140
But how are you going to kill me?

453
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,180
- What? 
 - You would have to kill me, too!

454
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,760
When I'm a witness!

455
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:18,300
But what to do? Of all things, I'm very skilled at killing people.

456
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,510
Before you kill me, you'll die first.

457
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,540
What? Wh-Who are you exactly?!

458
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,920
Me? I'm a predator,

459
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,760
who is on another level from someone like you.

460
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,110
A-Are you okay?

461
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:54,030
Go stay outside if you don't want to die.

462
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,800
Yes.

463
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,620
Why? Why? Why?

464
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,230
Kooi! What happened? Are you okay?

465
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,230
Where's Hyungnim?

466
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,660
Oh, he saved me, and he bled and got hurt.

467
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,580
- Bled? 
 - It's dangerous.

468
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,360
What? What is it?

469
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,230
First, if he bled, the one in danger is not my Hyungnim

470
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,450
but your boss.

471
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,120
We have to hurry up and report it to the police!

472
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,090
How is it? Now, that we've switched places?

473
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,490
Is your heart filled with fear?

474
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,160
Die!

475
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,210
Die!

476
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,900
What does this bastard take me for?

477
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:37,850
Yeah and what do you see me as?

478
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,020
It's here!  Here!

479
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,460
Wow!  Daebak!

480
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,200
Don't move! If you move, we'll shoot.

481
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,920
Hyungnim!

482
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,630
That man tried to kill me.

483
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,370
He said he is experienced in killing people!

484
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:50,230
Are you eating while you attend to him?

485
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,050
- Oh, you're here. 
 - Take this.

486
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,130
I asked the doctor, and he said it's probably not a big deal.

487
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,310
Anyway, he is probably the most skilled doctor in this field in Korea,

488
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,970
so you can trust him.

489
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,120
Thank you, really.

490
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,560
Now that I think about it, we haven't even introduced ourselves to each other.

491
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,770
I'm Sim Bo Gyeong.

492
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:20,210
- I'm— 
 - You are Mr. Seo In Woo, right?

493
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,660
As expected you're something else, since you're a cop.

494
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,710
How do you know ...

495
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,060
- I did some background check. 
 - Pardon?

496
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,180
It's a joke. I saw you write it under "guardian's profession."

497
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,000
Wait a second.

498
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,210
Yeah, Taek Soo?

499
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,570
From Goseong Chemicals?

500
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Okay, I'll go quick.

501
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,320
What is it?

502
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,030
Ah, something urgent came up so I think I'll have to go first.

503
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,080
If it's something urgent, go with my car.

504
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,050
Get off. Quickly, come out.

505
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:32,020
I didn't realize and caused you much inconvenience.  I heard the witness' statement.

506
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,460
They said you were saving a foreign worker.

507
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,100
I didn't even know. I'm sorry.

508
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,790
Ah, it's okay.

509
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,350
Not anybody can do this. You're quite great.

510
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:48,710
I wonder if I should get an autograph. There are some procedures left, so please cooperate a little bit more.

511
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,120
Yes.

512
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,300
Dong Sik!

513
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,160
What happened?

514
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,400
Ah, Corporal Sim. Th-That is ...

515
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,930
Mr. Dong Sik.

516
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,130
Director Seo! What are you doing here?

517
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,980
You two know each other?

518
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,960
- Ah, that is— 
- We discovered a body!

519
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,320
- Where, where? 
 - This way. Quick quick!

520
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,300
Hyung.  Friend.  Hyung.

521
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,140
Seeing that his stomach, intestines and lungs were filled with preservatives,

522
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:11,050
the cause of death indeed seems to be that he fell in a chemical tank, as the statement said.

523
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,950
Thanks to that, even though the time of death has passed for a while, the body is still intact.

524
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,230
Let's see.

525
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,550
Is there something?

526
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,820
From the body that was discovered, together with traces of esophageal rupture,

527
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,820
a blood drawing needle was found.

528
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,250
It looks like the victim swallowed it on purpose just before being murdered.

529
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,500
A blood drawing needle?

530
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,940
Usually, it is used by people suffering from diabetes, who need to check their blood sugar frequently.

531
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:00,430
However, since the victim Mr. Hong didn't have a related medical history, it was revealed by his coworkers that this was not applicable.

532
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:06,400
Goseong chemicals is a company producing chemicals such as preservatives, so it is unrelated to the blood needle.

533
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,660
We presume that it is something the culprit was carrying.

534
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,360
With this, what are you telling us to do?

535
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,440
You're not telling us that he killed someone with a blood drawing device, are you?

536
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,740
 Name:  Hong Jin Goo; Age: 27; Notes: Death by Drowning; Blood found on left thumb

537
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:26,250
On the victim, Mr. Hong's left thumb, a wound from a blood drawing needle was found.

538
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,610
For the other cases that we assume to be the deed of the same killer as well,

539
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,790
after making the victim powerless through the use of sleeping pills,

540
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:38,890
before they died, he drew blood from the victim's left thumb using the needle and collected a blood print.

541
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,810
Then he murdered them while disguising it as suicide, is what we presume.

542
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,320
Senior citizens living alone, exam students, homeless people, migrant workers, etc...

543
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,990
The serial killer suspect who targets exclusively the weak of society,

544
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,670
I want to designate him as "predator murderer."

545
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,020
Predator ...

546
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,860
Apart from what you just said, are there other characteristics or patterns?

547
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,480
As you can see, the time of occurrence of the four cases

548
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,710
correspond to the pattern on this specific stock chart.

549
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:14,020
Seeing this, I think there is a high possibility that the suspect works in the securities industry.

550
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,310
and if we analyze these patterns and the suicide cases together,

551
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:21,100
I expect we can find other cases.

552
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,310
- Inspector Ryoo. 
 - Yes.

553
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:28,100
What do you think? Does it make sense?

554
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,600
I think it will be good to promptly make a special team and run an open investigation.

555
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,870
Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong. I heard you're detective Sim Seok Goo's daughter?

556
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,380
Yes, I am.

557
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,980
It looks like your father's blood runs through you.

558
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,920
You pulled a big one. I will entrust you with the special team as well, hm?

559
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,950
Whoa. When did you prepare all of this?

560
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:02,540
- You did well, Sim Bo Gyeong. 
 - Thank you, Uncle.

561
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:15,030
 Due to personal circumstances, we are closed for the moment.

562
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:19,240
 A boring day

563
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,840
What are you doing?

564
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,620
Ah, Corporal Sim. That is ...

565
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,640
I was wondering if something came out from that corpse.

566
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,440
Ah perhaps, uh, if you found some evidence,

567
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,360
the culprit must ...

568
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,070
He'll be in big trouble, right?

569
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,990
I was going to contact you anyway.

570
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,550
Come with me somewhere.

571
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,010
Letter of appreciation. You rescued the foreign worker Mr. Nehrukkui when he faced great danger

572
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:29,140
and contributed to revealing the truth of the disappearance case of Hong Jin Goo which had been covered up.

573
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,480
Thus, you are presented with the brave citizen award

574
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,830
on behalf of Seoul  Metropolitan Police Agency Director Song Won Seok.

575
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,050
Congratulations.

576
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,680
 No. This isn't right!

577
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,050
Including the murder case of Mr. Hong Jin Goo,

578
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,110
in order to investigate the chain of murder cases,

579
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,300
the headquarters has decided to form a special team made up of criminal behavior analysts.

580
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,700
From now on, like the case of Mr. Hong, among the deceased who were processed as established suicides,

581
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,140
disappearances or accidents—for the cases which need reinvestigation

582
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,400
we need the citizen’s report.

583
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,120
I have a question. I am Reporter Seong Si Jin from Daehan Daily.

584
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,360
I heard that you are in the middle of investigating while keeping in mind the possibility of serial murder.

585
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,710
Could you tell us to what extent you have achieved the culprit's profiling?

586
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:38,390
From the results of our analyses until now, the suspect is a highly educated man in his thirties,

587
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,030
and we think there is a possibility he works in the securities industry.

588
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,520
We cannot reveal much here, but the profiling

589
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,970
is already achieved to a large part, so as the investigation goes forward,

590
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,120
we will let you know progressively through briefings.

591
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,260
Our team in charge designates the suspects of these vicious crimes

592
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,100
who only choose and kill the weak people of the society, as predator murderers.

593
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:03,200
In order to apprehend the murderers who committed these unpardonable atrocities, we will mobilize our full investigation power.

594
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,000
I'll go to the bathroom for a bit.

595
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,500
We will accept additional questions.

596
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,930
 Predator Murder Case - Investigation Team

597
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:27,910
 I need to find out what the police have found out up to now.

598
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,820
Where did he go? Mr. Yook Dong Sik!

599
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,070
- What are you doing here? 
 - What? Ah, n-no, I —

600
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:59,050
What are you doing here, we looked for you everywhere!

601
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:03,130
Hey, here here!

602
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,980
Ah he was here? Ah really!

603
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,130
 "Predator Murderer" Investigation Team

604
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,560
As an ordinary citizen, you got a  decisive clue on this case

605
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,170
and played a big role, I heard. You really did something amazing.

606
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:25,850
Yes. Well it somehow ended up like this.

607
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,850
 According to Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong, if you weren't there,

608
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,330
 they wouldn't have been able to investigate the case this much.

609
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,050
 That's what I'm saying.

610
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:37,050
Yeah yeah , it's really our Dong Sik!

611
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,980
I knew he would do something big one day! Of course!

612
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:46,320
 What would you say to the culprit who is looking at this news?

613
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,650
 You idiotic fool.

614
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,340
 I hate you so much! Yeah.

615
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:05,520
- Yes, it's the investigation team. 
 - They had an accident but there are some suspicious elements?

616
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,810
Ah, is that so?

617
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:12,220
Then please give me your contact and address.

618
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,560
- Yes, thank you. 
 - Thank you for the report.

619
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,870
But his height is 1.8 meters (5'9").

620
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,420
Yes. We will check the relevant content as soon as possible,

621
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,980
so please cooperate with the competent police team.

622
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,630
 Since the open investigation started, reports from the citizen are not stopping.

623
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:33,700
 The team in charge thinks there will be at least two other cases besides the four that were discovered.

624
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,700
 The suicide cases that are presumed to be the deed of the same criminal—

625
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,440
It's been the same news for days.

626
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:48,650
Everyone is talking about how it's so horrific and whatnot,

627
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:52,350
but they're all making a fuss to show more of it, to see more of it.

628
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,320
They want to confirm it, that's what it is.

629
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,500
That they themselves are safe in this brutal world.

630
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,910
Even though those around them are getting killed without anyone noticing,

631
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:06,050
that it has nothing to do with them.

632
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:12,030
There's a rumor that Geolabs is recruiting executives from Goldman Sachs

633
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:14,510
and to keep an eye on their IPO. ( IPO - when a stock goes on sale to the public for the first time )

634
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,480
I think there's a need to look into it.

635
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,080
Your brother-in-law said this.

636
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:27,000
That there's a rumor going around that the culprit works in securities.

637
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,440
Is that so?

638
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,050
That's interesting.

639
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,220
I know, right?

640
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,880
Are you busy tomorrow?

641
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,310
I feel a little out of sorts these days.

642
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,930
Let's go hunting together.

643
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,660
Alright.

644
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,450
What is this?

645
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:45,180
Well... I got a reward for something that's not a big deal.

646
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,270
It's my thanks to you.

647
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:52,300
It would be nice if you came to the restaurant in person, but I figured everyone is busy.

648
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,580
Share it with your new team members like a group meal.

649
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,830
Why did you do this?

650
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,300
Thank you. We'll enjoy them.

651
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,040
You must have slept here.

652
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,590
I guess someone always has to be on guard in the task force team.

653
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,980
No. It's not really that.

654
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,760
We leave for home at night, but I was looking into something yesterday.

655
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:23,900
Oh, where's my head? These should be in the fridge!

656
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,090
Really...

657
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,780
Will there be a place to put these in the task force office?

658
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,470
It's okay. There's a fridge in the break room.

659
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,240
- Should we go? 
 - Yes.

660
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,850
When will we eat all these?

661
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,370
Tell me when you finish them all.

662
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,830
I'll bring you some more again.

663
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,500
Where's my head?!

664
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:20,060
Make sure to tell your parents, thank you.

665
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:26,190
You're working endlessly to catch criminals.

666
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,060
We're the ones...

667
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,290
 Sim Bo Gyeong

668
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,150
who are thankful.

669
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,380
I'm grateful just hearing those words, really.

670
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,800
Then I'll be leaving now since you're busy.

671
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,730
Hold on!

672
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,000
I'll see you out after putting these away. I'm grateful, that's why.

673
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,160
Just a second.

674
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,100
It's okay. Good bye.

675
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,210
 Men's Restroom

676
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,830
Did you look into the report that we received in the morning?

677
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:11,050
Yes, but there are some things in common to other incidents, so I think we need to do some on-scene investigation.

678
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:16,100
Fine. Yesterday was a day that had high chances for the culprit to commit a crime according to the stock graph,

679
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,120
so investigate in detail, and if you confirm that it's an additional case, let's prepare a briefing.

680
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,260
We understand.

681
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:33,040
No matter what, I have to get in today.

682
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,790
You said you had a hunting appointment with the president,

683
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,790
so I altered your schedule from now on.

684
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,250
You worked hard.

685
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:45,620
It's good. You seemed a little tense these days, so I had been worried.

686
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,440
If you get some air and change your mood, too—

687
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,190
I've always liked going hunting with my father.

688
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,790
In front of Ji Hoon who freaks out at the sight of blood,

689
01:06:57,490 --> 01:07:04,890
it was a chance for me to be acknowledged that I'm my father's son.

690
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:10,130
Today you don't seem to feel like doing it.

691
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,660
As expected, you know too much about me.

692
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:01,340
 It's still hot. Have it before it cools down.

693
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,810
 Do you want to try it? It's very good for males.

694
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:13,490
 I don't want to! It's dirty!

695
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:18,250
 I... want to try drinking that.

696
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:47,190
This forest and the mountains are still the same.

697
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,960
But I don't feel like before, maybe it's my old age.

698
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,710
How are you?

699
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:58,950
In my view, you seem to be the same now as when you were young.

700
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,690
 Security has been cleared.

701
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,890
 Park Jae Moon (52) suicide, arson

702
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,700
  Lee Ji Hee (28) suicide, bleeding from a stabbing

703
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:19,020
 Other incidents that are in the diary has already been...

704
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,290
 What do I do?

705
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,110
 Do I have to vent my anger or something?

706
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,760
Are you sure?

707
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,970
I'm checking.

708
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,690
We have no time to waste, so move quickly and check once more.

709
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,040
Yes.

710
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,070
From your taste to your personality,

711
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:01,020
you take after me in each and every way.

712
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,530
With my personality, if I were in your situation,

713
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:07,890
I wouldn't have been able to bear it.

714
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:17,550
Tell me. Did you do it?

715
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,410
What about the informant's identity? Did they verify his whereabouts?

716
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:33,270
The precinct is in the process of confirming it.

717
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,420
 Psychopath Diary

718
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:18,670

719
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,830
 A dead body. Dead body!

720
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,340
 Additional murder?

721
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,000
 You must have a lot of interest in this incident.

722
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,250
 I want them to get caught quickly, that's all.

723
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,280
 Do you still not think that guy is the predator murderer?

724
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,020
 If we catch him, we should know.

725
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:33,270
 So this recent crime is a type of invitation.

726
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,730
 I want to meet you...

727
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:39,990
 It seems like the call has been connected to the person speculated to be the culprit.

728
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:42,320
 It's me, the predator murderer.

729
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,450
 But do you really think it's that punk?

730
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:48,290
 I don't feel like he's going to end up being the guy.
