 Psychopath Diary

3
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,040
 Seo Ji Hoon, I shall kill you.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,300
 Because I'm a psychopathic serial killer.

5
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,900
 Episode 3

6
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,220
Yook Dong Sik ... with a bunch of gangsters?

7
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,270
Didn't I tell you? There's something about him.

8
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,350
Ah, those idiots can't even take care of one little employee.

9
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,530
Ah, does that bastard work out? Was he some kind of special forces? Is he something like that?

10
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,320
No, he is not.

11
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,320
As far as I know he’s got two left feet and was a rear unit administrative soldier.

12
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,400
No, don't those guys usually try and

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,850
hide their true color? Don't you watch movies? What?

14
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,430
Director Seo, I think we messed with the wrong guy.

15
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,470
Yook Dong Sik,

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,410
what kind of guy are you?

17
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,490
 Psychopath Diary

18
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,010
- Is he hospitalized? 
 - He's not dead, right?

19
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,090
- Because of us, Sunbae Dong Sik is— 
 - What about me?

20
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,990
Oh. Oh!

21
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,740
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

22
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,890
Ah ... that ...

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,290
- Look at this, look. What happened here? 
 - Where, where?

24
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,090
What are we going to do?

25
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,450
- It looks okay. 
 - It's not okay.

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,860
I must have burned myself with the oil. It's nothing.

27
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,220
They all seemed like bad guys. Are you sure everything was fine?

28
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,550
Yeah, well, for the most part.

29
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,040
You see, I ...

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,890
- was going to report it right away. 
 - That's right.

31
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,040
But something suddenly came up at home.

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,590
- That's right. Is everything okay? 
 - Yes, it is. Now, it is.

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,670
- That's good. 
 - The restaurant is a mess, isn't it?

34
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,690
Ah, no, no. I just gave them a scare

35
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,500
and they all backed down.

36
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,440
What is it?

37
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,650
During a time like this, you're still joking.

38
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,920
As a man, I understand you're bluffing to try to overcome the pain.

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,190
You're doing this because you don't want us to feel sorry for you, right?

40
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,360
Sunbae, how can you be like this?

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,270
We even gave false statements so that we can survive.

42
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,420
Should we go confess now to the audit team

43
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,630
- and report the assault? 
 - What, all of a sudden?

44
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,630
My family has a lot debt,

45
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,830
but I can pay it back through work.

46
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,660
This isn't the only company around.

47
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,690
Ah, n-no. That matter ... I'll handle everything,

48
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,820
so don't worry about it too much.

49
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,750
So then grabbing, grabbing ...

50
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,840
Why did you want to see me?

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,140
I heard you got into a fight with some gangsters at your father's restaurant.

52
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,520
How did I find out? It seemed like it was something I needed to know.

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,810
Did you hear anything from the gangsters? Like who hired them?

54
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:02,560
 It's the Managing Director! Managing Director Seo! That's what I heard.

55
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,810
Why aren't you speaking? I'm trying to help you.

56
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,100
If someone with power in this company

57
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,570
not only framed you for the Yuseong Bio case,

58
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,650
but also forced false statements from the other employees and tried to assault you,

59
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,340
then this isn't just a normal incident.

60
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,610
By any chance, did you record it?

61
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,160
Never mind.

62
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,800
If the employees that were with you can testify—

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,390
What are you saying?

64
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,130
- Nothing like that happened. 
 - Pardon?

65
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,490
What are you trying to do? I'm trying to prevent you from getting being unfairly fired.

66
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,030
If you're done, I'll get going.

67
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,460
 There's no need to uselessly prolong this issue.

68
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,930
 I'm going to kill him with my own hands anyway.

69
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,580
What?

70
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,160
- This isn't funny. 
 - But it's entertaining.

71
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,760
If we reveal that Seo Ji Hoon was behind the assault, we can turn this case around.

72
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,700
So why is he denying it? Because he's scared?

73
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,250
Or was he threaten to death?

74
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,420
Or he has ace in his sleeve we don't know about.

75
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,130
Like what?

76
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,730
Not sure.

77
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,690
I may have to meet this friend.

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,190
 Blood Right Thumb Seal

79
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,880
- Uncle. 
 - Did you stay up all night again? What are you looking for?

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
- It's nothing. 
 - Is it a serial murder?

81
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm not certain yet.

82
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,830
It's nothing. I'm not certain.

83
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,490
Sunbae would always say these things.

84
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,070
But that wasn't the look in his eyes. It was something and he was certain.

85
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,500
Your eyes are the same.

86
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,770
Our Captain Yu is being scary so I should get out of here. Oh, scary, scary.

87
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,320
Aren't you working too hard? You study at night and work at day time. Aren't you on duty today?

88
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,870
Oh no, I'm dead. I'm leaving now, Uncle.

89
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,260
- I'm leaving. 
 - Be careful.

90
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,760
Ah, seriously.

91
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,630
Don't you have to be promoted this time? Nowadays, it's decided by only a few points? You know that, don't you?

92
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,790
It's endless competition. Endless competition!

93
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,490
Sunbae, are you working two jobs lately?

94
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,590
If I had two jobs, I would have more money. Let's go eat lunch.

95
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,630
The boss is keeping an eye on us so let's just eat something light at the convenience store.

96
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,290
- How about gopchang ( T.N. intestines )? 
 - Gopchang? For lunch?

97
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,750
Lunch is gopchang.

98
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,710
Eat well.

99
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,220
- You could eat from our lunch menu. 
 - We just suddenly craved meat.

100
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,430
Your son is really good looking.

101
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,460
He died earlier this year, right?

102
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,000
From suicide.

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,580
I'm sorry, but I have some questions—

104
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,120
I won't charge you so just get out.

105
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,360
- Don't do this. I just need a moment— 
 - Get out!

106
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Yook Dong Sik met with the head of the audit team, but I don't think they talked about much.

107
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,490
Really? Those gangsters said one of them confessed I hired them.

108
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,730
There must not be enough evidence. Oh, and the posts from before have all been deleted.

109
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,110
Then, he's nothing. I was nervous for nothing.

110
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,130
Still, you should be careful not to get caught.

111
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,800
Then, we need to plan so we don't get caught.

112
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,050
Team Leader Hong,

113
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,950
let's do that.

114
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,960
By that you mean?

115
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,130
That thing. That thing we like to use when we have to get rid of someone.

116
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,520
That's an excellent choice.

117
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,290
 Without thinking about it too much. Like a true psychopath.

118
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,590
 I will kill Seo Ji Hoon. I just need to kill him.

119
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,690
 But murder, where do I start?

120
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,820
 You idiot. Get it together.

121
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,900
Team Leader Gong.

122
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,350
- Team Leader Gong, where are you? 
 - Managing Director Seo Ji Hoon.

123
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,160
Where is he?

124
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,940
He never said he was leaving the office.

125
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,090
Then, call him and tell him to come here now.

126
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,490
He's not answering the phone.

127
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,860
Wait, what did you just say?

128
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,060
The Team Leader is not answering his phone.

129
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,270
This is driving me crazy.

130
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,000
How are they training these employees?

131
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,760
Who's in charge of her?

132
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,560
- Yes, I'm Han Jung Ah. 
 - What do you think she did wrong?

133
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,390
She should have continued to call the team leader,

134
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,190
but she gave up after trying only one time?

135
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,620
This is what's wrong with women. What did she just say?

136
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,960
Team Leader Gong is not answering his phone.

137
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,860
Is my position lower than Team Leader Gong? Huh?

138
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,240
 I can't show my teeth yet.

139
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,770
 I need to be cool-headed and precise.

140
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,140
Hey you, over there.

141
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,030
Yes! I'm Yook Dong Sik!

142
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,850
Ah, so you've been to the army. So what did she do wrong?

143
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,960
She used the honorifics wrongly.

144
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,630
That's right. You try it properly this time.

145
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,910
Team Leader Gong is not picking up his phone ( using more formal speech ).

146
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,230
When you say he is not picking up the phone, you're putting him at a higher rank.

147
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,150
You people, seriously!

148
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,820
Team Leader Gong, that bastard,

149
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,220
when Director is looking for him, he's not answering the phone.

150
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,160
Are you ignoring me? I told you to do it again, properly.

151
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,700
Team Leader Gong, that bastard, Director Seo Ji Hoon is calling for him,

152
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,160
but he's not answering his darn phone.

153
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,550
- What is this? Look at what you're doing. 
 - Move, move.

154
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,880
Director, what's the problem?

155
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,530
Asset Management Team 3, prepare your performance report by next week.

156
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,940
- By next week? 
 - Not next, next week. Next week.

157
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,960
You know this team is on thin ice, right?

158
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,760
I was going to fire all of you but I decided to fire only one. Just know that.

159
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,360
Yes, I understand.

160
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,210
Let's clean this up.

161
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,600
- How was the timing? 
 - It was good.

162
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,770
Work hard.

163
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,350
Did you enjoy watching?

164
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,830
When you started here, I was pushed out of the management support office so I was just checking to see if the employees were doing okay.

165
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,450
And if there's something I can help with, that's my job.

166
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,830
And that's why I stopped by.

167
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,970
You must be so great.

168
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,590
Please head inside.

169
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,340
Please head inside.

170
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,430
Take care.

171
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,180
Was that him? Your scapegoat for Yuseong Bio Medical.

172
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,830
Seeing how he's still around, he's tougher than he looks.

173
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,280
Half-wit bastard.

174
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,410
Thanks for your concern, but he'll be out of here soon.

175
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,200
The president is anxious these days, so take care of it without a lot of noise.

176
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,340
Is it fun watching the fire?

177
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,760
If you just watch, your house could burn too.

178
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,090
What are talking about? We're all one family.

179
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,530
Unlucky bastard.

180
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,690
Okay, okay. Everyone stand up. Stand up.

181
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,030
Okay, stand up.

182
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,210
To improve our target performance and reinforce discipline,

183
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,430
we will rebuild our team.

184
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,840
We will start by relocating our seating.

185
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,040
- Chief Han. 
 - Yes?

186
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
You can sit there.

187
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,720
- And Assistant Manager Park, you just sit there. 
 - Yes.

188
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,860
- And Seok Hyeon and Mi Joo. 
 - Yes.

189
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,660
You can remain seated there.

190
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,190
And me?

191
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,930
And Dong Sik, over there. Over there.

192
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,400
The storage closet?

193
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,340
Ah, nowadays the sanitation department is a mess, a mess.

194
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,430
I'll be checking every day on how the cleaning is going and if the equipment is emptied.

195
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,130
For now, just move your seat.

196
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,000
And in 30 minutes, I'll be receiving the market trend reports.

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,550
Everyone excluding the person in charge of the storage room, just the people right here.

198
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,750
- You'll attend. Okay? 
 - Yes.

199
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,590
And that person on maternity leave. Did she go on vacation after her leave?

200
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,550
Why isn't she coming back?

201
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,140
Hurry, hurry.

202
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,030
Do you need help?

203
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,620
It's fine. Sit back down.

204
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,200
Why did I get off here?

205
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,830
Oh no!

206
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,910
 This place seems familiar.

207
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,250
 Did I come here often?

208
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,880
 It wasn't in the diary.

209
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,630
 Of course, dogs are able to recognize predators.

210
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,170
 Why do humans have to be victims to recognize one?

211
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,360
 Even though they could possibly die.

212
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,330
He's here.

213
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,520
The nice man.

214
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,610
Dong Sik?

215
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,440
What are you doing here?

216
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,560
Why is she always ...

217
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,340
Dong Sik.

218
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,620
Hello.

219
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,770
How did you find my house?

220
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,390
- Your house? 
 - Yes.

221
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,210
Okay, I'm here.

222
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,400
Did you want to go inside and have some tea?

223
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,070
No.

224
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,670
I just wasn't paying attention and got off at the wrong stop.

225
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,530
If that's the case, get in. We'll take you home.

226
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,250
You're ... busy on patrol. I shouldn't bother you.

227
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,830
Dong Sik, Dong Sik. Supporting our citizens is also our job.

228
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,670
Isn't that right Sunbae?

229
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,560
That's right.

230
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,550
Get in.

231
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,710
Get in.

232
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,630
Get in.

233
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,910
 Something feels strange. Like I'm being arrested.

234
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,380
My father was in an accident years ago, so he's like a child.

235
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,310
He was a detective before.

236
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,970
Your father was also a police officer?

237
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,250
Of course. Not only that, he was the Legendary Detective Sim.

238
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,250
My sunbae is a carbon copy of Detective Sim.  Exactly like him.

239
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,130
- Hey, hey.  Keep it to yourself. 
 - I'm going to let it all out today.

240
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,160
Dong Sik, you know criminals.

241
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,630
Especially powerful criminals, even if they try to hide, she can smell them out right away.

242
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,790
- Oh I see. 
 - Dong Sik, are you okay?

243
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,320
- Ah, I just th-think I'm getting motion sickness.

244
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,630
Is there a smell in the car?

245
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,990
Hey.

246
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,610
Did you not brush your teeth after you had soybean stew?

247
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,850
I did.

248
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,200
How is work going? Has the Team Leader bothered you since then?

249
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,250
That is ...

250
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,570
I get it.

251
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,160
Those stingy people.

252
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,950
Isn't that a common trick?

253
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,210
Not giving you any work to do to hurt your performance, then make you leave on your own.

254
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,810
Then, if you don't do any work, they'll fire you.

255
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,710
They've already decided to let you go.

256
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,450
 I'm a psychopath and I'm talking about my problems to the cops.

257
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,380
I don't know if this will be helpful, but it would be nice to switch places with you.

258
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,430
I have so many things I'm ordered to do that I don't have time for things I want to do.

259
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,880
If they don't give me work, I'd say thank you.

260
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,170
Nothings going to change if I start working harder.

261
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,990
So don't be depressed about having more time. Just do what makes your heart race.

262
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,340
Follow your subconscious. Do that.

263
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,100
Sunbae, you're really not working two jobs, right?

264
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,270
I told you I wasn't.

265
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,350
 Something that makes my heart race. Follow my subconscious.

266
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,290
 Okay.

267
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,490
 Even the local cop is encouraging herself.

268
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,300
 I need to focus on what I really need to do.

269
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,790
 And that is ...

270
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,570
 Second Degree Murder   
  Suspect

271
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,840
 Homicide project

272
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,830
I think your idea is the best, Team Leader.

273
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,200
Will Yook Dong Sik come or will he not? What about betting on it, huh?

274
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
Ah, a bet is a bit...

275
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,010
What? It looks like it is bothering you because he's your colleague, after all that.

276
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,530
No, it's just a bit uncomfortable, even though I'll feel refreshed not seeing him.

277
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,770
Good morning!

278
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,990
 What?

279
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,830
He's doing something. What is he doing?

280
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,240
He must be working on his performance.

281
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,200
No, if you pull an all-nighter to study the day before an exam, you can increase your rank,

282
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,100
but for the work we do, would it work? It's already obvious, with the money he was trusted for investment job.

283
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,830
- Could it be he's got a source somewhere? 
 - A source?

284
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,950
Even if you make sibling-like relationships by diligently buttering up to the masters in this field,

285
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,930
they gulp the real honey by themselves

286
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,390
and throw you the leftover crumbs when they feel like getting credit. That is a source. Shit.

287
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,960
Move.

288
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,870
What could it be for him to be so serious?

289
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,100
He looks like he's enjoying it a lot, though?

290
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,390
Did he, pow pow! Catch a killer number?

291
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,430
A killing count?

292
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,530
In that case, for us, coffee pow!

293
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,770
Morning coffee pow!

294
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,320
- Oh my God. 
 - Pow pow pow!

295
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,720
- Let's drink coffee, coffee pow! 
 - Pow pow!

296
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Coffee pow!

297
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,030
What is he doing?

298
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,670
Yook Dong Sik.

299
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,750
A killing count? 
  (Office floor plan)

300
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,120
He's just trying to squirm, that's all.

301
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,800
We never know, so keep watch over what he's doing.

302
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,960
Director told me to take good care of moving this.

303
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,750
Work well.

304
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,160
Why is it like this?

305
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,710
Do you have something to do here?

306
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,550
Perhaps, could I, urgently,

307
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:27,840
and discreetly, meet the director, just us two?

308
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,270
Did you book a meeting? What's your division and name?

309
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,770
What is it? Did someone come?

310
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,060
I asked if someone came?

311
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,800
Before, there was ...

312
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,940
- What? 
 - His height was this much ...

313
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,840
And his shirt ...

314
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,510
What are you saying?

315
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,090
 As expected, killing someone is not an easy task.

316
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,880
 What's more, the guy is the heir, the top of our company's executive management board.

317
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,410
 A mere employee like me can't approach him easily.

318
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,200
Look, there's a document missing here.

319
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,180
Look for it.

320
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,480
He was snickering while working earlier,  but something must not be going his way.

321
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,680
He must be seriously stressed.

322
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,920
What could he do? No matter how much we worry, nothing will change.

323
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,610
Still, I feel bad for him.

324
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,120
It's hard, right?

325
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,480
Ah, yes.

326
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,050
 Who is he?

327
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,080
They say that Director Seo will be cutting people depending on performance?

328
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,400
Yes.

329
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,550
 I think I have to act as if I know him.

330
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,960
It could be quite irritating, but our work is like that.

331
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,180
Since it's a field where we endlessly need to prove ourselves to survive in this unlimited competition.

332
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,140
 He's a good speaker,

333
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:32,020
 and has the fashion of a rich person with a clean-cut appearance.

334
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,220
 He must be from the sales team.

335
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,860
I have a good source that only I know.

336
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,220
 He's indeed from the sales team.

337
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,480
It's alright. I don't have the leisure to pay attention to other things.

338
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,060
I'm busy.

339
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,170
Wait, wait, wait.

340
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,580
You'll leave without listening? When it's my source?

341
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,430
I'm sorry. I'm quite busy.

342
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,380
No but!

343
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,360
Listen to it, first.

344
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,270
It's a Chinese game company called SOK,  and tomorrow they'll be listed on  KOSDAQ  (Korea Securities Dealers Automated Quotations).

345
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,960
But do you know who will come to the listing ceremony?
( Listed: the stock can be bought and sold on the exchange)

346
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,520
Prime Minister Xi Jin Ping's nephew.

347
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,640
It's still top secret, and from noon the trade volume will explode and purchases will start.

348
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,810
Articles are planned to come out in the afternoon, so if you mobilize the funds and purchase before then ...

349
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:39,140
 How desperate must he be, that he's so frantically trying to convince me?

350
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,940
 It's tear jerking.

351
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,130
It's a sure thing, really!

352
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,740
With this, you can screw over Director Seo in one go, Dong Sik.

353
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,170
Yes yes, I understand.

354
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,420
I will try my best somehow.

355
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,930
Thank you.

356
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,530
The death of a salaryman.

357
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,780
The extreme decision of employee Mr. L due to excessive stress at work.

358
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,070
 Noona

359
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,350
Yes?

360
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,170
What yes? Are you at work?

361
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,970
Yes. I mean, yep.

362
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,780
How is it at work these days?

363
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,560
There isn't anything wrong?

364
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,060
No, it's just, well ...

365
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,690
Really, you're always like this. Hey, if you're having a hard time, say it!

366
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,460
And if there is something I can help with, talk about it.

367
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,620
There isn't really anything, though.

368
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,010
- It's nothing much, but— 
 - What is it, what?

369
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,250
It doesn't really have anything to do with me, but someone asked me for help.

370
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,290
There's a stock called SOK that's being listed tomorrow.

371
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:21,580
Don't expect too much from it, but think of it as saving a pitiful person. Yeah, yeah.

372
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,580
In the morning, yeah. Well, I'm busy, so then.

373
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:35,160
 Even such a cold psychopath like me would want to help him out.

374
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,670
 Should I say it's the joys and sorrows of the office worker's life?

375
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,190
Why is the money short?

376
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh? It shouldn't be, though?

377
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,520
Perhaps, did the youngest touch it?

378
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,490
Dong Chan? No way.

379
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,540
These days, he's constantly asking for money.

380
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,260
 My daughter Ji Yeon

381
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,970
Yeah, Ji Yeon?

382
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,960
What? Dong Sik?

383
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,360
Alright, understood.

384
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,550
What is it?

385
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,580
She says that Dong Sik called her and asked to buy some shares.

386
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,290
- All of a sudden? 
 - That's what I'm saying!

387
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,170
It's the first time he is making that kind of request.

388
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,160
He said that he might be fired from work, it looks like it's not easy for him to hold on.

389
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,390
Call all the members from the hiking club.

390
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,860
Okay okay. You guys are all here?

391
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,060
It looks like a few are missing.

392
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,690
You all got it, right? Daehan Securities.

393
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,650
Sales representatibe, Yook Dong Sik.

394
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,130
Stock, SOK.

395
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,120
When? Tomorrow, in the morning.

396
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,800
If it doesn't fly, it will be break-even, and if it fails ... If it fails,

397
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,960
I'll sell this restaurant and compensate you for all your losses,

398
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,890
so I'm asking this of you, just this once.

399
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,130
I'll never forget this grace.

400
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,480
I won't forget it.

401
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,760
What grace? We owe you so much, of course, we'll help!

402
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,650
He's your eldest son. There's nothing like children.

403
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,660
Isn't it so?

404
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,050
I'm so grateful I can't handle it. All of you come on in

405
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,780
and have some meat, each of you.

406
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,620
Come in!

407
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,350
 Seo Ji Hoon Homicide Plan

408
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,950
A rope, chair,

409
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,960
saw (foldable), mask,

410
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,200
burlap sack. Oh, right!

411
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,700
Antidiarrheal.

412
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
All of you have a smartphone, right?

413
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,490
These days, you can trade stocks with just a smart phone!

414
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,920
You just have to download Daehan Securities' app.

415
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,840
E as in English, A, B, C, D, E.

416
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,770
A, B, C, D, E's E.

417
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,220
I see, the letter E!

418
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,690
That's what I'm saying!

419
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,150
If you do amazingly, you have to treat me!

420
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,460
You have to!

421
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,200
This is a sure thing!

422
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,950
That's what I'm saying!

423
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,060
Okay!

424
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,850
Okay!

425
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,320
Okay!

426
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,960
Bring all the meat!

427
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,790
Let's be sensible about it, huh?

428
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,870
Do I have to tell you everything?

429
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,410
Honey, Honey!

430
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,370
- Honey! Look.
 - Oh!

431
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,210
 Upper Price Limit 
 165,000

432
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,200
  Again Upper Price Limit

433
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,580
 Again, Upper Price Limit

434
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,020
 Upper price limit – the maximum price allowed by the stock exchange for a stock for the day

435
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,300
 set to limit volatility in stock prices.

436
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,840
 Every Friday night, Upper Price Limit.

437
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,670
 OK

438
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,520
  I'll kill you, Seo Ji Hoon.

439
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,390
 That bastard is still hanging on?

440
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,510
Little by little, he'll hit his limit.

441
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,420
Of course! Today's the performance check day anyway!

442
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,970
Yes, yes.

443
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,860
As soon as the market's closed, we'll put them together

444
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,800
and we'll beat him to a pulp!

445
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,890
Yes, yes. Okay, then.

446
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,730
Team Leader!

447
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,460
What is it?

448
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,700
The... the thing...

449
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,620
  SOK 190,513 (+30%)

450
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,400
- Excuse me. 
 - Ridiculous

451
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,130
 1 Yook Dong Sik SOK 48.7% Asset Management Team 3

452
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,320
 Yook Dong Sik

453
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,190
Yook Dong Sik, you got on this?

454
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,970
And before we calculated performance.

455
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,000
Well, it- it just happened somehow.

456
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,180
Instinctively?

457
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,830
Then what happened to the account? Where did you gather up this money from?

458
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,800
Well, just... I think my father gave it to me or something.

459
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,400
What does your father do? Does he turn out to be a wealthy CEO or something?

460
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,320
He owns a meat restaurant. He is the president of a hiking club.

461
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,060
At this rate, this week...

462
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,680
It's number one in performance this month!

463
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,460
 Yook Dong Sik, SOK, 48.7%, Asset Management Team 3

464
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,200
How did I not even rank at all?

465
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,490
Wow, cool! Yoo-hoo!

466
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,650
I guess I was lucky.

467
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,960
  Should I have bought some, too?

468
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,410
 Never mind. What's important to me right now isn't performance but the homicide plan.

469
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:57,830
  I have a rough plan of the kidnapping and an alibi, but...

470
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,370
 I haven't been able to settle on the most important thing.

471
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,700
 How am I going to kill?

472
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,190
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

473
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,130
Hello.

474
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,770
It turned out even better than expected.

475
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,600
Well, yes.

476
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,590
Thanks to you.

477
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm thinking about making you an even better suggestion.

478
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:36,130
Would you like to listen to my plan over a drink?

479
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,050
  He got lucky with one share, and he's over the moon about it.

480
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,750
I have other plans,

481
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,650
so let's talk next time.

482
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,860
- What? 
 - Then.

483
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,790
- Hello! 
 - Oh.

484
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,440
Yes.

485
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,980
Yes, good-bye.

486
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,870
Was he lucky or did he use a trick of some kind?

487
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,720
Why is this acting up now?!

488
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,510
Where did Yook Dong Sik go?!

489
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,460
He left early. He was confident about it, too.

490
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,020
He left early? Left early! You want to get beat up?

491
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,500
What? Continue what you were doing.

492
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,600
What? You don't drink?

493
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,320
I will just!

494
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,720
The knife would cause the blood to splatter too much.

495
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,690
Should I wear a raincoat?

496
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,340
Should I just strangle his neck?

497
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,090
He won't stay still I'm sure.

498
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,460
Damn it, it's not like it's my first time killing someone.

499
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,990
Should I just leave it to my instincts?

500
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,980
No, no. I have to make it perfect and clean.

501
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,420
It's not like I can practice it somewhere.

502
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,220
It's hot. It's so hot.

503
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,510
Excuse me.

504
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,480
Seong Tae!

505
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,170
What?

506
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,030
  The Best in the World 
 Launch of a Live Escape Room Cafe.

507
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:08,350
Yes, the room you've selected is a complete crime room.

508
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,110
What is a crime room, you ask?

509
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,490
Using the various clues in the room, you will guess how the murder was committed—

510
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,960
You don't need to explain.

511
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,050
This must be important for you to contact me first.

512
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,920
I was in such a rush that I couldn't even finish my makeup properly.

513
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,670
I'll have the same.

514
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,100
Right?

515
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,090
If I ask you to have a drink, it's normal for you to enjoy it, right?

516
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,740
What are you talking about?

517
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,720
What kind of girl is it?

518
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,600
Girl?

519
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,490
Do I look like someone who would be like this because of a girl?

520
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,370
I'm sorry.

521
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,180
 Escape Room Cafe

522
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,520
They're putting on a freaking show.

523
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,950
They say they don't need any explanations and are stuck even with extended time.

524
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,930
There's always someone like him.

525
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:22,080
They're making me do the same work twice.

526
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,920
As expected, is it the knife?

527
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,990
If you approach quietly from the back and ...

528
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:39,130
No, no. It just doesn't seem like a serial killer.

529
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,290
Like this. From the front. Just walk straight.

530
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,730
They'd get scared, right?

531
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,750
Yeah, they'd be scared.

532
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:54,140
And that's when—

533
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,970
Die! Die!

534
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,710
Die! Die! Die!

535
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,790
Die! Die! Die!

536
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,020
Die! Die!

537
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,680
Die! Die! Die! Die!

538
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,400
Is this the police?

539
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,980
There's a weird person here.

540
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,760
Get out! Get out!

541
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,730
- Can I just ask you one more question? 
 - No! Go!

542
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,740
That was so long ago! Why are you bringing it up again?

543
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,110
We don't even want to think about it! It's fine!

544
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,540
How unlucky.

545
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,960
Could you please just try to think about this again?

546
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,510
What are you doing right now? These elderly folks are pitiful enough as it is.

547
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:41,400
We don't need your help so please never come back!

548
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,160
Please leave.

549
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,740
My heart hurts!

550
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,970
I'm sorry.

551
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,990
Please leave.

552
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,100
I have a mountain of suicide cases to look into, but nobody's even letting me talk.

553
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,850
- Yeah. 
 - Where are you? We got a report.

554
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,010
There was something I had to do really quick. I'll be right there.

555
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,500
What's the location?

556
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,620
This is him.

557
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,240
That person is ...

558
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,380
It's Dong Sik, right?

559
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,730
He's said he's being targeted by management. He must be under a lot of stress.

560
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:51,480
Do you think the mannequin is going to die by doing that?

561
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,520
Corporal Sim ... How did you ...

562
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,520
A report came in. A suspicious person looked like he was getting ready to murder someone.

563
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,630
This is ...

564
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,490
You see, if you want to leave the room ...

565
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,840
You must figure out how the murderer killed him.

566
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:28,130
Oh?  Seeing you this nervous makes it seem even more suspicious.

567
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,430
No. I-I-It's not that.

568
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,210
It's okay, Dong Sik. Who doesn't have a boss they want to kill?

569
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,940
Isn't that right?

570
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,170
This jerk boss, huh?

571
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,530
How should we kill him so that it makes our Yook Dong Sik feel better, huh?

572
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,310
How should I kick him? Carry him.

573
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,690
Why? Ah!

574
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:52,740
- Step back a bit. 
 - Ah, okay okay!

575
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,180
How should we do this? Like this?

576
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,980
Your posture, whoa!

577
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,520
No, wait.

578
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,770
Are you okay?

579
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,990
It's hard.

580
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,690
That's why, no matter how much you hate your superior, think well about it,

581
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,200
since killing is quite a difficult task.

582
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Psychopaths must also really have quite a headache.

583
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,840
Of course. They must be using their head so much.

584
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,090
Since they can't be caught, they have to make up an alibi,

585
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,940
hide the weapon, abandon the corpse ...

586
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:57,170
- Yes. 
 -  To not be caught, no matter what.

587
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,650
Would it be only that?

588
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,860
Pardon?

589
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:05,310
Of course, the most important would be not to get caught,

590
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,780
but the really scary psychos, how should I say it?

591
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:12,680
Wouldn't they think about murder as their own work of art?

592
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,200
So, like artists do,

593
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,870
they try to express some kind of message or desire through murder.

594
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,280
And the target or space that suits it?

595
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,630
Even the method, they choose them very meticulously.

596
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:34,660
We could also think like this, that's right.

597
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,190
Ah no, I'm saying that's what it was like from the movie.

598
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,220
That, what was it? Saw? Was that Saw?

599
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,770
It was fun today.

600
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,880
- Go in. 
 - Yes.

601
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,420
Murder is a work of art,

602
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:08,300
if they chose their target meticulously in order to express something?

603
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,040
 Finally, I found it.

604
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,110
 The murder method that suits Seo Ji Hoon the best.

605
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,200
Your heart must be aching just by thinking about your son,

606
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,970
but there is something I absolutely need to ask you.

607
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,860
He went to live in a student cell, after saying he would fulfill his filial duty by becoming a civil servant,

608
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,970
and five years later came back as a corpse. Did he really commit suicide?

609
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,650
Look here! I decided to bury it in my heart and live on, but why do you keep on doing that?

610
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,810
My apologies, but do you also really think he committed suicide?

611
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,960
You said you kept on saying to conduct an autopsy, then.

612
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,610
When I said to conduct an autopsy, do you know what they all said?

613
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,010
That he deserved to die!

614
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,460
I am chasing a murderer.

615
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,060
That skunk, as if making some kind of artwork,

616
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,320
chooses weak and poor people and kills them, disguising the deaths as suicide.

617
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,640
Do you know why?

618
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,740
Because far from thinking it's strange that they died suddenly,

619
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,600
people think it's explainable.

620
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:35,960
Anyone can have a life that is so hard they might want to die,

621
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,990
but there isn't anyone for whom it is okay to  just die.

622
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,360
Our Min Seok ...

623
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,520
couldn't have committed suicide.

624
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:01,420
No. There is no way he committed suicide.

625
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,350
It's the suicide letter.

626
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:18,250
 I am mooching off my mother on the excuse of study,

627
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,620
 when in reality it is just a repetition of days vacantly spending my time in the student dorm room.

628
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:27,800
 I am worse than vermin. I don't have hope anymore.

629
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,450
 Mother. I am sorry.

630
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,480
But no matter how hard it was for him because of his studies,

631
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,140
he never mooched off me.

632
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,360
Before he died, he said that his grade was just short of the cutline.

633
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,430
And that he would pass for sure the next time.

634
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:52,200
Could I see something else with your son's handwriting?

635
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,060
Yes.

636
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,500
Here.

637
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:11,710
It is indeed my kid's handwriting.

638
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,580
Perhaps, were there any strange marks on your son's body?

639
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:27,130
Either blood on his fingers, or some wound?

640
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:30,420
There was a bruise on his left hand's thumb.

641
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,030
According to the autopsy, it was like he was pricked by a needle.

642
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,710
Mother, I'll borrow that a bit.

643
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,540
You're here. Sit comfortably.

644
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,630
In this era of work-life balance, I'm sorry for preventing you from going home by telling you to come up.

645
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:07,030
No, it's alright. But what did you call me for?

646
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:14,520
It looks like you are nervous. I'm telling you, be comfortable.

647
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,360
These days, these kind of nothings get misunderstood

648
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,200
and there are fusses about workplace sexual harassment and all that, right?

649
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:33,240
My Oh Mi Joo, how long has it been since you entered the company?

650
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,840
It will soon be the third year, Director.

651
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:44,060
In truth, they say that you can succeed in this field as long as you have the skills.

652
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:48,460
But the base itself is different, you see? But those scum who started life in the  third class,

653
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,440
they think they made a third-base hit and are trying hard.

654
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,840
Isn't it so?

655
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,630
My Mi Joo, look at the state of your performance score when you worked so hard.

656
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,450
I heard your parents have some debt from gambling?

657
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:07,210
Ah, why did they use money from loan sharks?

658
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,170
With your salary, you wouldn't be able to cope with it, though?

659
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,320
How do you ...

660
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,060
Since I'm the director.

661
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,850
You see, I would like it if things went well for people like you.

662
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,900
Since the game started with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning,

663
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,600
if you get a sprain just once, it's game over right away.

664
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,020
You need to step on it and return to base, don't you?

665
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,120
 Now all planning is complete.

666
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,390
 The decisive action ... today.

667
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:18,610
Ah, Mr. Dong Sik. Get on.

668
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:42,130
Yook Dong Sik. Did you become bolder, or did you just lose fear?

669
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,050
Seo Ji Hoon, will you be able to handle him alone?

670
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,670
I don't know what you're saying.

671
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:58,360
Do you think I wouldn't know what you are trying to do?

672
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,720
Wh-Wh-What? What is it?

673
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,450
The one who put the comment on the blind is you.

674
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:09,270
I don't know what you are scheming, but with your strength alone,

675
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,960
you won't be able to make a scratch on Seo Ji Hoon.

676
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,300
Ah, yes, you're right.

677
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,610
Come work under me.

678
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,440
Why would I?

679
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,660
This is not a proposition, but a warning.

680
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:37,520
If you mess up the board by yourself as you please, I won't leave you alone.

681
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,730
Don't touch me.

682
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,620
You'll get hurt.

683
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,330
- Aren’t you leaving? 
 - Pardon? Oh.

684
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,740
I have some work still left to do.

685
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,000
I’m leaving first then since I have an appointment.

686
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,750
Yes, good-bye.

687
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:22,270
  The plan is complete, and all I now have to do is carry it out.

688
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,890
  Why can’t I get calm?

689
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,550
  Should I postpone it?

690
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,610
What are you doing? Coffee time?

691
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,630
Oh, I’m okay.

692
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,920
- I have something to take care of. 
 - Oh, really?

693
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,920
I guess you have a lot of things you have to do.

694
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,250
Dong Sik, hang in there. Fighting!

695
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,800
Okay.

696
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,130
  That’s right. I have to hang in there so I can kill him!

697
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:01,520
Well, I already made this, so just have a taste. Oh, no! No!

698
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,120
Oh, it’s hot, right?

699
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,960
I’m fine. It happens.

700
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,090
Oh, it’s a problem if it stains! There’s soap in the bathroom, so let’s go clean it.

701
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,220
Please, let’s go. Please!

702
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,250
Let’s go. Let’s go!

703
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,580
  This isn’t me getting nervous but excited.

704
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,150
  The plan is perfect.

705
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,560
  Let’s go, Yook Dong Sik.

706
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,830
  While being cruel and cold, you're a meticulous psychopath.

707
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,210
Yook Dong Sik, what are you doing?!

708
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,640
What is it? What’s going on?

709
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,430
It’s nothing.

710
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,950
What is it? Assistant Manager Park, spit it out.

711
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,260
Dong Sik used his phone to take pictures of Mi Joo's le... Never mind.

712
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,020
What? Hey.

713
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,670
What are you saying?

714
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:38,050
Wow, Yook Dong Sik. You. Give me your phone.

715
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,740
Let me see the photo on your phone.

716
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,590
Go ahead. Goodness.

717
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,920
Look at this. Look at it, just look at it.

718
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,410
Look. Hey, you. What the hell is this picture?

719
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:02,210
This, this,  can get you in serious trouble!

720
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,580
 No way...

721
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,240
 It doesn't look like there's anyone around.

722
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,790
 Go quickly.

723
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,750
 Hurry, hurry. Bring the towel.

724
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,470
 Get into position.

725
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,280
 Team Leader, isn't this a bit...

726
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,170
 We're all in the same boat! Hurry up, get in position. We don't have much time.

727
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,090
 Quickly!

728
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,740
 Good.

729
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,150
Now you’re even taking secret photos at work?

730
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,610
Assistant Manager Park, call the police.

731
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,850
Well, I don't know if we should go that far.

732
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,910
Since it happened at work, how about we follow the company’s policy?

733
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,260
If we went by the internal rules,

734
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,980
we could be done if he officially apologizes and we have him resign,

735
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:11,190
but would that be enough for Mi Joo?

736
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,830
Mi Joo, is that enough for you?

737
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,460
See, would you look at him? He's still looking at her with such sleazy eyes.

738
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,710
He still hasn't come to his senses.

739
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,780
We don't have a choice. We have the evidence so call the police!

740
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,900
Do whatever you want.

741
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,120
I'm sorry. You had to go through this because of me.

742
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:42,680
Don't move. This is also sexual harassment.

743
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:50,260
Let go! Ow! Let go!

744
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:53,050
Swing my arm back. Hey!

745
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,130
Where do you think you're going?

746
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,360
That little...

747
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,430
It'll be okay.

748
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:12,180
 Using a woman as a tool to commit such a crude act like this...

749
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:18,400
 Seo Ji Hoon, I’ll take care of you right away!

750
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,540
Did the blood identification results come out?

751
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:33,120
I was worried since it’s been some time, but we detected a luminol glow from one sample.

752
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,800
 TN:  Luminol glows if sprayed on traces of blood.

753
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,970
What is this? I think it’s about time you told me.

754
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:54,410
This is like a seal that the person I’m chasing after has been leaving,

755
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,850
So you’re saying this blood fingerprint is the signature

756
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:04,280
of the serial killer who hasn’t been identified yet to the world?

757
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,890
Yes.

758
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,270
Civil service exam test taker, Oh Min Seok,

759
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,900
overdosed on sleeping pills at his rooftop apartment earlier this year, and it was ruled a suicide.

760
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,520
An elderly who lived alone, Park Mal Soon,

761
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,020
took sleeping pills and died from gas inhalation which was ruled as a suicide.

762
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,510
Homeless man, Kim Meung Goo,

763
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:26,150
died in a fire after taking sleeping pills which was ruled a suicide.

764
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:32,770
But we found evidence that a bloody left thumbprint was collected from all three of them.

765
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,600
 Team Leader Gong

766
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,670
Did you get it done?

767
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:49,380
Okay! Call the police right away and take care of it according to procedure.

768
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:54,940
I feel so relieved! Because of a bastard who’s a nobody!

769
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,480
Call more girls.

770
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,670
Let’s have real fun tonight!

771
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:14,580
 Again, Upper Price Limit

772
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,070
You’re having a hard time.

773
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:42,060
Oh, thank you.

774
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,390
It’s tasty.

775
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,200
What’s going on all of a sudden?

776
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,480
Come out quick and open the door!

777
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,350
So slow!

778
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,520
Take care.

779
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:51,610
Have a safe trip home, Director!

780
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:54,280
What? Are we at the office right now?

781
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,590
Take your time going home.

782
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,100
What is this?

783
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,190
It’s supposed to be really good for hangover.

784
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,010
Oh yeah?

785
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,940
This person detests those who are weak.

786
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:34,000
After making the victims incapable of resisting, he kills them while disguising it as a suicide.

787
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,550
I’m sure he gets deluded into thinking he's stronger and greater than the victims.

788
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:03,530
That bastard is probably looking for his prey somewhere, even at this moment.

789
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,660
You bastard! What are you doing!

790
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:03,980
Are you crazy?!

791
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:07,530
Don’t you know who I am? Let me go this instant!

792
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:15,850
Who are you? What are you doing?!

793
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,170
Let’s start the game.

794
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:34,950
 Psychopath Diary

795
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:44,060

796
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,240
 He's very careful and meticulous.

797
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,160
 Pretending to be a fool and a pushover is a cover.

798
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,330
 Did you do it?

799
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:55,680
  Yes, I did.

800
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,720
 I'm going to get that guy.

801
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,030
 I'm Director Seo In Woo, in charge of the Asset Management Team.

802
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:02,170
 Dong Sik faked his amnesia?

803
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,070
 That doesn't make sense.

804
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,580
 Dong Sik, I know more than you think I know about you.

805
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,490
 You were going to commit suicide. You even wrote a suicide note.

806
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:09,840
 Suicide note? What did it say?

807
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,290
 I was going to commit suicide?

808
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:14,050
 Do you have your diary?
