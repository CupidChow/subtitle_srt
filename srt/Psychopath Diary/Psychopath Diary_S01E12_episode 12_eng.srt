 Psychopath Diary

4
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,970
Dong Sik.

5
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,730
Are you going to kill me with that?

6
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,210
You fooled me from the beginning, didn't you?

7
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,080
Trying to help me with the investigation was in order to use me!

8
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
How could a person do that?!

9
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,550
You, too. How could you do that to me?!

10
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,320
If you hadn't suspected me,

11
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,670
I was just going to flee.

12
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,010
Are you giving me that as an excuse?!

13
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,230
Dong Sik, think about this carefully.

14
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,570
It's the last chance to pay for your sins.

15
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,620
I can't do that.

16
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,580
Until the end...

17
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,680
I must be a good person.

18
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,040
So you really are... a psychopath.

19
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,580
That's right.

20
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,940
I don't know why a psychopath like me had that kind of thought,

21
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,200
but I wanted to do that.

22
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,940
To my family...

23
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,340
to co-workers ...

24
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,420
to you, too ...

25
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,820
I can't be caught!

26
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,990
Yook Dong Sik, I'm arresting you as the suspect for the predator serial murder case.

27
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,970
You don't need to go to the hospital?

28
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,400
No.

29
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,510
And this.

30
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:59,190
That pushover, in the end, without being able to kill a single person,

31
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,920
he's become a serial killer.

32
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,230
 Psychopath Diary

33
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,200
 Episode 12

34
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,890
2018, August 25th,

35
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,450
You drowned Park Jae Moon, a 48-years-old male, and made it look accidental. Did you do this?

36
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,260
Yes, I did.

37
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,350
In November of the same year, you cut the wrist of a 28-year-old woman, Lee Ji Hye, and made it look like a suicide.

38
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,250
Yes.

39
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,490
 2019, March 4th, you fed a 32-year-old male, Oh Min Seok, some sleeping pills and made it look like suicide.

40
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,190
On April 24th, you locked up a 72-year-old woman,

41
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,270
Park Mal Soon, at her house. You turned on the gas and made it look like a suicide.

42
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,020
I did all those things.

43
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,780
I killed everyone just like it says in the diary.

44
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
On July 8th, you drowned Hong Jin Goo, a 27-year-old,

45
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,190
in a pharmaceutical factory storage facility and disguised it as a suicide.

46
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,530
And on September 18th, you set fire to the house of Kim Myeong Gook, 64-year-old male,

47
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,160
and made it look like a suicide.

48
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,950
- And on December 19th, Park Moo Seok, a former detective— 
 - Um...

49
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,390
Kim Myeong Gook is the homeless man, right?

50
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,840
So?

51
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,670
K-Killing that person

52
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,950
should be September 13th, at the construction site.

53
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,540
If you look there—

54
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,960
You said you hurt your head.

55
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,980
Retrograde amnesia?

56
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,650
Yes.

57
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,520
Then it means there's not much credibility to the confession you're making while relying on your memory.

58
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,920
We'll take care of reconstructing the crime and identifying facts,

59
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,610
so you just need to answer the questions you're asked.

60
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,950
I understand.

61
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,700
That Jang Chil Seong, the former thug, is that your accomplice?

62
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,460
Oh, he isn't. As I've told you, I acted alone in those crimes,

63
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,100
and when it comes down to it, he's also one of the victims who was fooled by me.

64
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,700
What did you do with these?

66
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,840
Didn't you take part in the crime?

67
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,720
If you're not an accomplice, why would you help

68
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Yook Dong Sik get rid of evidence? Why, you bastard?!

69
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,660
Are you not going to talk?

70
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,120
The detective said to finish off the questioning and send him home.

71
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,080
Our Hyungnim would never do that.

72
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,380
Killing powerless people. He's not that kind of a person.

73
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,600
He already confessed to everything.

74
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,170
He said he did everything as written in the diary.

75
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,090
What did you say?

76
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,030
Are you okay?

77
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,430
I still can't believe it.

78
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,410
He confessed to everything.

79
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,880
That he killed everyone as written in the diary.

80
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,060
About Mr. Kim, the homeless man...

81
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,480
in the diary is written only about the initial attempt to murder but not the outcome.

82
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,010
He confessed to that, too. That he lost him on the 13th but later caught him

83
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,410
and locked him up in his house and set fire to it.

84
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,220
A compulsive criminal who has the desire to collect

85
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,800
managed to find the victim he once lost and killed him in the end...

86
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,660
Why didn't he write about that in the diary?

87
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,550
Well, he didn't write down every crime in the diary, so...

88
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,380
The murder of Park Moo Seok is also missing.

89
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,280
What about Ms. Son Ji Min's case eight years ago?

90
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,840
That's also not in the diary, but it should be his doing, right?

91
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,820
It's been so long that it won't be easy to obtain evidence.

92
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,240
We'll have to take the time to do a corroborative investigation. Once we confirm the crime, we'll get an additional writ request.

93
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,990
Anyway, what's certain is that he is the predator murderer you've been looking for.

94
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,760
So you can be more proud of it.

95
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,250
 A serial murderer who terrorized people has finally been arrested.

96
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,900
 The suspect has admitted to committing seven murders,

97
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,130
 six of which were conclusively identified in a diary about the suspect' Yook Dong Sik's behavior,

98
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,140
 plus one additional murder for a total of seven counts.

99
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,090
He's coming. He's coming.

100
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,710
It's him! Take pictures!

101
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,140
- Why did you kill them?
 - Why did you record the details of the murders in a diary?

102
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,960
How do you feel now? Do you feel any guilt?

103
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you intend to request a psychological evaluation?

104
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,060
Will you be claiming mental weakness?

105
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,440
We will make a further announcement after the investigation.

106
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,340
I'm not a crazy person

107
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,390
but just a psychopath...

108
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,410
murderer.

109
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,880
Right now, are you confessing to the murders?!

110
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,880
Please, step aside!

111
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,080
Is it true that he enjoyed watching movies about murders?

112
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,010
How are you feeling right now as his family?

113
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,030
Please give us a comment.

114
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,290
Did you know that your son was a psychopath?

115
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,060
You people, I'll report you for interfering with business!

116
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,270
Go in, all of you.

117
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,980
What he wrote in the diary about his hatred toward his family members stands out.

118
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,040
Was the suspect's relationship with family not usually harmonious?

119
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,510
I have no comment.

120
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,830
Please, a word!

121
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,660
What are you doing? Prepare to open for business.

122
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,490
How could you open for business today in this situation?

123
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,840
Why? Have we committed a sin?

124
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
Please open the door!

125
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,540
Dong Chan.

126
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,500
From the time that kid was crawling in diapers until now,

127
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,820
I've never seen him kill even one cockroach.

128
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,090
But that kind of kid killed a person?

129
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,310
Our Dong Sik? There's no way he would.

130
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:54,240
Though the whole world might point at him and criticize him, we have to trust him.

131
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,290
Disconnect all the phone lines, okay?

132
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,840
It's so noisy, it's impossible to work! Disconnect them all!

133
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,580
No way... he couldn't have really done that, right?

134
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,630
Not sure. I don't know anything anymore.

135
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,600
Why can I not disconnect this one?

136
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,840
What do I do?

137
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,670
Mi Joo, why can't you disconnect it?

138
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,550
 Serial Murderer Yook Dong Sik's death penalty petition reaches 200,000 signatures.

139
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,650
Wow, that murderer.

140
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,180
 On all social sites, his past actions,

141
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,010
 his place of residence, and personal information about his family and work,

142
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,720
 are rapidly spreading.

143
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,960
 Especially that Mr. Yook wasn't the type to get noticed,

144
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,810
 and even up until the time of arrest, he led a very ordinary life.

145
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,310
What kind of person...

146
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,570
I mean, he's still doing business?

147
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,650
That President is brazen-faced! Damn!

148
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,760
- This is this restaurant the one? 
 - Is it here?  This restaurant?

149
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
How could they be so guilt-free?

150
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,370
Wow, I can't believe they're still doing business.

151
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,010
You didn't reserve the end-of-the-year party here, right?

152
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,500
I didn't. Never.

153
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,150
 Early this morning, The National Police Agency gave a special 1 rank promotion to Corporal Sim Bo Gyeong

154
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,320
 of Naksan Patrol Division who caught the serial killer Yook Dong Sik, who was known as the predator murderer.

155
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,160
 And as though the Department of Justice is well-aware of the public's opinion,

156
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,130
 for swift punishment of Yook Dong Sik,

157
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,870
 they will make a judgment on the seven murders for which evidence and testimony have been obtained

158
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,870
 as early as  this week.

159
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,130
 Meanwhile the leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly ...

160
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,770
Defendant, if you have any last words, please speak.

161
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,270
I don't have any.

162
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,600
Now then, we'll hand down the

163
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,600
ruling for the defendant Yook Dong Sik.

164
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,020
With the evidence retained during the original trial,

165
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,050
if we look at them and compare against the records,

166
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,810
after he killed the victims...

167
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,030
I sentence him to life in prison.

168
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,250
Judge!

169
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,130
Judge! My son would never do such a thing!

170
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,370
Come on, Dong Sik, tell him it's not true! Hurry!

171
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,080
Hey, tell him! What are you doing, Dong Sik!

172
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,870
Dong Sik! Judge!

173
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,030
Judge!

174
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,990
Hey, Dong Sik, don't go like that!

175
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,150
Dong Sik! Dong Sik!

176
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,410
Dong Sik!

177
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,580
You bastard!

178
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,580
How could Yook Dong Sik do that?

179
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:52,020
I mean, when you told me you suspected him, I thought it was really ridiculous.

180
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,610
Sunbae... you really did something amazing.

181
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,490
You know, right?

182
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,630
Don't be like that. Let's be happy and celebrate it!

183
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,330
I can't understand, that's why.

184
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,620
People like us... how could we understand the mind of a psychopath?

185
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,210
Still,

186
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,830
the person I knew as Yook Dong Sik and the psychopath Yook Dong Sik...

187
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,840
seem like completely different people.

188
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,810
The moment he tried to kill you,

189
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,380
the person we knew as Yook Dong Sik died.

190
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,330
Stop, stop, stop. Just shake it all off.

191
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,300
If Detective Sim knew about this, he would have been very proud.

192
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,220
Do you think so?

193
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,400
Oh, of course!

194
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,910
Then why did he appear again?

195
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,350
What?

196
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,610
Never mind.

197
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,340
It probably means I need to look after my dad well.

198
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Is that him?

199
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,180
Oh, it's that serial killer.

200
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,330
How is he a killer?

201
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,420
He doesn't look like he would have killed people.

202
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,920
It's him?

203
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,960
He's a psychopath.

204
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,600
He's a total psycho!

205
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,320
He killed seven people. Seven.

206
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,750
Just the rumored number is that much, but there could be more I heard.

207
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,840
No, no. A grandmother with an incurable illness, a student preparing for an exam, a homeless person, a jobless person.

208
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,890
He picked out all the powerless people and brutally killed them is what I heard.

209
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,680
Also, with that blood, he made an imprint of their thumb in the diary and wrote about it all.

210
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,710
Wow, even if this is a dumpster,

211
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,390
if they put him in here with us, what are we supposed to do? Really!

212
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,630
7046, sit up straight.

213
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,110
My back hurts a bit. You know already.

214
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,100
Prisoner number 9062, enter.

215
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,750
You look normal on the outside. Just by the looks of you, you look human.

216
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,830
You're that infamous Yook Dong Sik?

217
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,060
What did they say?

218
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,390
What? A predator?

219
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,110
Are you talking to me?

220
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,850
Then who else in here is called Yook Dong Sik?

221
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,620
I'm sorry. You weren't looking at me while talking, so I didn't know.

222
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,020
Wow, are you telling me to look you in the eyes when I talk to you from now on? Is that it?

223
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,900
Oh, no. No. I wasn't thinking.

224
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,360
I'm sure it's not comfortable to look at someone like me in the eyes.

225
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
From now on, I'll keep my eyes lowered.

226
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,380
Look at this punk.

227
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,620
Are you saying if I look into your eyes, I'll pee my pants or something?! What, punk!

228
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,460
Let go! Let me go take a look at his eyeballs!

229
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,400
Let's see.

230
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,990
Look at me. Why? Are you scared?

231
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,570
Look at me, I said!

232
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,770
Wh-What is with this punk?

233
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,730
Oh, it's... it's...

234
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,870
I didn't do it to scare you. I'm sorry if it did.

235
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,360
Sit down. Sit.

236
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,660
 Cheong An Hospital
 - If you stop treatment, we can't guarantee the patient's condition.

237
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,730
For the time being, I have some time off.

238
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,490
I thought it would be better for my mom and me to care for him.

239
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,630
But getting expert care from a doctor is—

240
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,280
We did for several months, but he seems to be getting worse.

241
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,670
I'm not blaming the hospital. I'm sure it's due to not being able to care for him with the excuse that I'm busy.

242
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,920
Thank you for everything.

243
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,630
Yes.

244
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,160
I did the right thing, right?

245
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,850
 Thank you, my daughter.

246
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,070
 No, no. Not over there. Over here.

247
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,850
But...

248
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:42,150
 I perceive a peculiar sense of difference between Yook Dong Sik and that diary.

249
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,720
Exactly why do I feel this way?

250
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,150
It's because you think that way.

251
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,420
If he really is the predator, he could have killed you at that time.

252
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,660
But why did he hesitate at the crucial moment?

253
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,750
But... you remember his face, right?

254
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,570
It was feeling a guilty conscience.

255
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,080
It wasn't the face of a psychopath.

256
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,970
You met with the president, right?

257
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,730
I apologize, that is—

258
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,000
If he calls for you, you have to go. Why would you apologize to me?

259
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So, what did he ask? If I killed Park Moo Seong?

260
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,140
No. He asked about meeting Park Moo Seok and your personal account,

261
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,440
but it seemed like he was just confirming what he already knew.

262
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,670
Is that right?

263
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,430
So,

264
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,970
what do you think?

265
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,190
About?

266
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,680
Do you still see me as the murderer who killed Park Moo Seok?

267
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,930
I believe the culprit was already caught. Didn't Yook Dong Sik confess to everything?

268
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,720
Why would I ask about what the whole world knows?

269
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,010
I'm curious about your thoughts.

270
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,440
I don't believe so.

271
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,320
You suspected Yook Dong Sik from the beginning thinking something was strange about him,

272
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,680
but I didn't realize that and—

273
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,370
But... the president keeps having strange thoughts.

274
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,520
I feel like someone is egging him on.

275
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,820
If not you, I would like to find out who exactly is responsible for that.

276
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,410
I'll look into it.

277
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,010
Quietly. Please.

278
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,030
Yeah. Discharged?

279
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,170
I couldn't help it. She abruptly insisted on taking him.

280
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,020
You should have stopped them no matter what.

281
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,690
How is the man's condition?

282
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,450
It will be hard for him to communicate for the time being.

283
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,480
I told her to get a monthly check-up,so I'll keep you posted on his condition.

284
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,200
Damn.

285
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,350
Bo Gyeong...

286
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,610
I don't like that guy. He seems wicked.

287
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,200
Also, this isn't the time to leisurely go on dates.

288
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,900
Please be quiet. Shoo! Shoo!

289
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,340
Congratulations on your promotion. Your father would have been proud, too.

290
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,160
By the way, about Father...

291
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,860
I heard from my friend.

292
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,980
If that's how you feel, I understand.

293
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,520
How is he doing?

294
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,440
For now... I have to keep a watch and see.

295
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,480
By chance, if you did that because of the hospital bill, you don't need to worry.

296
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,800
I told you before, too, but I sincerely think of you as—

297
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,360
Actually, I was going to return it to you.

298
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,220
And I'm thankful for your generosity but—

299
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,660
-  Bo Gyeong. 
 - Sorry.

300
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,400
Then...

301
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,140
I know you're having a hard time.

302
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,660
You were that close to Dong Sik, so of course you would be sad.

303
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,450
It's natural for you to feel betrayed, but—

304
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,730
I have no time to wallow in those types of feelings.

305
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,410
You see, there's something I really need to confirm.

306
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,650
And you told me to be quiet.

307
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,820
Instead of personal feelings, you chose your calling as an officer.

308
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,820
As expected, you're my daughter.

309
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,810
That's enough.

310
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,540
Anyway, if your daughter can't get married, just know it's all your fault.

311
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,090
Why is that my fault? I'm your subconscious. It's your fault.

312
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,080
Anyway, so how long are you going to appear this time?

313
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,790
Until Yook Dong Sik is cleared of the false charges?

314
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,930
It's already a false charge?

315
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,380
It's really not easy, though...

316
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,940
What?!

317
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,110
Huh?

318
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,220
Sorry. Someone keeps driving like a moron.

319
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,310
What is it?

320
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,240
That is, someone came to see you.

321
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,970
So this is... Dong Sik's suicide note he wrote himself?

322
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,660
After he was solely blamed for the Yuseong Biomedi deal, how wronged he must have felt that he...

323
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,620
This note, too, I was going to rip it up and throw it away,

324
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,430
but I felt guilty so I held onto it.

325
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,870
You're saying the estimated date of attempted suicide is

326
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:02,720
the day he got into an accident and lost his memory, right?

327
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,990
Dong Sik...

328
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,460
after the memory loss,

329
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,440
it does seem like his personality was transformed.

330
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,490
But still... When I saw the news,

331
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,240
it said he killed several people since a while back.

332
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,520
But think about it carefully.

333
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,410
Someone who did that, why would he write a suicide note and attempt to kill himself?

334
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,140
He would have done something to Team Leader Gong!

335
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,540
If not... to me.

336
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,590
True. Something does seem very strange.

337
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,030
But... he confessed.

338
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:51,630
Usually people like this, they're mentally unstable, so they do odd things.

339
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,860
A suicide note, memory loss, and a diary.

340
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,130
It's like an incomplete puzzle is starting to—

341
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,820
Hold on a sec!

342
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,810
Yes. I was...

343
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,180
I'm trying to concentrate while reading this.

344
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,210
You must never cry or get upset here.

345
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,980
You have to be as calm as possible and only say what you need to.

346
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,570
If not, the time will just fly by.

347
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,650
Dong Sik!

348
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,420
Oh...

349
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,080
Are you eating?

350
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,920
Hyungnim!

351
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,160
It will all be revealed! That you didn't commit those crimes!

352
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,850
Hyungnim!

353
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,300
Right! You didn't do this,

354
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,050
so why would you confess?

355
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,600
That man knows that I killed a person.

356
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,430
No. That's ...

357
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm sorry. I have no right to be anyone's child.

358
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,700
So, don't come to see me ever again.

359
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,010
No!

360
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
No.

361
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,590
 Don't cry. Don't cry, Yook Dong Sik.

362
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,730
 You're not even a human being, so you have no right to be sad.

363
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,020
I have to hold back. I have to hold back!

364
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,320
Are you okay?

365
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,820
I think I peed my pants.

366
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,390
Let's not bother him.

367
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,800
I thought I smelled poop! Hey Poop Poo, go away!

368
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,670
 A Boring Day

369
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,560
A pushover, Yook Dong Sik, who even wrote a suicide note and tried to commit suicide after being wrongly blamed.

370
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,830
A predator murderer who tried to attack and kill a homeless person.

371
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,000
Could the two be the same person?

372
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,370
The simplest answer is this.

373
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,920
The Yook Dong Sik who tried to kill himself

374
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,720
and the predator who tried to kill the homeless man are...

375
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,570
Different people.

376
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,030
Then what about the diary?

377
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,200
It would obviously be the predator's.

378
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,650
If that's true, in the hands of Yook Dong Sik who lost his memory,

379
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,240
the predator's diary was given.

380
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,680
How about it? Isn't it plausible?

381
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:23,750
It's not that there's no possibility, but it's too...

382
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,610
Who are you talking to?

383
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,820
I was talking to Taek Soo.

384
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,260
Have you had dinner?

385
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,850
You want me to make you something?

386
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,560
No.

387
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,870
Are you okay?

388
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,660
Oh, my eyesight's not been good lately.

389
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,510
Since when? You should have told me.

390
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,760
Team Leader Jo, have you looked into it?

391
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,650
Who? Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon?

392
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,540
Good job.

393
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,530
I did get a bad feeling at the hospital that time when I brushed past him.

394
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,690
I don't know what he heard from Sim Bo Gyeong,

395
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,360
but he found out that the true culprit he couldn't catch was me?

396
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,120
That's why he met with the president?

397
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,630
Why? To blackmail him or something?

398
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,020
Ryu Jae Joon ...

399
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,630
it's too bad...

400
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,840
but you won't be able to die by suicide.

401
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,460
Can you see well?

402
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,670
Oh, I should have gotten glasses sooner! I can see clearly now.

403
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:54,890
Sorry, Mom. I've been too busy with work, haven't I?

404
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,320
What do you mean, so unexpectedly?

405
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,620
You and dad are people who get sick if you don't do your job.

406
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:07,090
No. I'm somewhat established now, so I'll help take some of your burden.

407
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,750
You should spend more time with Dad, too.

408
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,590
That would make me happy.

409
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,350
 Next news. The serial killer who received the sentence of life without parole,

410
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,470
 he's currently in—

411
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,590
Dad must have been shocked.

412
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,560
 The anger toward the horrendous crimes he committed—

413
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,780
Wait.

414
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,480
 has still not subsided.

415
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,600
 Especially, the reporters who—

416
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,180
That man is, Yook Dong Sik?

417
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,020
The serial killer?

418
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,690
Yeah.

419
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,530
- That's right. 
   - We should avoid the media's extremism.

420
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,960
That's right. Now that I see him with the glasses, I can tell.

421
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,340
It is him. That's that Mr. Bingo-is-the-dog's-name.

422
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,970
What? Mr. Bingo-is-the-dog's-name?

423
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,320
What happened?

424
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,520
What is it?

425
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,990
They say you never know what happens in life. What is all this?

426
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,960
Mom!

427
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,670
This is the person who use to come to our store

428
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,280
to walk our dog but stopped showing up.

429
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,010
It seemed like that person, so I thought, "No way," but...

430
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,770
What?

431
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,050
But... are you sure there wasn't a mistake?

432
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:31,870
No matter what, he didn't seem like someone who would kill people.

433
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,530
If you look at the diary,

434
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:46,120
the day before the murder, he searched for a site for the crime and prepared for it.

435
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,690
Dong Sik was walking the dog the night before...

436
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,670
But we can't overturn all the other charges just with that.

437
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:00,100
Park Moo Seok, too, the DNA that was obtained at the site ended up being Dong Sik's.

438
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,010
The abandoned factory where he was killed,

439
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,920
isn't there something strange? It was extremely remote,

440
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,240
and there wasn't even a CCTV nearby. A perfect site to kill someone.

441
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,580
If he picked the place like that on purpose, to make thorough preparations...

442
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,920
Yook Dong Sik called out Park Moo Seok to that place in order to kill him?

443
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,120
Then, why did Park Moo Seok go there without hesitation?

444
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,530
Someone who served nearly 15 years as a detective in a violent crimes unit.

445
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,050
While threatening a serial killer to hand over one-billion won,

446
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,040
would he have gone willingly into a situation that stank of a trap?

447
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
This is...

448
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,550
Right, so we're going to confirm it, aren't we?

449
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,750
Was it you? That predator or whatnot?

450
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,590
Yes. I'm sorry.

451
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,030
Sorry? About what?

452
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,270
Hey!  Do you know everything I've been wronged about?

453
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,760
Hey, stand up! Stand up!

454
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,500
You're that scary? Come at me then!

455
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,000
Come at me, you bastard!

456
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,810
Won't you stand up?!

457
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,960
Stop!

458
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,890
Let go! Let me go!

459
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,460
Come on!

460
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,340
That crazy bastard. He should watch who he bothers.

461
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,470
I was just talking to myself.

462
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,190
Who is he that everyone is avoiding him?

463
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,240
Are his crimes as horrendous as mine?

464
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,690
Well, no. He's just an idiot,

465
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:56,310
but he has a habit of starting arguments with people, claiming he's innocent.

466
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,770
Also, he stinks of poop. It's just better not to deal with... with him. (polite form)

467
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,550
Stinks of poop?

468
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,890
Maybe one of the punishment cells has a sewage backup.

469
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,290
The stink is terrible that no one wants to go in there!

470
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:15,920
But maybe he likes the smell of poop! Every day, he keeps trying to go there... yo (polite form).

471
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,190
Prisoner number 9362, you have a visitor.

472
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,960
Wait. I came because I have something to talk to you about.

473
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,980
Sit down.

474
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,090
What's wrong? You even tried to kill me.

475
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,220
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,960
I came because I felt like I needed to apologize.

477
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,160
Never mind the apology.

478
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,800
Just tell me in detail how you killed Park Moo Seok.

479
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,150
That's... I'm the person who should be killed—

480
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:38,230
No. Just tell me clearly what the situation was.

481
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,520
- I 
 - Dong Sik! Yook Dong Sik!

482
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,520
While fighting with Park Moo Seok, you rolled down the stairs. Is that when you stabbed him with the knife?

483
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,030
That is, we rolled down the stairs,

484
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,720
but I fainted as though I hit my head on something.

485
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,280
When I came to, he was collapsed on top of me after being stabbed with the knife.

486
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,310
Something is strange.

487
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,140
So, you have no recollection of stabbing him?

488
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:15,160
If not... are you trying to say it was accidental?

489
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,320
I told the officer already, so I don't want to talk about it anymore.

490
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:26,520
Just one more then. The abandoned factory where Park Moo Seok died, did you ask to see him there?

491
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,540
No. I received a text to meet him there.

492
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,580
See that? Yook Dong Sik isn't the one who asked him to come there!

493
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,110
I saw the suicide note through Jae Ho.

494
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:45,580
On September 13th, the day the homeless man, Kim Myeong Gook got attacked by the predator,

495
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,930
you were attempting suicide.

496
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,270
I'm aware.

497
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,510
Do you remember what you wrote, too?

498
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,190
You probably don't.

499
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,740
That day, you got hit by my car and suffered memory loss.

500
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,460
And you had in your possession that diary in question.

501
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,920
During that time, we both thought it obviously belonged to you,

502
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,390
but what if it doesn't?

503
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,910
The diary's owner is someone else?

504
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:40,330
Also, if that guy knew the truth about you,

505
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:46,160
the one who killed Park Moo Seok might not be you either.

506
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,180
If, before you got hit by my car,

507
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,580
you ended up with the real predator's diary,

508
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,460
if you had picked it up on the road by chance... No,

509
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,890
if you had witnessed the scene of the predator's murder?

510
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,720
Are you saying, because of my amnesia,

511
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,180
I'm mistaking

512
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,730
the real predator's diary

513
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,280
as my own?

514
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,620
I've never heard such nonsense in my life!

515
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,820
Dong Sik.

516
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,750
2018, August 25th, 48-year-old, Park Jae Moon,

517
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,340
I drowned him and made it look accidental.

518
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,380
November 10th, I cut the wrist of Lee Ji Hye

519
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,950
and disguised it as a suicide.

520
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,040
March 4, 32-year-old, Oh Min Seok,

521
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:10,150
April 24th, 67-year-old, Park Mal Soon!

522
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:15,740
July 8th, 42-year-old, Hong Jin Goo, I killed him at the factory.

523
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,950
I killed him at the factory. September 13th,

524
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,220
Kim Myeong Gook, at the construction site...

525
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,610
I killed them all.

526
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,080
- I'm sure it's the same for Park Moo Seok. 
 - Wait.

527
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,900
Did you just say September 13th?

528
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,280
That you killed him at the construction site?

529
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,930
Yes.

530
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,360
What now?

531
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,740
No. The homeless man, Kim Myeong Gook, died on September 18th.

532
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,760
You must be mistaken. I'll be going then.

533
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,020
Dong Sik.

534
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,690
Five days after Kim Myeong Gook got attacked at the construction site,

535
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,460
he died from a fire at his home which was disguised as a suicide.

536
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,650
Wh-What did you say?

537
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,680
If you didn't set fire to his home that day, at least the homeless man, Kim Myeong Gook,

538
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,930
wasn't killed by you.

539
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,990
What are you talking about?

540
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,390
Visiting hours are over.

541
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:21,600
 Corrections Administration of Healing and Hope

542
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,910
Just wait a bit. I'll look into it more and come back.

543
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:45,860
Does that make sense? He confessed to everything and acknowledged his crimes.

544
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,780
He believes firmly that he killed Kim Myeong Gook.

545
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,660
Not on September 18th at Kim's house

546
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,810
but on the 13th at the construction site.

547
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,170
So like you say,

548
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,830
let's say there was a mistake in the confession. You want to overturn everything because of it?

549
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,230
Because of you, the police will become the laughing stock,

550
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:14,380
and you'll forever be branded as the officer who made an innocent person into a serial killer to get a promotion!

551
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,190
Can you handle it?

552
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,430
I... have to handle it.

553
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,610
Why? Yook Dong Sik and everyone in the world

554
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,650
believes he's the predator.

555
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,780
- Uncle. 
 - The case eight years ago, too,

556
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,660
if he ends up being the culprit of that case,

557
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,090
Sunbae can request compensation for exclusion from official duties.

558
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,190
Think about it carefully. Got it?

559
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,110
I understand.

560
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,390
You understand? Exactly what do you understand?

561
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,340
No way. Are you going to cover it up like he said?

562
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,810
Don't appear anymore, Dad.

563
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,540
What? Hey, Sim Bo Gyeong, are you sure you're my daughter?

564
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,970
I am. That's why I'm being like this.

565
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,250
Something about Inspector Ryoo's reaction is odd.

566
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,170
I'm going to confirm the testimony and check everything from the very beginning.

567
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,500
Like you say, if I keep suspecting and suspecting some more,

568
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,660
the truth will probably be revealed.

569
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,740
Whatever the truth may be that comes out at the end of all that...

570
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,330
I won't ignore it.

571
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,420
So...

572
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,830
you don't need to appear anymore.

573
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:02,670
 It should be September 13th that I killed him at the construction site.

574
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:08,470
Since his crimes are all delusional, the errors in his testimony can't be avoided.

575
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:15,120
If I hadn't tweaked some things while writing out the affidavit, there could have been a reinvestigation.

576
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:20,550
If that had happened, the real predator's identity would probably have been revealed to the world.

577
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,180
By that you mean...

578
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:36,950
It probably means that as long as I don't open my mouth, the true identity of the predator won't be revealed to the world.

579
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,000
Director Seo is

580
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,800
very lucky, it seems.

581
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:50,610
He has a fool as his subordinate who believes he's guilty of crimes he didn't even commit,

582
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:55,850
and the only officer who knows the truth is me.

583
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,760
I want to show my gratitude.

584
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,010
What can I do for you?

585
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,560
So that you can live comfortably after your term of office is over with,

586
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,870
would an affiliate representative position be good enough?

587
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,060
Take  your time to come up with something suitable.

588
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,140
 Video of interrogation of Yook Dong Sik in the Predator Murder Case

589
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,600
 And on September 18th, you set fire to the house of Kim Myeong Gook, 64-year-old male, and made it look like a suicide.

590
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,560
 - And on December 19th, Park Moo Seok, a former detective— 
 - Um...

591
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,480
 Kim Myeong Gook is the homeless man, right?

592
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,920
 - So?
 - K-killing that person

593
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,240
 should be September 13th, at the construction site.

594
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,430
 If you look there—

595
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:08,600
  - You said you hurt your head. Retrograde amnesia? 
 - Yes.

596
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,830
 Then it means there's not much credibility to the confession you're making while relying on your memory.

597
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:17,740
 We'll take care of reconstructing the crime and identifying facts,

598
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,530
 so you just need to answer the questions you're asked.

599
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,340
 I understand.

600
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,430
What is it?

601
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,300
I saw the original video of Yook Dong Sik's testimony.

602
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,570
Bo Gyeong, I think I explained it to you in a way you would understand.

603
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,270
 I finally get it now. Since the beginning,

604
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,920
you knew Yook Dong Sik wasn't the culprit.

605
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,960
Right?

606
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,570
 So you omitted the erroneous statement on purpose, and—

607
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:39,080
But what will change? Just because you change one part of the testimony, the whole picture doesn't change.

608
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,710
Also, you're the one who brought him saying he's the culprit.

609
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:47,330
The real culprit... do you know who it is?

610
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,280
- Bo Gyeong. 
 - Do you know or not?

611
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,830
- Let's talk in person. 
 - Who's the real culprit?!

612
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,830
Tell me, I said!

613
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,830
What is it? What happened?

614
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,990
Hello?

615
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,170
 Hello? Inspector?

616
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,670
 Uncle! Uncle!

617
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,990
 Hello?

618
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,590
 Uncle!

619
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,100
 Uncle!

620
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,030
Where are you?

621
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,440
The view is great here.

622
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,780
When we move to the new headquarters, I'll miss it once in a while.

623
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,870
What did you do to Inspector Ryoo?

624
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:17,070
Are you coming from seeing him off?

625
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:20,230
You ordered it?

626
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:27,090
There aren't any more people who know about your nasty hobby, right?

627
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,740
Do you think I got to this position without a drop of blood on my hands?

628
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,510
A beast who wears the mask of a human being, a monster who has no blood, nor tears.

629
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,250
Those are words that poured out like excuses from people who were trampled by me.

630
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,180
I told you once, didn't I?

631
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,950
That since you were young, you were just like me.

632
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:53,120
Why? Just because you killed a few people,

633
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,040
you thought I'd throw you out or something?

634
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,430
Well, if you hadn't cleaned up properly after yourself,

635
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,800
I might have done that,

636
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,750
but you took care of things perfectly.

637
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,280
Did you say Yook Dong Sik?

638
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,550
Traditionally, the seat of the king is for someone who knows when to draw the sword,

639
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:17,480
and when to draw blood.

640
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,000
But if you must draw blood once you become king,

641
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
it's not for fun but for profit that you must do so.

642
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,350
B-By that you mean...

643
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:42,340
I'll call a board meeting once the succession matters are taken care of with the legal team.

644
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,530
Thank you, President.

645
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,360
Why do you keep calling your dad President?

646
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,630
I'm sick and tired of being called that now.

647
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:00,760
Your bad habits might surface at the sight of Ji Hoon,

648
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,420
so I'll send him overseas.

649
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,370
I'm... not the predator?

650
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,740
Then... what am I?

651
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,010
I'm sure, at that time, the homeless man was...

652
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,290
 Let's have a fight today.

653
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,470
 Hey, I said let's have a fight!

654
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,510
Go ahead and fight!

655
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:51,180
Why? You beat me up for claiming innocence after killing a person.

656
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,880
You smell. Get lost!

657
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,370
Go! Go away, I said!

658
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,160
Ah, this bastard—

659
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,600
Hey, stop now. I get that you feel wronged, so stop it now.

660
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,130
- What? 
 - A lady officer once came for a visit and said this.

661
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,620
That she can clear you, Oh Myeong Dal, of your charges.

662
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,530
Oh Myeong Dal?

663
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:20,890
 He killed her at an abandoned hospital but left the body in a field in the path of Mr. Oh.

664
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:25,090
 Maybe he saw Ms. Son and Oh at the convenience store and—

665
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:29,720
 By that, you mean, Mr. Oh could have seen him, too?

666
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,100
At this point in time, do what?!

667
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,960
Seriously, I try to endure it, but I can't hold back because you smell so much!

668
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,560
Hey!

669
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:52,520
That man is... that Mr. Oh?

670
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,560
This thing!

671
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,260
Wait a minute. You're Oh Myeong Dal, right?

672
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,230
Eight years ago, Ms. Son Ji Min's case!

673
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,690
Who are you to bother me now?!

674
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,860
 Help me.

675
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,370
 Help me!

676
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,770
Huh? He's a total weakling!

677
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,180
Keep going.

678
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,680
For a split second, everything was clear.

679
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,620
Everything became clear. Right.

680
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:54,020
One more time. One... one more time, one more time!

681
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,060
Back! Back! Back! Back!

682
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,650
Please hit me!

683
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,470
Hurry up! One more time!

684
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,890
What do you want?!

685
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,600
Why don't you get what I'm saying?!

686
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,260
Like you beat him up, beat me up!

687
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,560
Here, here, here!

688
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,050
Concentrate on hitting this spot!

689
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:21,690
This spot right here! Seriously!

690
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,680
Hurry up, while I got a moment of clarity!

691
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,320
Hurry up! Come on!

692
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,090
Come on!

693
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,660
Seriously...

694
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,370
Wait! Wait!

695
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,530
Wait a minute!

696
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:04,860
Predator, my ass. You're a pushover.

697
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,890
Why did you butt in?

698
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,240
But why are we the only ones locked up? We're the ones who got beat up.

699
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,680
Because I'm the one who always gets into trouble.

700
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,420
On top of that, that head is close with the warden.

701
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,390
If you know, don't butt in next time.

702
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:23,440
That cell is my usual, but you took it from me.

703
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,540
Never mind.

704
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:31,100
Just sleep. It will smell a bit, though.

705
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:36,640
Oh Myeong Dal, I heard you were framed.

706
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:43,760
Right. No one would listen no matter how much I talked about it, so why today

707
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,110
is everyone taking an interest?

708
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,440
I, also feel like I've been wronged, that's why.

709
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,430
Right.

710
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:59,840
Of course, you were. I thought I was the only one, but it happened to a lot of people.

711
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:06,900
Also, maybe, I could be in here because of the same punk.

712
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,910
What?

713
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:16,420
Eight years ago, Son Ji Min, the part-time worker at the convenience store,

714
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,230
I know you didn't kill her.

715
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,330
By chance, at that time, did you see the real culprit?

716
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,560
  Well... this.

717
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,690
 I gave you that since it was buy one, get one free.

718
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,430
 Have it while you work.

719
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:02,280
 One bottle is enough for me.

720
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,280
 Thank you.

721
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:13,050
I'm sure he put something in it. Like a sleeping pill.

722
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,200
A s-sleeping pill?

723
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,280
Once they found her body, I kept telling the police, but no one would believe me.

724
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,200
But then, I'm sure I looked more like the criminal than him since he was clean cut.

725
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,640
Anyway, it wasn't me. I didn't see his face, but I remember his height and his voice.

726
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,030
But what do you mean you came because of the same guy?

727
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,110
 If before you got hit by my car

728
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:40,460
 you ended up with the real predator's diary?

729
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,860
 If you had picked it up off the street by chance...

730
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,440
 No, the predator's murder scene...

731
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,060
 what if you had witnessed it?

732
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:53,010
 April 24th, today,

733
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,730
 I killed another person.

734
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,990
 Are you saying, because of my amnesia,

735
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,200
 I'm mistaking the real predator's diary as my own?

736
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,900
 right now?

737
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,440
  No!!!!

738
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,510
Really...

739
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,270
I wasn't...

740
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:39,130
I wasn't...

741
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,510
It wasn't me...

742
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,950
Salute!

743
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:45,090
 You mean, there's someone who's been more wronged than me in this world?

744
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,490
 Because of that diary?

745
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,460
Oh, my stomach!

746
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:58,120
So, you're saying you and I are locked up in here because of that real predator!

747
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:23,600
Now... what do I do?

748
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:36,270
Lift that toilet seat slightly and try moving it.

749
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:19,200
Do you know a movie called Shawshank Redemption?

750
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,680
 Psychopath Diary

751
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:42,650

752
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,710
 Are you telling me to escape right now?

753
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,640
 This is the only means for you.

754
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,780
 We never know when that brutal Yook Dong Sik might appear again.

755
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,470
 Yook Dong Sik!

756
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:59,040
 If he came to Seoul, it means he wants to reveal the truth.

757
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,140
 Maybe he wants to meet with you, Sunbae.

758
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,420
 No matter how I think about it,

759
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,040
 I don't think Inspector Ryoo died from an accident.

760
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:12,390
 Can you help me?
