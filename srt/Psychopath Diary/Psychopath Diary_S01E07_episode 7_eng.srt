  Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,550
Tell me. Was it your doing?

5
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,550
Yes. I understand.

6
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,400
What's going on?

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,640
They've found traces of blood from the corpse's left thumb.

8
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,130
Time of death is around 11pm last night, which also corresponds to the stock market patterns.

9
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,080
That means that there's a high chance of it being an additional incident.

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,100
Everyone to the scene of the crime, now.

11
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,030
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,090
What?

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,740
Are you sure?

14
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,350
I got it.

15
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,080
Your brother-in-law just heard this from his acquaintance in the police force.

16
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,350
He says the punk or supposed 'predator' or whatever, killed another man last night.

17
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,080
You were with me last night, weren't you?

18
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,610
Satisfied?

19
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,520
Even if it was your doing, I don't consider it to be anything personal.

20
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,150
Still, I can't pass the company over to a murderer, so better make some things certain.

21
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,480
It may be because I'm getting old,

22
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,610
but my bones get too chilly when sleeping at places like this.

23
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,690
I'll be going back down first, so take your time.

24
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,070
  An additional murder?

25
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,450
  Last night?

26
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,700
 But I didn't do anything.

27
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,600
What’s going on in your mind, Yook Dong Sik?

28
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,830
  Psychopath Diary

29
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,050
 Episode 7

30
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,090
More than a lethal amount of propofol was injected.

31
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,380
Seeing that the victim is a nurse with easy access to the drug,

32
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,620
and that there aren't any other traces of resistance, this looks like a suicide.

33
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,540
However, look here.

34
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,860
Reactions to Luminol only appeared here.

35
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,220
This place was purposefully punctured to secrete blood, and—

36
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,010
Has been used to leave a thumbprint before being wiped away, right?

37
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,700
Where is the victim's husband right now?

38
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,520
I came home and found her like that.

39
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,380
Working in the emergency room must have been stressful normally.

40
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,150
She sometimes would give herself IV injections and lie down like that,

41
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,540
so I didn't think much of it.

42
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm sorry to ask you such a thing, but the time of death was yesterday.

43
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,420
What's the reason behind your late report?

44
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,270
I ..

45
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,460
went fishing late last night and ... it's because I was setting a snare.

46
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:14,410
It wasn't even that important. If I had stayed home..

47
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,710
Did your wife suffer from depression or show any signs of suicide?

48
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,860
Actually, we are currently investigating your wife's case as a possible murder.

49
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,920
Mur... murder? What do you mean?

50
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,690
Yes.  Did you perhaps notice anything strange concerning your wife?

51
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,990
Mr. Nam Seong Cheol?

52
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,600
I-I'm not sure.

53
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,990
I cannot bring myself to tell you anything at the moment.

54
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,680
I understand this is hard for you, but we must catch the culprit before there is another victim.

55
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,860
We understand.

56
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,690
We'll be in touch if we need anything else from you for the progress of the case.

57
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,620
Is this case involved also with that 'predator' or whatever he is?

58
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,850
Similarities are found in the use of sleeping pills by the culprit and in the way that the murder was disguised as a suicide.

59
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,110
The crime was committed on a day corresponding to the stock market patterns,

60
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:49,040
and more than anything, seeing the blood thumbprint of the left hand, this is definitely the same culprit.

61
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,400
Why, do you have a differing opinion?

62
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,860
- The thing is— 
 - No, sir.

63
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,250
There are a few doubtful points, but we will clear them up during the investigation.

64
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,850
What's wrong? Thanks to your profiling, we were able to make the task force and we've made it this far.

65
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,560
And we've found the guy that perfectly matches the profile. What's bothering you?

66
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,650
He's too perfect of a match. That is what's strange.

67
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,940
The Predator Murderer has been disguising his kills as suicides so as to not get caught.

68
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,130
But at this moment, when the public investigation has been opened and publicized,

69
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,880
he murders another victim using the same method?

70
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,010
This is too conspicuous, which differs from our profile.

71
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,270
He may have turned to conspicuous now that the police have interfered and the investigation has been opened.

72
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,580
Moreover, the patterns and methods of crime were not disclosed to the public.

73
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,620
If this were not the culprit, how can you explain this?

74
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,580
We'll know for sure once we capture him.

75
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,380
Detective Lee, report to me after analyzing the surveillance records.

76
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,720
Detective Cho, you try to find the means of acquisition of the propofol.

77
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,740
The rest of you, investigate the victim's surroundings.

78
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:11,110
And I feel that the victim's husband, Nam Seong Cheol is hiding something.

79
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,490
When you mention a murder, the normal response is to ask who or why someone would do such a thing, but

80
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,570
instead, he chose to remain silent—

81
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,460
He personally witnessed his dead wife with whom he had dined up until last night.

82
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,810
Unless he was a psychopath, how could he remain calm?

83
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,220
Everyone get going. There's no good in the press getting onto all of this so make sure to keep quiet.

84
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,570
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

85
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,620
I'm reporter Seong, from Daehan Daily Report.

86
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,160
An additional murder?

87
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,150
And the victim?

88
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,550
A nurse.

89
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,680
Are you sure about this?

90
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,140
  The task force is certain that this is an additional crime committed by the Predator Murderer.

91
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,600
  The culprit's signature move, the victim's blood thumbprint,

92
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,640
 wasn't revealed to the public up to now.

93
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,780
  How can this be?

94
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,940
  Who would do this?

95
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,000
Sorry, I'm in a rush. I'm sorry.

96
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,770
Gosh.

97
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,920
I guess you’re really interested in this case.

98
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,760
As would be expected of Yook Dong Sik who won the brave citizen award.

99
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,790
Well, it’s not so much that,

100
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,090
but I’m hoping for the culprit to be caught quickly.

101
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,970
The culprit's nothing but a... loser who goes after only the weak.

102
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,760
Predator or whatever...

103
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,560
But, do you really think it’s that guy?

104
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,680
- Somehow, I don’t feel like it is. 
 - Pardon?

105
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,500
Don’t you see it in movies? Like a copycat criminal.

106
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,570
A copycat criminal?

107
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,350
Well... I’m just saying it feels like that.

108
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,870
If it was something done by a copycat criminal, why was something like that done?

109
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:38,360
To provoke the real criminal maybe?

110
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,840
We can’t be sure, but the real culprit must know

111
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,340
that it was done by a fake culprit as an imitation.

112
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,520
So the latest crime is kind of an invitation.

113
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,150
“I want to meet you.”

114
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,620
After meeting ...

115
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,740
and then do what?

116
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,800
How would I know that?

117
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,910
I just threw out there because I feel like I’ve seen a movie similar to that.

118
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,930
 To drag me out ...

119
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,530
 Did something like that?

120
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,060
 A copycat criminal?

121
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,980
 To do exactly what after meeting me?

122
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,720
 I’m nervous as it is because of the task force that was established!

123
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,270
  Now a strange punk’s gotten involved!

124
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,330
 But more than that, how did they find out about me to imitate?

125
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,040
 Whoever the punk is, you wait til I catch you.

126
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,140
 I’ll make you regret wanting to meet me.

127
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,600
Really...

128
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,970
 But how do I find that punk?

129
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,360
 Approach Corporal Sim?  No.

130
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,910
  Now that she’s part of the task force, there’s no way she’d share investigation info with me.

131
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,030
  But if I hide out in the task force again,

132
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,240
  I’m sure I’ll be behind bars next time instead of inside the cabinet.

133
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,660
Don’t even dream of it!

134
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,810
Hyeon! Mr. Seok Hyeon. Hyung Seok Hyeon.

135
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,580
Couldn’t you do it for me just this once?

136
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,980
Seriously!  Why are you being like this to me?

137
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,580
Why are you being like this to me?

138
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,320
Joo Hyeon and Mi Hye both can’t. That’s why I’m asking you!  Please.

139
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,030
What’s going on?

140
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,010
Sunbae, have you seen the news?

141
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,440
The victim... I mean, Manager Park—

142
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,350
- What? 
 - Never mind.

143
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,170
To be honest, the victim’s husband used to be my client until last year,

144
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,130
but he lost everything.

145
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,260
- But I got a text from the funeral home. 
 - I see.

146
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,950
I can’t  not  go, but if I do, I don’t think any good will come of it... Oh, it’s driving me crazy.

147
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,950
Hey! I’m asking you to go instead of me just this once, punk!

148
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,760
And if I do ... yo (ending that makes the statement formal)?

149
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,370
If you do, I’ll buy you meals! I’ll buy you drinks!

150
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,700
I’ll take you to the sauna! I’ll do all of it for you!

151
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,020
- I’ll go. 
 - Yeah.

152
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,380
Huh? Where? To the funeral...

153
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,800
This punk! You really are the Dong Sik I know!

154
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,550
This is Cheongan Hospital’s funeral parlor.

155
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,940
You can just go there as a favor to me.

156
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,780
Thank you!

157
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,840
  'Intelligent' Serial Killer, the 'Predator," why did he?

158
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,740
  Brave Citizen Saves a Foreign Worker

159
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,300
Oh, I’m sorry.

160
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,790
You got nervous!

161
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,490
Chil Seong, what are you doing here?

162
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,750
I watched the movie again.

163
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,560
- Pardon? 
 - Wherever Batman goes, Alfred must go.

164
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,960
I’m so sick and tired of this.

165
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,810
“Predator murderer.”

166
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,600
I sensed from before that you were hiding something from me.

167
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,560
Right?

168
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,550
That is...

169
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,470
I’m not. On what kind of basis?

170
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,570
I told you I knew every detail about you. 
   What about the intelligent serial killer, "predator"?

171
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:41,020
If, as brothers, you keep this many secrets, it really disappoints me.

172
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,640
That is—

173
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,230
Predator murderer...

174
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,730
is who you’re on your way to catch, right?

175
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,460
Right? Right?

176
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,110
I saw it all on TV!

177
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,100
“Hey, you stupid punk... I ... really hate you.”

178
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,940
If you declare a war face-to-face,

179
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,860
our Yook Dong Sik’s spirit is alive and well!

180
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,090
Our Hyungnim is taking on a huge task,

181
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,830
so I, Alfred, also will lead the way.

182
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,310
Let’s go.

183
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,910
Go where? In that outfit?

184
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,440
Whenever I ask, he’s always...

185
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,120
I have all types of things...prepared.

186
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,540
Occupationally, there are more than a few funerals, so...

187
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,690
We have relevant equipment at the ready.

188
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,010
Couple?

189
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,730
Please give us a statement.

190
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,060
How do you feel right now?

191
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,380
Please.

192
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,050
Please give us one statement.

193
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,740
How did you feel when you came upon the crime site?

194
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,110
What do you think is the reason your wife was targeted?

195
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,790
Did you know that the Predator Murderer only goes after those who are the weak in society?

196
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,860
We heard you lost your retirement pay due to failure of stock investments

197
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,300
and now have debts because of trading stocks on margin.

198
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,490
Have you ever thought about whether it was your fault your wife was targeted as a victim?

199
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,430
This is a funeral. Please don’t be like this.

200
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,010
We heard you weren’t home at the time of the incident.

201
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,740
Did you catch any fish at the indoor fishery?

202
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,430
Excuse me. Excuse me.

203
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,790
By chance, the brave citizen from before. Right?

204
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,190
I came to pay respects today as an employee of Daehan Securities.

205
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:05,820
Oh good. How much did Mr. Nam Seong Cheol here lose from bad investments?

206
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,310
I mean, how can you ask such a thing at a funeral?!

207
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,300
Seriously! At a funeral!

208
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,520
Hyungnim, you just stay out, okay?

209
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,590
Any of you who are not part of the family or mourners of the deceased, I ask you to leave.

210
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,070
I'm asking nicely.

211
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,830
Here, you see these scratches, right?

212
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,150
These were made by the Ulsan Black Whales.

213
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,970
During a meeting with them, huh?

214
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,720
This isn't much though. A mere scratch.

215
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,230
This, right here, was made when I was still young and kicking

216
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,920
during the Busan Blood Bath incident, when I was in a fight with the Busan Weeds!

217
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,700
If this right here, was my heart, I'd be gone now.

218
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,760
It was a bloody mess.

219
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,370
And here, right here.. huh?

220
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,950
Words won't be enough for you lot. I wasn't going to go this far, but...

221
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,540
What are you going to do? No need for you to cause a scene.

222
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,350
Hyungnim. Do you know what my specialty is?

223
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,320
It isn't a punch, a knife, or anything like that.

224
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,670
It's this right here.

225
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,140
Are you okay?

226
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,860
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,080
Are reporters allowed to beat people up like that?

228
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,610
No, that... Who says anyone beat him up?

229
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,580
Then, are you saying this person trying to fake being injured by extortion or something?

230
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,170
Who are you to play to victim here?

231
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,560
Weren't you the one who disturbed our cover first, and acted by force?

232
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,820
Then what about you reporters?

233
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,320
You're the ones who now are turning this victim into an assailant here!

234
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,830
It should have all been filmed in those CCTV cameras.

235
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,380
A video titled "Reporters' abuse of power and violence"

236
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,470
being uploaded somewhere. What do you think will happen? Wow.

237
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,340
The view count will be massive.

238
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,010
Your faces and identities will be out everywhere.

239
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,220
You'll receive hate comments, cursing, and even personal attacks.

240
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,970
Even thinking about it makes me lose my mind.

241
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,670
But you are still "honorable" reporters, so

242
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,120
you'll be able to defend yourselves with logical reasoning, of course.

243
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,980
However! Why would the truth be of any importance?

244
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,370
If later they find out they were wrong, they'll just say "Whatever!"

245
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,010
And it won't matter at all.

246
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,890
Sounds plausible, right?

247
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm here on behalf of Assistant Manager Park Jae Ho.

248
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,680
I'm sorry for your loss.

249
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,250
Thank you.

250
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,420
You must be having a hard time.

251
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:22,450
I've heard somewhere, that the so-called 'Predator Murderer'

252
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,530
carefully observes and prepares before going after his victim.

253
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,870
Did you perhaps see any suspicious person

254
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,300
around your wife?

255
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,340
Why are you asking such things?

256
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,770
No, I am actually...

257
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm no 'brave citizen' or anything like that. I'm just a pushover.

258
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,910
If I were h-him, I think I-I would have wanted to go after me.

259
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,390
That's why. I'm scared, and I just wish he could be caught a little sooner.

260
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,170
I'm scared of him too.

261
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,000
That face? Even in my dreams.

262
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,630
I don't even want to think about it.

263
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,700
Did you by any chance ... see that man?

264
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
The thing is that...

265
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,940
What do you mean by that?

266
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,010
Sergeant Sim!

267
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,920
Did you witness the culprit?

268
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,760
No, well, I'm not sure but for a moment, briefly.

269
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,210
You brushed by him?

270
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,130
Did you see his face?

271
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:15,640
The thing is, actually not long ago, on her way home, my wife

272
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,250
told me that she felt like someone was following her.

273
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,970
So I went out and found a man roaming around the house,

274
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,840
who saw me and rushed away.

275
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,490
Why did you hide that from me?

276
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,710
I was scared.

277
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:35,370
I thought if I told you, that punk might come after me too.

278
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,490
After my house went broke, I went fishing every day like some insect.

279
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,740
Even so, my wife would always tell me to go have fun and gave me some spending money on my way out.

280
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,650
A wife like that...

281
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,970
Those reporters were right.

282
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:59,540
The one who killed my wife isn’t that punk, it’s me.

283
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,740
It's me...

284
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,910
  An evil psychopath like me, crying?

285
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,640
Is it because I can feel his love?

286
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,640
I'm sorry, Hyungnim. I dozed off.

287
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,820
But that punk, if the police catch him first he'll end up going to jail for a while and that'll be all.

288
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,640
That kind of jerk would better be off being caught by you. He should be killed.

289
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,010
He really needs to suffer a bit, to learn his lesson, right?

290
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,460
And—

291
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,210
I happened to receive your help once again, Dong Sik.

292
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,580
Gosh, did you?

293
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,600
I came here for work and started talking to him because he looked so sad.

294
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,470
I'm a little worried that you may have gotten too involved with the case because of me.

295
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,680
- Knowing you, you'd probably get emotionally attached to the victim, and this is a dangerous case. 
 - Oh gosh, no.

296
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,190
That's not the case! If you need any help at all, don't hesitate to ask like you did last time.

297
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,810
I'd love to be able to do that, but it's important for this case to be kept confidential.

298
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,730
It was a mess last time because of the news article.

299
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,840
Still...

300
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,980
It's the task force's job to do, so you should forget about it.

301
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,350
Salute!

302
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,610
Thank you for your work.

303
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:55,880
What's your relationship with each other?

304
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,570
- I live on the top floor— 
 - We are blood brothers.

305
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,350
Okay.

306
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,790
Let's sit down.

307
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,590
That was a waste of our time. What shall we do now?

308
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,900
We must be the first to catch him.

309
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,510
That copycat fake predator jerk.

310
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,720
A fake?

311
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,360
No.

312
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,600
Someone who targets only the weak.

313
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,300
How can he be a predator?

314
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,650
He needs to be like our Hyungnim to be a real predator.

315
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,460
Isn't that right?

316
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,750
I think his height was about 180.

317
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,890
Then, how much do you ...

318
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,990
I think he had a mole on his ear.

319
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,580
Were his bangs covering his face?

320
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,350
His statement seems solid and credible.

321
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,370
  Lee Jin Hee (28) 
 Death: 10th November 2018 
Excessive bleeding caused by penetrating wound.

322
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:12,120
Height 180, man in his mid-30s. The mole on his left ear is a key feature.

323
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,920
What do you think? You're pretty good at profiling.

324
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,540
You still don't think he's a predator murderer?

325
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,770
We'll know once we catch him.

326
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,480
Request assistance from each office, and start interviewing the surroundings.

327
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,870
- Okay. 
 - We understand.

328
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,320
Well ... he does look familiar.

329
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,070
But then again, maybe not.

330
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,900
- Look carefully. You see this, right? 
 - Yes.

331
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,260
He has a mole on his left ear.

332
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,420
- What? What is it? 
 - Look at this.

333
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,920
- Looking at it ... he doesn't look like someone from around here. Right? 
 - Yeah.

334
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,850
Everyone in this neighborhood comes here for grocery shopping.

335
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,810
Thanks for your cooperation.

336
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:15,430
And just in case you see someone who looks like this man, please contact me.

337
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,950
Sure.

338
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,020
- Thank you. I'll leave this here. 
 - Yes.

339
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,990
I think we've looked everywhere in the immediate area. Should we widen our search radius?

340
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,980
Yeah.

341
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,020
I'm going.

342
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,680
Sim Bo Gyeong.

343
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,120
Is there someone you're thinking of?

344
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,420
This won't do.

345
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,220
We can't go around asking people in groups like the police do.

346
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,360
Groups?

347
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,300
Did you just say 'groups' (also means gang)?

348
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,720
What is he saying?

349
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,790
You punks, you're slacking off!

350
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,640
Put yourselves together! Got it?

351
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,500
This won't do. Let's just get things straight today.

352
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,380
Get down, you bastards.

353
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,660
I need to beat some sense into you.

354
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,220
Number four is great.

355
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,470
Stay straight, got it?

356
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,130
Or you'll lose your tailbones.

357
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,870
These punks—

358
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,400
Easy now, boy. Are you slaughtering pigs or something?

359
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,350
Who's this now, isn't it our Chil Seong ('Great Bear') Hyungnim?

360
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,960
You were so unavailable I thought you had left this field.

361
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,390
It just happened.

362
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,280
So, what brings you here?

363
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,710
As you can see, I'm a little busy.

364
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,060
I've come to know and support a new Hyungnim (boss).

365
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,950
So I'm starting to work on this project, and it won't earn a lot of money, but it's for the sake of social justice.

366
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,160
I'm hoping you guys will help out too.

367
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,000
What are you saying? "Social justice"?

368
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,610
Social justice?

369
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,370
- Hello, sir. 
 - Hello.

370
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,330
It's been awhile.

371
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,690
Have you been well?

372
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,820
- Hello, Hyungnim. We're here from the Naksan District ... 
 - Last time ...

373
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,020
We just want to ask a few questions.

374
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,260
Thank you.

375
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,900
Oh!

376
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,540
Look closely, I tell you.

377
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,660
♫   I just wanna be bad   ♫

378
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,960
♫   I just wanna be bad   ♫

379
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,950
Excuse me.

380
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,300
♫   Shining brighter than anyone   ♫

381
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,910
♫   Let me do it again 
I just wanna be bad   ♫

382
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,380
  Reception

383
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,970
What are you doing here?

384
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,200
I stopped by after I got off work. It looks like I had great timing.

385
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,980
Thank you. Because of you, my dad has gotten a lot better. He'll probably be discharged soon.

386
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,960
That's a relief.

387
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,380
As for the hospital bill, I wasn't able to talk to you about it due to the circumstances, but I'll pay you back soon.

388
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,830
You really don't have to.

389
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,320
No, of course, I should.

390
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,340
Thank you.

391
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,680
I saw on the news that the investigation seems to be going long. Has there been any progress?

392
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,690
That is ...

393
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,120
I'm not sure.

394
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:23,140
Why? Since there is a new case, wouldn't it be easier to find the culprit?

395
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,380
It would be if this case was related to the predator murder case.

396
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,150
Are you saying it might not be?

397
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,900
No wonder. I thought it was strange.

398
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,870
This person murdered people and made it look like a suicide,

399
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,130
but once the public investigation started ...

400
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,240
You also seem to like thriller movies, much like Dong Sik.

401
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,010
Is Dong Sik that type of guy? I didn't know.

402
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,370
But how did you become close with Dong Sik?

403
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,490
It just happened that way.

404
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,030
What about your father? How did he become like ...

405
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,200
When my dad was on duty, he was a well respected detective.

406
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,800
He was investigating a murder case.

407
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,970
The suspect was already caught but my dad believed it was someone else.

408
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,560
He got into an accident when he went after that suspect alone.

409
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,610
He fell off a building.

410
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:38,400
It was a miracle the doctor was able to save his life.

411
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,410
It's already been eight years.

412
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,570
Eight years?

413
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,360
Dad.

414
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,590
The color on your face has gotten a lot better.

415
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,150
In Woo, you also came. I'll get you something to drink.

416
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,300
Dad. Dad, what's wrong?

417
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,750
It's me. Can't you recognize me?

418
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,660
Ho-Honey.

419
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,830
Dad. Dad, it's okay.

420
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,970
It's me Bo Gyeong.

421
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,980
Calm down. It's okay.

422
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,600
Okay. Dad, it's o—

423
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,440
 Closure Notice

424
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,760
 Student ID: Son Ji Min

425
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,990
 I told you, he's not the criminal.

426
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,380
 I think I found the murder location.

427
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,590
 Come quickly.

428
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,790
 There are blood stains on the floor.

429
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,280
 The criminal murdered his victim here.

430
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,420
 He doesn't seem like he's killed anyone before.

431
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,720
 He may have watched the victim die.

432
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:46,880
 And among the blood stains on this sheet, there is a thumbprint of the victim.

433
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,580
 It's too distinct to have been a coincidence.

434
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,230
  It could be seen as a result of a collecting desire.

435
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,720
Have you been eating?

436
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,740
- C-C-Can we go now? 
 - Ah, yes.

437
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,340
Yes, yes. I'm sorry for causing you trouble. Please go safely.

438
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,800
Hyungnim, what should we do now? Should we get more guys?

439
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,080
Do you think there's anyone left?

440
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,760
According to whom?

441
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,650
I've got many brothers, called The Guild of the Great Bear!

442
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,830
- What? 
 - Do you even understand the game?

443
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,580
Why are we here?

444
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,790
A witness' statement,

445
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,620
since their memory is hazy due to the stressful situation,

446
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,390
may not be completely accurate.

447
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,660
I'm going to meet Nam Seong Cheol and ask him a few more questions.

448
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,500
I have no idea what you're talking about.

449
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,610
Even so, he told the police everything already. Is there more we can learn?

450
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:29,250
In my opinion, the culprit may not have been close with the victim or Mr. Nam, but they knew each other.

451
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,080
How would you know that?

452
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
It's because ...

453
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,660
  The punk's a copycat.

454
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,040
  If he's an amateur, he wouldn't choose his target from an unspecific group of people like I do.

455
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,570
  He would have searched amongst his surroundings.

456
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,540
Never mind. Let's go.

457
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,800
He's so cool. So cool.

458
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,160
Did he go somewhere?

459
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,550
Hyungnim, do you smell something?

460
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,080
I was sweating a lot today.

461
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,820
No, not like that.

462
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,810
It's something I've smelled before.

463
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,770
Gas?

464
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,880
My stomach hasn't been feeling well.

465
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,800
No, I told you, not like that.

466
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,760
Hyungnim, you’re cute.

467
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,670
What smell is he talking about?

468
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,400
This dog smell? I think it’s coming from here.

469
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,560
It's a body! A body!

470
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,350
Excuse me?

471
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,180
It was the smell of this burning charcoal briquette.

472
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,170
Are you okay?

473
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,190
Open your eyes.

474
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,090
What's going on?

475
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,370
No way, were you trying to die?

476
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,020
If I died and saw my wife, I was going to tell her

477
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,200
that I'm sorry.

478
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,520
That it was all my fault.

479
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,330
Why would you die? The one who did the crime was that bastard.

480
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,220
If someone dies, it should be him!

481
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,240
Because who that guy was after

482
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,950
wasn't my wife, but me.

483
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,510
- What? 
 - In his eyes,

484
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,890
there would not have been better prey than me.

485
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,210
But when he took a closer look, living with failure of a piece of human trash,

486
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:32,950
was my wife, who must have looked more pitiful.

487
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,820
The fact that you think like this,

488
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:40,630
by chance, is it because there’s someone around you that you suspect?

489
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,180
  Night clinic + emergency room

490
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,020
We've arrived.

491
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,610
Wait, wait, wait!

492
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:59,230
If it's who I think it is, I can't tell the police.

493
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:04,760
- Why? 
 - When I sort out my thoughts, I will contact you.

494
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,140
Because the only person I can trust right now is you, Dong Sik.

495
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,120
Please contact me. Please.

496
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:39,850
Why do you think dad's condition got worse so suddenly?

497
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,850
What are you thinking about so deeply, Mom?

498
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:57,830
Bo Gyeong, about your dad...

499
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,520
Never mind. Never mind.

500
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,690
What?

501
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,420
Should I say I'll quit the special team?

502
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,260
What?

503
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:21,680
Well, I have to watch over Dad, and it's hard for you to do this alone.

504
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,740
Also, I'm not all that capable.

505
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,150
I feel like joined for no reason and just held people back.

506
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,920
Don't talk like that!

507
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,720
- No, I'm— 
 - We're us. And you're you!

508
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:42,610
I feel like this too, but your dad wouldn't want to be a burden to you.

509
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,180
Burden? What are you talk—

510
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,800
You said you have to go back to work!

511
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,440
Eat well. How else will you catch the culprit?

512
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,580
Mom, I have to be somewhere.

513
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,750
Excuse me!

514
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,360
Excuse me, do you have time to talk?

515
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,170
Excuse me!

516
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Why are you doing this? I haven't done anything wrong!

517
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,880
Then why did you run?

518
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,630
From this moment on, you are being arrested without warrant.

519
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,500
You say that you ran because you were being chased. How does that make any sense?

520
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,410
Be honest.

521
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,010
It's true! I watch the news so I know enough.

522
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:25,350
I thought I'd be seen as a suspect, so I got scared and I ran.

523
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,490
Myeong Hwa Pharmaceuticals, where you work,

524
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:32,430
you're also distributing medicine to Cheongan Hospital, right?

525
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,970
Propofol is among those, right? You're the employee in charge there.

526
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,710
What were you doing on October 24th, the night Sin Yeong Mi died?

527
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,810
I was at home alone that day.

528
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,490
I didn't kill her!

529
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,630
Sunbae, whose call are you waiting for?

530
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,350
By chance, a girlfriend?

531
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,860
A girlfriend? It's not that.

532
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,870
Sunbae, then if you have time tonight, could we go watch a movie—

533
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,170
 Nam Seong Cheol.

534
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,470
 It's me, Nam Seong Cheol.

535
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,040
Yes, I've been waiting.

536
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,380
Could you come by my house?

537
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,300
With a car.

538
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,550
A car?

539
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,630
Yes, as you know, my car isn't usable, so

540
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,820
I was wondering if we could go somewhere together.

541
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,680
But I don't have a car.

542
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,330
I think I know who the culprit is.

543
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:10,490
I will somehow get a car and be there soon.

544
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,430
Are you going to try to start over?

545
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:19,620
I really didn't kill them.

546
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,000
I really didn't.

547
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,640
I really didn't do it.

548
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,220
"I didn't kill them."

549
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:33,560
He's saying the same thing he's said all night. Again and again.

550
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,530
Yes, Detective Lee.

551
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,960
Okay, I got it.

552
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,140
Sunbae, just now, we got the results from a CCTV in his neighborhood

553
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,200
and it sounds like he was home at that time.

554
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,360
You knew Nurse Sin, didn't you?

555
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,030
You said you didn't kill her but why do you feel so guilty?

556
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,830
No. I'm telling you it wasn't me!

557
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:10,660
"I didn't kill them, I didn't kill them."

558
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,210
It sounded like you were saying it to yourself.

559
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,860
The drug. You stole it, right?

560
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,770
She was a pitiful woman.

561
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,890
She got hit by her husband every day.

562
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,100
Her husband?

563
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,100
You know, right?

564
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,780
I just need to borrow your car.

565
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,740
What about me?

566
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:50,830
Well, the thing is... Nam Seong Cheol is in a bad state and...

567
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,450
I understand your feelings about wanting to help, but—

568
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,330
Alright.

569
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,000
What?

570
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,840
Take it.

571
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,140
I also am busy with other things.

572
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,060
I hope he's not angry at me.

573
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,770
I don't know. I don't know.

574
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,990
Why is this car so heavy?

575
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,480
Did I hear wrong?

576
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,940
Nam Seong Cheol hit Sin Yeong Mi?

577
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,660
I saw her bruises and thought she got hit. I thought there was no way, but I asked

578
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,410
and her husband saw us in the hospital.

579
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:56,130
The next time I saw her, her arms, neck and body were bruised.

580
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,670
And one day, she asked if I could sell her some medicine.

581
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,290
How did she contact you? Through text?

582
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,080
Did you give her the medicine directly?

583
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,410
Close the door and come out for a second.

584
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,970
What are you doing right now?

585
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,440
Mr. Kim Jin Ho, the pharmaceutical employee who's sitting inside,

586
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,720
he looks just like the composite but has an alibi. Why do you think that is?

587
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,320
Composites have flaws.

588
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,710
What if Nam Seong Cheol lied from the start?

589
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:35,610
If you took away the preconceived notion that it’s a predatory killer case, it was actually a very simple one.

590
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:40,200
The victim’s husband. Mr. Nam is a very probable suspect.

591
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,970
You're here.

592
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,610
The car?

593
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,120
It's over there.

594
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,400
Would you like to come in for a moment?

595
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,930
Sure.

596
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:29,560
Nam Seong Cheol witnessed the culprit at the start but hid that from the police.

597
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,600
No, he said he was scared. That man attempted suicide last night.

598
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,350
Isn't that weird too?

599
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:41,380
A man who lost his cherished wife, tries to commit suicide after drawing a sketch of the culprit?

600
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,240
Maybe it was hard to find a reason to live,

601
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,070
and during the investigation process, he probably felt a lot of guilt.

602
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,940
Sadness, guilt.

603
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,430
I think something is missing.

604
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,340
And what is that?

605
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,610
Anger.

606
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:02,570
From the start, I felt a sense that something did not fit.

607
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,890
I wondered what that was and for the longest time. I didn't know but

608
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:12,140
that man. He doesn't feel any anger toward the person who killed his wife.

609
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,700
There are people who can't express their anger even when they're mad.

610
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,140
And that kind of person would beat their wife?

611
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:21,400
Wait, wait. So right now, you're saying that the victim's husband

612
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,360
is a predatory murderer?

613
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,050
No. I told you from the beginning

614
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:29,560
that this wasn't a predatory murder case.

615
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:35,100
Could this be a copycat murder?

616
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,380
It must have been difficult to come here.

617
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,360
Oh no, not at all.

618
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,100
Here you go.

619
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,970
This...

620
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,140
What's wrong?

621
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,440
Is it Vita Chance?

622
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,820
There are so many fakes, huh?

623
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,760
Oh, yeah, you're right.

624
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,580
Thanks.

625
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:18,130
But, you said that you think you know the suspect?

626
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,050
There's something I have to finish. Will you wait here for a moment?

627
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,920
Make yourself comfortable.

628
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,360
Finish your drink. I'll bring some clothes and be out shortly.

629
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,950
Sure.

630
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,130
 A brave citizen who rescued foreign workers. 
 Suicide by gas of old people living alone is cover for murder.

631
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,580
 Predator Investigation Team

632
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,680
 Well educated predator goes after the socially vulnerable.

633
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,180
This is....

634
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,330
What is all this?

635
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,420
What do you think it is? As you can see,

636
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,960
It's my collection.  Should I add one more object now?

637
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,220
- What? 
 - I think you're so kind, like an idiot.

638
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,040
If you hadn't saved me yesterday, I would have really died.

639
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,500
The truth is...I was testing something.

640
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,250
Test?

641
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:06,830
I was researching how I could make the next time look like a suicide.

642
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,640
You're...

643
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:17,030
It's like Vita Chance.

644
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,210
We have to investigate Mr. Nam right away.

645
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,090
Stop.

646
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,610
I'm telling you to stop.

647
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:48,310
We are searching now for a predator who killed seven powerless people

648
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,270
and disguised them as suicides.

649
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,670
But you are so focused on the profile you've created

650
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,230
that you're creating another murderer that doesn't exist.

651
01:01:56,230 --> 01:02:01,070
Do you all really, really think that way?

652
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:09,270
Then, I'll at least go by myself.

653
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,000
You ...

654
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,980
Do you want to become like your dad?

655
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,370
Uncle.

656
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,450
Just now, we heard from the broadcasting station

657
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,040
and they said that there's someone whose confessed to the crime

658
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,150
who wants to tell you something on a live broadcast.

659
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,250
 You are watching a special live broadcast of a predatory killer

660
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,720
 who will be speaking live. 
 (Issues in Current Events)

661
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,650
I will repeat. We received a call at the station

662
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:18,310
from an unidentified person whom we believe to be perpetrator.

663
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:23,760
Immediately after that, we notified the investigating police team and asked someone to join us.

664
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,370
He's just now arrived.

665
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,860
A member of the Seoul Police Department's team on the predatory murders,

666
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,400
Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon, is here.

667
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,640
 Issues in Current Events

668
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,250
Hello.

669
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,720
An Inspector who also became famous for making major contributions

670
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,760
in all sorts of violent crimes through his profiles.

671
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,340
Now, what do you think about the culprit's actions?

672
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,670
If there is anything that my investigation team has found out,

673
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,430
the perpetrator is a stockbroker committing murder

674
01:03:56,430 --> 01:04:00,130
on the day a certain stock price pattern is completed.

675
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:03,460
The murders were disguised as suicides so the pattern wouldn't be discovered.

676
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,380
But after the investigation was started,

677
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:09,700
he's become bolder and more flamboyant, unlike the way he used to be.

678
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,960
I see.

679
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,980
So, this is theoretically risking provoking him even in the future—

680
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,620
It means that he is highly likely to commit additional murders.

681
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,690
We cannot rule out the possibility that perhaps he has committed more crimes.

682
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,780
It means he is meticulously planning and acting.

683
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,320
But our task force must ensure that we are fully prepared

684
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,930
to respond to any unforeseen circumstance.

685
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,650
One moment.

686
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:12,400
I think we've received a call from the person claiming to be the culprit.

687
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,960
Hello?

688
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:17,290
Can you hear me?

689
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,890
I will speak to him directly.

690
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,500
Hello? I am Inspector Ryoo Jae Joon.

691
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,440
Please speak.

692
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,720
 It's me. The Predatory Murderer.

693
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,420
You killed at least seven good citizens and disguised the deaths as suicides.

694
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,780
What is the reason that you've done this?

695
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,680
 Do you know why our society is in this state?

696
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,630
 Originally, human beings wanted to live freely

697
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:49,510
 We've been endlessly fighting, killing and conquering.

698
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:55,360
 That was a natural way for the weak to die.

699
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,310
 But look. How are things now?

700
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:01,280
 Whether it's equality, human rights, or social welfare,

701
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,050
 you've created a logic which primarily makes no sense.

702
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,800
 Predators like me, have our hands and feet tied.

703
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,840
 While treating them equally, are you forcing me to live like a beggar?

704
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,890
 I can't do that.

705
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:18,610
A cold-hearted predator doesn't sound like he's going to freeze to death.

706
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:22,750
Is this being broadcast all over the country? It's a waste of airwaves.

707
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:28,080
But do you think Dong Sik is eating well?

708
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,650
Should I call him?

709
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,130
Why do I kill people?

710
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:54,560
I wanted to make this world go back to normal.

711
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:59,140
How can you prove that you are the predatory murderer?

712
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,740
You'll find out soon.

713
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:06,230
 You'll probably find a body today.

714
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:18,410
 Issues in Current Events

715
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,600
Dong Sik.

716
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,980
You...

717
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,630
 Psychopath Diary

718
01:07:55,810 --> 01:08:02,820

719
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,010
 Where is Yook Dong Sik?

720
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:09,140
 He's someone who even attempted suicide.

721
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,340
 But what if it wasn't attempted suicide and was a test run?

722
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:15,230
 If he called the broadcasting station directly and reported the murder, he'd definitely want to watch.

723
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:19,180
 He's got a lot of cops running around in panic. He must be close.

724
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:19,880
 Are you okay?

725
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,130
 I'm telling you, I'm the Predatory Murderer!

726
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:27,060
 Then prove it. If you cross this and run away, I'll acknowledge you.

727
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,750
 I will catch the perpetrator that my father was after.
