 Psychopath Diary

4
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,550
I had a lot to drink so I'll be off.

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,060
Wait.

6
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,330
What? What did you just say?

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,630
I said that jerk is a psycho,

8
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,350
a murderous bastard.

9
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,660
Are you okay?

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,870
But thanks to you, I got to see the type of people you hang out with.

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,060
I had fun in my own way.

12
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,360
♫  my babe  ♫

13
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,390
♫  now you are saying you love  ♫

14
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,250
♫  me more ... more ... more  ♫

15
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,920
 I've realized it now.

16
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,280
 Killing people who are weak and powerless

17
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,420
 does not fulfill my impulsive desires.

18
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,000
 But I'm a psychopathic serial killer.

19
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,850
 What happens if I want to kill someone again?

20
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,830
I'll just think about that when it happens.

21
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,430
 Psychopath Diary

22
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,460
 Episode 5

23
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,250
Ah, what are you doing, Sunbae?

24
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,770
Taek Soo, you're off tomorrow, right?

25
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,260
Can you switch with me for one day?

26
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,860
It's possible, but what's going on?

27
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,530
Two jobs again?

28
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,680
Something like that.

29
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,590
Sunbae, you're too much.

30
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,330
I might seem a little sloppy at times, but I'm still a police officer and your partner.

31
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,700
Do you think I don't know that you're always looking into files and doing all the inquiry and investigation?

32
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,270
Taek Soo, that is—

33
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,240
I don't know. I don't know.

34
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,230
I can't cover for you all the time. Either include me if it's an investigation,

35
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,790
or if it's really a two-job situation, share your earnings. I can't give in anymore.

36
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,400
Hey. Come outside.

37
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,140
So, you found out the predator you were chasing;

38
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,420
that serial killer is Yook Dong Sik.

39
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,650
Don't you think that's going too far? The Yook Dong Sik we know?

40
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,720
That's why no one suspects him.

41
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,960
Because he looks innocent and nice.

42
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,310
Even so, he lost his memory because of us.

43
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,210
What if all that was a lie?

44
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,840
After he kidnapped the homeless man, Kim Myeong Gook, in the restroom,

45
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,900
he was going to kill him at the construction site but saw us coming, so he purposely leapt in front of the car.

46
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,950
So he wouldn't be suspected.

47
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,790
The premise and conclusion don't seem to match.

48
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,910
Because since then, he's been pretending to have amnesia.

49
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,230
We never asked why he jumped out of there or what he was doing.

50
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,140
I've been trailing him and there are more than just one or two things suspicious about him.

51
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,230
Trailing him?

52
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,270
Sunbae, have you been stalking Dong Sik this entire time?

53
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,310
It would be better if you had two jobs.

54
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,070
I even heard a conclusive statement.

55
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,050
You always say something to me. To act as though we are in a detective mode.

56
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,380
That's why ...

57
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,020
I'll find the evidence.

58
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,480
- Just your day off— 
 - I'll switch with you.

59
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,750
But in return, that this is really something

60
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,020
that deserves the investment of our citizens' taxes and police force,

61
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,530
something that makes you go, "Wow, it was that big of an issue!"

62
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,040
So that I can be assured of that, please make me, your partner, understand.

63
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,220
If not, I'm going to report it immediately to the boss.

64
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,650
Immediately.

65
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,370
Watch Yook Dong Sik's every move within the company and report to me.

66
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,430
Yes.

67
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,710
But if it's about work, Team Leader Gong is reporting all of it—

68
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,090
Did I not say his every move?

69
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,380
How many times he goes to the bathroom, what he talks about in the break room.

70
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,800
Who he hangs out with normally, about his reputation,

71
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,310
by any means necessary.

72
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,000
 - By any means necessary, watch his every move and report it to me. 
 - He blocked the entrance.

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
- And then? 
 - I think he had something on his mind,

74
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,910
so I looked at him.

75
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,030
And then he recognized me.

76
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,160
Charisma.

77
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,350
Wow, then Director Seo took you with him to Winner's Club?

78
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,380
Daebak event!

79
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,590
This is the first time I've heard of him taking someone there. You've been completely accepted by him.

80
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,930
Then, because I am in Sunbae Dong Sik's line,

81
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,420
- I'm also in Director Seo's line. Right? 
 - Oh, come on.

82
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,820
It's really interesting.

83
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,050
- Sunbae, did you go looking like that? 
 - Yeah.

84
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,270
You need to buy some new clothes.

85
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,950
- He's fine. 
 - He looks cool.

86
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,290
But if you go to a place like that, you need to dress nice.

87
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,530
He said just one look in his eyes and it’s game over!

88
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,370
But then you went with ordinary clothing.

89
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,080
Should I try a bow tie?

90
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,650
Excuse me, Dong Sik.

91
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,550
I'm Team One's Assistant Manager Chan Ho Park.

92
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm Team Two's Oh Sang Sik. I greeted you at the dinner meeting before.

93
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

94
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,310
Which market are you watching lately?

95
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,270
I heard you were friends with Director Seo. Do you have any sources?

96
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,890
As far as I can see, recently, inverse futures contracts look good.

97
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,010
What do you think?

98
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,650
I'm not sure. I'm not too familiar with those things.

99
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,370
C'mon. Tell us a little.

100
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,540
While you all know that ...

101
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,560
 KOSPI 300 Inverse futures contracts  
  (Korea Composite Stock Price Index)

102
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,230
Inverse futures contracts.

103
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,290
Well, but then again, I feel like I know something.

104
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,210
What are you all doing when first close already happened?

105
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,520
Did you forget Director Seo telling us to work rationally and efficiently?

106
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,540
How long are we going to be this old fashioned and work so self-consciously?

107
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,780
If there’s something to report, do it separately. Don’t dilly dally and get home early. Get going.

108
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,900
Yes, you worked hard.

109
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,680
I'll be here until 7.

110
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,240
I said you can leave.

111
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,150
I may work overtime.

112
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,160
Good job everyone.

113
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,010
You worked hard.

114
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,850
You worked hard.

115
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,780
- Work hard. 
 - I'll be leaving now.

116
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,420
I'll see you tomorrow.

117
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,110
Well, if you have some time, when we're done with work, let's do it.

118
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,960
Is that right?

119
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,490
Did you get home okay last night?

120
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,510
Hello.

121
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,420
Hello.

122
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,820
Okay, then.

123
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,680
Oh, thanks to you, we were going home early.

124
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,180
What? Was there something else you wanted to say?

125
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,930
No, go ahead.

126
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,550
Okay.

127
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,550
So, you're going to continue to act like everything's normal, huh?

128
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,050
It's me. I need you to watch someone for me.

129
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,160
Right now.

130
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,380
Good bye.

131
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,270
I heard your family’s meat restaurant is doing well.

132
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,770
You must be pleased.

133
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,810
But is this all?

134
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,380
I asked if this is all you have?

135
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,510
Sorry. But I can’t give any more than that.

136
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,520
Right. I guess more isn’t possible.

137
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,850
Hold that properly.

138
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,820
If you gave your word between friends, you need to keep it.

139
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,860
Are you kidding? Uh?

140
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,320
Does our friendship only amount to this?

141
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,660
High schoolers!

142
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,910
Perhaps, do you have a lighter?

143
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,890
We smoke electronic cigarettes, though.

144
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,350
Thugs nowadays don't carry a lighter around?

145
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,320
That's freaking smart.

146
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,440
What are you, ahjussi?

147
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,230
Me? I'm your future.

148
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,470
Reeking of alcohol in broad daylight.

149
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,430
Ree... reeking of alcohol?

150
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,280
It shouldn't be. I should be smelling like bread.

151
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,830
Because I came out of prison not long ago. 
  (bread and prison have similar pronunciation)

152
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,870
It's funny, right? It's funny.

153
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,170
- It's funny! 
 - Damn scary!

154
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,980
You foolish puppies, I should slice your head with a sashimi knife for you to come to your senses.

155
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,820
Ah, I have a weak heart. I was so scared I almost died!

156
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,740
Ahjussi, instead of compensation, take this and buy yourself a lighter.

157
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,380
Hey, I told you I'm playing a RAM game today, right?

158
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,530
The guys are meeting at the cyber café.

159
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,630
Okay, go first.

160
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,560
Today's kids don't care about who is higher or lower or logic, they just let their fists fly first!

161
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,290
If I didn't have 50-year-old shoulders, I would have pulverized them.

162
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,910
Still, I'm thankful. Usually, people just pass by, you see.

163
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,710
But why does a guy like you go around getting beat? Are you the neighborhood drum?

164
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,090
What about you?

165
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,350
You little, an elder is talking and you interrupt him, you!

166
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,310
Or if you can't, learn some moves or something.

167
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:48,350
Give a feeling like if I catch you once, I'm going to swing a hook. The feeling.

168
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,500
Or call their bluff.

169
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,610
Look!

170
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,380
You! What are you looking at!

171
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,550
What? Did you come to see the sights?

172
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,770
Well, you should figure out the person first, before doing it.

173
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,490
What's with your face? Did you get beaten by that person?

174
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,390
It isn't so! Is he someone you know?

175
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,150
- Youngest one— 
 - Get off!

176
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,390
- Don't butt in. 
 - Youngest!

177
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,590
That is... What happened is...

178
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,200
There, it's those. Th-There, those two.

179
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,560
I told you to hit here.

180
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,390
If you do that, you're going to lose.

181
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,170
Students.

182
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,930
Perhaps, did you two hit our Dong Chan?

183
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,430
And if we did?

184
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,270
What?

185
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,190
Sorry to bother you during your game, but could we have a chat for a minute?

186
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,640
You guys, you don't know who this guy is, right? You're dead.

187
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,090
What is that? Shit.

188
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,800
Shit.

189
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,580
- What is it? 
 - What?

190
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,760
There's a situation, come here.

191
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,000
- What do we do if it leaves a scar? 
 - It's fine.

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,120
Where is your head that you’re always falling?

193
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,270
Is it because he's in a growth spurt? Should we give him to herbal medicine?

194
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,740
What herbal medicine? It's because you always side with him like this that he's feeble.

195
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,890
 At the cyber café some oldie got beaten up and dragged out by our school's bullies.

196
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,280
Dong Chan!

197
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,270
How could he not fall when all he does is go around looking at his smart phone?

198
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,150
Now, what are you gonna do?

199
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,360
Your style is to die for.

200
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,210
He's got killer style. It's several years past.

201
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,770
This is driving me crazy.

202
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,180
Can we really just keep watching like this?

203
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,420
For now, just watch.

204
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,330
Yook Dong Sik's true identity will come out soon.

205
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,960
Do you wanna fight?

206
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,060
Ahjussi, you're an office worker?

207
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,930
- You must have some money! 
 - Money?

208
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,670
Ahjussi, if you don't have change we also accept cards. Card loans work well these days, I hear.

209
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,980
Have you had many painful experiences?

210
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,930
 No Country For Old Men

211
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,260
What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?

212
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,170
What are you saying?

213
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,500
Heads, Tails. Choose.

214
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,840
Did he go crazy, really?

215
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,440
What a coincidence, this is a coin from 2002.

216
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,760
That means it's the same age as you guys. It's perfect for choosing your fate.

217
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,570
Choose, quick. Heads or tails?

218
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,360
We need to bet something on it, though.

219
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,420
What about one million won  (around 800 USD) ?

220
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,690
Actually the bet is already made. I did.

221
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,820
What did you bet on?

222
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,430
You guys' lives.

223
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,420
How dare this bastard put on airs?

224
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,390
Hey. Look at that jerk's face. That's a line from a movie!

225
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,720
Haven’t we watched enough?

226
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,290
You told me to convince you. Wait a bit.

227
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,690
His true colors will appear soon now.

228
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,220
Seriously.

229
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,750
 In the old days, I would have buried these small fry on the spot.

230
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,110
 But I need to hold back

231
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,750
 since I am not the Yook Dong Sik from the past.

232
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,360
This bastard, really!

233
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,420
My body aches all over,

234
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,750
so I was thinking of getting a massage anyway.

235
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,000
It's so refreshing.

236
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,020
What, it's not already over, is it?

237
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,590
What is he saying, this crazy bastard?

238
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,010
Come on! I can do this all day.

239
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,000
Hyung!

240
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,630
Are you okay?

241
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,990
Why did you come here?

242
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,710
Speak for yourself. What are you doing here?

243
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,060
A pushover like you, why are you butting in and getting beaten up?

244
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,260
Beaten up, who? Huh? Huh?

245
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,370
I am just trying to have a talk with your schoolmates.

246
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,560
Hyung.

247
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,620
- From now on I'll give it to you systematically without stalling, so please stop! 
 - Hey.

248
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,490
Am I a beggar? Your brother is asking for a massage, move!

249
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

250
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,590
So please overlook it just once.

251
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,420
What wrong did you do?

252
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
The ones to blame ...

253
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,960
are these guys.

254
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,770
Hyung is teaching them that, so get away for a bit.

255
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,650
No, these guys are really scary ones.

256
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,990
- Hyung, at this rate you really!
 - Stay out of it.

257
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,150
Dong Chan, your brother is saying he wants to receive a massage.

258
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,820
- Wait, guys! 
 - Let's stay out of it.

259
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,730
- No ... 
 - Keep off.

260
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,850
Hyung!

261
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,850
He looks like he’s got no more left in him.

262
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,150
You're still energetic, right? Try and hit me,

263
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,390
Do you really want to die?

264
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,600
- Hyung! 
 - Stay out of it.

265
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,380
Hyung!

266
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,770
- Let's request for assistance right now. 
 - Damn.

267
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,290
Sunbae!

268
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,400
I said I was wrong!

269
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,530
Please, stop it!

270
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,570
Hyung.

271
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,580
 The blood of a psychopath ...  Alive!

272
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,740
 I'm warming up my whole body.

273
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,610
 That I'm restraining myself ...

274
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,190
 They wouldn't know, even in their dreams.

275
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,430
So irritating, is he laughing?

276
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,950
Maybe he hurt his head? At this rate, if something goes wrong ...

277
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,250
- It's fine, so go. 
 - What?

278
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,680
What are you doing? I told you to hit him.

279
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,450
It's fine, with this we beat him a lot.

280
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,430
Ah annoying, really.

281
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,010
Hurry up and ask for back-up.

282
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,700
Yes.

283
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,910
Who is that woman?

284
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,100
Quiet, all of you! Don't move.

285
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,930
- Don't move. 
 - Hey, Ahjussi, are you alone?

286
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,800
I came from the station. I'm not alone, no. Don't move.

287
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,240
Hey, dog crap.  I'm here to save your lives.

288
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
Here! Here!

289
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,880
The strong guy is here.  The strong guy is here.

290
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,040
Taek Soo, I'm calling for back-up.

291
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,360
Mister!

292
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,530
Hyungnim.

293
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,830
Why did you just let yourself get beat up, huh?

294
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,060
I... don't bother the weak.

295
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,480
Seriously, you're showing off to the end.

296
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,670
Did you say you were as tall as a telephone pole?

297
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,430
Let's take him to the hospital.

298
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,890
Don't we have to ask for the patrol division to come out?

299
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,990
Captain!  Where is the captain?

300
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,610
Tell him to come out!

301
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,920
Please calm down.

302
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,100
Can you do that to children?

303
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,160
How can you treat them like criminals?

304
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,910
They are criminals, though, Father. A group of them beat one person nearly to death. It's special violence.

305
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,380
You said the other party is an adult! Isn't this a mutual assault?

306
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,020
- My kid got hurt! 
 - Damn it, please shut up!

307
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,830
Huh? What did you just say?

308
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,530
A little hurt? (sounds similar to shut up) He's a little hurt.

309
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,870
He really did get hurt. She's just asking like that.

310
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,310
Isn't that right, Sunbae?

311
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,390
Seriously, this woman!  Do you know who my husband is?

312
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,390
If I do, does anything change?

313
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,930
A victim who didn't even grab him by the collar as it's commonly done, let alone throw a punch,

314
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,930
at least seven people attacked him as a group.

315
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,580
Two police officers, including me, witnessed it!

316
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,300
The kids, what they did wrong,

317
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,590
what kind of punishment they'll receive if they do something wrong,

318
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,020
if you don't teach them at the appropriate time,

319
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,610
they become monsters when they get older.

320
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,200
It seems like all of you who are parents don't have any intention of teaching them,

321
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,130
so I will instead teach them for certain.

322
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,720
It's all done.

323
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,330
Just stay lying down.

324
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,030
I'm okay. They said nothing's broken.

325
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,630
Come on! Who do you think you are to get involved?

326
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,130
I thought you were going to die.

327
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,100
Why did you go that far?

328
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,130
I'm not anybody special.

329
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,120
When I didn't call you Hyung,

330
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,360
and I dismissed you all the time and only said mean things to you.

331
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,850
You know, I have amnesia.

332
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,800
I can't remember anything.

333
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,300
Seriously, you're putting on airs till the end.

334
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,450
Stop watching movies and imitating them!

335
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,320
It makes you look pathetic.

336
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,200
This punk. Ouch!

337
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,000
This little kid!

338
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,150
Dong Sik! Dong Sik! Hey!

339
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,320
What happened to you!

340
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,540
Ouch! It hurts, it hurts, Mom!

341
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,680
Oh, sorry.

342
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,070
I'm sorry. Even so,

343
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,870
thanks to Hyung, I think it got resolved well.

344
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,230
Dong Sik, thank you.

345
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,630
It's nothing.

346
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,900
Well, I see that he's perfectly fine.

347
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,180
It's okay.

348
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,580
He's a pushover.

349
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,760
I followed him around all day, but no matter what,

350
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,250
I don't think there's a need to watch him any longer.

351
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,160
Could he have figured out that he's being followed?

352
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,100
You're saying he made me? That kind of punk made me?

353
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,380
- I've been a detective for over 20 year— 
 - I got it.

354
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,000
I mean, maybe you're mistaken.

355
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,720
I said, I got it.

356
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Here.

357
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,800
You are a police officer. Wow, your uniform ...

358
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,800
I didn't wear it to show you, so no need for a comment.

359
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,980
What would you like to drink? The same one?

360
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,360
I'm sorry, but we police officers,

361
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,130
even when we eat cup noodles just to put something in our stomach,

362
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,200
we keep receiving various reports.

363
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,410
Just make it short.

364
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,350
About that psychopath from before,

365
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,720
if I had known that was a line from a movie,

366
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,940
I would have finished him off on the spot.

367
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,250
After that day, I got so angry about how I was treated that I developed a sleeping disorder.

368
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,390
So I was watching the television mindlessly,

369
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,090
but damn it.

370
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,230
In the movie, what he said to me,

371
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,260
the same exact line was repeated back with minor modifications.

372
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,330
I was so flabbergasted that I couldn't even laugh.

373
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,590
It's a total lie that he did that to Seo Ji Yoon, too.

374
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,500
He must have heard it from somewhere random and just let his mouth run.

375
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,120
So, you summoned me to tell me that?

376
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,870
Oh, It's not that.

377
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,400
I considered the jerk long and hard with a lawyer.

378
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,500
Charging him with intimidation just doesn't do it for me.

379
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,270
Look into him and see if there's anything we can get him on.

380
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,770
You're someone who's been educated enough,

381
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,390
but yet, you can't tell the difference between a police station and a detective agency?

382
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,720
Ey. I took great care in how much I put in here,

383
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,620
so why don't you at least check the amount before rejecting me?

384
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,150
If you call me one more time,

385
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,780
I myself will put this skewer in your head.

386
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,230
Charge me with intimidation, why don't you?

387
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,430
I'll lock you up for bribery before that.

388
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,630
I'll be going.

389
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,950
Oh.

390
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,260
What brings you here? 
  Porridge

391
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,120
I thought you might be having a hard time eating.

392
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,720
Oh...

393
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,900
I keep getting indebted to you.  I'm sorry.

394
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,390
I'm sorry.

395
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,220
What do you mean?

396
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,290
It's nothing ... To be honest...

397
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,580
the whole time, I've been thinking that you're—

398
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,450
Wait a moment.

399
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,900
- Hyungnim. 
 - Pardon?

400
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,800
I... from now on, will treat you as my hyungnim.

401
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,560
Why are you doing this?

402
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,690
I think you've had too much to drink.

403
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,730
Yes, I did have a drink.

404
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,790
Even if you ignore me, it's okay with me.

405
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,470
I'll eat and grow older and always live as a loser.

406
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,030
And you can even make fun of me.

407
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,430
But this Jang Chil Seong,

408
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,630
with just loyalty alone,

409
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,900
has been living in vain in the violent world of fists

410
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,900
unyieldingly all this time, and surviving.

411
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,290
But...

412
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,260
But inside that heart,

413
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,130
you came in so suddenly, like, bam!

414
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,510
And made an unforgettable impression.

415
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,190
Please at least remember

416
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,430
my sincerity, Hyungnim.

417
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,700
Yes, yes, yes. I'll remember, so please.

418
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,140
If you have no intention of accepting me

419
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,360
as your dongsaeng (younger sibling),

420
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,770
I will not even move a step from this spot.

421
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,460
Kill me. Just kill me.

422
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,830
You're good at killing, no? Kill me!

423
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,110
Killing?  How?

424
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,130
What's going on?

425
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,480
It's nothing. It's my upstairs neighbor,

426
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,080
and he's really drunk.

427
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,090
Just stay there a moment.

428
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,550
Hyungnim!

429
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,250
Jeez.  All right, all right.

430
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,150
Hyungnim, you're warm.

431
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,210
This is why he recited lines from movies so easily.

432
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,400
Memoir of a Murderer.

433
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,780
So ...

434
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,120
Do you remember the last shot in the movie?

435
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,270
What was it again?

436
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,030
An older ex-detective, Park Doo Man,

437
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,810
at the location where an incident took place,

438
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,420
stares into the camera directly.

439
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,390
As if, among the people sitting in the audience at that very moment,

440
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,270
he's looking for a criminal.

441
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,040
Director Bong Joon Ho said this,

442
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,370
"The culprit of the Hwaseong serial murders case will come see the movie no matter what."

443
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,250
So it means that at the end, what the protagonist was looking at

444
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,490
was the real culprit's face.

445
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,500
Did he really watch it?

446
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,740
Not only once. He must have watched it several times.

447
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,590
While watching the movie, he reminisced about those times

448
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:54,390
and felt the pleasure of having not been caught.

449
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,440
Just then, you quite looked like a profiler!

450
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,660
Well... I'm just a thriller freak.

451
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:12,300
Then, perhaps, you must be really interested in criminal psychology or that kind of thing?

452
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,200
- Oh, well. Well, that's true. 
 - Ooh.

453
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,400
Why? Is there a case being investigated

454
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,460
or something I could help with?

455
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,470
What?

456
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,820
Is it a murderer?

457
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,860
That is ...

458
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,570
A serial killer?

459
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,360
No, forget it.

460
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,250
Tell me! You never know, I could be of help!

461
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,220
Next time.

462
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,710
If we ever need help, I'll tell you for sure.

463
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,620
I took too much of your time.

464
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,030
Then, get some rest.

465
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,930
- Get some rest. 
 - Ah, yes.

466
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,620
 It seems I found the answer through blood.

467
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:34,330
 In this world filled with weak people, the way to retrieve my dangerous impulses.

468
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:38,220
 If I have to kill someone,

469
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,120
 if I can find someone stronger and more vicious than me, I can kill him.

470
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,960
 The serial killer corporal Sim is chasing after.

471
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,980
 What kind of guy would he be?

472
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,490
 I look forward to it.

473
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,110
How is Ji Hoon these days?

474
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,940
He's not in his right mind. He keeps locking himself in his room.

475
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,710
I'm thinking of sending him abroad for a bit.

476
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,800
Then, the position of chief director, will it still ...

477
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,820
In Woo will have to take it

478
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,950
until Ji Hoon is reinstated.

479
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,240
Are you even thinking of reinstating him?

480
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,230
If he was going to crumble after such an incident, I wouldn't have even thought of leaving him my position.

481
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,940
Isn't that so?

482
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,750
That's right. Since he is a strong guy.

483
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,170
Ji Hoon is?

484
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,950
Do you really think that?

485
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,810
But, I'm sure he will become strong, little by little.

486
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:50,190
An opponent playing the exemplary brother in front

487
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,960
while in the back, he could draw out a knife anytime.

488
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,750
As long as such an opponent is by his side, that is.

489
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,340
Are you still doubting me?

490
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,650
I always doubt since that's the way I have managed to survive.

491
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,460
- Take it. 
 - It's alright.

492
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,410
There is no call that a businessman doesn't have to take.

493
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,640
What's going on, for you to even call me to your house?

494
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,100
You said you had something to say about Yook Dong Sik.

495
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,780
What is it about?

496
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,440
That jackass.

497
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,730
I don't like him, you see. I'm asking to fire him.

498
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,720
Why?

499
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,650
Why else?  You saw it too. No matter what it is, I have to be in control.

500
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,860
You can't fire an employee over that kind of matter.

501
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,470
Even if it's my request?

502
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,660
If I refuse, what will you do?

503
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,010
I'll go to your brother-in-law.

504
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:20,700
What will happen if I tell him everything you've done to harass Seo Ji Hoon.

505
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,370
Will your president stay put?

506
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,250
That you stole company money and buried it in overseas real estate.

507
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,810
I can let it out.

508
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,780
You're saying you'll defend Yook Dong Sik this much.

509
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,060
I'm dying of curiosity, really.

510
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,610
Did he catch a weakness of yours or something?

511
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,280
Do you want to know?

512
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,100
I'll tell you

513
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,100
what I'm hiding.
   On the Origin of Species by Darwin

514
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,620
Of course.

515
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,850
Vermin-like bastard Yeong Min.

516
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,000
How dare he bring up a subject of which you know nothing.

517
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,720
Do I look ridiculous to you? Do I?

518
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,590
Don't come at me, Yook Dong Sik!

519
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,410
 CCTV

520
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,180
 2019

521
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,180
 Delete

522
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,060
 Korean Daily:  We only give you the true news!

523
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,710
What is this?

524
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,660
 Anonymous - Tip-off: Sinseong Securities Director Joo Yeong Min's alleged embezzlement

525
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,200
 Sinseong Securities Director Joo Yeong Min's alleged embezzlement

526
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,190
Alleged embezzlement.

527
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,360
 A senior executive at Sinseong Securities, a leading brokerage house, identified only by his surname Kim,

528
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,610
 has been revealed to have embezzled several hundred million won of company funds.

529
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,830
 The police conducted an emergency search at his company and home.

530
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,890
 However, it seems he has already fled.

531
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,020
 Thus, the investigation is expected to meet difficulties.

532
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,350
Yes, yes.

533
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,060
Dad, we came to have lun—

534
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,190
- Uncle! 
 - Bo Gyeong,

535
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,200
come. Jae Joon came, Jae Joon.

536
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,710
Inspector, it's an honor to meet you.  I'm your fan.

537
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,380
- Yes, you're working hard. 
 - Yes.

538
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,170
Uncle, why did you come?

539
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,920
I came for some business in the neighborhood, and I haven't seen Sunbae in a long time.

540
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,960
You came at the right time. You'll stay for lunch, right?

541
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,600
No, I have to go right away.

542
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,080
Where are you going? Stay here some more.

543
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,740
Please come often, he likes it this much.

544
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,730
Yes. I will come by again soon.

545
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,620
I'll go, Sunbae.

546
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,360
Bo Gyeong. See me for a bit.

547
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,640
Are you making any progress in the case you were investigating?

548
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,460
That is ... I had a setback from a wrong assumption.

549
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,970
I don't know if this will help,

550
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,870
but why don't you focus on the date the murders started?

551
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,140
It's not that I haven't thought of that.

552
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,030
There are still only three cases.

553
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,050
Well, given that, although it's not going to be easy to establish a specific pattern,

554
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,680
even so, according to your profile, he's moving very closely according to a pattern.

555
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,390
I mean when we see how he sticks to his subjects

556
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,190
and method of killing according to his own rules.

557
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,310
You know, even in setting the date for a murder,

558
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,960
I'm sure he has his own unique rule.

559
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,800
 March 4

560
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,300
  April

561
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,110
 September

562
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,300
Sunbae, aren't you going home?

563
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,780
March 4. Between April 22 and 28.

564
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,580
September 18. Does anything come to mind?

565
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,890
Right.   When did we find the broken toilet tank lid?

566
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,990
Oh, that was ... September—

567
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,270
Thirteenth.

568
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,560
Yes. The date of Kim Myeong Gook's death was the 18th.

569
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,930
The first murder was on the 13th.

570
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,170
If the culprit moves according to a pattern,

571
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,240
the 13th is more significant than the 18th.

572
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,960
That's so.

573
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,130
March 4.  Between April 22 and 28.

574
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,760
September 13.

575
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,550
 Yook Dong Sik.

576
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,890
Dong Sik?

577
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,620
- Are you busy? 
 No.

578
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,410
Why is your voice so weak?

579
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,930
It's just that things are not working out.

580
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,380
Oh my, is that so?

581
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,780
When that happens,

582
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,080
isn't it better to relieve your stress rather than hold on to it?

583
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,220
I too felt a little frustrated today.

584
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,260
Would you like to go there where I haven't gone in a while?

585
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,420
There?

586
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:01,560
There is some kind of pattern in these numbers which turned out to be clues.

587
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,110
So, the password to this safe is ...

588
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,290
Wow.  Daebak!

589
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,140
Did you see me open it in one go?!

590
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,410
Here, the handcuffs key.

591
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,760
Oh, what, you opened it? Oh wow.

592
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,990
You're good.

593
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,660
Corporal Sim, it seems like you can't focus at all today.

594
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:47,260
I'm sorry. I wanted to have a change of mood, but there's still a lot on my mind.

595
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,020
Do you have some worries?

596
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:57,840
For example, like the case you talked about last time, that isn't going well?

597
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:04,000
But why are you so interested in it? In my case?

598
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,860
Well, I can't sleep,

599
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:12,710
and to try to revive my old memories, I'm watching the movies I have stacked at home.

600
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,910
Before, when I was having a hard time being an outcast at the company,

601
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,510
I thought of what you told me then.

602
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,720
To do what my subconscious tells me to do.

603
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,680
And that is helping me?

604
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,920
So that we can catch the murderers that come out in movies?

605
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,950
On March 4th, between April 22nd to 28th,

606
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,120
September 13th.

607
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,660
Is there anything coming to mind?

608
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,960
No, not if you only tell me that.

609
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,860
Right.

610
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,890
Among the three murder cases you discovered,

611
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:21,150
seeing that for one of them the estimated date of death is within a week,

612
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:25,210
it means that it was discovered at least three to four months later.

613
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,560
Yes. Keep going.

614
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,160
Hold on.

615
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,060
March 4th. From April 22nd

616
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,080
to 28th.

617
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,400
September 13th.

618
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,120
What could have happened?

619
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,680
I told you before about Memories of Murder, right?

620
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,530
- Did you see that movie? 
 - Yes.

621
00:50:54,530 --> 00:51:01,240
There, on rainy days where Yoo Jae Ha's song Gloomy Letter

622
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,120
was broadcast per request, the murder occurred.

623
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,940
With these dates as well, there surely ...

624
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,650
 Wait. These dates.

625
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,030
 It somehow isn't unfamiliar.

626
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,560
What? Is there something coming to mind?

627
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,770
These dates are...

628
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:42,710
We call this the KOSPI 300 inverse futures.

629
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,560
That is, hmmm. Just think of it like this:

630
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,960
They are the stocks that increase in price when the composite price index declines.

631
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,540
Okay okay, here.

632
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:58,030
The lines you see on this chart are called trend lines.

633
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:03,760
This green line is the line with a 5 days moving average, and this red line is the line with a 22 days moving average.

634
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,870
But, why are you ...

635
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,000
Look at the dates when the green 5 day moving average line is higher than the red 22 day moving average line.

636
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,550
Look. March 4th.

637
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,220
April 24th.

638
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,230
September 13th.

639
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,120
As expected, there was a pattern to the murders' dates.

640
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,280
That's not all.

641
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,030
If this is indeed the right pattern, there might be at least one other case

642
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,000
that hasn't been discovered yet.

643
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,680
July 8th.

644
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,090
Thank you!

645
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,980
Hello, please open the door.

646
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,490
Thank you, Dong Sik. Thank you!

647
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,370
Corporal Sim! Let's go togeth—

648
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,540
You guys aren't going home? Ah, really.

649
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,720
Then, let's have a meeting while doing the review of the draft proposal.

650
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,370
Prepare for it.

651
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,960
Sit down.

652
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,270
Why? The humidifier last time was good. You said you liked your partner that time.

653
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,380
 Dong Sik, when are you leaving work?

654
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,430
 I have a matter to check, would you like to go with me?

655
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:43,340
 A serial killer who killed at least four times, I don't know what kind of guy he is,

656
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,670
 but he is worthy prey to release my urge to kill.

657
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,600
I can just play a round of World of Warcraft then.

658
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,320
- Good work today. 
 - We'll leave now.

659
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,690
Prepare for the meeting.

660
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,310
You must have figured out to some extent,

661
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:25,360
but in reality, I am chasing after a serial killer.

662
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,400
What kind of guy is it?

663
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,920
That is ...

664
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,640
I'll give you the details later.

665
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,080
Yes, sure. You can't just carelessly reveal investigation information, of course.

666
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,910
That is true, but in reality, it's also because I'm not that confident.

667
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,100
- Sorry.  
 - Oh oh, no! Not at all.

668
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:53,600
However, thanks to the dates you specified, I found a quite strong case.

669
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,460
It's a missing person case, but ...

670
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,360
- You think he was killed. 
 - Yes.

671
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,430
If that is really so, then this case could become a big turning point.

672
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,110
If there is something that I am missing and not seeing,

673
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,010
be sure to tell me, Dong Sik.

674
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,860
Of course. Leave it to me.

675
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,390
- Hello, I have something to ask. 
 - Ah, I'm a bit busy.

676
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,360
Hello, I have something to ask.

677
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,820
Hello, I'll ask you some questions.

678
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,610
I came from the Naksan Patrol Division.

679
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,690
 Sim Bo Gyeong - Naksan Police station

680
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:44,340
I'm from Mongolia, I don't know Korean v-very well.

681
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:56,880
What's with you guys? Why are you loitering around someone else's factory?

682
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,320
Are you the boss?

683
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,820
That's right. You guys, are you ... reporters?

684
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,480
- No, I'm— 
 - Oh!

685
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,950
Boss! Hello.

686
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,040
I am, uhm.

687
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,550
An analyst from Daehan Securities, Yook Dong Sik.

688
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,100
You didn't get the message? Aigoo.

689
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:34,820
We said we would come for a site visit, but it looks like you didn't get the message.

690
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,930
Ah, shit, this Kim Yak again. Such important information.

691
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:42,600
- But, that person? 
 - Ah, I ...

692
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:48,000
Miss Bo Gyeong! Did you come without a business card again? Aigoo.

693
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,970
She is still an intern, you see.

694
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,290
There isn't a separate person in charge of investor relations, so you can speak with me.

695
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,330
As you know, our business holds twelve types of patent technologies.

696
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:20,630
We are expecting to double our product line in the second half of the year.

697
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:25,070
Whoa, double? Wow, you're great.

698
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,340
- But, where did that woman from earlier ...? 
 - Ah.

699
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:42,180
We got a call from the main office, so I sent her on an errand for a bit.

700
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,060
This is our company's performance chart for this year.

701
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,830
Would you like to see it?

702
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,000
Ah, yes.

703
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,310
There's a cargo truck coming in this evening,

704
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,310
so check it thoroughly, understood?

705
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:59,200
Yes. I will move this to the storehouse.

706
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,030
Alright. Work hard.

707
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:14,410
It looks like you speak Korean well.

708
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,540
Are you an illegal resident?

709
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,830
You don't have to worry since I didn't come for that.

710
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,550
I am not an illegal resident.

711
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,770
Then, why are you so defensive?

712
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,370
I am not defensive.

713
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,680
You are obstructing.

714
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,560
Are you scared of the boss?

715
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,260
Perhaps, are you getting unfair treatment or something?

716
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:50,340
Ah, no. The boss is good.

717
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:55,220
If you only reply to a few questions, I'll stop obstructing your work and go.

718
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:59,090
How long has it been since you started working here?

719
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,250
It's been a year.

720
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:07,360
Then, you should know someone called Hong Jin Goo.

721
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,630
What's that? Didn't you hear some noise?

722
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,610
I-I'm not sure.

723
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:19,070
Wh-What kind of noise? I don't really ... Boss, this—

724
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:20,770
I'm back!

725
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:24,870
What were you doing that you're only coming now? Why did you leave out the messages from Daehan Securities?

726
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,100
Pardon? What messages?

727
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,830
Really, how they are doing their work these days ...

728
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,130
It looks like there was some mistake.

729
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,680
Who are you guys?

730
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,000
- You know, right? 
 - I-I don't know.

731
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,540
Then why can't you even look me in the eyes?

732
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:02,400
If you've been working here for a year, you were at the factory when that person went missing.

733
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,430
I-I don't know.

734
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:06,670
Look, what is your name?

735
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,600
Allagha.

736
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,330
Allagha.

737
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,540
Please tell me. If you know anything, even a small thing is good, so—

738
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,290
What are you doing here?

739
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,610
That is, uhm, at Daehan Securities,

740
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,700
for the outstanding businesses,

741
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,250
there is a program for promoting them which I didn't get to tell you about yet.

742
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,130
That is, um...

743
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,650
You guys. You are indeed reporters, right?

744
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,820
Get out. Get out right now!

745
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,450
Did you find out something from that person?

746
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,920
No.

747
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,650
In my opinion, that boss is suspicious.

748
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:56,140
He is certainly hiding something, but he's not saying anything, maybe because of the boss.

749
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:59,190
 My bestial instincts are telling me

750
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,030
 that boss is the culprit.

751
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,010
Ah really, we can't even request a warrant and come.

752
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,810
Wait a minute.

753
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:13,510
Yeah? Ah, the chief?

754
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,970
Okay, I'll go right away.

755
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,360
For today, let's go back.

756
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:26,910
Oh! I think I left my phone in the office.

757
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,710
Ah, really.

758
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:31,350
- Oh, your phone? 
 - Yes.

759
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,830
It looks like you're in a hurry, go first.

760
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,070
Is it alright?

761
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,890
I'm sorry. It's because it'll get troublesome if the chief finds out.

762
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,420
It's alright! Go quick.

763
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,380
I'm sorry.

764
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,560
- I'll go. 
 - Go.

765
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,140
 A predator doesn't need a warrant.

766
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:08,570
 Okay. Now should we find out the boss's real identity?

767
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,810
This bastard, you don't understand what I tell you?

768
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:27,870
I'm gonna tell you one last time, so listen well.

769
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:32,860
That guy went missing. No one saw him after that day, understood?

770
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,420
Still ...

771
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,920
Oh, this bastard, really!

772
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,290
If this goes wrong, do you think it'll be the end of only me?

773
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,110
It'll also be the end of you, huh?

774
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,590
You need to think of your family in your hometown.

775
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:50,800
Nehrukkui, there's no need to ruin our lives because of a bastard who committed suicide.

776
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,190
Hong Jin Goo didn't commit suicide.

777
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,960
 Hong Jin Goo.

778
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,380
 It's a name I heard a lot from somewhere.

779
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,250
 Hong Jin Goo - 52 years old - male

780
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:13,600
 The one I killed. Why is that name coming out here?

781
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,330
You saw as well.

782
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:20,290
That he wrote a suicide note and died. If that's not suicide, what is it?

783
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,820
No.

784
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:31,210
Jin Goo didn't commit suicide.

785
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,810
Ah, this bastard.

786
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:57,820
 In reality, I am chasing after a serial killer.

787
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,600
 March 4th.

788
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,270
 From April 22nd to 28th.

789
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,290
 September 13th.

790
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:10,340
 Spare me!

791
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,650
 Is there anything coming to mind?

792
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:30,660
 Who knew that I was digging my own grave! The guy Corporal Sim is chasing

793
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,990
 was me. It was me!

794
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,670
 A boring day

795
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:01,600
Hello?  I am from the Seoul Regional Employment and Labor Administration management team.

796
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,690
This is Goseong Chemical's employee lodging house, right?

797
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:08,820
I am sorry to bother you at this late time, but could I talk to an employee called Allahu?

798
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:12,050
Ala- what? There is no such person.

799
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,720
Allahu. Allahu.

800
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,490
  I'm telling you there is no such person.

801
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,850
That can't be? Among the foreign employees with a Mongolian nationality —

802
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:25,570
Ahh! Ah, but if it's a Mongolian, there is only one person? Are you talking about Nehrukkui?

803
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,790
Nehrukkui?

804
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:30,420
But what do you need at this time? Are you really from the Labor Administration?

805
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,370
I will call you back after verifying it.

806
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,220
Nehrukuoi? Allahu?

807
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,700
Allahu.

808
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,500
A-la-hu.

809
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,800
 Crazy person

810
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,960
A-la-huh

811
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,130
 While, whereas

812
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,930
Al-la-gha.

813
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:20,830
 Murder

814
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,620
 Hong Jin Gu - 52 years old - male

815
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,020
 Corporal Sim

816
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,700
 The person you are calling is not answering, leave a message.

817
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,680
Did he not find his phone yet?

818
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,520
 Going up.

819
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:25,420
 Psychopath Diary

820
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:33,980

821
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:42,160
 Dong Sik got  my diary and is chasing my cases together with the police.

822
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:47,280
 Then, it means that he doesn't know the owner of that diary is me, yet?

823
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,960
 What are you, exactly?

824
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,360
 Me? I'm a predator who's on another level than guys like you.

825
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,040
 We found the corpse!

826
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,480
 The suspect is a highly educated man in his thirties.

827
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,710
 We are thinking of the possibility that he is a worker in the financial industry.

828
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:05,450
 I have to stop Corporal Sim's investigation at all costs.
