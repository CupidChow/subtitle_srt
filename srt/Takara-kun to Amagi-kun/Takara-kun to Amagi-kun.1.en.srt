1
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,102
Long time no see.

2
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:36,840
"Long time no see"? We see each other in class all the time.

3
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,394
But you haven't talked to me in a while.

4
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:43,628
I thought you were avoiding me.

5
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,744
I wasn't avoiding you.

6
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:51,589
There is just no reason to talk to you anymore.

7
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:55,203
What is that supposed to mean?

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,965
Let's just forget what happened between us.

9
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:06,884
I'm sorry I forced you to date me.

10
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,440
I don't get you.

11
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:15,765
Why are you running away?

12
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:20,100
Let go! Don't talk to me anymore!

13
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,828
Even at a time like this,

14
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:35,242
that first hand I ever held was hot and painful.

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,091
And despite that...

16
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,900
I didn't want him to let go.

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,690
♫ Do you remember the season that took our breath away? ♫

18
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:03,990
♫ My joyful heart is restless because of the words left unspoken ♫

[Takara-kun & Amagi-kun]

26
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,887
[Episode 1]

27
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:42,729
The 12th graders are rebelling after their phones were confiscated.

28
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,972
You shouldn't give tools to those with no imagination.

29
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:47,267
Segawa, you're so cold.

30
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,964
Takara-kun, I came to return your health textbook.

31
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,516
I said to put it in my locker.

32
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,543
I don't know your student number.

33
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:56,919
It's on the textbook.

34
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,032
Hey, don't act so cold.

35
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,466
That's not okay, Takara.

36
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,340
- Don't be mean.
- Treat her nicely.

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,514
You keep coming to me.

38
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:07,461
- Do you like me?
- I do.

39
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:09,440
Oh, that's great.

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,273
Keep her out of the classroom.

41
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:14,979
Don't mind him. Hey, Takara!

42
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,895
Wait up, Takara.

43
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,120
It was his chance to get a girlfriend.

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,740
This is ridiculous.

45
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,194
The popular kids seem fired up as usual.

46
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:28,464
Thanks to the dominant power, we're at peace.

47
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,683
Amagi, we only finished the first period.

48
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,294
Let him sleep.

49
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:37,390
He's tired from talking to you since morning.

50
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,424
Then he would have dropped dead in elementary school.

51
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:42,574
Thanks.

52
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:45,801
You should rest, too, Zakki.

53
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,779
Thanks for thinking of me.

54
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:51,419
I'm the happiest when I see your sleeping face.

55
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,996
You must have a hard life.

56
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,294
Shut up.

57
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,335
Keep quiet, Four-eyes.

58
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:00,480
Why am I the only one you are mean to?

59
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,974
Do you even know my name?

60
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,467
Sato? Yamada?

61
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:05,535
Or maybe Suzuki?

62
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,059
Stop guessing with common names.

63
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,625
You look like a Suzuki.

64
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,249
It's not Suzuki, it's Katori.

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,274
Katori, Katori, Katori!

66
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,150
- Suzuki!
- Hey!

67
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,001
I can't sleep.

68
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,743
Sorry, Amagi.

69
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,279
I'll put you to sleep.

70
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,901
Zakki, you're too close!

71
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,417
Hey, people are watching us.

72
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,430
- Stop it.
- I don't care.

73
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,629
Does candy make you feel better?

74
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,396
Are you trying to act cute?

75
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:35,499
If you want it back, just say so.

76
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,087
It's from an auntie on the street. I'm too scared to eat it.

77
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,512
- Don't give it to me then.
- Just eat it.

78
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:44,272
I wish the slow punks in front of me would disappear.

79
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,156
Segawa, you're always so rude.

80
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:49,983
- Our Princess is in a bad mood today, too.
- Why?

81
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:53,599
Because an older co-worker at her part-time job speaks down to her.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,965
- How much older are they?
- 47 years old.

83
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,783
Hire me, too.

84
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,819
I'm really curious about where she works.

85
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,581
- Can't say.
- A cosplay café?

86
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,836
Those don't exist in the countryside.

87
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:08,089
Oh. I think I forgot my bag and textbooks at home today.

88
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,165
Adieu.

89
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:13,474
- Hey. Do you have English today?
- What?

90
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:15,403
Class A's schedule changed.

91
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:18,034
- I'm looking for a textbook.
- Sure!

92
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,359
Really? Thank you!

93
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,343
Tell me your class and student number so I can return it later.

94
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,721
And your phone number, if you don't mind.

95
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,589
You're so flirty.

96
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,703
Sara-chan, your facial proportions are amazing.

97
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,241
I think I might fall for you.

98
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,905
Geez. I'm totally awake now.

99
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:37,934
They say napping for over an hour can increase the risk of death,

100
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:41,175
so don't nap so much if you want to live until graduation.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,892
Can you not scare me so casually?

102
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,919
I can't sleep an hour even with all of our breaks, so don't worry.

103
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,785
You sleep for 64 minutes, based on my calculations.

104
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:51,154
Why are you keeping count?

105
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:53,499
- Don't do that.
- You might die.

106
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:01,034
Did you know that the first person in Japan to try on contact lenses was a high schooler?

107
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:03,409
Oh, really?

108
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,790
What about glasses?

109
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,076
I don't know, but probably a military commander in the Edo period.

110
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,739
I think Ieyasu used them, too.

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,534
Don't you think people with glasses act like they control the world?

112
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:19,449
Well, those people probably study twice as much,

113
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,521
so you could say that people in power are more likely to wear glasses.

114
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,966
What a weird way to assert dominance.

115
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:35,225
Anyway, since glasses came first, I wanted to know the first to wear them.

116
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:39,300
For a four-eyes, you really lack vision.

117
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,404
Are you trying to pick a fight with us glasses users?

118
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,232
If you're including sunglasses,

119
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:49,217
I retract my statement.

120
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,210
Does the environment committee meet today?

121
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,239
Yeah.

122
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:03,276
We're taking away the lives of weeds, which is hard to get excited for.

123
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:06,333
I guess you can't file a complaint for physical labor.

124
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,514
Why are you running away?

125
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,085
Let go!

126
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,731
Don't talk to me anymore.

127
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:34,387
Don't run.

128
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,314
We can't go back to being mere classmates at this point.

129
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:39,017
Don't mess with me.

130
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,960
No, they haven't broken up yet, but things aren't going well.

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,883
Let's go to karaoke next time.

132
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:03,668
No, I'm not very good, so I'll just bring down the mood.

133
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,549
Just bring in a tambourine.

134
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:08,584
Seriously, you should come. Everyone would love to see you.

135
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:12,460
Let's go. Come on.

136
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,900
Stop preying on a weak kohai.
(T/N: younger student, junior)

137
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:20,701
There is a committee meeting tomorrow anyway.

138
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,414
I have important things to tell him.

139
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,700
You can tell him later.

140
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:27,035
You're not cute at all, do you know that?

141
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:28,717
Learn from Amagi.

142
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,314
Yeah, I'll try my best.

143
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:34,851
Anyway, we want to finish up quickly and head home.

144
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,443
Can he be excused?

145
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:38,532
Fine.

146
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,866
See you later, Amagi-kun.

147
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:48,960
Amagi, don't listen to what guys like that have to say.

148
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,972
They have nothing important to say,

149
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:55,060
yet they keep bothering the kohais.

150
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,582
Next time, you should better escape.

151
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,662
Let's get going.

152
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,944
The weeds worked so hard to grow this much, yet we're pulling them out.

153
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:47,000
We are so cruel.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,682
We could just show them that this isn't where they are meant to live

155
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,703
by paving the whole place with asphalt.

156
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,371
Then we can avoid needless killing,

157
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,060
and they can go live in a nice environment.

158
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,040
It would be a win-win.

159
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,110
That kind of good will might be causing global warming.

160
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:11,887
I see. We have to find a home for them first.

161
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:18,567
Amagi, you're a kind guy.

162
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:27,802
Well, we can't do much during our remaining time in high school,

When I said I liked him,

172

that's when I realized my feelings for him.
