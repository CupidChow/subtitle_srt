1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,360
It feels fulfilling,

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,140
but I'm spending my days aimlessly.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,610
Like any other high schooler,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,580
my mind is filled with temporary worries.

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,180
I keep an exaggerated distance between those around me.

6
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,490
A bit of boredom is just right.

7
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,910
It's easier to deal with those who are awkward.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,190
Afraid of looking stupid when expressing myself,

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,710
I pretend because of my youth.

10
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,940
That's why I thought...

11
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,890
this must be the same kind of thing.

12
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,820
That's what I thought at first.

13
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,350
♫ Do you remember the season that took our breath away? ♫

14
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:40,580
♫ My joyful heart is restless because of the words left unspoken ♫

15
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,800

[Takara-kun & Amagi-kun]

22
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:17,739
[Episode 4]

23
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,289
"I know that I know nothing"? Probably they don't even know what that means.

24
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,810
Did they even read Socrates?

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,140
But Socrates didn't write any books.

26
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,860
Amagi?

27
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,879
- Hey!
- Whoa!

28
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,389
- Why are you spacing out? Let's go to the kiosk.
- Sure.

29
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,509
- Takara.
- Let's go.

30
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,229
Do you know Socrates?

31
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,689
Oh, uh... Right.

32
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,389
He definitely doesn't know it.

33
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,140
It's tasty, right?

34
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,920
I mean...

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Takara...

36
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,939
It's a person.

37
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:00,559
It's not food.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,399
He's a Greek scientist or philosopher. Right?

39
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,310
Were you paying attention to the class?

40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,459
I'm so glad I got the last one.

41
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,740
You'll get gout if you keep eating pollack roe.

42
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,660
That's only for old people.

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,349
It has DHA, so it improves your learning ability and memory.

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,379
It's great for young people.

45
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,949
Oh, really?

46
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,740
What about my seaweed then?

47
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,190
You'll have glossy hair.

48
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,669
- I don't need that.
- Yes, you do.

49
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:39,899
I don't. Mine's already glossy.

50
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,600
That's true.

51
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,039
No, it really happened yesterday.

52
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,550
An elementary schooler on the train gave up his seat to an old man.

53
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,269
- Then the kid sat on his friend's lap.
- Seriously?

54
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,740
That's too wild.

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,449
But it may be the solution for overpacked trains.

56
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,319
- Japan's future is looking bright.
- Awesome.

57
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,329
Sitting on someone's lap? No way.

58
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,330
- Hey.
- Hi.

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,699
I will tell you the rest of the story later.

60
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,140
Sitting on laps isn't the solution.

61
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,879
Why does the conversation never stop in Takara's group?

62
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,140
There's no room for me to cut in.

63
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,929
Hey, hotties. Move over.

64
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,719
Do you mind accompanying me to the vending machine?

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,679
Do you want me to pay as well?

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,500
This weak girl is scared of going to the 12th graders' building alone.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,650
Tanaka, it's all you.

68
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,349
I knew you'd say that.

69
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,960
Protect this weak girl.

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,429
Please?

71
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,649
I should've talked to him first.

72
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,069
All right, let us all go together.

73
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,470
Hooray, let's go.

74
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,400
Takara? You better come, or you're paying for all of us.

75
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,240
I'll have a yakisoba bread.

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,260
- What kind of sandwich is this?
- A pork cutlet sandwich.

77
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,910
A pork cutlet sandwich? Nice.

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,699
Café au lait was all out. What a bummer.

79
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,299
I wanted some, too.

80
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,300
What an awful day.

81
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,079
- Excuse us.
- Thank you.

82
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,919
It's fine. Sorry for rushing you.

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,979
So cool.

84
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,670
He's so nice.

85
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,599
What?

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,569
You're in a good mood today, Takara.

87
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,070
What?

88
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,179
Oh, I guess so.

89
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,520
Yeah, you are absolutely right.

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,079
Every day's a blast.

91
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,900
I want to punch you.

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,719
- I hope you go bald.
- I hope you'll get stabbed three times.

93
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,399
- What?
- Oh, crap! Run away!

94
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,380
Don't be jealous.

95
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,910
Takara.

96
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,909
What is it?

97
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,939
It's nothing.

98
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,200
Ugh.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,330
I'm just greeting a popular kid.

100
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,689
What? So lame.

101
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:09,040
It's mean of you to be so busy.

102
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,579
It's rare of you to bother me.

103
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,690
Yeah, I kind of feel restless.

104
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,209
Why?

105
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,790
I don't know, either.

106
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,109
Maybe I'm excited.

107
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:27,170
Since I got to be with you a lot.

108
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,920
Takara?

109
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,630
I'm fine.

110
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,600
Amagi.

111
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,510
Huh?

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,180
So Takara,

113
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,570
I want you to teach me what to do.

114
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,560
Then I will do my best at anything you say.

115
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,770
Just make a move already.

116
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,600
Don't make Amagi flustered.

117
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,859
I'm not a monkey like you,

118
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:01,380
acting impulsively on my instinct, or unable to resist my desire.

119
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,950
All right, let's go home together today.

120
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,400
Sure.

121
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,069
I'm logical

122
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,059
and considerate of other's feelings.

123
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm a sophisticated person.

124
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,100
What are you doing?

125
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,889
Oh, I have a stupid story to tell you.

126
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,689
My bedhead this morning was so puffy, I thought it was statically charged.

127
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,099
So stupid.

128
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,869
But bedhead can be bad, right?

129
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:43,870
Yeah.

130
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,140
Hey, mine's an art form.

131
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,099
Amagi and Katori, don't ignore me.

132
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:52,319
I'm kidding.

133
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,649
We are kidding.

134
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,659
It's art, right?

135
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,449
How is that art?

136
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,680
It's a work of art no matter how you look at it.

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,659
- No matter where you look at it.
- Not in the slightest.

138
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,399
How could you call that art?

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,930
Hey, Amagi-kun.

140
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,350
Warm this up for me.

141
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,029
It looks good on you.

142
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,430
Just as I thought it would.

143
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,100
I'll take it back when it gets cold, so hold on to it.

144
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,280
I'm coming in.

145
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,639
"I went to sleep because I don't want to think about you,"

146
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,039
"it's awful that you appear in my dreams."

147
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,469
So is this a traditional poem talking about romance?

148
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,719
You understood it wrong.

149
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:14,189
Have you ever heard of the word "koromogaeshi"?

150
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,169
What?

151
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:17,359
When you wear your pajamas inside out,

152
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
the person you like will appear in your dreams.

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,599
So the answer is A.

154
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,769
Yes, you're correct.

155
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,190
All right! Next one.

156
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,949
By the way,

157
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:34,159
you also saw the person you like in your dream, right?

158
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,059
Idiot, don't remind me.

159
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,039
You are making a scene.

160
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,429
Tell me what happened.

161
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,739
- Seriously, don't ask me.
- Of course I'd ask.

162
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,899
You don't have to act interested.

163
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,239
- I'm telling you.
- Amagi.

164
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,099
Oh, Takara.

165
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,379
This is a thank-you for the blackboard photo.

166
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,519
Oh, thank you very much.

167
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,240
Likewise.

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,119
Want one, too, Katori, the kindred spirit?

169
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,960
Oh, thank you.

170
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,860
Okay, bye then.

171
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,210
Wow, he shut me up.

172
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,440
By the way, what happened in Amagi's dream?

173
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,589
Why are you asking me?

174
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,160
You were the one who interrupted me.

175
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,980
I mean... Well, I mean...

176
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,010
What?

177
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,080
You sexually harassed me.

178
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,629
Right... he explained it to me.

179
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,850
I didn't really understand it, but it's resolved.

180
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,479
Sorry for getting you involved.

181
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:16,599
Oh, so he told you about it.

182
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,530
How interesting.

183
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,999
- What about you, Takara?
- Me?

184
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,789
Yeah, are you not going to tell him what kind of dreams you've had?

185
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,269
It's only fair.

186
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,799
Wait, that makes no sense.

187
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,919
I've never dreamt about him.

188
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,940
That's not funny.

189
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,739
Amagi stayed over at your place the other night.

190
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:48,890
Since when have you gotten so close?

191
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,680
Fifth period is starting soon.

192
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,520
He ran away.

193
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,760
Amagi is easy to read, but so is he.

194
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,420
Why are we suddenly having a hair inspection?

195
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,680
Who knows?

196
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,720
- Takara will die.
- Your hair is blonde.

197
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,220
What are you, Monchicchi, the monkey doll?

198
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,640
Have you ever had black hair?

199
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,850
I had when I was an infant.

200
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,110
Stop it. I'm telling you to stop.

201
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,070
- Seriously, this is great.
- Oh, good. This is nice.

202
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,760
After the opening ceremony,

203
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:09,860
I felt uncomfortable with the hustle and bustle of my new classmate.

204
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,300
With that vague feeling, I felt my blood rush through my body for the first time.

205
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,519
Who do you think is the cutest girl in the class?

206
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,629
Who's number one?

207
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,860
Only based on their looks, have you thought of anyone?

208
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,480
Didn't you like Hashino?

209
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,490
Don't touch me, you moron.

210
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,349
Oh, I'm sorry.

211
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,429
I thought you were Tanaka.

212
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,969
Oh, I see.

213
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:53,100
I was taken aback by how aggressive you were.

214
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,830
You had a petal on your back.

215
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,510
It was my bad.

216
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,739
Sorry for startling you.

217
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,279
You didn't put it on for fashion's sake, right?

218
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,430
But it really looked good on you.

219
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,689
Thanks.

220
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,749
By the way, my name's Amagi, not moron.

221
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,400
I'm the number one, so don't forget.

222
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,719
Okay.

223
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,740
Okay, then. Sorry to bother you.

224
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,810
Number one?

225
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,150
Oh, his student number.

226
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,580
I thought his friendly smile...

227
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,130
felt like the fresh spring season.

228
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,910
Well, this isn't good.

229
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,709
What do you want for lunch?

230
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,109
Hey, let's eat together.

231
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,359
- Amagi, I've been waiting for you.
- You're lame.

232
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,799
Don't call me lame.

233
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,710
Guess what I'm eating.

234
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
A moment that changes my values.

235
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,470
A fated, miraculous moment.

236
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,980
I can't, and I won't say that's the case.

237
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,999
Do you want to go to a karaoke bar or bowling?

238
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,259
Definitely bowling.

239
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,979
Even so,

240
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,260
there's no need to rush. Let the time pass slowly

241
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,300
like the morning sun slowly melts the snow.

242
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,889
...is located at the base of the slope.

243
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,569
A pretty garden with ponds welcomes visitors as they enter the grounds.

244
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:56,319
A small hole in the garden is dedicated to building...

245
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,460
Oh, he's falling asleep again.

246
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,460
So cute.

247
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,810
I mean, seriously...

248
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,780
It's so soothing.

249
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,039
Don't make that cute face.

250
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,859
You sleep too much.

251
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,739
- It's fine, isn't it?
- What time did you go to bed?

252
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,199
Last night, I slept at 2 a.m.

253
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,619
Oh, geez.

254
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,189
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

255
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:32,079
It's too early for me.

256
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,469
- Good morning.
- It's not morning.

257
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,790
The cherry blossoms bloomed in full.

258
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,049
Sorry, I'm late.

259
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,549
You're late.

260
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,699
Hey there.

261
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,929
Oh, hey there.

262
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,739
You barely made it.

263
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,539
I signed you in already.

264
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,040
Thanks.

265
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,450
It's Amagi in the flesh.

266
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,630
Oh, crap.

267
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,999
Takachi-senpai?

268
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,229
Oh, he noticed us!

269
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,309
Yoo-hoo, how do you do?

270
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,579
Look forward, Stupid.

271
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,880
Huh?

272
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,439
Takachi-senpai, are you in a club or something?

273
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,319
Oh, me?

274
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,059
I'm not.

275
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,069
How do you know the underclassmen? How incredible.

276
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:29,499
They're friends of my friends.

277
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,349
Wow.

278
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,389
I only hang out with people in our grade.

279
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,140
Oh, what do I do?

280
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,429
I might die without ever being called senpai.

281
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,310
Wow.

282
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,329
It's fine.

283
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,379
You'll work at a company.

284
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:57,500
If it comes down to it, I could call you that before you die.

285
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,940
For real?

286
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
I'll hold you to that, so don't forget your promise!

287
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,620
He's too close.

288
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,470
I let this happen because I had my guard down.

289
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,809
Oh, you played volleyball?

290
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:21,319
Yeah, I guess. In middle school.

291
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,449
Only for a little while.

292
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,080
So you're not playing anymore?

293
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,189
The game itself wasn't fun.

294
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,210
I just did it out of habit.

295
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,089
It was like everyone passed me while I was waiting at the traffic light.

296
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,890
So I quit.

297
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,109
Oh, that's such a waste.

298
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,460
Takara, you'd be cool even if you're not number one.

299
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,600
But I guess a lot of hobbies are fine in moderation too.

300
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,440
I guess that's true.

301
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,250
I always thought

302
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,150
I could just ignore any misunderstanding.

303
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,520
But...

304
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,030
After meeting Amagi,

305
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,830
I found it too difficult to control my own emotions.

306
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,879
Isn't our teacher for next period scary?

307
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,999
Apparently.

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,969
- Yeah.
- Right?

309
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,780
- Do it.
- Do it.

310
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,180
- Do it.
- I'm not doing it.

311
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,299
You did it.

312
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,850
You did it as I told you.

313
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,609
Huh?

314
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,110
What?

315
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,339
Why are you doing this?

316
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,989
- You thought I was Tanaka, right?
- I did.

317
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,139
Come sing at the karaoke bar with us.

318
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,909
- I can't let you hear my singing for free.
- You're tone-deaf.

319
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:02,279
I was doing an arrangement.

320
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,909
Oh, so it was an arrangement?

321
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,800
Why does she keep talking in that pose?

322
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,019
Thank you so much.

323
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,950
Don't call out to me again.

324
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,469
I recently realized that the red stuff in mapo tofu isn't ketchup.

325
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:32,060
That'd just be tofu boiled in ketchup.

326
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,390
Whoa, what is it?

327
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,770
Get off. I can't move.

328
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,370
Amagi?

329
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,710
What's wrong?

330
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,590
Why are you crying?

331
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,530
Because I shoved you off?

332
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm sad.

333
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,130
I just wanted to hug you from the front, not the back.

334
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,890
Sorry.

335
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,360
♫ Chasing after the sparkly aspiration ♫

336
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,740
♫ In my heart. One-step, two-step, let's dance ♫

337
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,790
♫ As our gaze follows the fingers, our feelings are mutual ♫

338
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:24,390
♫ The feelings that cannot be put into words are precious ♫

339
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,120
♫ If the sky is clear tomorrow, ♫

340
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,640
♫ Will you smile? ♫

341
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,560
♫ Darling, for you, love is simple ♫

342
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,070
♫ Darling, I need you. Coming anytime, anytime ♫

344
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,139
Do you want to go out tomorrow?

345
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,229
I'm so excited about today!

346
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,559
This is so much fun like no other.

347
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,740
I'm good at loving someone.

348
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,499
A classmate? I don't want to be seen!

349
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,372
Do you want to walk past them?

350
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:00,070
I'm dating that guy.
