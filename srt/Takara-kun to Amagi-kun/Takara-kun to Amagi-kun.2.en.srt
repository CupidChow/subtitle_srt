00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,170
Goodbye.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,670
Hey, Takara!

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,009
Hey.

5
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,829
Why are you still here?

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,289
I was being held up by a teacher.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,999
What about you?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,889
Same here.

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,599
I thought I was down on my luck,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,119
but I got to see you!

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,329
Suddenly, I feel lucky.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,719
Yeah.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,210
I feel lucky seeing you, too, Amagi.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,510
Double luck and happiness, right?

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,600
Hey, Amagi. Listen to me.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,140
I like you.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,570
I like you!

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,206
Oh, sorry.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,644
What? You like me, Takara?

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,640
Yeah.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,929
Then why did you tell that girl that you are not dating anyone?

22
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,510
Huh?

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,980
Oh, that?

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,420
You heard?

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,059
I wanted to keep it a secret that I like you, Amagi.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,130
Oh... I see.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,099
On that day, we officially became lovers.

28
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:13,020
However... I can't get used to it at all.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,229
Takara is probably being really careful around me

30
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,090
because of that crazy misunderstanding.

31
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,939
Are you done after submitting that?

32
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:28,559
Oh, but the approval might take a while.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,831
I'll probably get out late.

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,799
I'll wait, so let's leave together.

35
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,625
It's fine. It will get dark outside, you know.

36
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:40,379
Yeah, that's why I'll walk you home.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,839
Come on, I'm not a first-grader.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,626
I'm totally fine.

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,770
Hm?

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,719
Hey, if you don't mind,

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,739
I want to spend more time with you.

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,360
That's why I want to take you home.

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,650
I...

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,510
I love that!

45
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,440
I'll finish this in a flash!

46
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,690
That reaction made me feel embarrassed.

[Episode 2]

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,809
Oh, man. My left hand is the happiest in the world.

58
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:28,229
I feel so shy about holding hands like this.

59
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,469
He's so damn cute. Yep, instant proof.

60
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,736
I will protect him my whole life.

61
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:38,399
What if a classmate jumps out from the corner?

62
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,839
We will be fine.

63
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,629
We will say we accidentally glued ourselves together.

64
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,510
Think about it. What kind of situation is that?

65
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,344
Think fast!

66
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,625
That's strange.

67
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,206
Hey.

68
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,479
The trend you started is so stupid.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
I have lost count today.

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,559
I'm a guy that shares his new obsessions.

71
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,360
It's annoying.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,689
Only elementary students get their pants pulled down.

73
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,730
Geez, I don't want to be a boring adult.

74
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,289

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,909
I'm so bad at basketball.

77
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,379
I'm really good at it.

78
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,577
- Don't lie.
- It's true.

79
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:50,939
I bet you're awful.

80
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,010
I don't want to hear that from you.

81
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,259
His face is awful.

82
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,879
Darn it.

00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,879
Yep, that's me!

I need you for a second.

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
Sure, I'll come with you!

87
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,339
Huh? What do we do?

88
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,300
Takara from the popular crowd took Amagi away.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,470
- Catch it.
- Okay.

90
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,350
- Good.
- Nice one.

91
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,979
So those idiots are going around pulling down people's pants from behind.

92
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,359
I'm checking to make sure your pants are on tight.

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,829
You're such a worrywart.

94
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:38,920
I think they'll target you since you seem forgiving.

95
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,330
Tie your string tightly so they'll never fall.

96
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,670
Let's see...

97
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,289
Okay, do it for me.

98
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,680
Are you seriously asking me?

99
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,359
But I think it will take a while to untie when I'm changing.

100
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,180
Yeah, that's true.

101
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,710
Just call me over then.

102
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,930
Okay.

103
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm done.

104
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,840
Okay, thanks.

105
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,670
Since when were you Yamazaki?

106
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,649
It's only for the first period today.

107
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,370
I forgot we had gym class today.

108
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,930
Oh.

109
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,460
- Don't glare at me.
- You started it.

110
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,229
I didn't glare at you.

111
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,829
You're the one who asked, but all you said was "oh."

112
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,310
Sorry about that.

113
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,640
Are you not wearing anything underneath?

114
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,609
I am.

115
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,310
Don't lie.

116
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,799
Are you angry?

117
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:18,090
No, I'm not.

studying in the same classroom,

122
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,620
and being able to go talk to him whenever I want.

123
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,170
I can be by his side without making excuses to do so.

124
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,819
I can always hold his hand

125
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:56,590
and be within an arm's reach.

126
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,650
That's why I...

127
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,460
am over the moon with happiness.

Touch mine, too.

Good morning.

131
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,210
What's wrong? Did gym class wear you out?

132
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,150
What is it?

133
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,240
Oh, no. I ran away.

134
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,600
But that was...

135
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,100
Amagi.

136
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,819
We can't!

137
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,140
He's going to get suspicious now.

138
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,699
Yes, that's correct.

139
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:37,200
Return to your seat.

140
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,070
Next is Segawa-san.

141
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,619
I'm totally acting strange.

142
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:50,300
It will be bad if he gets even more suspicious of me.

143
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,735
- This one, please.
- That'll be 110 yen.

144
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,589
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

145
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,949
Hello.

146
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,550
I'd like this one.

147
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,240
I, a great typhoon, have arrived at the classroom.

148
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,189
I wish you'd get lost in the Pacific Ocean and dissipate.

149
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,709
Agreed.

150
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,090
What color is your underwear today, Segawa?

151
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,649
Same as Takara's.

152
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,839
What? You're gross.

153
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,449
I'm asking what color it is.

154
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,219
You're the gross one.

155
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm wearing strawberry-colored ones.

156
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,310
I need to act normal so that Takara doesn't notice.

157
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,069
What do I do? I'm at a loss.

158
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,290
Help me, kindred spirit.

159
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,879
Kindred spirit? Do you mean me?

160
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,299
Who else would it be?

161
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,959
I don't remember becoming one.

162
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,269
It happened naturally.

163
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,809
And when people talk about worries, don't they usually start

164
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,199
by sighing and dropping hints?

165
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,109
You came out of nowhere, so I'm not ready to help yet.

166
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,419
Before you ask what to do, tell me what happened.

167
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,216
Okay, fine. Take two.

168
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,470
What? Is something on your mind?

169
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,891
Have you ever had a weird dream, Katori?

170
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,619
A weird dream? Like what?

171
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,089
I don't know if it's weird, but the person I like appeared.

172
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,620
Is there someone you like?

173
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,139
Are you not asking who it is?

174
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,679
I'll save that for later.

175
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,039
Does anyone call you a weirdo?

176
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,489
Oh, I see.

177
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:15,079
Seeing the person you like in your dream happens to everyone.

178
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,879
Isn't it embarrassing?

179
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,499
Well, sometimes your dreams show you what you desire.

180
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,409
It can't be that.

181
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,619
So you never want this to happen?

182
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,120
Is that it?

183
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,160
Something I never want to happen?

184
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,959
That doesn't seem right, either.

185
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,579
Oh, no. What am I thinking?

186
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:49,379
If they knew, they'd hate me, right?

187
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,829
Wouldn't that depend on the person?

188
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,330
I'll stop this at all costs.

189
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:07,379
Want to finally go find out where Segawa works today?

190
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,310
Well...

191
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,832
I wonder where he works.

192
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:15,488
I bet it's just a lunch vendor.

193
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,369
- I could see that.
- Right?

194
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:19,869
I'd go hang out if he works at a convenience store.

195
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,389
Sure, I'll go.

196
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,460
Okay, let's go.

197
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:41,290
I'm finally able to be with him whenever I want, and yet...

198
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,229
Even today, there was a chance we could have held hands and walk home together.

199
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,220
I'm such a coward!

200
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,410
- Over here!
- All right! Nice shot!

201
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,439
Amagi.

202
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,399
You're acting strange.

203
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,320
What's up with you lately?

204
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,459
Hm... Nothing.

205
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,129
I'm just a normal boy, every day.

206
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,850
Are you?

207
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,782
Honestly, it's kind of scary.

208
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:47,073
I wouldn't know unless you told me.

209
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,239
If something's on your mind, tell me.

210
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,750
Even if it's nothing important.

211
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,020
If you keep acting this way with me,

212
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,800
I'll get worried.

213
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,989
I can't.

214
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:10,449
That scene runs through my mind every time I see his face.

215
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,699
Sorry, Takara.

216
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm sorry!

217
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,610
How about the café near the train station?

218
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,120
Sure, okay.

219
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,049
Where's Amagi-san?

220
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:39,179
Oh, he ran home just a bit ago.

221
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,409
He's lost in his mind right now.

222
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,269
You won't get any talk out of him.

223
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,779
You two are close, right?

224
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,219
Oh, I'm the one who gives him advice.

225
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,999
He's hard to handle at this age.

226
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,620
Are you his dad?

227
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,519
I'm a kindred spirit.

228
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,230
Is that so?

229
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,620
It seems puberty came late to Amagi.

230
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,810
I think he's having love troubles.

231
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm still worried about our difference in interest.

232
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,920
There's a gap between me and Takara that won't close up.

233
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,440
Tell me, even if it's nothing important.

234
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,610
If you keep acting this way with me, I'll get worried.

235
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,860
Worrying about me will just make things harder for me.

236
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,610
My reason is so insignificant.

237
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,170
But I don't find it insignificant.

238
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,640
I really hate that.

239
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,330
So exhausted.

240
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,610
What are you so tired of?

241
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,300
Let's go to a karaoke bar.

242
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,610
What are we eating?

243
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,780
What should we eat?

244
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,130
Let's go to a family restaurant.

245
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,410
Leaving so soon?

246
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,402
I was going to give you your space, but it's been days.

247
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,879
Hiding and sneaking around...

248
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,339
Avoiding me when I come to talk...

249
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,390
That stuff won't make me angry.

250
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,799
You can ask others for advice

251
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,170
and do whatever you want.

252
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,160
But it's tough on me.

253
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,650
Do you not trust me?

254
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,490
I don't know what you're thinking, Amagi.

255
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Oh, it's happening again.

256
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,450
I'm always overwhelmed with my situation.

257
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,170
Even though I'm not the only one who gets anxious.

258
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:53,006
Takara always conveys what he thinks.

259
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
Sorry.

260
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,100
I didn't want an apology.

261
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,299
I just want to be with you.

262
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,220
I'm just being selfish.

263
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,700
I didn't want to act weak and ask why you won't talk to me.

264
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,482
I only make excuses.

265
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,500
If I don't speak, we will misunderstand each other again.

266
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,340
For us, time won't solve anything.

267
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,040
I mean...

268
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,160
Well, I mean...

269
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,210
Yes?

270
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,740
You sexually harassed me. You sexually harassed me!

271
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,709
I wanted to act normal,

272
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,699
but I'm always reminded by your face.

273
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:56,659
I felt all weird and didn't know what to do.

274
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,439
Hold on now.

275
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,109
Who harassed whom?

276
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,849
You harassed me!

277
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,659
- I don't remember that.
- You pervert!

278
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,679
What are you talking about?

279
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,719
Was it someone who looked like me?

280
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,209
No, it was you!

281
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,840
Wait. Can you elaborate on that?

282
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,870
I didn't do anything.

283
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,850
Amagi.

284
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,580
Even though I can act dumb every day,

285
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,879
when I look back,

286
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,640
having Takara by my side

287
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,980
might have been a source of happiness for me.

288
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,660
I was pretty simple.

289
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,160
Or perhaps,

290
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,600
I was being really stupid.

291
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,700
But... that's fine, isn't it?

292
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,259
- Amagi.
- Stay back!

293
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,360
You're always like this.

294
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,999
- Stay away!

I'm spending the night at Takara's.

304
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,132
Do any family members live there?

305

I get to always be with you.
