1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,159
- That was a chihuahua.
- No, it wasn't.

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:07,049
It had the eyes, nose, and mouth.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,489
Then all dogs are chihuahuas.

4
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,339
You're just stereotyping.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,622
The teacher asked for you.

6
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:13,689
Me?

7
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,339
Go to the freshman office.

8
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:18,010
Seriously? Thanks for the message.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,619
Was the teacher really calling for him?

10
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,369
What? Yeah, it's true.

11
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,659
I thought you came to interrupt our arm wrestling.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,550
How rude.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,139
But the teacher said it wasn't urgent.

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,740
I knew it.

15
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:48,556
Don't worry. We're just friends.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,650
I'm not worried about that.

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,429
Does Amagi get angry when you call him cute?

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,719
I don't say stuff like that.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,700
He thinks I'm making fun of him.

20
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,931
I can see that.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,799
Honestly, he is cute when he's angry.

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,909
Not at all.

23
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,089
He even does it on purpose lately.

24
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,370
No, the one yesterday...

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,200
was really cute.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,810
He's the cutest in the world.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,382
You're hopeless.

28
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:01,662
That guy and I are dating.

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,259
Wow, how annoying.

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,529
Oh, no.

31
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,839
I forgot to write my name on the last quiz.

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,439
- Zero points?
- No, she'll let this slide since I wrote which class I'm in.

33
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,659
That's great.

34
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,129
It's all thanks to Takara for telling me quickly.

35
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,129
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

36
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,680
Oh... Okay.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,180
Wait, why are you two all friendly without me?

38
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,229
Wow, I've never seen that bird before.

39
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:35,480
Look, Takara.

40
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,460

[Episode 5]

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,929
I'm really sorry.

52
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,089
Don't be.

53
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:44,559
It's fine. It doesn't have to be today.

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,741
Sorry.

55
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,932
Don't worry. Raise your head.

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,550
Takara, let's go.

57
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,379
I'll invite you next time.

58
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,579
Don't worry about it, really.

59
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,720
It's not your fault.

60
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,099
Hey, Takara.

61
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,059
Don't make the senpais wait. Go on.

62
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,030
I'll text you later. I'm really sorry.

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,650
I thought we would finally get some time together after a while, but I guess not.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,160
Ever since I was little, I was never good at relying on others.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,739
Sorry, I was getting everything ready to have you come home with me.

66
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:55,399
Because I had no one to rely on.

67
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,685
Being treated nicely made me feel uncomfortable.

68
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:03,432
Taichi finally came home with us,

69
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,586
yet he doesn't say a word to me.

70
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:11,569
Maybe you didn't have to try so hard to bring him home.

71
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,629
But he wasn't like that before. If we give him time...

72
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,240
I don't have the confidence anymore.

73
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,010
After all, everybody hates me.

74
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,250
Who could possibly learn to love me?

75
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,830
Do you want to go home halfway with me?

76
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,590
Hey, what do you think kindness is?

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,349
If you convert the adjective "kind" into─

78
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,479
No, I wasn't asking about the grammar or definition.

79
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,080
Right.

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,900
I've noticed something.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,579
People act like they're being kind for others' sake,

82
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:11,620
when they are actually doing it for their own good.

83
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,160
Can you really call that kindness?

84
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,829
As a result, if it benefits the other person─

85
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,549
You're wrong.

86
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,670
The kindness I'm thinking of gets you nothing in return.

87
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,259
For example, let's say you see someone struggling to bike up a hill.

88
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,606
I notice them when I pass by in a car.

89
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:41,050
And without saying anything, I cheer them on in my mind.

90
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,270
That's what I mean.

91
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,779
There's no benefit. It's pure, natural, and without thought.

92
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,029
A bit of compassion that feels obvious.

93
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,120
Isn't this the innate kindness that we find within people?

94
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,720
I see.

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,960
It's so clear and sunny today. I love it.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,620
I wish my heart was clear as well.

97
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,439
Am I relying on him too much?

98
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,070
I'm nervous since I don't even know how to rely on someone.

99
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,630
Am I doing a good job with liking Takara?

100
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,069
I want to make up for today. Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

101
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,350
Really? Seriously?

102
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,569
You're awesome, Popular Kid.

103
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,049
You're on a totally different level.

104
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,436
Of course, I'll say yes! There is no other option!

105
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,390
What should I wear? Where are we going anyway?

106
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,129
Geez, what should I do?

107
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,240
What should I wear?

108
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,159
But will Takara be bored hanging out with me?

109
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,980
His energy when he's with his friends is completely different.

110
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,509
No, with my negative vibe,

111
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,199
hanging out with Takara would be a waste.

112
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,369
Let's do tons of fun things tomorrow.

113
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,980
Great. I'll take this, and...

114
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,660
Hey you, the popular kid!

115
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,439
Here I am. I'm all hyped up.

116
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:19,249
I also brought tissues and a handkerchief.

117
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,669
Hi.

118
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,999
You look really sleepy.

119
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,560
You're just too energetic.

120

Smile blockage.

121
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,959
Let's go.

122
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,409
Takara, you really are made to be popular with girls.

123
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,009
Wow, you're making fun of me.

124
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,679
I'm not.

125
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,480
This is fun. I'm so excited for today.

126
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,840
A train!

127
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,649
Are you ready?

128
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,450
Oh no, Takara, hurry!

129
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,019
- Multiple shots?
- What?

130
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,179
I wonder if it was okay.

131
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh, it came out really well.

132
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,759
Two boats! What is that?

133
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,879
It's Nessie!

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,249
- This is crazy!
- Really?

135
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,279
- I'm going crazy, too.
- Do you know Nessie?

136
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,209
They're like this and this.

137
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,799
- Are you tired?
- No.

138
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,239
Look, it's Nessie.

139
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,140
Don't you know Nessie?

140
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,960
It's huge.

141
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,010
Do I just bow here?

142
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,399
- Yeah.
- Okay.

143
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,700
Wait.

144
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,119
What is it?

145
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay, bow here.

146
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,030
Oh, they have fortune charms.

[We Offer a Prayer]

148
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,499
- Do you want one?
- Sure.

149
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,239
Which one should I pick?

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,279
I'll take this one.

151
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,509
I choose this one.

152
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:02,819
Are you sure?

153
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,099
I'm positive.

154
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,379
Green. It's so cute.

155
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,659
- Oh?
- What color is it?

156
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:12,459
Oh, it's a completely different shape.

157
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,060
It's really cute.

158
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,430
"Excellent luck"?

159
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,090
Why do you have "excellent luck," too?

160
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,170
Oh, I want to go over there!

161
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,430
Amagi, you're going to trip.

162
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,569
So huge! They are way bigger than any koi fish I've seen.

163
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,380
And there are so many, it's not even funny.

164
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,259
I would die if I fell in, right?

165
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,489
Takara, save me!

166
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,420
No, I would die, too.

167
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,219
Hey, how about you go to one end and I go to the other?

168
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,659
And we'll see which one of us gathers more koi.

169
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,719
You're so eager to have a match.

170
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,540
I'm hungry for a competition.

171
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,449
Seriously, let's do it.

172
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,600
- I will not compete.
- Let's do it.

173
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,310
By the way...

174
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,890
you're too close.

175
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,239
So annoying.

176
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,829
Amagi-san, conflict won't lead to anything.
(T/N: -san, a title of respect between equals, equivalent to Mr. or Mrs.)

177
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,920
And peace comes from smiles.

178
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,179
Well, isn't that nice, Mother Takara.

179
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm good at loving people.

180
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:55,000
There aren't many people at this pond. It's relaxing, isn't it?

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,800
It sure is.

182
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,799
- Boarding now!
- Amagi, watch your step.

183
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,269
Nessie really exists.

184
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,950
I hear you.

185
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,459
Wow, the weather is so nice.

186
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,249
I'm so happy. We are lucky, lucky.

187
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,040
I'm glad we came here today.

188
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,122
- I would love to come again.
- Yeah.

189
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,919
This was so fun.

190
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,179
It's as funny as your tardy slip at school.

191
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,399
When did you see that?

192
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,010
It was on the teacher's desk.

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,989
So embarrassing. Forget about it.

194
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,739
I don't even remember what I wrote there.

195
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,059
Everyone always writes long excuses about how they were sick,

196
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,019
but yours said in a beautiful writing, "carelessness."
[Carelessness]

197
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,629
Just that!

198
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,509
I laughed so much.

199
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,349
You're funny, Takara.

200
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,570
It doesn't make me happy.

201
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,840
Forget it right now.

202
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,819
But I'm complimenting you.

203
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,140
Don't lie. It's dishonorable.

204
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,500
Be happy about it.

205
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,950
Huh?

206
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:23,279
What?

207
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,959
There are actually people from our class.

208
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,700
I don't want to be seen.

209
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,529
What do we do, Takara?

210
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,649
Should we run? I'm ready whenever you are.

211
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,729
I can run anywhere as long as I'm with you.

212
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:43,490
Calm down.

213
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,529
It's fine. Hide and seek at this age?

214
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,010
It would be fun.

215
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,209
Why are you grinning?

216
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,919
It's interesting how thrilled you are.

217
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,379
I'm just glad you've calmed down.

218
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,199
It might be fun, but won't it get tiring every time?

219
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,669
What if we just pass by them and greet them normally?

220
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,710
No, I don't want them to think I'm close to you.

221
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,520
What?

222
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,059
- No, I meant─
- I'm going to the bathroom.

223
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,750
Amagi!

224
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,000
He doesn't want others to think we are close.

225
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,260
How could I misunderstand so badly?

226
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,269
Oh, we forgot to go see the cherry blossoms.

227
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,449
Oh, it's the asocial group that drowned in their past lives as pirates.

228
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,189
They bully nerds and are popular with girls.

229
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,699
What a nice life.

230
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,310
How arrogant. What's so great about them?

231
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,519
Aren't the blossoms gone soon?

232
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,099
Oh right, we need to go soon.

233
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,819
Should we get BBQ? Or sushi?

234
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,209
Hold on.

235
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,389
That's right.

236
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,459
Takara from that popular group,

237
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,349
using his precious day off for me,

238
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:27,050
is already like a miracle.

239
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,960
I knew it all along.

240
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,630
Of course, he wouldn't want people to know.

241
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,039
Hey Taichi, I won't understand if you stay silent.

242
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,339
Why won't you talk to me?

243
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,320
Say something. Please.

244
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,699
Apparently, he's lying about the hospital to save face.

245
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,010
The truth is, she just doesn't want to live with him.

246
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,710
I want to go home.

247
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,120
But where is my home?

248
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,840
Where is the home I can go to?

249
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,050
Who in the world will learn to love me?

250
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,280
Amagi!

251
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,679
About what I said earlier...

252
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,539
It's fine. You were just joking.

253
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,980
And I can try not to greet you at school.

254
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,179
I won't do anything that would bother you, so just relax.

255
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,929
No, it's not like that.

256
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,590
It's fine. Don't mind me.

257
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,940
You don't have to explain.

258
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,659
I know it would be uncomfortable if they thought we were close.

259
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,650
But it's different for me,

260
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,160
so I felt a little upset.

261
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,480
To be honest,

262
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,229
I wanted to become friends with your friends too, and─

263
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,249
Like I said, I can't stand that.

264
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:55,780
I don't want anyone to get closer to you than me!

265
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,049
Those guys will definitely be curious.

266
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,259
If you end up getting along,

267
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,640
and they learn how cute you are...

268
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,310
It would be better if they didn't know.

269
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,640
They don't need to like you.

270
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,420
Would that be enough if I kept you to myself?

271
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,040
Does that bother you?

272
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,720
Aren't you screaming with joy?

273
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,800
Your silence is quite gut-wrenching.

274
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,889
Whoa.

275
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,500
What? Did I make a mistake?

276
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,869
I want to disappear.

277
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,370
No.

278
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,660
It feels like I found happiness.

279
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,960
Who... Who would love...

280
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,260
Say you like me.

281
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,160
I like you.

282
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,330
I really like you.

283
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,170
It makes me happy that you asked something of me.

284
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,109
Okay, then let me say this too.

285
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,429
How about you don't let Doi-san and Rin-chan cling to you?

286
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,560
Okay, got it.

287
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,420
Do you get jealous, Amagi?

288
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,559
- Hey.
- Geez, let's just get going.

289
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,180
He might look troubled.

290
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,989
He might find me annoying.

291
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,450
I was so worried about such things.

292
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,240
But Takara smiles so wholeheartedly

293
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,410
that I went beyond being happy

294
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,190
and got a little annoyed.

295
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,219
You're radiating happiness from your whole body.

296
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:04,059
My heart is as clear as the sky.

297
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,760
That's great.

298
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:15,229
Hey, I asked the person I like about kindness.

299
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,019
Oh, okay?

300
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,670
And it seems like it is for yourself.

301
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,430
What he does for himself is done for my sake.

302
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,769
For yourself?

303
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,510
Of course, it is.

304
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,379
The absolute condition of my happiness is

305
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,900
that you have to be happy.

Amagi has changed.

316
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,969
It's my fault for expecting it.

317
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,079
It's a bit awkward.

I wasn't able to say a word.

Don't run away when talked to.

320
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,049
The one who should apologize for everything is me,

321
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:59,963
since I'm falling for Takara even more.
