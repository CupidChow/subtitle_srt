You two look so good together.

We do?

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,659
Are you two really not going to date?

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,839
- We are not.
- No.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,429
- Really?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:24,429
The guys from Class D wanted us to check.

7
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:27,119
Then tell them we are dating.

8

I bet you have chemistry.

12
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:38,079
Well, he rejected me twice and did it with me three times.

14

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,699
Thanks for the other day.

20
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,279
No, it was nothing.

21
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,529
I personally came over to say thanks.

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,730
I appreciate it, so you can go now.

23

Hey, hold on.

28

How did you get close to the student council president?

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,539

He said "really like" and "someone important."

59
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,629
Could it be that he was talking about me?

60
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,819
Maybe he was talking about me.

61

Excuse me?

Wait...

65
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,909
He said he wouldn't get excited because I'm a guy,

66
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,180
so I let my guard down.

67

He's totally going to eat Amagi up.

This isn't what he implied.

69

He's 10 times more aggressive than I thought.

What is this? He's ignoring my human rights just for fun.

No way, he rejected me.

I haven't been rejected like that since middle school.

The third mission:

tell Takara in a causal manner

153
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:58,820
that shaking off his hand wasn't because I dislike him.

Actually,

169
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,130
I'll wait another twenty minutes.

170
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,819
"The traveler moves forward in the morning moon."

171
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,619
"What a beautiful song."

172
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,687
"You flatter me, he laughs."

173
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,679
"But it was too wonderful to ignore."

174
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,419
Okay, that's all for today.

175
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,709
Let's end class here.

176
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

177
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,719
Are you avoiding Amagi?

178
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,339
Nice to meet you.

179
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,699
What? Did you lose your memory?

180
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,649
I tried to forget bad memories and failed.

181
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,159
So I forgot everything related to them, too.

182
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,099
Oh, I saved your life.

183
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,140
Please try to remember.

184
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,329
I think I lent you some money.

185
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,420
What are you saying?

186
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,289
The day a cheery man extorts people for money.

187
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,250
Peace.

188
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,829
I'm sending this to Amagi.

189
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,570
Hold it.

190
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm not avoiding him.

191
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,850
I just feel a bit awkward.

192
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,979
I don't know what happened,

193
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:56,309
but did talking to him worsen the situation?

194
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,990
No, I haven't talked to him at all.

195
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm too scared.

196
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,900
Yesterday, you were talking to two girls in the science lab, right?

197
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,550
Well...

198
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,279
Maybe.

199
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,969
I don't remember.

200
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:29,420
Amagi and I were watching you from our classroom.

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,720
Were you?

202
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,780
I think he was probably waiting for you.

203
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,040
Was he?

204
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,900
So he couldn't go home with you, after all.

205
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,890
I think he waited for a long time.

206
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,889
Whoa, Zakki is a pupa now!

207
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,800
Is he getting any oxygen?

208
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,310
He's not responding! Is he alive?

209
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,270
He looked like an abandoned puppy.

210
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,810
If he tries to talk to you, don't run.

211
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,150
Just listen to what he has to say.

212
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,260
That won't be so scary.

213
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,550
Amagi-kun!

214
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,950
Switch!

215
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,499
Amagi-kun, you are spacing out too much.

216
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:07,740
Oh, sorry.

217
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,449
You are slow, dumb, and mess up when it matters.

218
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,919
You are hopeless.

219
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,750
What?

220
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,820
I've had it up to here with you.

221
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,699
But what I really want is a passionate kiss.

222
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,279
Wh-What the heck?

223
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,839
- Ouch!
- Move over.

224
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,299
That hurt, you know.

225
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,869
There's no time for a passionate kiss.

226
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:35,049
It's your turn. You're up next.

227
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,819
Oh, seriously?

228
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,039
You are too promiscuous.

229
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,899
No, I've narrowed it down to guys that don't smell.

230
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:44,189
Whatever. Just go turn the tables.

231
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,109
If you miss even once, beg Amagi for forgiveness.

232
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,419
You are so strict.

233
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,040
I will do my best.

234
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,399
Thanks...

235
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,850
You are lucky I was watching. You're welcome.

236
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,000
Um...

237
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,390
I want to leave school with you today.

238
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,800
Sure.

239
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,969
Nice assist, Katori.

240
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:23,519
- Katori, watch out!
- Hm?

241
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,059
I'm the one who rejected his kiss.

242
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,820
And I'm the guilty one if he loses affection toward me.

243
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,590
I'm the one who needs to apologize for everything...

244
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm here.

245
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,880
Takara.

246
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,339
Did we break up?

247
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,579
No, we haven't.

248
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,860
And I'm not planning to.

249
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,640
I was the one who got jealous.

250
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,520
Sorry I treated you so coldly.

251
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,360
Do you like me?

252
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,490
I like you.

253
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,480
Were you trying to make up with me?

254
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
Well?

255
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,420
I was.

256
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,380
We both were.

257
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,820
No matter what he does,

258
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,690
there's no way I would ever hate him.

259
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,739
Well, you see...

260
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:12,199
I'm sorry about everything.

261
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:15,440
Don't be. It's my fault, too.

262
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,140
You've changed, Amagi-san.

263
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,689
What?

264
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,850
If it were the old you, you would just fade away.

265
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,460
You were amazing this time.

266
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,600
You came to me without running away.

267
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,490
Thanks.

268
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,479
What? Well, I was the one in the wrong.

269
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,940
Really?

270
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,779
You are so cute.

271
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm touched.

272
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,700
Takara.

273
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,760
There's one more thing I wanted to say.

274
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,930
Yeah?

275
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,269
I'm more nervous now than when we first started dating.

276
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:14,790
It's probably...

277
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,390
because I'm falling in love with you

278
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,250
more and more, I think.

279
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,250
Or something like that!

280
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,829
Get used to it now.

281
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:38,949
What are you saying?

282
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:40,699
Get used to it.

283
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,139
If that's what you want,

284
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,999
God will without a doubt reach his hand out to save you.

285
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,309
Hold on.

286
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:49,089
The difference between being reckless and adventurous is...

287
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,040
Wait...

288
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,530

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,360
Amagi has been bullied since this morning.

299
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,969
I let my guard down. Sorry.

300
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:53,140
Let me try it just once.

301
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,649
I will trick him.

302
00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,010
Is this for real?
