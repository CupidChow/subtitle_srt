Your enthusiasm is quite annoying early in the morning, as always.

Sorry, but it's your fault for having low blood pressure.

There is something in your hair.

Isn't this dog hair? Do you have one at home?

7
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:30,139
It's... because I pet a dog on my walk earlier.

Cute. Okay then.

I'm completely lost.

And you, Katori?

I'm fine as long as I'm a respectable adult,

so I'm applying to a few public universities.

Keep up your minimal efforts until your last breath, okay?

We've been together since first grade,

Your forehead is kind of red, isn't it?

You'd get mobbed by penguins during feeding time.

Don't worry. As for me, I haven't decided on my future yet.

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,020
You've been ditching us a lot.

168
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,860
Takara, come with me for a second.

169
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,720
What's wrong?

170
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,219
See? It's not okay.

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,180
Oh, they're just joking.

172
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,500
Don't worry about it.

173
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,830
Seriously, what is it?

174
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,100
What's the matter?

175
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,040
At this rate, you'll end up alone.

176
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,540
I...

177
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,590
want you to be happy.

178
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,330
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

179
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,950
Can I really depend on Takara's kindness like this?

180
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,330
Say something.

181
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,290
How many people in your lifetime

182
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,240
would listen to your self-indulgent requests?

183
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,250
Right now, it's just you, Katori.

184
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,200
I didn't know that.

185
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,520
Well, we are kindred spirits.

186
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,049
Here's what I think.

187
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,409
Living self-indulgently means you are just being honest with yourself.

188
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,999
You are not acting selfishly.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,210
So is your self-indulgence

190
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,080
really a bother to the other person?

191
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,250
It's hard to tell on your own.

192
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,519
Is it really okay?

193
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,350
It's like I only think about myself.

194
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,590
It's hard to tell when that crosses over into selfishness.

195
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,340
Of course, I want to be with Takara, too.

196
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:13,340
But the only one who would find happiness is me.

197
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,420
It's rare to see you alone.

198
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,769
Let's have a nice chat.

199
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,179
I don't want to. Go away.

200
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,510
How unfortunate. It's about Amagi-kun, though.

201
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,019
- What?
- Wow, I really want to punch you.

202
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,239
It's annoying how defensive you get when it's about Amagi.

203
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,339
- Maybe I will tell everyone.
- No, they will realize how cute he is.

204
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,340
What's so cute about him?

205
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,140
Everything.

206
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,709
By the way, have you slept with him?

207
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,410
You can't just suddenly ask me that.

208
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,749
And he's not like that.

209
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,380
I will stab you, if you ask him that.

210
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,540
Oh, that's hilarious.

211
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,609
It's so hard watching you two misunderstand each other.

212
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,900
He will just get harder to deal with if you leave it like this.

213
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,799
Just shower him with love before he goes crazy.

214
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,960
It's already too late.

215
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,080
He's already going crazy.

216
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,360
Huh? What do you mean?

217
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,930
Oh.

218
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,949
I never would have guessed.

219
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:33,599
Did you know about it all along, Katori?

220
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,829
Well, yes, for some reason.

221
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,819
I totally thought I screwed up.

222
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,839
I was ready to "harakiri" in front of Takara.

223
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,300
It didn't seem like that to me.

224
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,360
But I guess you'd figure it out if you thought about it.

225
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,280
I guess. And I overheard you.

226
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,679
Brute force doesn't seem right.

227
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,539
Words won't work on that thick head of his.

228
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,799
Amagi-kun just needs to try it once.

229
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,240
- But...
- Katori.

230
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,090
It's fine.

231
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,090
I've already decided I won't rush him.

232
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,180
I'm going to treasure Amagi-san.

233
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,760
Why are you reporting that to him?

234
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,440
Are you Amagi's dad?

235
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,440
I'm his kindred spirit.

236
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,129
That's funny. All right.

237
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,830
Okay then.

238
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,289
Maybe shower him with love another time.

239
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,069
I never agreed to that.

240
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:44,079
But lately, Amagi's worried that Takara is being left out of the group.

241
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,479
Knowing him, he will probably decide to pull away.

242
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,139
So annoying.

243
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:53,509
Since he's so stubborn, maybe showering him with love is best.

244
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,169
You are a lost cause.

245
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,970
Are you really his dad?

246
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
Tanaka-shi.

247
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,020
Can we talk?

248
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,490
Yeah.

249
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,250
I have to do my homework at home.

250
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,539
Oh, I just remembered something.

251
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,440
Go without me.

252
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,850
What?

253
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,260
I need your advice on something.

254
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,490
I think they're in the science room.

255
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,379
Takara always watches over me since he's so nice.

256
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,529
He does his best to be with me.

257
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:17,279
But I don't want him to lose his friends because of that.

258
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,559
I'm sure he will end up alone at this rate.

259
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,569
So...

260
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,630
Stop messing around. I won't break up with you.

261
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,810
Ding ding! I'm tagging out.

262
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,399
Takara?

263
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,100
- How...
- I will never break up with you.

264
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,020
What? I know.

265
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:06,090
I just wanted to ask Tanaka-shi to be your ally.

266
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,920
What the hell?

267
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,339
Wait, but you talked about pulling away from me.

268
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,679
Oh, I thought about it.

269
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,920
But I don't think I can.

270
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,120
I want to be with you at least until we graduate.

271
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,609
Why until we graduate?

272
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,830
We can be together long-term.

273
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,090
Long-term?

274
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,720
Yeah, as in we will always be together.

275
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,930
Huh? What is going on?

276
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,580
Do I have to spell it out for you?

277
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,879
I just felt like I was being too self-indulgent.

278
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,680
What?

279
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,320
I want us to stay together. Is it okay to say that?

280
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,820
Just say it.

281
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,630
I'd be thrilled.

282
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,040
I was really scared that you'd say we should break up again.

283
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm really happy.

284
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,860
What? Who is that?

285
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Is it really okay?

286
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,099
We will be together forever.

287
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,659
Yeah. Sounds amazing.

288
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,790
I want to be with you forever.

289
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,030

Oh, my phone...

295
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,140
Did it crack?

296
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,179
It's fine.

297
00:21:58,179 --> 00:21:59,829
My head cracked, though.

298
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,990
Sorry about that.
