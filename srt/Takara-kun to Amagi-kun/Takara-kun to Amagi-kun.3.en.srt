You'd better catch it.

Are you ready?

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,069
Apparently, his mom isn't really in the hospital.

4
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:19,319
What? That means he lied about everything.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,679
Wasn't that why he's staying at his grandma's house?

6
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,549
I wonder why he doesn't live with his mom.

7
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:26,950
Right?

8
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,569
- Do you have plans for the three-day weekend?
- I'm going on a trip.

9
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:04,789
- That's nice.
- Right?

10
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,000
- To where?
- I'm going to Okinawa.

11
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,700
I hope the long weekend never comes.

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,570
You look so down. What's wrong?

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,530
All right, you can depend on me all you want.

[Episode 3]

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,529
What a refreshing morning!

25
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,580
Even the sun is on my side.

26
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,080
You act as if you just saved the world.

27
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,229
What about the evil three-day weekend?

28
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,979
Problem solved!

29
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:40,179
Oh, did you decide to go to your mom's house?

30
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:44,079
Nope. I'm staying over at Takara's.

31
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,270
My grandparents are going away on a trip

32
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,657
so I have to stay at my mom's place.

33
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,617
I already know it will be really awkward.

34
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,260
Your mom?

35
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,170
Yeah.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,179
We don't hate each other or anything,

37
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,110
but there is nothing to talk about.

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,550
Hey, do you want to come to my house?

39
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:23,643
What?

40
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,659
You can just escape to my place.

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,400
I can lend you my clothes too.

42
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,469
Can I?

43
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,870
Yes.

44
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,630
That would be...

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,660
You are my savior!

46
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,909
Wow, that's great.

47
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,210
Yeah.

48
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,530
What is it?

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,960
You and Takara are surprisingly close.

50
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,000
Takara really seems to like you.

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,249
Well... we're on the same committee, so we naturally became friends.

52
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:11,019
He's just offering a place to sleep.

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,189
Oh, I see.

54
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,509
What?

55
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,790
Now I get it.

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,689
It's nice how easy you are to read sometimes.

57
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:23,799
What?

58
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:27,429
By the way, do any of his family members live there?

59
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,849
Yeah, but they work nights or are at camp.

60
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,810
I probably won't see them.

61
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,699
I'm not saying this out of my wicked curiosity.

62
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,419
You can always talk to me.

63
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,699
I will be your ally as well as I can.

64
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,690
What are you talking about?

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,339
I have no plans for the long weekend.

66
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,299
Why did you reject them all?

67
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,259
- There was no love there.
- You'll say that your whole life.

68
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,309
And they totally misunderstand me.

69
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,369
Why am I only surrounded by annoying girls?

70
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:05,320
You're the bad one for giving them the wrong idea.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,469
Hey, they are nothing more than just friends.

72
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:12,029
Still, they think I'm acting shy.

73
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,265
Who am I, a virgin?

74
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,840
Guys who don't lay a hand on the ones they love are stupid. So delusional.

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,519
They say the same thing about you.

76
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,410
It makes no sense.

77
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,730
Yeah.

78
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,599
I don't think I will ever have another Friday as great as today.

79
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,579
Why are you smiling?

80
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,239
Because the sky is blue.

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,439
But the sun is going down soon.

82
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,959
Then it's because the stars are pretty.

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,690
It's too early for that.

84
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,200
Starting today, I will be at Takara's house

85
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,890

This desk doesn't match your image.

Of course, I'm so happy.

Well, that's fine.

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,779
You look like an elementary schooler who has never heard of a sweater.

169
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,630
Is it summer in here?

170
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,340
Your arms have a suntan.

171
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,419
It's from gym class. Don't make fun of me.

172
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,190
I'm not.

173
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,340
Yeah.

174
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,910
What is it?

175
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,210
It's proof you attend gym classes properly.

176
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,520
- Hey...
- I will check where your tan goes up to.

177
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,399
Wait, that's indecent.

178
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,090
How so?

179
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,780
Are you undressing me?

180
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,860
Yes.

181
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,400
Hey.

182
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,010
Should we do it?

183
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,740
Oh.

184
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,658
Do you not want to?

185
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,240
It's not... that I don't want to.

186
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,150
Um...

187
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,989
I'm sorry about this.

188
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:08,959
It's embarrassing to say, but I haven't done this before.

189
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,799
And I haven't studied up on it,

190
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,409
so I don't know much about this stuff.

191
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,180
Sorry.

192
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,150
So...

193
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,820
I want you to teach me what to do.

194
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,860
Then I will...

195
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,350
do my best at anything you say.

196
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,959
Sorry.

197
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,360
What?

198
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,260
I need a moment.

199
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,619
I was left alone. Someone tell me what just happened.

200
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,210
Did I mess something up again?

201
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,279
Was he put off by me?

202
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,680
Oh.

203
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,650
Let's...

204
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,320
not do it today.

205
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,630
I was really happy, but it is not something to "do your best" at.

206
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,130
And we don't have to rush it.

207
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Sorry for surprising you.

208
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,400
And thanks for not hating the idea.

209
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,130
Let's do it when we've calmed down.

210
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Of course, that goes for both of us.

211
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,820
Honestly, I was really relieved.

212
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,989
Hearing Takara's kind words,

213
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,060
I felt so sorry that I wanted to cry.

214
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,210
Of course, I don't hate it.

215
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,110
Don't get me all excited again.

216
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,879
I really like Takara,

217
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,190
but it's not convincing.

218
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,500
I avoid him a lot, and I feel like I'm just spinning my wheel.

219
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,120
I can't return his favor.

220
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,220
I wish I could do something that would make Takara happy.

221
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,109
- Are you okay sleeping in this bed?
- Sure.

222
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,380
Then you can sleep here.

223
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,220
Oh.

224
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,170
Thanks! Are you sleeping here, too?

225
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,160
Together?

226
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,479
I'll just sleep somewhere downstairs.

227
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:53,159
What? Why?

228
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,499
Then I can sleep somewhere else. The floor is fine too.

229
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:59,319
My parents would be angry if they found out.

230
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,809
They would think I stole the bed from their precious son.

231
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,350
No, they wouldn't.

232
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,079
You don't have to treat me so kindly.

233
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,959
No way.

234
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,530
Sorry for being spoiled.

235
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,199
Come wake me up in the morning.

236
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,469
No problem!

237
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:28,900
Then I will contact you when I wake up.

238
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,270
I thought I was waking you up.

239
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,119
Good night.

240
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,110
Wait, Takara.

241
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,250
I really like you.

242
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,820
See you tomorrow.

243
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,960
I'll like you tomorrow too.

244
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,270
Good night.

245
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,209
- Good night.
- Bye.

246
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,570
I keep messing up.

247
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:21,109
Please notice.

248
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:26,650
My feelings can be a burden, so I hope he only notices a tenth of it.

249
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,629
Hello, Tanaka?

250
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:08,409
Hey, what's up?

251
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,479
Sing me a lullaby.

252
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,089
Huh? That's weird.

253
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,029
I need a distraction, or I'll break the door down.

254
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,759
What? Can't you fall asleep?

255
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,329
Yeah, it's like...

256
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,839
I'll treasure this person.

257
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,329
I'll make this person the happiest in the world.

258
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,199
Sorry, I'll pass.

259
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,960
It's not you.

[Preview]
I thought I could act like nothing happened.

269
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,036
Dammit, he's so soothing.

270
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:52,528
This is not good.

271
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:55,579
Takara, you would even be cool if you weren't number one.

272
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,009
Meeting Amagi made my heart bloom like it was spring.
