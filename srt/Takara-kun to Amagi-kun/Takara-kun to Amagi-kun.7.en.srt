1
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,596
I don't know what to do.

2
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:27,306
You can't let your boyfriend stop you from hanging out.

3
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,549
Yeah, we're just friends. It will be fine.

4
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,296
Then how about tomorrow?

5
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:34,656
All right! We're going to hang out all night long!

6
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:36,542
Come on, I can't do that!

7
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,426
Don't worry about it!

8
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:40,186
Oh?

9
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:42,880

[Episode 7]

20
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,280
Same old Tanaka-shi...
(T/N: Shi is a highly formal name suffix used to address someone with high social status.)

21
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:47,179
He's been messing with me since morning.

22
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,115
But he didn't hit me where it hurts.

23
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:54,926
He was just laughing at me being flustered.

24
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,846
What is he thinking?

25
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:59,406
- Got you!
- Ah!

26
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,556
Well, well.

27
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:07,286
Huh? What is it?

28
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,657
Are you not going to say anything?

29
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,326
Did you just come to frighten me?

30
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,360
This is nothing but bullying.

31
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,980
Let's ignore him.

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,096
I slept on it, but couldn't think of anything.

33
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:45,200
It all started because you were being weird in the classroom.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,700
I didn't see anyone's bag, so I thought we were alone.

35
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,480
I let my guard down a little.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,366
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:02,340
It isn't a small matter.

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,932
Hypothetically speaking, what if he tells everyone in school,

39
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:14,216
and you end up losing your friends...

40
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:16,200
If that happens...

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,460
I'll take responsibility and fix this.

42
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,465
- I'm starving.
- Let's go.

43
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:50,134
- Where are we going?
- What should we eat?

44
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,006
Takara said he would take care of it, but I can't let Tanaka-shi run loose.

45
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:03,692
I should come up with excuses.

46
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,730
If we assume he didn't hear our conversation, we can...

47
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,316
So... what did you want to talk about?

48
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:18,697
Don't panic!

49
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,736
I can do this.

50
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:24,380
Hey, you don't look too good. Your face is pale.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,786
- I'm totally fine.
- No, go take a look in the mirror.

52
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,110
What? It's about yesterday, isn't it?

53
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,894
Tanaka-kun,

54
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,936
listen to me carefully.

55
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,380
I'm really into yoga.

56
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,790
Yoga.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,986
I started it to help with my posture.

58
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,990
Yeah, it's yoga.

59
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,036
And I was doing yoga with Takara yesterday,

60
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:12,210
but my body was really stiff,

61
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,894
so we were doing stretches.

62
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:20,540
Yes, I hope you don't misunderstand what you saw.

63
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,810
I don't believe your boring story.

64
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,510
Amagi-kun, I'm truly sorry.

65
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,456
What?

66
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:47,230
I'm not good at pretending to be deceived.

67
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,784
I can't believe this.

68
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,746
Why is the hallway all wet? It's like someone set a trap.

69
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:23,796
Someone must have spilled water from the art room and left it.

70
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:27,200
If I fell, I would have had his head.

71
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,336
You're actually pretty funny.

72
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:36,580
If you actually fell, I might have laughed myself to death.

73
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,416
Thanks for helping.

74
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:43,796
Not at all. Thank you for always helping with Amagi.

75
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:46,176
Hey, stop acting like his boyfriend.

76
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,010
I am his boyfriend.

77
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,096
Well, I'm glad. That's one problem solved.

78
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,440
What?

79
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,236
How could you be so stupid?

80
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:13,896
How did you end up doing that right after getting back together?

81
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:17,286
Your brain must be rotten to be this horny in the classroom.

82
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,626
He said something really cute, so I couldn't help myself.

83
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:25,300
Who cares if he said something cute?

84
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,585
How will you fix this?

85
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,576
Not only that, he happens to be the one who rules this school.

86
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:37,696
Tanaka, the one whose words can sway the will of the people.

87
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,169
Yeah, but so what?

88
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,169
You're hilarious. I'm going to tell Amagi.

89
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,316
Let me ask you, why aren't you worried about this?

90
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:49,410
I am worried.

91
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,216
But he is not taking any action right now,

92
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:58,666
so he'll forget soon enough if we ignore him.

93
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,956
No, he's been messing with Amagi since morning.

94
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,740
He has taken action.

95
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,676
Come on, just come clean, and you'll feel a lot better.

96
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:12,806
Huh? What do you mean?

97
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:16,476
What were you doing in our holy classroom?

98
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:18,856
We really weren't doing anything.

99
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:19,946
Nothing at all.

100
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:24,740
We weren't doing anything. I swear.

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,776
The expert in getting pinned down is a stubborn one.

102
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,366
Takara did it yesterday, and I'm doing it today.

103
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,026
No, Takara was doing yoga...

104
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,156
Fine, forget it.

105
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:38,148
Since we're getting nowhere, let's just say it's yoga.

106
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,326
Here's a catch.

107
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:41,950
What?

108
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,456
I just have one request.

109
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,796
A request from you?

110
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,320
Yeah.

111
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,756
I have a bad feeling about this,

112
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:59,240
but he may believe it was yoga, if I do one favor for him.

113
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,800
Well? Do we have a deal?

114
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,290
I need to know what it is first.

115
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,276
What? Hey, don't run away.

116
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:15,200
Let go of me.

117
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,786
I mean, you've let Takara do it, right?

118
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:19,966
Do what?

119
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,490
Stop playing dumb.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,110
I thought I could do it with anyone, but I wonder if that's the case.

121
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,960
Do you think I can?

122
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,996
What are you saying?

123
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:36,256
Just say what you mean.

124
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,480
Well...

125
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:44,366
I'll get straight to the point. Let me try─

126
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,490
Ouch.

127
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,796
You might hear me swearing,

128
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:52,940
so cover your ears and wait downstairs, Amagi.

129
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,186
- Don't get carried away.
- Back at you.

130
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,524
This is really uncomfortable.

131
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,200
I was surprised to learn that you would swing that way.

132
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,506
You've totally destroyed your devoted boyfriend image.

133
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,440
Shut up. Get up.

134
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,200
Oh, sorry about that.

135
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,410
I just don't want our girlfriends to find out about it or make an unnecessary fuss.

136
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,286
Don't get so serious.

137
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,900
I am serious.

138
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,300
Because the one I'm dating is Amagi.

139
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,246
Say what?

140
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:52,883
You're... dating?

141
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,553
Weren't you just trying it out?

142
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,256
Amagi, you have dog hair on your sweater.

143
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,316
Oh, you're right.

144
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:46,446
But you don't have a dog.

145
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:49,646
I petted one on my way to school today.

146
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:51,146
I see.

147
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:52,816
And I'm petting Amagi now.

148
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:57,416
- Annoying. Get off, Zakki.
- That's embarrassing.

149
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,236
Hey, Takara, are you listening to me?

150
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:00,916
Yeah, I see.

151
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,910
That response means he totally isn't listening.

152
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,670
Are you serious?

153
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,020
What the heck is he doing?

154
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,660
Get the ball! Come on.

155
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,470
Get the ball.

156
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,880
Come on. Hustle, hustle.

157
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,600
- Nice block!
- Nice block!

158
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,990
The lecture was too hard to understand, so I slept through it.

159
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,080
Hello.

160
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,406
Isn't it cold being on the bench during gym class?

161
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:33,066
Don't worry about us.

162
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,180
Our hearts are warm.

163
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,810
Well, the players are always the same, so we're getting kind of bored.

164
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,890
Should we go to the kiosk?

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,340
And we lost to Class C three times in a row.

166
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,100
It should be a busy time for the kiosk.

167
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,246
So, um...

168
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,876
I'll play.

169
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,500
What?

170
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,942
Hey, don't forget to have some Class A pride.

171
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,436
How boring.

172
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:04,466
I guess I'll play if Takara is playing.

173
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,606
Me, too.

174

Really?

175
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,130
All right, let's show Class C what real soccer is like.

Let's switch.

177

Thank you very mucho.

I'm so bad with my sleeve buttons.

183
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:52,565
I just can't get them to button up. So frustrating.

- That sucks.

221

We're land creatures, so why do we have to enter the water?

222
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:38,726
Maybe it's to leave our aquatic genes for future generations?

223
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,766
So humans can go back to living in the water?

224
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:46,410
It's a burial option. We get fins and do butterfly strokes.

- A burial option?

- I sure can.

- About fifty meters.

Did you give your button to a girl like an idiot?

243

Are you an idiot for realizing this morning you're wearing your middle school uniform to the orientation?

Damn, what a relief.

It's weird that we're sitting next to each other.

I know, right?

248
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,476
Why do I have to sit behind an idiot?

249
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:51,106
Shut up, Idiot. This is my seat.

250
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,056
I want to transfer schools already.

251

256
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,850
Because of that, people thought we were from the same middle school.

257

He's an idiot, and everyone sees us as a pair.

It was hilarious when I heard the reason why Takara broke up with her.

260
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:27,346
She cheated on him, right? That's crazy.

261
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:29,646
To be honest, he deserved it.

262
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,396
I didn't get why he was so popular. It's fair enough.

263

Those two really love badmouthing people.

I could never tell if you were really okay or just pretending.

I'd laugh when you said things that'd usually turn me away.

275

Did you get to explain it to him?

Not really. He didn't really give me a chance to.
