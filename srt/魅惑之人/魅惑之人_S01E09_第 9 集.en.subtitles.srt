00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,006
EPISODE 9

3
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,004
How come I never realized
that you are a woman?

4
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,681
I only had eyes for you
and wanted you from the outset.

5
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,533
Goodness.

6
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,953
Why are you running away
when you are here to see me?

7
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,996
Here.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,415
Oh, that is cold!

9
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,021
I finally understand…

10
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,652
why my heart was torn into pieces

11
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,117
after sending you to your death.

12
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,250
Return this stone…

13
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,129
to its original spot.

14
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,263
Convey these words to Mongwoo.

15
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,059
"There is absolutely no meaning…

16
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,146
behind saving you."

17
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,858
"Our bond

18
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,818
has been severed

19
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,281
and my regrets have faded away.

20
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,828
I wish you a peaceful life."

21
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,585
Go this instant.

22
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,047
What do you mean Mongwoo disappeared?

23
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,632
After Courtesan Hongjang died,

24
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,260
he ran away in shock,
only to end up falling off a cliff.

25
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,678
However, his whereabouts are unclear.

26
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,639
According to the patrolmen,

27
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,225
a tiger probably took him.

28
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,309
Shut your mouth.

29
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,773
That cannot be.

30
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,112
Order the men
to find Mongwoo this instant.

31
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,155
Respectfully,

32
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,533
I have already searched
the cliff he fell from

33
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,285
and even every corner of the area.

34
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,537
Yet, I still could not
find a trace of him.

35
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,207
It is for certain

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,167
that Mongwoo has died.

37
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,841
No…

38
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,785
Your Majesty.

39
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,871
Your Majesty.

40
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,041
Do not touch me.

41
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,673
I truly do not understand, Your Majesty.

42
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,385
What could he have meant to you
for you to suffer so?

43
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,598
He…

44
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,729
was my left-hand man.

45
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,946
My left hand that I had to cut off
to ascend to the throne.

46
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,742
You should be careful too.

47
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,996
You never know
when I might cut off my remaining hand.

48
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,831
Back then,

49
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,168
the royal physician

50
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,629
who claimed to have treated the wound
on your back was lying.

51
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,219
I would have gotten caught
if I were treated.

52
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,390
And as getting caught
would only lead to death,

53
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,517
I desperately pleaded with him.

54
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,019
If you are intending to punish him,

55
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,730
please punish me instead.

56
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,713
You have deceived me on all counts.

57
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,096
Was there any truth

58
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,100
to your words to me so far?

59
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,440
If you order me to answer,

60
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,401
I shall do so, Your Majesty.

61
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,404
I will not…

62
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,743
ask any questions of you.

63
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,831
I will not ask what your real name is,

64
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,213
why you are disguising yourself as a man,

65
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,840
or what you have done
and where you have been…

66
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,969
for the past three years

67
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,433
to finally return before my eyes
to drive me into madness.

68
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,568
Since long ago,

69
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,656
without my conscious knowledge,

70
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,910
I have fallen in love with you,

71
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,788
and you have felt the same way.

72
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,923
For now, this is enough.

73
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,796
I will not bed you…

74
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,467
nor dismiss you from my quarters.

75
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,553
Your Majesty.

76
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,763
You cannot be crueler than this.

77
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,684
How could you ask me
to endure such indignity?

78
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,519
I, too, am enduring one.

79
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,357
You must endure as well.

80
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,986
That is a royal command.

81
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,390
My lord.

82
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,600
A letter arrived from the palace.

83
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,613
His Majesty did not bed
Senior Court Lady Dong

84
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,532
and left the palace instead.

85
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,208
I thought he would at least
pretend to bed her.

86
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,007
His Majesty's affection
for the gidaeryeong

87
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,801
must run deeper than we expected.

88
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,395
This consummation
was clearly set out to fail.

89
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,231
As the court forced this on him,

90
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,483
it was only natural
for His Majesty to run away.

91
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,152
The court did insist,

92
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,654
but it was Her Royal Highness's wish.

93
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,738
So what?

94
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,199
Would you take your life
should she insist?

95
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,162
Great Lord!

96
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,873
Please do mind your tone
to the Chief State Councilor!

97
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,541
I am holding back.

98
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,501
Do you really want to see the worst?

99
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,586
Great Lord.

100
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,050
The Border Defense Council
has gathered here

101
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,970
to discuss important state matters
on His Majesty's behalf.

102
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,973
If you cannot keep your temper
under control, go home and rest.

103
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,475
I apologize, Lord Park.

104
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,562
I was over the line.

105
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,737
It has been over a month

106
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,323
since we have received word
that the Qing's envoy

107
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,825
has reached Paju.

108
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,621
They are inspecting various areas
under the pretense of sightseeing.

109
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,750
A recent report requested
an immediate dispatch of an envoy escort,

110
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,793
citing financial burden

111
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,964
as the envoy's party spends at least
1,000 nyang in silver for each feast.

112
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,091
An envoy escort?

113
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,093
If we send a nobody,

114
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,346
they may feign dissatisfaction

115
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,640
and threaten to return to the Qing.

116
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,184
Podan, the chief envoy,

117
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,978
is not the type
to cause trouble without reason.

118
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,480
However,

119
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,816
Jung Je-pyo, the vice envoy, is different.

120
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,109
Then who do you suggest

121
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,862
to send as an envoy escort?

122
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,831
Why are you all looking at me?

123
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,583
The title may sound grand,

124
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,710
but the post only exists
to serve Jung Je-pyo.

125
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,963
Now that he has been
promoted to vice envoy,

126
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,339
he will expect more compensation.

127
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,801
I am sick and tired of pouring money
into a bottomless pit.

128
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,387
I will have you know
that my fortune is not unlimited.

129
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,723
If you refuse, we will not force you.

130
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,810
There are many others
who are willing to supply funds.

131
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,188
Is that so?

132
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,359
The Royal Treasury's funds cannot be used
without His Majesty's permission.

133
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,819
Who in their right mind

134
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,822
would bear such a huge expense
other than me?

135
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,323
Let him in.

136
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,799
Podan carries a letter declaring
the Emperor's ascent to the throne.

137
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,926
The envoy escort
should at least be a full minister!

138
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,887
The Third Minister of Rites is too lowly!

139
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,931
Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo and I

140
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,977
are old acquaintances who get along well.

141
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,273
I am confident that I can escort them
to the capital in a few days.

142
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,650
Please entrust me with this task.

143
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,822
Those of you who are against sending him,

144
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,740
raise your hands.

145
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,541
Except for one vote,
we are all in agreement

146
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,294
to send Yoo Hyun-bo as the envoy escort.

147
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,426
His Majesty will not approve of this.

148
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,929
I shall secure his approval,

149
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,096
so you need not worry.

150
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,517
I will not forget
the generosity and the trust

151
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,645
you have shown me today.

152
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,893
Is anyone outside?

153
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,064
Have you woken up, Your Majesty?

154
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,816
I will return to the palace.

155
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,734
Get ready.

156
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,235
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,732
Sang-hwa, you will remain here

158
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,068
and convey my command
when the gidaeryeong awakes.

159
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,778
Please speak.

160
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,823
"As you evaded my men
and intoxicated yourself last night,

161
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,951
thereby abandoning your duties,
your crime is grave."

162
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,871
"You are not to come to the palace
for the time being

163
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,083
and to await my orders
while confined to your lodgings."

164
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,045
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will convey your command.

165
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,216
That cannot be
for your father's court robe.

166
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,676
Why are you embroidering it?

167
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,928
This is for Hongjang.

168
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,265
She has taken good care of me,

169
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,684
but I have never returned her kindness.

170
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,612
My lady.

171
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,572
Your father is home.

172
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
Father.

173
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,693
Hee-soo.

174
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,198
Is it that you dislike marriage
or Kim Myung-ha?

175
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,992
I will get married.

176
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,494
When I find the right man, that is.

177
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
You mean someone
who can beat you at baduk?

178
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,832
What if he is a white-haired sage?

179
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,168
If that is my fate,

180
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,963
I must accept it.

181
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,802
Well, that is troublesome.

182
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,356
I am traveling under a royal command.

183
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,317
As a criminal.

184
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,530
I will return safely

185
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,574
like I always have.

186
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,245
Father…

187
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,789
My dear.

188
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,295
You must also

189
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,131
stay safe and sound.

190
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,175
Do you understand?

191
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,438
You look as if you have seen a ghost.

192
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,699
When one encounters the fearsome captain
of the Special Firearms Unit,

193
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,285
anyone would be surprised.

194
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,872
I have a royal command for you.

195
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,503
Please speak.

196
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,005
You are not to come to the palace

197
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,673
and stay confined to your lodgings.

198
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,763
If I am to stay confined,
that means he has given me a punishment.

199
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,265
May I ask the reason?

200
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,393
The crime of neglecting your duties
due to intoxication.

201
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,441
An incident like last night
cannot reoccur.

202
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,320
While serving your penalty,
you are not to leave the premises.

203
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,238
Do you understand me?

204
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,368
I shall do as you say.

205
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,709
My lady!

206
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,670
My lady!

207
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,630
Goodness.

208
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,342
Gosh, you startled me.
My heart almost skipped a beat.

209
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,760
Is Lady Hee-soo not here?

210
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,097
She did not stay with you last night?

211
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,557
What are you saying?

212
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,392
Lady Hee-soo stayed out last night?

213
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,021
What if she was taken
by the patrol troops overnight?

214
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,191
If that were the case,
she would have sent word in the morning.

215
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,152
I guess she would have.

216
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,863
This is the first time she has disappeared
since three years ago.

217
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,782
Wait, where is Master Chu?

218
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,578
He left upon paru to see Master Choam.

219
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,620
PARU: THE CURFEW LIFT BELL

220
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,998
I will go wait outside the palace
just in case.

221
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,667
-What in the world…
-My goodness.

222
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,918
My la…

223
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,258
-My lord!
-Gosh, my lord!

224
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,927
Goodness, my lord.

225
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,929
We were worried sick about you.

226
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,849
Where have you been all night?

227
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,560
I apologize for worrying you.

228
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,228
Things happened.

229
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,814
You should come in and rest.

230
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,776
I will prepare breakfast.

231
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,069
-Go ahead.
-All right.

232
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,071
My goodness.

233
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,699
I will leave you to rest, my lord.

234
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,536
Goodness.

235
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,465
Are you so bent on being the death of me?

236
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,134
Seriously, are you doing this
to drive me crazy?

237
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,224
It does not seem like
you spent the night outside.

238
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,684
Tell me, where did you spend the night?

239
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,407
My lady, this is…

240
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,285
I went to my house.

241
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,916
For what reason, all of a sudden?

242
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,627
You told me
not to even look in that direction

243
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,171
in case we run into someone we know.

244
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,133
You must be deeply distressed.

245
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,264
You should have told me
if you wanted to go visit.

246
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,902
Stay here and rest.

247
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,487
I will bring your breakfast soon.

248
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,155
We should hurry before you are late.

249
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,117
I cannot go to the palace
for the time being.

250
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,870
I have been ordered to stay confined.

251
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,123
What?

252
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,250
Confinement?

253
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,085
Is that not a punishment?

254
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,504
What could they possibly punish you for?

255
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,422
What happened?

256
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,756
Tell me the reason.

257
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,387
Goodness.

258
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,891
Did the King become enraged
over the rumors of his attraction to men

259
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,186
that delighted Jeomine so much?

260
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,230
What do we do?

261
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,857
The Qing's envoy will arrive soon.

262
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,698
Let us not worry too much, my lady.

263
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,159
They say you can always

264
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,120
find a way out of a tiger's den
if only you pull yourself together.

265
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,664
I am sure some other means will come up.

266
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,666
It is not that.

267
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,129
Then what is the reason?

268
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,260
Why? What is it?

269
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,183
The King has found out…

270
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,270
that I am a woman.

271
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,333
Senior Court Lady Dong is missing.

272
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,088
Actually, due to the incident yesterday,

273
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,507
she has fallen ill and feverish.

274
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,302
I ordered her
not to come to serve you today.

275
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,561
I must see Court Lady Dong.

276
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,271
Go summon her.

277
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,237
Why are you standing around?

278
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,613
I ordered you to summon her.

279
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,282
I beg for your pardon.

280
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,328
Your Majesty!

281
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,497
Please take my life!

282
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,584
Did the Queen Dowager command it?

283
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,636
Where is Court Lady Dong?

284
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,097
Drag her out.

285
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,267
If you value your lives,

286
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,310
step back.

287
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,562
You wench!

288
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,606
How dare you disobey
Her Royal Highness's order?

289
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,442
As I serve His Majesty,

290
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,277
I will only take orders from him.

291
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,779
His Majesty's orders?

292
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,324
No one will fall for that now.

293
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,035
Your lies were uncovered
due to yesterday's event.

294
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,662
How dare you act high and mighty?

295
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,706
What are you waiting for?

296
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,166
Drag her out this moment!

297
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,208
If any one of you

298
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,294
dares to lay a finger on me,

299
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,172
I shall make a request to His Majesty

300
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:22,177
to have every limb of your body severed,
starting with those fingers.

301
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,980
Why are you having so much trouble
dragging out a mere court lady?

302
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,024
My apologies.

303
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,069
She put up a fight
with such a vicious attitude.

304
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,447
It was impossible to lay a finger on her.

305
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,909
Order the adjunct overseers
to expel her from the palace.

306
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,244
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

307
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,832
Your Royal Highness, His Majesty is here.

308
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,044
Let him in.

309
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,019
I hope you had
a comfortable night, Mother.

310
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,524
I did indeed, Your Majesty.

311
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,121
Mother.

312
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,291
I am thinking of bestowing

313
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,170
the former First Senior Consort's abode
on Senior Court Lady Dong.

314
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,713
What do you think?

315
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,636
Your Majesty.

316
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,683
For what reason are you allowing her
to have her own place?

317
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,934
From what I heard,

318
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,187
you and she did not even
consummate your union.

319
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:00,441
Such an event is a mere formality.

320
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,486
She has served me for long

321
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,072
and will continue to do so in the future.

322
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,408
It is only right for her
to have her own place.

323
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,661
If Court Lady Dong wishes for it,

324
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,372
I will appoint her as a concubine as well.

325
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,792
That is ridiculous.

326
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,212
You should not allow her
a personal residence either.

327
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,174
Why do you disapprove of it?

328
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,344
Did you not want her to bear my son?

329
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,015
I am only trying to honor
you and the court's wishes.

330
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,767
Are you trying to mock me?

331
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,313
As the feeble Queen
could not bear you an heir,

332
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,939
I approved of the consummation

333
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,985
in tears and heartbreak
only to secure an heir to your bloodline.

334
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,654
Forgive me,

335
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,657
but the feeble one is not the Queen

336
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,868
but me.

337
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,621
We should not be so greedy.

338
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,040
How could a bud sprout

339
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,208
when no seed has been sown in the field?

340
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,543
Do you not agree, My Queen?

341
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,130
Mind your words, Your Majesty!

342
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,801
Look at her.

343
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,011
How pathetic.

344
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,973
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

345
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,394
No man can understand heaven's will

346
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,522
as no child can ever fathom
their mother's heart.

347
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,483
I do not want to see any of you.

348
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,610
Everyone, leave this moment!

349
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,822
Your Royal Highness,
I am to blame for this.

350
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,201
Please do not be upset and forgive us.

351
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,536
-Please forgive us, Your Royal Highness.
-Please forgive us, Your Royal Highness.

352
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,756
Mother.

353
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,218
I shall excuse myself
as I have matters of state to tend to.

354
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,224
Your Majesty.

355
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,499
Your Majesty.

356
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,462
You have my approval

357
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,589
to skip today's greetings
and return to your quarters.

358
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,216
Pardon?

359
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,426
For what reason…

360
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,803
Forgive me for saying this,

361
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,807
but I have learned
that a greeting is not to be skipped

362
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,934
as it goes against the etiquette

363
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,229
and is deemed a failure of filial duty.

364
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,023
Has the Queen Dowager taught you that

365
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,816
whenever I skipped my greetings?

366
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,153
Yes.

367
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,830
The Queen Dowager is deeply upset,
even more so than ever.

368
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,999
Do you think you can handle it?

369
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,959
Living in the palace,

370
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,837
at times, I must carry out duties
that I do not desire.

371
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,216
Also, such are things
I cannot entirely avoid.

372
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,136
Her fury finds itself back to me
in the end.

373
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,142
I have learned a lesson from you,
Grand Prince Munseong.

374
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,436
Make sure you greet her properly

375
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,522
and return to your duties.

376
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,783
Lord Park!

377
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,370
Do you not know
what His Majesty thinks of Yoo Hyun-bo?

378
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,082
He will not approve of
this recommendation.

379
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,293
His Majesty will approve of
the Border Defense Council's decision.

380
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,297
If he wishes to keep Gidaeryeong Kang
at Yeongchwijeong, that is.

381
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,674
What do you mean by that?

382
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,232
I have brought
what you have asked for, Lord Park.

383
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,568
These are the petitions seeking
an immediate removal of the gidaeryeong.

384
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,780
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo…

385
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,867
is indeed useful in many ways.

386
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,745
Do you not agree?

387
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,415
All right.

388
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,876
Let us go speak to His Majesty.

389
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,797
Lord Park.

390
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,842
I have an urgent matter to report.

391
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,385
Save it for later.

392
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,679
I am on my way
to make a request to His Majesty.

393
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,055
It concerns that very matter.

394
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,015
Last night,

395
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,977
His Majesty ordered the gidaeryeong
to be confined as a punishment.

396
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,987
He seemed to be so fond of him.

397
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,992
His Majesty would not expel
Kang Mong-woo like this, would he?

398
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,120
Who knows?

399
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,082
He may just give out a royal command
to behead Kang Mong-woo tomorrow.

400
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,333
My goodness.

401
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,836
Do not say such an awful thing
even as a joke.

402
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,049
His Majesty

403
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,302
is more than capable of such things.

404
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,344
Do not tell me

405
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,724
you have already forgotten
how my father lost his life.

406
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,567
What shall we do about this?

407
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,959
Your Majesty.

408
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,005
May I truly take up my abode
in the concubines' quarters?

409
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,051
If you wish,
I will appoint you a concubine as well.

410
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,807
As Her Royal Highness

411
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,644
would never allow the appointment,

412
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,021
I will only accept the house.

413
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,023
As you wish.

414
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,067
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

415
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,944
Your Majesty.

416
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,196
The Principal Director
requests an audience.

417
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,489
What shall I do?

418
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,076
Let him in.

419
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,063
You must have heard about
what happened to the gidaeryeong.

420
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,108
What took you so long to seek an audience?

421
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,735
I merely seek

422
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,655
to report what was discussed
by the Border Defense Council

423
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,866
and to ask for your opinion on the matter.

424
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,493
However,

425
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,414
I shall speak of the gidaeryeong's matter
as you have mentioned it.

426
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,708
If I may be candid,

427
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,335
a part of me was hopeful.

428
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,297
As you have broken our promise,

429
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,466
I hoped that you would
adhere to my wishes this time.

430
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,010
However,

431
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,179
you punished the gidaeryeong
by ordering him to stay confined.

432
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,975
I did not expect you
to jump ahead and punish him

433
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,727
before I could speak with you.

434
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,604
I could not sit back and watch

435
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,606
when your next move was so obvious.

436
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,610
I warned you

437
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,280
when Prince Deokseong died, did I not?

438
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,577
That I would not hold back
should it happen again.

439
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,582
Have you forgotten already?

440
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,889
As the envoy escort
who will receive the Qing's envoy,

441
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,808
we seek to send
Yoo Hyun-bo, the Third Minister of Rites.

442
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,226
Please give us your approval.

443
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,072
He is not an appropriate candidate
as the envoy escort.

444
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,868
You are well aware of
the kind of man Jung Je-pyo is.

445
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:35,331
There is no one better than Yoo Hyun-bo
to handle a man like him.

446
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,751
Since when was Yoo Hyun-bo
such a capable man?

447
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,172
The Qing's envoy is visiting many areas
under the pretense of sightseeing,

448
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,091
looking for any opportunity to fault us.

449
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,760
It would be best to have them
at the capital as soon as possible

450
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,221
to receive the Emperor's letter
and send them back.

451
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,143
Your argument

452
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,771
has merit.

453
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,149
You have three days.

454
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,864
You may appoint Yoo Hyun-bo
as the envoy escort.

455
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,536
However, if the Qing's envoy
does not reach the capital in three days,

456
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,621
both Yoo Hyun-bo

457
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,999
and you, who recommended him,
shall be held responsible.

458
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,796
I also have a condition.

459
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,425
If the Qing's envoy
arrives in the said period,

460
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,511
please dismiss Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

461
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,180
and exile him from the capital.

462
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,897
Would you accept the terms?

463
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,584
I will pour my heart and soul

464
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,919
not to betray your trust in me, my lord.

465
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,381
You must confirm one matter
when you meet Jung Je-pyo.

466
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,592
Please speak.

467
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,721
See if there are other letters
other than the Emperor's letter.

468
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,932
By "other letters,"

469
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,394
whose letter might you be referring to?

470
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,605
Prince Rui's.

471
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,819
Confirm if Jung Je-pyo
has brought Prince Rui's letter first

472
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,530
before compensating him with the riches.

473
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,615
Do you understand?

474
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,617
Yes, my lord.

475
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,415
Move aside!

476
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,809
The Principal Director
must have lost all sense of propriety.

477
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,395
How dare he demand
such an absurd condition to His Majesty?

478
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,191
Yoo Hyun-bo would never be able to
escort the envoy here in three days.

479
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,444
I hope His Majesty
takes this chance to reform

480
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,196
the corrupt Border Defense Council.

481
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,615
Park Jong-hwan is His Majesty's uncle

482
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,450
and the Queen Dowager's
only family member.

483
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,286
I feel heavy at heart

484
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,123
that I seem to have gotten you
on his bad side needlessly.

485
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:28,170
I only deferred to him until now
for your sake, Your Majesty.

486
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,757
And how did he treat the both of us?

487
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,926
The Principal Director
must come to understand

488
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,346
that even he cannot
have his way in all matters.

489
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,894
Your Majesty.

490
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,605
Grand Prince Munseong
is here to greet you.

491
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,565
Let him in.

492
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,488
Welcome, Grand Prince.

493
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,462
It has been a while, Great Lord.

494
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,381
Your Highness.

495
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,384
It has indeed been a while
since the gisinje.

496
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,431
Had I known the Great Lord was here,
I would have visited you later.

497
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,599
There is no need.

498
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,310
The Great Lord was on his way out.

499
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,021
Is that not right?

500
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,105
Pardon?

501
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,316
Yes.

502
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,359
Please excuse me, Your Majesty.

503
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,361
Bring in the refreshments.

504
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,655
Your Majesty.

505
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,159
Would you like to take a walk
in the Royal Garden afterward?

506
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,370
The sky today
is exceptionally clear and blue.

507
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,623
Is that so?

508
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,874
Then we must go.

509
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,293
Please invite Princess Jangryeong as well.

510
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,128
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,851
Sixth Royal Secretary.

512
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,228
Yes, Your Majesty.

513
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,315
Have you made any progress
with the peach tree?

514
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,194
I acquired a compost
known to enhance soil fertility.

515
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,237
I am currently observing the tree
after scattering some.

516
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,291
Your Majesty.

517
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:37,341
What is the difference between
an act with knowledge and one without it?

518
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,598
Even done with knowledge,
an act is meaningless without virtue.

519
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,851
Even done in ignorance,
an act will see fruition

520
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,604
if it holds virtuous intent.

521
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,578
Have we not heard back from Kim Je-nam?

522
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,331
He seems to be uninterested
in a government post.

523
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,254
Dispatch a messenger
and have my wish conveyed clearly.

524
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,968
You may leave.

525
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,071
I will head to Yeongchwijeong.

526
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,156
Summon the…

527
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,036
Shall I summon the gidaeryeong?

528
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,248
I have misspoken.

529
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,416
There is no need.

530
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,964
Has there been any progress
on finding what was lost?

531
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,095
We have combed through the capital,

532
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,515
but we have not found anyone
who knows of or holds the item.

533
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,852
They will be sending word again soon.

534
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,605
I shall discuss it with them then
and find another way.

535
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,233
You must find it at all costs.

536
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,360
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,709
It has been a while, my lord.

538
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,045
Do you recognize me?

539
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,299
Has the gidaeryeong sent you?

540
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,551
Yes, my lord.

541
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,762
You have been called to an urgent meeting.

542
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,182
Lead the way.

543
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,226
I will follow you.

544
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,040
Have you decided to live as Kang Hee-soo?

545
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,753
I only dressed like this as a disguise.

546
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,339
I would be asking for trouble

547
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,466
to meet you while receiving my punishment

548
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,927
as Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

549
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,265
The King's refusal to consummate
and his order for your punishment

550
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,808
has the entire court in turmoil.

551
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,852
As they cannot fathom
the reason behind his actions,

552
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,646
they must be confused and frightened.

553
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,566
And you are not?

554
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,610
I, too, was afraid at first.

555
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,736
However,

556
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,365
the King's bet over you
with Principal Director Park Jong-hwan

557
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,575
changed my mind.

558
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,035
The King

559
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,956
seems to have placed you in confinement
to protect you.

560
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,835
What I do not understand

561
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,462
is the fact that he proposed
the three-day period first.

562
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,674
Yoo Hyun-bo will do his best
to make that happen.

563
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,761
Why did the King propose
a condition unfavorable to himself?

564
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,058
The King has set up a trap

565
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,227
that the Principal Director cannot avoid.

566
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,646
A trap?

567
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,857
What could he have up his sleeve
to set up one?

568
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,067
That much

569
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,236
is unknown to me.

570
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,867
I suggest we pretend
that our conversations did not take place.

571
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,537
My priority is the well-being
of Their Highnesses.

572
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,788
I came by to tell you that.

573
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,167
I understand your wishes, Lord Kim.

574
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,084
However,

575
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,212
I do not think we can pretend
they did not take place…

576
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,176
with the Qing's envoy on their way.

577
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,470
What do you mean?

578
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,139
What does the Qing's envoy
have to do with us?

579
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,224
If my assumption is correct,

580
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,313
a difficult ordeal
will be upon Their Highnesses.

581
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,582
I have returned, my lady.

582
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,880
I have heard about the confinement.

583
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,217
I should have waited
around the courtesan house

584
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,886
and brought you home, my lady.

585
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,138
It is in the past.

586
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,890
Tell me.

587
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,351
How is Master Choam doing?

588
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,312
He is doing well.

589
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,066
A court official was dispatched again
to convince him to take up a post.

590
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,902
He said he did not give them an answer.

591
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,658
Did you tell him not to refuse,
but to accept the offer next time?

592
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,451
He promised that he would.

593
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,246
However,

594
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,665
if Yoo Hyun-bo returns in three days

595
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,875
and the King does not summon you again,

596
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,627
what will you do?

597
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,717
Even with Kim Myung-ha's support
and Master Choam's return to the court,

598
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,594
what could possibly change?

599
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,723
What are you trying to say?

600
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,183
If your plan goes to shambles,

601
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,103
I will take the initiative

602
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,564
just as you promised me before.

603
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,027
Nothing is set in stone.

604
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,321
Even if I am dismissed,

605
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,533
I will not give up.

606
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,790
I truly wish that things turn out
the way you have planned.

607
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,076
Your Majesty,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

608
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,583
Your Majesty.

609
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,337
The Qing's chief envoy, Podan,
has arrived at Mohwa Guesthouse.

610
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,570
Your Majesty.

611
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,782
Please prepare to head out
to receive the Emperor's letter.

612
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,869
I do not think I will be able to go
as I am suddenly feeling ill.

613
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,998
Please go and receive the Emperor's letter
on my behalf, Uncle.

614
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,751
To my eye, you seem very hearty.

615
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,588
I am afraid that the envoy
might be enraged if I go in your stead.

616
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,550
If we hold a welcoming feast tonight

617
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,844
and relieve the exhaustion of the envoys,

618
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,513
there will not be a problem.

619
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,306
Your Majesty.

620
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,143
The three days we have promised
have not yet passed.

621
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,190
I hope you have not forgotten
the promise you made…

622
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,944
to dismiss and expel the gidaeryeong.

623
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,157
I have not.

624
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:45,036
Then I shall abide by your royal command.

625
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,142
We shall go to the Mohwa Guesthouse
to receive the envoy.

626
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,310
Get ready.

627
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,394
-Yes, Lord Park.
-Yes, Lord Park.

628
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,486
My lord, have you summoned me?

629
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,114
Immediately arrest
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

630
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,741
and bring him to the State Tribunal.

631
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,576
Yes, my lord.

632
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,579
Lord Park.

633
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,582
He is the Fourth Investigator
of the State Tribunal.

634
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,084
It is not like Kang Mong-woo
committed high treason.

635
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,133
The crime of disturbing the king's heart,
defiling the order of the court,

636
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,303
and weakening the people's hearts.

637
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,846
Tell me.

638
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,223
What are these crimes, if not treason?

639
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,237
The Principal Director is determined
to kill the gidaeryeong.

640
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,203
There is trouble, Myung-ha.

641
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:12,123
The Principal Director gave the order
to arrest Kang Mong-woo for high treason.

642
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,008
I must meet His Majesty immediately.

643
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,218
Please request an audience.

644
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,054
I have already told you that you cannot.

645
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,472
Please return.

646
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,933
Eunuch Kim.

647
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,686
How dare a royal secretary

648
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,896
behave so crudely
before His Majesty's quarters?

649
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,485
I apologize, but there is
an urgent matter I must inform him.

650
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,279
It is an important matter
that His Majesty must know about.

651
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,365
Is that matter
more important than the Qing's envoy?

652
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,245
Your important duty
is to prepare to receive the envoy.

653
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,288
Return to your post and get back to work.

654
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,290
Immediately!

655
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,803
Where are you going, my lady?

656
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,180
After being stuck here
for the last few days,

657
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,640
I feel suffocated.

658
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,517
I will go get some air.

659
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,603
Getting air, my foot.
You should be running away.

660
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,189
The Qing's envoy has arrived.

661
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,776
And where do you say we run to?

662
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,487
Are you sure we will not be caught?

663
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,239
Well…

664
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,158
It is better than waiting for the noose.

665
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,411
I will be back shortly.

666
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,039
My lady.

667
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,915
My lady.

668
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,934
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo?

669
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,853
That is me.

670
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,231
Arrest his man immediately.

671
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,149
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

672
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:06,946
My lord!

673
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,573
-Back off!
-Goodness.

674
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,657
Jageunnyeon.

675
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,037
These officers
are harming innocent people!

676
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,133
I shall follow you obediently.

677
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,135
Please refrain from needless violence.

678
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,638
Why are you standing about?

679
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,556
Arrest the criminal this instant.

680
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,557
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

681
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,202
I commend you for your efforts
in making such a long journey.

682
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,955
I was concerned
as I heard that you had fallen ill.

683
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,542
It is of much relief that you seem
to be feeling much better now.

684
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:28,129
It appears my concern for your ill health
was unnecessary.

685
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,384
As I felt bad for not being able
to receive the Emperor's letter myself,

686
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,427
I tried my best

687
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,388
to attend this feast at the least.

688
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,807
He has brought himself
to receive the letter.

689
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,726
I do speak Joseon's language.

690
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,313
Do not try to deceive me
and interpret properly.

691
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,774
I apologize. Please forgive me.

692
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,360
I hope the feast is to your liking.

693
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,323
I am rather disappointed.

694
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,243
I expected to see something better.

695
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,412
Something better?

696
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,042
Please tell me what you mean by it.
I shall have it brought here.

697
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,920
I heard of the gidaeryeong on my way here.

698
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:09,963
Word has it

699
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,465
that he is quite
an excellent baduk player.

700
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,511
Is that so?

701
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:22,267
Did you perchance forget
that I like baduk?

702
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,937
How shall I forget?

703
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,940
Our close friendship was formed

704
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:32,569
thanks to baduk games
all those years ago in Shenyang.

705
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,155
Right. That is true.

706
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,367
Where is the gidaeryeong?

707
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,160
Who is it…

708
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,705
among them?

709
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,416
The recent development
must not have reached you, Chief Envoy.

710
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,128
As the gidaeryeong was dismissed
and expelled from the capital,

711
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,546
he is not present here.

712
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,965
I beg for your understanding.

713
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:58,428
His Majesty can simply summon
the gidaeryeong back, can he not?

714
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,307
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

715
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,600
You are not wrong.

716
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,768
I shall summon him should you wish.

717
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,563
Your Majesty, that cannot happen.

718
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,025
You would be breaking the promise
you have made to me.

719
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,693
Is your petty promise so important

720
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,987
when we have our treasured guest to serve?

721
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,245
Are you attempting to humiliate me
before the Qing Emperor's envoy?

722
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,464
What I do not understand

723
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,133
is the fact that he proposed
the three-day period first.

724
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,385
The King has set up a trap

725
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,304
that the Principal Director cannot avoid.

726
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,014
A trap?

727
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,183
What could he have up his sleeve
to set up one?

728
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,143
That much

729
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,187
is unknown to me.

730
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,192
He had set up a trap

731
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,653
with the envoy up his sleeve.

732
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,365
Principal Director.

733
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,618
My apologies, Your Majesty.

734
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,080
Please forgive me for my discourtesy.

735
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,127
Hear my command.

736
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,174
Bring the gidaeryeong here.

737
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,555
He is young.

738
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,518
I thought he would be around my age.

739
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:58,649
Did you not mention
that you were a famed baduk prodigy

740
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,736
from a young age as well?

741
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,905
I played baduk before I walked.

742
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,618
I would like to play baduk
with the gidaeryeong this instant.

743
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,037
Would that be possible?

744
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,749
Your Majesty.

745
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,336
Would you allow me
to speak on this matter?

746
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,504
You may speak.

747
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,840
With all due respect to the envoy,

748
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,052
that man is a criminal
who was dismissed and expelled.

749
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,889
Your authority will be weakened
if you allow a criminal

750
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,266
to play baduk with the envoy
in front of everyone.

751
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,066
Your Majesty.

752
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,109
Might I propose another idea?

753
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:43,986
The gidaeryeong…

754
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,364
No, the criminal and I

755
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,199
will play a baduk with a bet.

756
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,159
If I win,

757
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,370
I shall decide his fate however I see fit.

758
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:53,955
If I lose,

759
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,124
the Principal Director
shall decide his fate.

760
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,629
How does that sound?

761
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,803
As you insist on playing with him,

762
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,973
I will not go against you
on this matter any further.

763
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:17,687
Your Majesty.

764
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,732
Mong-woo.

765
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,610
What do you say?

766
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,745
I would not refuse such a great honor

767
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,623
to play against the Emperor's subject.

768
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,461
All right.

769
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,006
Shall we begin?

770
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,724
Bring a baduk table and the stones.

771
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:40,079
CAPTIVATING THE KING

772
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,956
You are my gidaeryeong.

773
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,500
You must come running
whenever I summon you.

774
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,626
I have missed you.

775
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,796
How can you get revenge when you love him?

776
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:52,633
The King is my one and only family
before he is my lord.

777
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,802
We are bound by the heavens.

778
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,679
I implore you, Your Majesty.

779
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,348
Please do not command me
to marry Prince Rui.

780
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,183
I desired power.

781
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,854
I thought it was the only way
to protect those that I wished to protect.

782
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,605
Through this marriage,

783
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,025
I seek to plant a spy
in Prince Rui's inner circle.

784
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,568
Are you suggesting a substitution?

785
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:16,949
