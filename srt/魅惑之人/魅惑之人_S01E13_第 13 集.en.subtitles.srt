CAPTIVATING THE KING

00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,255
EPISODE 13

3
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,024
What is the matter?

4
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,828
You are trembling. What is wrong?

5
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,252
You cannot…

6
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,966
go inside.

7
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,559
Do you have another lover waiting inside?

8
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,275
Or…

9
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,032
is there an assassin hiding to kill me?

10
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,173
Since when have you caught on?

11
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,726
Why did you come…

12
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,231
when you knew everything?

13
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,691
Did I not promise…

14
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,529
that I shall

15
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,116
come running at your call?

16
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,605
Mong-woo.

17
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,275
Mong-woo!

18
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,201
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

19
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,078
Mong-woo.

20
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,164
My lady.

21
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,666
My lady!

22
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,670
No, Mong-woo.

23
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,882
"My lady"?

24
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,842
Mong-woo…

25
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,888
No, please.

26
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,849
You have to stay awake.

27
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,184
Mong-woo.

28
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,270
Mong-woo.

29
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,651
Mong-woo.

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,804
Your Majesty,
we are prepared to return to the palace.

31
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,805
Please give us your order.

32
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,932
Mong-woo's wound seems grave.

33
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,600
Bring Royal Physician Ji
and a female physician.

34
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,435
Your safety comes first.

35
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,814
Kang Mong-woo will be treated
after being taken to the State Tribunal.

36
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,733
-Let us return first.
-Mong-woo comes first.

37
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,194
This woman committed high treason.

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,619
Mong-woo took the knife…

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,706
to save my life.

40
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,209
It is clear that she is in league
with the assassin.

41
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,129
And their assassination attempt
simply failed.

42
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,724
-Your Majesty.
-I have already given my command.

43
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,684
-Bring the royal physician.
-Your Majesty.

44
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,352
Follow the royal command!

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,899
I shall, Your Majesty.

46
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,086
If I lose you like this,

47
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,382
I shall never

48
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,635
forgive myself.

49
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,143
His Majesty's return to the palace
has been delayed.

50
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,313
Not a single soul may enter the premises.

51
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,274
So examine the vicinity thoroughly
and stay extra vigilant.

52
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,068
-Yes, Captain!
-Yes, Captain!

53
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,282
Shall I transfer the criminal
in the storage to the State Tribunal?

54
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,742
Not yet.

55
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,619
Keep him there until there is an order

56
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,245
and do not take your eyes off him.

57
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,288
Yes, Captain.

58
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,457
You two will follow me.

59
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,958
-Yes, Captain.
-Yes, Captain.

60
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,217
The scent is pleasant.

61
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,138
You may drink too, Senior Court Lady Dong.

62
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,434
Please forgive my bluntness,

63
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,562
but His Majesty
may return to the palace anytime.

64
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,066
Please address the reason
behind your summon.

65
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,369
The empty queen's quarters

66
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,914
will soon welcome a new occupant.

67
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,626
The concubine appointment
would be within the new queen's purview,

68
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,629
but I shall put in a good word for you.

69
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,473
-How dare you?
-It is fine.

70
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,938
Why do you laugh?

71
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,525
I only laugh as I am reminded
of a past incident.

72
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,402
A past incident?

73
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,945
Long ago,

74
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,282
before His Majesty ascended to the throne

75
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,451
and I was a court maid in your service,

76
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,954
you gave me a command

77
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,291
when the late king
summoned me out of the blue.

78
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,461
Your Royal Highness.

79
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,547
Please do not send me
to His Majesty's quarters.

80
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,007
I would rather

81
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,718
you took my life this instant.

82
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,765
I hear you harbor affection
for Grand Prince Jinhan.

83
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,111
If you truly care for him,

84
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,989
become the King's woman.

85
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,411
Become the sword
that protects Grand Prince Jinhan.

86
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,415
Upon hearing those words,

87
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,877
my tender young soul
was shaken and terrified.

88
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,171
Whenever I recall that moment,

89
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,049
my heart still races
and I break out into a cold sweat.

90
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,843
And why are you bringing that up?

91
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,472
When lightning struck the palace,

92
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,226
His Majesty questioned me thusly.

93
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,482
"You know who poisoned
the late king to death,

94
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,069
do you not?"

95
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,915
You said you would put in a good word
for my appointment as a concubine.

96
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,628
I will be looking forward to it,
Your Royal Highness.

97
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,478
That insolent wench.

98
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,236
Do mind where you are!

99
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,363
Has His Majesty returned?

100
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,115
Not yet.

101
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,618
Come.

102
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,370
When he does,

103
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,164
I shall send you word immediately.

104
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,582
So please wait in your quarters.

105
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,584
How about Captain Joo?

106
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,753
How would he have returned

107
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,255
without His Majesty?

108
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,679
What is going on?

109
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,557
Did something happen

110
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,602
to His Majesty?

111
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,486
Wait here.

112
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,905
Follow me.

113
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,791
An attempt was made here

114
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,461
to assassinate His Majesty tonight.

115
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,922
Is His Majesty

116
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,008
the man who lost his consciousness

117
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,928
from a wound?

118
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,972
The one who was wounded

119
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,891
is a woman.

120
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,395
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

121
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,024
She seems to be
associated with the assassin.

122
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,574
Should you learn anything about her
during your treatment,

123
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,911
report every little detail back to me.

124
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,205
Do you understand?

125
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,085
Yes, Captain.

126
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,476
How is she?

127
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,355
Thankfully, it is not a fatal wound,

128
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,357
but it is deep.

129
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,360
She is running a fever,
the bleeding has not stopped yet,

130
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,237
and her body seems too weak.

131
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,156
Take her pulse.

132
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,666
Her pulse is very faint and beating fast.

133
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,334
Is she in a critical condition?

134
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,797
Suffering a wound in her weakened state
seems to have affected her deeply.

135
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,507
We shall stop the bleeding first.

136
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,760
As we must wash the wound
with salt water and apply ointment,

137
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,806
I must dare ask
that you give us some privacy.

138
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,700
-How is she?
-We have stopped the bleeding.

139
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,495
However, I am concerned about her fever.

140
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,247
We shall have to see
if she can last the night.

141
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,130
Your Majesty.

142
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,965
I await your punishment for my crimes.

143
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,761
Are you referring to…

144
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,266
your false report regarding her treatment
on the night of the gisinje?

145
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,894
I have committed a greater crime.

146
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,355
What is it?

147
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,983
I only reported to you falsely back then

148
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,402
as an old acquaintance
who did me a great favor long ago

149
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,405
made a special request
that I look after the gidaeryeong.

150
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,951
I only sought
to repay his kindness back then.

151
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,912
I never suspected that he was in league
with the gidaeryeong,

152
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,707
much less foresaw his return to the court
as the Inspector General.

153
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,878
What did Kim Je-nam…

154
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,299
say about his relationship
with the gidaeryeong?

155
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,761
He said she was the family
of a friend he considers as his brother.

156
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,141
Your confession now
equates to a confession of treason.

157
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,311
Can you swear
that there is no deceit in your words?

158
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,314
As you can question
the Inspector General for the truth,

159
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,984
there is no reason
for me to falsely confess.

160
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,987
Your Majesty, if his words are true,

161
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,822
you cannot let this slide.

162
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,615
Summon Kim Je-nam.

163
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,741
Yes, Your Majesty.

164
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,097
Please follow me inside.

165
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,610
Royal Physician Ji Nam-kyu

166
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,821
only reported the truth, Your Majesty.

167
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
Please ask me any questions you may have,

168
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,159
and I shall answer them.

169
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,454
Were you aware of…

170
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:20,085
the gidaeryeong's designs for me?

171
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,004
Of course, Your Majesty.

172
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,092
Three years ago,
she came to me in a wretched state.

173
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,969
As soon as she recovered,

174
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,306
she confessed
that she had a plan for treason

175
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,100
and requested my assistance.

176
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,979
Do your views

177
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,232
align with the gidaeryeong's?

178
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,317
Your Majesty.

179
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,278
It shames me to admit this,

180
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,115
but I do not have
a spirit of justice like her.

181
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,327
Before I received
your summon to the court,

182
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,997
I used to believe that I would be content
living all my days in the countryside.

183
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,958
While I found her spirit admirable,

184
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,170
I was sure of her failure

185
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,506
and only hoped for her safety.

186
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,590
Your Majesty.

187
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,760
Do not let him trick you
with his wicked words.

188
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,429
Why did you not report the gidaeryeong

189
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,265
even after being appointed
as the Inspector General?

190
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,269
Was it not to plot treason with her?

191
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,564
It is only natural for you
to have suspicion against me.

192
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,901
I, too, had a few against you,
Your Majesty.

193
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,614
I questioned your decision
to summon an unruly sword like me.

194
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,618
I assumed you were trying
to mimic acts of virtuous kings

195
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,621
to allay the concerns of the people.

196
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,749
However, upon meeting you,

197
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,751
my suspicion melted away like spring snow

198
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,670
and was instead replaced by hope

199
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,424
that I could contribute
to this nation and its people.

200
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,219
As such, I went to the gidaeryeong
and conveyed my change of heart.

201
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:56,098
Ever since then,
I have never had private meetings with her

202
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,933
nor have we exchanged words.

203
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,476
Your Majesty.

204
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,271
His words are nothing but crude excuses.

205
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,232
He sat back and watched the treason unfold
when he could have prevented it.

206
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,943
It is only right
to punish him for high treason.

207
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,529
I do not intend to avoid any punishment.

208
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,616
I prepared myself for death
when I was summoned here.

209
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,872
However,

210
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,833
should the gidaeryeong
survive and come to,

211
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,878
please be generous

212
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,714
and hearken to her reasoning.

213
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:34,386
Please contemplate
what would have driven her

214
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,264
to come before you

215
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,976
even in her weakened state.

216
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,314
I earnestly plead with you

217
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,358
for the sake of this nation
and its people.

218
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,855
I believe you.

219
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,153
I also

220
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,366
wish to hear her out…

221
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,703
so long as she wakes up.

222
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,832
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Majesty.

223
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,751
The master of this house

224
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,379
would also rejoice in the Underworld

225
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:55,050
to have his only kin
spared from being executed as a traitor.

226
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,433
What did you just say?

227
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,893
His only kin?

228
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,688
Are you saying…

229
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,109
Mong-woo is my Master Kang's kin?

230
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,601
Master Choam.

231
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,480
Stand back.

232
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,234
What about Lady Hee-soo?

233
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,653
Seeing as you are here,

234
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,031
she must be alive, must she not?

235
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,784
She has not
regained her consciousness yet.

236
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,793
We should interrogate him some other time.

237
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,982
You managed to save her life
three years ago.

238
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,986
You must have a way
to save her this time as well.

239
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,238
Is that not so?

240
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,198
Your Majesty.

241
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,200
You should return to the palace.

242
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,203
I will stay by the gidaeryeong.

243
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,849
I shall return. Lead the way.

244
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,393
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,096
Lady Hee-soo and Master Chu
are running late tonight.

246
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,432
The ingyeong will ring soon.

247
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,933
INGYEONG: THE CURFEW BELL

248
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,477
Did she tell you
she would be heading elsewhere?

249
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,730
How is it any of your concern?

250
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,486
Did Master Chu mention anything to you?

251
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,529
What?

252
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,781
He did mention something.

253
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,784
Right.

254
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,495
It was nothing. You need not know.

255
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,499
Are you trying to drive me out of my mind?

256
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,585
Look.

257
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,963
I do not know what came over him
to make such a request,

258
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:24,092
but he asked me to make an offering
in his stead on Hongjang's memorial day.

259
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,553
But he can do that himself, can he not?

260
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,807
Is anyone inside?

261
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,060
You seem to have a visitor.

262
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,478
That is odd.

263
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,354
I am not expecting anyone at this hour.

264
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,532
What is going on?

265
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,786
Who could it be
for it to be dead silent outside?

266
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,964
Who is Jageunnyeon?

267
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
That would be me.

268
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,389
The Inspector General summons you.

269
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,516
Come with us.

270
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,145
Wait, is that not Master Choam?

271
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,609
I am Jageunnyeon.

272
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,738
Why is Master Choam
looking for me at this hour?

273
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,448
You will know once you reach him.

274
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,668
I wonder why they are so serious.

275
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,004
Something must have happened here
in Lady Hee-soo's house.

276
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,012
Master Choam.

277
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,766
You are here.

278
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,605
Something happened
to Lady Hee-soo, did it not?

279
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,952
I noticed

280
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,538
that she had become very frail.

281
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,498
What happened?

282
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,336
She has suffered deeply
from her troubled heart.

283
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,425
She would skip meals
and have trouble sleeping.

284
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,847
I do not think
she intended to go this far.

285
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,937
She must have used all her might

286
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,773
to get here.

287
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,220
Your Majesty.

288
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,846
The Chief Royal Secretary is here.

289
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,436
You may leave.

290
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,074
Remind me of my agenda for today.

291
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,284
You have a morning assembly,

292
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,203
a rotational council,
and an evening study.

293
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,456
You must also review the reports
submitted by the offices.

294
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,333
Postpone the morning assembly.

295
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,834
I shall join the rotational council.

296
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,753
I will also go over the reports
at a later date.

297
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,671
Additionally,

298
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,757
I shall have a nighttime study
after the evening study.

299
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
So do prepare it.

300
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,011
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,515
I would like to see the Crown Prince.

302
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,308
Is he in his lecture?

303
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,062
He is at the Queen Dowager's quarters
to greet Her Royal Highness.

304
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,404
Here comes His Majesty!

305
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,162
Father.

306
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,332
Why are you standing out here?

307
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,212
I am waiting for permission to enter
from Her Royal Highness.

308
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,510
How long have you been waiting?

309
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,679
Does she keep you waiting every time?

310
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,061
I apologize for my tardiness,
Your Majesty.

311
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,479
Please come inside.

312
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,023
The Crown Prince will accompany me.

313
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,532
Until when are you going to leave
the Queen's quarters vacant?

314
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,119
Should you not order the court
to issue a decree for a selection?

315
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,830
We are still in mourning.

316
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,416
I will not have such a decree issued

317
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,252
while the Crown Prince
remains in mourning.

318
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,380
To think the nation
would not have a queen for so long.

319
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,632
This is unprecedented.

320
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,052
We shall have a new precedent then.

321
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,724
It seems that you keep
the Crown Prince waiting for a while

322
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,185
whenever he visits to greet you.

323
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,270
For what reason are you doing that?

324
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:37,322
I only did so as it was agonizing
to see him in his mourning dress.

325
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,950
It is not like
I am refusing to receive him.

326
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,994
What harm is there in a little wait?

327
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,877
I have failed to consider the agony
you are going through, Mother.

328
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,383
For the time being
until your sorrow subsides,

329
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,553
I shall have a palace eunuch greet you
on the Crown Prince's behalf.

330
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,643
I shall excuse myself first
to attend to matters of state.

331
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,104
You should rise as well.

332
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,606
We should not keep your lecturers waiting.

333
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,083
You wish for me to retract my command?

334
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,422
Are you sure you can bear it?

335
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,218
I am aware that you have
given the command for my sake.

336
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,345
However,

337
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,765
greeting Her Royal Highness
is my duty as her grandchild.

338
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,727
If I refuse to do as much,

339
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,730
I will not be able to handle
anything in the future.

340
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,442
Crown Prince.

341
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,195
You are a dutiful child indeed.

342
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,073
Do tell me if you need anything.

343
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,748
You must have something in mind.

344
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,707
What is it?

345
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,087
I miss Gidaeryeong Kang, Your Majesty.

346
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,430
It is not because I want to play baduk.

347
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,098
How could I indulge myself in pleasure

348
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,309
when I am still in mourning
for my late mother?

349
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,644
It is just that

350
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,355
he is my master

351
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,983
and I have not seen him in a while.

352
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,321
Am I not

353
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,782
allowed to see him?

354
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,667
I apologize.

355
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,462
I should not have made such a request.

356
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,892
For what reason is His Majesty not issuing
a decree for the selection of the queen?

357
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,977
With his heir secured,

358
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,313
he does not feel the need
to rush the matter.

359
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,984
My lord, even if that is
how His Majesty views the matter,

360
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,488
we cannot sit idly and watch.

361
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,573
We must appoint a new queen soon,

362
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,492
even if only to conduct

363
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,286
the memorial services
of the Royal Ancestral Shrine.

364
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,663
That is right.

365
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,540
That is what I was trying to say.

366
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,668
Additionally, we must have a new queen

367
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,962
to select a crown princess.

368
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,048
I hear His Royal Highness vowed not to wed

369
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,384
until he is done mourning.

370
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,803
Is that not right, Great Lord?

371
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,016
His Royal Highness

372
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,977
is such a dutiful son.

373
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,230
I have broached
the matter to him many times,

374
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,940
but he stayed resolute.

375
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,912
What brings you here?

376
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,081
I am here to convey a royal order.

377
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,459
His Majesty wishes to postpone
the morning assembly set for today

378
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,836
and only attend the rotational council.

379
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,671
I understand.

380
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,340
Let us leave now.

381
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,307
The new blunt-lobed spicebush
on the former peach tree's plot

382
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,850
looks very pleasant.

383
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,602
Have you noticed it too,
Left State Councilor?

384
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,062
Peach blossoms are quite fine,

385
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,565
but they are not as grand
as the flowers of blunt-lobed spicebush.

386
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,484
I am looking forward to next spring.

387
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,528
I am flattered by your praise.

388
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,988
Let us go.

389
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,995
When Her Majesty passed away,

390
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,624
I was too bitter
and lost my will to continue on.

391
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,835
But life has its twists and turns.

392
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,007
Who would have thought

393
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:10,094
I would gain such a dutiful grandson
as His Royal Highness?

394
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,472
You are right, Great Lord.

395
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,101
Life indeed has its twists and turns.

396
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,205
He must still believe
we are his subordinates.

397
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,289
How foolish.

398
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,168
Everyone in the court
is favoring His Royal Highness.

399
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,796
Do you not agree, Minister Min?

400
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,549
You are not wrong,
but nothing is for certain.

401
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,842
What is the problem this time?

402
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,429
As His Majesty
and the Queen Dowager's kin,

403
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,806
he still remains in power.

404
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,848
But what about us?

405
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,268
You are the Crown Prince's grandfather
only in name with no influence.

406
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,436
and I am…

407
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,272
holding my breath
for a marriage that may never happen.

408
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,066
Brother.

409
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,069
That was not my decision,
but His Royal Highness's.

410
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,862
You have changed.

411
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,074
Becoming the Crown Prince's kin
has changed your attitude.

412
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,076
Nothing has changed.

413
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,161
Please do not think so.

414
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,082
I must meet the gidaeryeong.

415
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,669
Why would you seek my approval

416
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,295
when he is not my subordinate?

417
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,714
Have you not heard?

418
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,759
While His Majesty
was in mourning for the late queen,

419
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,720
the gidaeryeong did not enter the palace.

420
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,889
He only did so yesterday briefly
and has not come in today.

421
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,058
I asked a runner

422
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,602
and learned that he did not come
without sending any word.

423
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,896
His Majesty did not summon him either.

424
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,025
I have been so busy tending
to His Royal Highness

425
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,484
that I have been out of touch with him.

426
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,947
I assumed that you and the gidaeryeong

427
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,200
were working together
for His Royal Highness.

428
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,203
Was I perhaps mistaken?

429
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,205
Do you now see

430
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,875
how much you have changed?

431
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,514
Do not mind him.

432
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,353
He is only being brusque out of annoyance
regarding the marriage matters.

433
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,293
Officials are already flocking
to the Crown Prince

434
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,212
and Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha.

435
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,631
I knew this would happen.

436
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,300
The court is composed of people

437
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,178
who have a knack for detecting
who holds sway in the world.

438
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,473
I shall seek the official's support
and petition His Majesty

439
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,183
to issue a decree
for the selection of the queen.

440
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
Min Ji-hwan has sided
with the Crown Prince.

441
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,109
Do you still have
Yoo Hyun-bo's family in mind?

442
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,822
How about the former Minister of Justice
Kim Nae-seon's daughter?

443
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,324
Is his daughter

444
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,536
not your wife's niece?

445
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,955
He has people following him

446
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,623
and is close to our family.

447
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,459
His daughter would be perfect
as His Majesty's spouse.

448
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,047
You should have thought of that earlier.

449
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,301
What about the Crown Prince
and Kim Myung-ha?

450
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,764
I will take care of them all in due time,
so please do not worry.

451
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,366
I was about to deliver
the herbal medicine.

452
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,993
Is His Majesty looking for me?

453
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,538
He is still at the hall of governance.

454
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,623
Then what brings you here?

455
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,709
Last night,

456
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,879
I saw you leave the palace
with Captain Joo.

457
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,339
Where did you go?

458
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,301
His Majesty was out of the palace.

459
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,720
Did he summon you?

460
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,682
I cannot say.

461
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,596
Who is that?

462
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,723
Is that not Senior Court Lady Dong?

463
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,815
Speak the truth.

464
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,027
Where was His Majesty last night?

465
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,489
If you tell me,

466
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,492
I will reward you handsomely.

467
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,743
I apologize,

468
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,413
but I cannot tell you anything.

469
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,547
I can easily have you
framed for a crime, flogged,

470
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,592
and expelled out of this palace.

471
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,886
Do you wish for such a fate?

472
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,973
What are you doing there?

473
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,107
Did you not hear me?

474
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,234
What are you doing back here?

475
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,823
I have been feeling unwell,

476
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,284
so I was just asking her for treatment.

477
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,495
Is that true?

478
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,294
Yes, my lady.

479
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,461
Senior Court Lady Dong…

480
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,423
complained of pain in her shoulders,

481
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,800
so I was about to tend to her.

482
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,089
I will give it to you.

483
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,719
Who was His Majesty with?

484
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,314
You must keep this to yourself.

485
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,285
I do not know whose residence it was,

486
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,995
but he was with Gidaeryeong Kang.

487
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,543
But the gidaeryeong…

488
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,714
turned out to be a woman.

489
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,719
What?

490
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,181
The gidaeryeong…

491
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,435
is a woman?

492
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,571
I wondered why His Majesty

493
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,033
was so smitten with a lowly baduk player.

494
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,994
I can see why after seeing you up close.

495
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:15,913
You are a man,

496
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,707
yet peculiar.

497
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,127
I would like to become your woman.

498
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,504
Please allow me to spend a night with you.

499
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,798
I…

500
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,551
will not bed you…

501
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,054
nor dismiss you from my quarters.

502
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,521
I cannot bring myself to do this.

503
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,315
Your Majesty!

504
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,532
I do not understand the reason

505
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,785
why you are explaining
His Majesty's heart to me

506
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,496
when you are so sure of his affection.

507
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,393
Is anyone inside?

508
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,032
Have you been on my tail?

509
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,909
Do not take this the wrong way.

510
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,162
I am here to meet the gidaeryeong as well.

511
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,624
Is there no one inside?

512
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,755
Do not stand in my way.

513
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,465
Do not act this way.

514
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,761
I want to be on good terms with you.

515
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,430
Let us consider the past
water under the bridge

516
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,640
and become good friends.

517
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,601
There is no reason for us to be enemies.

518
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,145
You have the audacity
to utter such disgusting words?

519
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,188
What is it?

520
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,565
Has the Principal Director
had a change of heart?

521
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,568
Did he go back on his promise
about the new queen?

522
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,472
Lady Hee-soo.

523
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,599
Where have you gone?

524
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,874
I think she is waking up.

525
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,210
My goodness.

526
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,253
Master Choam!

527
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,180
Your Majesty!

528
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,892
Your Majesty.

529
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,271
The news you have been awaiting
has arrived.

530
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,689
Has he awakened?

531
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,571
Answer me.

532
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,156
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,116
He has awakened.

534
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,548
What is the matter?

535
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,264
It is enough to hear he has awakened.

536
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,393
Eunuch Kim.

537
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,563
Yes, Your Majesty. Please speak.

538
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,649
I have ordered a nighttime study,

539
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,275
so bring me the Royal Secretary.

540
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,485
Yes, Your Majesty.

541
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,241
Master Choam.

542
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,410
Why have we not heard from the palace yet?

543
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,372
His Majesty's day is long
and filled with countless duties.

544
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,332
He will send word soon.

545
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,671
What will happen to Master Chu?

546
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,085
Principal Director.

547
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,379
What brings you here?

548
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,924
As you keep postponing
the morning assembly,

549
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,094
I have come to convey the court's wishes

550
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,929
and to seek your approval.

551
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,850
The Chief Royal Secretary
is apprising me of all urgent matters.

552
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,769
What is this important matter

553
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,314
that you must report to me yourself?

554
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,660
This is the list
of potential Sixth Royal Secretaries.

555
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,872
Please replace Kim Myung-ha.

556
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,169
What is the reason?

557
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,882
He is His Royal Highness's
only kin remaining.

558
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,594
His holding a position responsible
for relaying royal commands

559
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,221
is not appropriate.

560
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,972
To speak the truth,

561
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,351
some people are already lining up
to be on his good side.

562
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,479
It would only be proper to dismiss him

563
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,440
before he causes any concern
for His Royal Highness.

564
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,608
I shall consider it.

565
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,406
Inspector General Kim Je-nam
has not come to the palace for days.

566
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,369
The same goes for Gidaeryeong Kang.

567
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,706
I advise you to inspect them
for disciplinary actions.

568
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,838
You do not let even a small blunder

569
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,801
slip through the cracks, do you?

570
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,469
For officials

571
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,389
who have the duty
to serve you and the people,

572
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,641
even a small blunder is a grave crime.

573
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,061
If you let this slide,
the discipline of the court will grow lax.

574
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,730
Your words are correct.

575
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,275
Crimes are crimes.

576
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,194
We cannot minimize them as blunders.

577
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,658
I will keep that in mind.

578
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,336
Master Choam will give you an earful
if he finds out.

579
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,506
I feel too stuffy.

580
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,593
I will take a short walk and come back

581
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,595
before he notices.

582
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,765
My lady.

583
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,809
The night air is chilly.

584
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,650
Wait here.

585
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,153
I will quickly go get your robe.

586
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,752
You sure have returned quickly.

587
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,008
Your Majesty.

588
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,586
And who might you be?

589
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,344
I will guard this area, so leave.

590
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,970
Bollocks.

591
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,432
I suggest you leave.

592
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,393
I will protect Lady Hee-soo.

593
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,651
I thought you would never come.

594
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,573
I wanted to come running
as soon as I heard you were awake,

595
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,037
but I could not bear myself to face you.

596
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,499
The sight of a traitor like me

597
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,919
would understandably distress you.

598
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:09,089
It was because of my crime, not yours.

599
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,093
The crime that began three years ago

600
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,554
and still continues to this day.

601
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,349
Your crime?

602
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,728
What do you mean by that?

603
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,521
All your actions…

604
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,151
were all that I wished for.

605
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,365
If I had not wished for them,

606
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:41,329
I would not have made you the gidaeryeong,
given you access to Yeongchwijeong,

607
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,625
or kept you at the Grand Prince's side.

608
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,379
I would have punished and expelled you

609
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,590
when Princess Jangryeong was substituted.

610
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,762
I would have punished you harshly
for high treason

611
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,347
when your advice

612
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,769
prompted the Queen
to urge the Great Lord to petition

613
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,107
for the Grand Prince's appointment
as the Crown Prince during assembly.

614
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,031
But Your Majesty,

615
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,742
you threatened to have me killed

616
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,039
if I sought any patron other than you
when I first entered Yeongchwijeong.

617
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,165
I only did so…

618
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:31,588
to scare you enough
to make you act with caution.

619
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,258
But seeing you refuse
the Queen Dowager's offer

620
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,718
changed my mind.

621
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,722
I appointed you the Grand Prince's master

622
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,392
to avoid the Queen Dowager
and the Principal Director's keen eyes

623
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,604
and finally carry out

624
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,898
what I intended to do.

625
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,072
Appointing Grand Prince Munseong
as the Crown Prince.

626
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,245
I took advantage of you.

627
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,915
I used you as my shield

628
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,295
to veil my doings.

629
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,137
Even if your words are true,

630
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,392
the crimes I committed against you

631
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,270
do not go away.

632
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,400
I assume you could not
bring yourself to forgive me

633
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,610
for what I did to you three years ago.

634
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,863
That was not the reason.

635
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,123
In the evening
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan

636
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,667
intruded into Yeongchwijeong
without your permission,

637
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,546
I was there.

638
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,341
I hid myself

639
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,096
and heard what you said to him.

640
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,558
The appointment of the Crown Prince

641
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:11,146
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

642
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:15,567
When the people's minds are put at ease,
I can expel and banish him from the palace

643
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,485
and then eliminate him.

644
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:21,364
You are the one who should stop
being foolish and come to your senses.

645
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,035
I am the king of this nation.

646
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,872
Anyone who opposes me shall face death

647
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,998
and that includes

648
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,668
my kin who shares my blood.

649
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,760
And thus…

650
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,432
you decided to kill me

651
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,645
because you became afraid and sick of me.

652
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,695
Had that been the case…

653
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,951
Had I become sick of you,

654
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,330
I would have
discarded the plan to harm you

655
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,167
and made a rational decision
to wait for the Grand Prince's chance.

656
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,003
The man whom I love

657
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,590
revealed his true nature before me

658
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:26,137
as a treacherous and depraved king
just as I have long known.

659
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,520
And yet, my love for you did not diminish.

660
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,606
Instead of diminishing,

661
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,194
it only grew so painfully strong

662
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,322
that it swayed me.

663
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,373
That is why I decided to assassinate you.

664
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,921
It was to prevent myself
from becoming more captivated by you

665
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,634
and to protect the Grand Prince
who was appointed the Crown Prince.

666
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,782
Do you hear my heart beating?

667
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,913
Do you hear the mad, racing heartbeat

668
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,416
overcome with joy?

669
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,179
I will not lose you ever again.

670
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,681
I will protect you.

671
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,501
I have news to share with you.

672
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,462
Please speak, Your Majesty.

673
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,507
My master,

674
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,134
Lord Kang Hang-soon, has not passed away.

675
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,260
He is alive.

676
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,141
Where is he,

677
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,268
Your Majesty?

678
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,232
He is staying in Beijing to observe
the tension between Qing and Ming.

679
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,400
Your Majesty.

680
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,987
Are you saying
that Kang Hang-soon is your spy?

681
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,281
That is right.

682
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:55,912
He was imprisoned in Shenyang and released
while being transferred to Beijing.

683
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,872
But instead of returning,

684
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,835
he decided to hide his identity
and stay in the Qing.

685
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,256
His Majesty sent his men several times
asking Lord Kang to return,

686
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,133
but he refused.

687
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,688
Your Majesty.

688
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,774
When you mentioned

689
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,196
that there was a caretaker in the Qing
to look after Her Highness…

690
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,281
Yes.

691
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,160
I was referring to Master Kang.

692
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:46,546
I tried to find you at all costs
upon his request.

693
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,923
But I could not.

694
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,016
Thank you for the letter.

695
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,894
As I shall find what is lost at all costs,

696
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,355
make sure you tell them not to worry.

697
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,526
Has there been any progress
on finding what was lost?

698
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,572
We have combed through the capital,

699
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,992
but we have not found anyone
who knows of or holds the item.

700
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,913
You must find it at all costs.

701
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,039
Do you understand?

702
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,251
I had my men travel all across the land

703
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,172
when you were here all along.

704
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,428
I am truly relieved

705
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:41,726
to have finally heard
the news about my father.

706
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,146
Your Majesty.

707
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,024
You should let Gidaeryeong Kang rest now.

708
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,485
She has not fully recovered yet,

709
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,071
and her condition could take a bad turn.

710
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,326
You heard him.

711
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,703
You may leave and rest.

712
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,873
Yes, Your Majesty.

713
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,227
My lady.

714
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,155
Jageunnyeon.

715
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,076
My father…

716
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,834
is alive.

717
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,755
Is that true?

718
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,194
Your Majesty.

719
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,238
What will you do with Chu Dal-ha?

720
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,823
Your Majesty.

721
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,534
I know you are conflicted
because of the gidaeryeong.

722
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,621
But Chu Dal-ha
dared to point his knife at you!

723
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,415
We must transfer him
to the State Tribunal for interrogation.

724
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,155
Untie the rope.

725
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,531
Yes, Your Majesty.

726
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,636
You may leave, Sang-hwa.

727
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,554
I cannot, Your Majesty.

728
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,348
He attempted to harm you.

729
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,407
Raise your head.

730
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,038
Is there anything you want to say?

731
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,001
Lady Hee-soo
has nothing to do with this incident.

732
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,089
I plotted and carried this out
all on my own,

733
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,842
so take my life.

734
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,011
Though I am resentful

735
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,764
that I could not punish
the wicked criminal

736
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,559
who served as a spy for the Qing
to ascend to the throne

737
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,643
before my death,

738
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,563
I have no regrets.

739
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,108
You truly believe…

740
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,573
that I informed against you to the Qing.

741
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,325
Are you saying

742
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,411
you did not do it?

743
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,912
It would be difficult to believe me.

744
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,332
It does not matter even if you do not.

745
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,549
You are a righteous man.

746
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:43,634
As such,

747
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,764
I will give you two options
to choose from.

748
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,807
You may hide your crimes

749
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,686
and find a way to live on.

750
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:55,980
Or…

751
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,317
you will confess your crimes

752
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,777
and lay down your life

753
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,780
to have your resentment resolved.

754
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,452
Whatever you choose, I will follow it.

755
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,621
What will you do?

756
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,671
Get some rest.

757
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,048
My lady!

758
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,634
Good grief.

759
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,927
Lady Hee-soo needs peace and quiet.

760
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,722
My lady, Master Chu is being taken away
by the men of the Special Firearms Unit.

761
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,057
What?

762
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,527
Master Choam.

763
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,320
What is going on?

764
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,366
His Majesty ordered him
to be transferred to the State Tribunal.

765
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,996
Where is His Majesty?

766
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,250
He returned to the palace
after giving the command.

767
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:01,963
My goodness.

768
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:26,654
Your Majesty.

769
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,406
The Chief Royal Secretary is here.

770
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,753
Have you summoned me, Your Majesty?

771
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,467
Summon the members
of the Border Defense Council.

772
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,635
I will interrogate

773
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,430
the traitor myself.

774
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,143
Yes, Your Majesty.

775
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,478
I shall follow your command.

776
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,450
What is going on, my lord?

777
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,577
A man who attempted
to assassinate His Majesty

778
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,245
has been transferred
to the State Tribunal.

779
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,709
We must send out the royal summons,
so summon all the clerks and runners.

780
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,127
Yes, my lord.

781
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,965
My lord.

782
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,217
What is the name of the criminal?

783
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,597
Chu Dal-ha.

784
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,643
A spy dispatched to the Ming
and caught by the Qing three years ago.

785
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,067
SUMMONS

786
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,413
My lord.

787
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,915
Have you heard the news?

788
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,792
I was about to head to the palace.

789
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,712
I came running
as I had urgent news to share.

790
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,424
You would not know who Chu Dal-ha is.

791
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,135
I had forgotten about him
until I heard his name today.

792
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,262
Who is he?

793
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:18,557
He is a spy who went to the Ming
and was caught by the Qing.

794
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,810
And now, he serves Gidaeryeong Kang.

795
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,438
Are you certain?

796
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,190
After hearing his name,

797
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:29,568
I went to the State Tribunal
to confirm my doubts.

798
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,070
I am certain.

799
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,032
The gidaeryeong
has to be related to this case.

800
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,034
Has he truly lost his mind?

801
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,078
Why would he make such a blunder

802
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,872
when he holds a position
others can only envy?

803
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,124
After all,

804
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,710
he did make a false attestation
three years ago.

805
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,670
What with Princess Jangryeong's incident,

806
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:51,799
it would not be so strange
even if he harbored a treacherous intent.

807
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,012
False attestation from three years ago?

808
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:58,431
That means

809
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,517
Kim Myung-ha may be implicated as well.

810
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:02,935
Yes, my lord.

811
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,647
They may have committed such an act
for His Royal Highness.

812
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,942
I must go see His Majesty immediately.

813
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,779
Your Majesty.

814
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,699
What shocking event is this?

815
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,869
Captain Joo Sang-hwa
of the Special Firearms Unit

816
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,121
should be punished harshly
for his negligence.

817
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,790
He has committed no crime

818
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,669
for the traitor's blade did not reach me.

819
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,923
The heavens have truly helped.

820
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:39,096
I have looked into
Chu Dal-ha's past doings on my way here.

821
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,015
Indeed?

822
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,102
You may report them to me.

823
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,815
Yes, Your Majesty.

824
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,525
To speak the truth,

825
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:55,738
Chu Dal-ha was a spy who was caught
by the Qing three years ago.

826
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,617
He currently works as a butcher
in Banchon Village

827
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,494
with Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
as his patron.

828
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,997
Due to the grudges they hold
for the incident three years ago,

829
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,457
Kang Mong-woo and Kim Myung-ha

830
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,293
must have given the order
to assassinate you.

831
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,045
I shall have them
sent to the State Tribunal

832
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,421
for interrogation.

833
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,965
-Please approve of this.
-Principal Director.

834
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:22,556
This interrogation is not to investigate
Chu Dal-ha's crimes.

835
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,270
He has already confessed his crimes.

836
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,398
Then…

837
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,361
what is this interrogation for?

838
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,113
Chu Dal-ha made a report.

839
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,699
What must I do

840
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,576
to resolve my resentment?

841
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,539
Confess your crimes and make a report.

842
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,918
Report the wicked spy
who sold you to the Qing

843
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,671
and petition to have them
found and punished.

844
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,934
He reported the spy
who put this nation at risk

845
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,479
and asked that their crime
be brought to light.

846
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,992
I have long awaited this day.

847
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:30,040
The capital traitor
who joined hands with the Qing

848
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:34,044
and put this nation
and its people in a crisis.

849
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,132
I will find that vile spy

850
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,135
and have them punished for high treason.

851
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:45,431
I will have their disgraceful name
engraved in the records…

852
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,688
so that the people of this nation…

853
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,111
will remember their crime.

854
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,108
CAPTIVATING THE KING

855
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:42,947
Hiding the crimes I have committed
has been eating me alive.

856
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:48,202
If His Majesty dares to bring me down,
he will crumble before I do.

857
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,162
Are you suspecting the spy
who colluded with the Qing

858
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,165
to be among the members
of the Border Defense Council?

859
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,543
Attacking the Principal Director
will only endanger your reign.

860
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,588
For what reason
are you taking such a high risk?

861
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,676
Kim Myung-ha
wishes to join hands with you.

862
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,636
Are you telling me to take my own life

863
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,346
now that you have no use for me?

864
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,848
Do you truly believe

865
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,643
your treasonous collusion with the Qing
can remain a secret?

866
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:18,190
