CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,923
EPISODE 15

3
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,733
Do you still…

4
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,571
find me unworthy?

5
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,043
Is it because of the crime I committed?

6
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,592
That crime is not solely yours.

7
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,761
My brother and I had a hand in it…

8
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,269
as well as the Queen Dowager
and the Principal Director.

9
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,989
I refuse to accept your affection…

10
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,578
for claiming you as mine

11
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,957
would be reprehensible in that
I would be exploiting you

12
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,294
and hurting you yet again.

13
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,802
Do you resent me?

14
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:06,978
Your Majesty.

15
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,439
To speak the truth,

16
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,821
I knew that you would refuse
my final request.

17
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,451
Knowing your true nature…

18
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,875
might have been what led me

19
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,669
to love you.

20
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,904
This cannot be.

21
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,991
Did you take poison?

22
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,544
Is anyone outside?

23
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,671
Eunuch Kim!

24
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,303
Why are you standing around?

25
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,222
Bring the royal physician immediately!

26
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,724
Yes, Your Majesty.

27
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,233
Why in heaven's name
would you take poison?

28
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,819
Your Majesty.

29
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,240
I have received an order

30
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,784
to kill you.

31
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,729
I was told…

32
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,816
that you would never forgive me

33
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,155
for harming the late king

34
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,160
and that this was the only way
for me to survive.

35
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,621
I was also told that if you forgave me,

36
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,083
you would become

37
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,003
a depraved tyrant

38
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,926
who forsook the bond set by the heavens.

39
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,597
You were coerced.

40
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,182
Who was it?

41
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,559
Was it the Queen Dowager
or the Principal Director?

42
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,444
What made you change your mind?

43
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,738
Why did you take the poison

44
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,824
instead of using it to kill me?

45
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,203
Your Majesty.

46
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,790
My lifelong wish…

47
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,170
was to be loved by you.

48
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,173
However,

49
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,842
what I desired

50
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,846
and hoped for more

51
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,558
was to protect you…

52
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,189
until the end of my days.

53
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,820
Your Majesty.

54
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,449
Since the day you promised

55
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,327
to grant all my requests,

56
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,790
I have wished…

57
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,712
to say these words to you one day.

58
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,634
What are they?

59
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,096
Your Majesty.

60
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,976
I have…

61
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,023
no more…

62
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,694
requests to make.

63
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,129
Senior Court Lady Dong.

64
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,443
Your Majesty!

65
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,725
Here comes His Majesty!

66
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,696
Your Majesty.

67
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,699
Forgive me, but I have not received
any word of your visit.

68
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,201
May I ask what brings you…

69
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,667
Tell her I am here.

70
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,421
Your Royal Highness.

71
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,298
His Majesty is here.

72
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,195
Your Majesty.

73
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,364
Why is there blood on you?

74
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,123
This blood is not mine,
but Senior Court Lady Dong's.

75
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,333
Senior Court Lady Dong's?

76
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,878
What do you mean?

77
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,714
She is dead.

78
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,426
She received an order to poison me
just like my brother,

79
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,305
but she could not bring herself
to follow the order

80
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,266
and took the poison herself and died.

81
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,274
His Majesty cannot dare to cast me away.

82
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,151
If he dares to bring me down,

83
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,988
he will crumble before I do.

84
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,660
Mother.

85
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,413
I do not understand

86
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,208
how you could remain silent

87
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,919
at the news of a threat to my life.

88
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,137
I cannot fathom
what spite she may have had

89
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,557
to take her own life before you,

90
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,225
but poisoning?

91
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,144
As you well know,

92
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,272
the late king passed away
due to his chronic illness.

93
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,315
Mother.

94
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,819
Senior Court Lady Dong
confessed before she died.

95
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,780
Her words are all lies!

96
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,533
You must believe in your mother.

97
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,414
All this has come to pass
because of Chu Dal-ha's report.

98
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,667
You must behead him
and hang up his head for display

99
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,046
to show the world your authority
and bring an end to this case.

100
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,841
That is the only way
to preserve your reign.

101
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,760
I cannot and will not do so.

102
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,929
-Your Majesty!
-Enough!

103
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,230
Enough.

104
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,900
That is enough.

105
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,406
Do you still not see it?

106
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,910
I could not bring myself
to ask you the question

107
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,914
on the day my brother died.

108
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,958
However,

109
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,669
I already…

110
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,215
know its answer!

111
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,935
I have no idea what you are talking about.

112
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,147
You would have also known for long

113
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,608
that my uncle

114
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,280
is the spy who colluded with the Qing…

115
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,202
and that he poisoned my brother to death.

116
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,041
When I sought to punish him for it,

117
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,461
he turned against me
and tried to poison me as well.

118
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,304
Tell me.

119
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,391
Did you order him to poison my brother?

120
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,567
That is ridiculous.

121
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,332
As his crimes have been revealed,

122
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,083
I shall interrogate him

123
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,003
without further ado.

124
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,422
I would rather bite my tongue

125
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,592
and take my own life on this spot
than see that happen!

126
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,232
Your Majesty.

127
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,656
Reconsider what you are about to do.

128
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,661
The Principal Director
is your one and only kin

129
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,040
and a loyal subject
who will help you maintain your reign.

130
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you not see

131
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,545
that you will be endangered
if you punish him?

132
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,591
Mother.

133
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,845
Let me be clear.

134
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,351
Do not act as the leader of traitors.

135
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,353
Using my authority as the king,

136
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,315
I will do everything in my power…

137
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,781
to make sure

138
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,034
not to let such an act slide.

139
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,293
Your…

140
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,047
Your Majesty.

141
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,885
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Majesty!

142
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,845
Your Majesty.

143
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,349
Your Majesty…

144
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:07,865
Your Majesty.

145
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,760
Your Majesty.

146
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,138
Your quarters are being cleaned up,

147
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,514
so let us head to Yeongchwijeong.

148
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,858
Gidaeryeong Kang should be in the palace.

149
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,735
-Go summon him.
-Yes, Captain.

150
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,677
Your Majesty.

151
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,193
I heard the news…

152
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,948
of Senior Court Lady Dong's death.

153
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,954
Back when…

154
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,794
you told me Kim Myung-ha confessed
that the Principal Director

155
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,587
was plotting treason,

156
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,384
I should have ordered
his immediate arrest and interrogation.

157
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,563
What did you say?

158
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,566
The Principal Director asked Myung-ha
to join him in a plot of treason?

159
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,901
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,112
Yoo Hyun-bo served
as the Principal Director's messenger

161
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,031
and tried to convince
the Sixth Royal Secretary.

162
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,077
He insisted on reporting them
to you himself, but I dissuaded him.

163
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,537
With Yoo Hyun-bo as the messenger,

164
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,956
the Principal Director
can simply deny his involvement,

165
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,334
which would make the Sixth Royal Secretary
a criminal who falsely accused your kin.

166
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,463
I thought it would be wiser
for me to report the matter

167
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,756
and await your orders.

168
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,800
This is better.

169
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,343
I shall exploit it

170
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,722
to trick the Principal Director
into lowering his guard.

171
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,975
Tell Myung-ha to accept his offer.

172
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,771
This is a golden opportunity
to make him reveal his own crimes.

173
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,487
I am responsible
for Court Lady Dong's death.

174
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,913
My greedy pursuit of exposing
all the crimes of the Principal Director

175
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,249
led to her death.

176
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,503
Your Majesty.

177
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,839
Please do not blame yourself.

178
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,342
They say even the wisest of the wise

179
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,179
cannot fully fathom another's thoughts.

180
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,847
I also once witnessed

181
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,268
Senior Court Lady Dong crying in despair,

182
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,439
but I failed to understand
the reasons behind her sorrow.

183
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,859
Court Lady Dong…

184
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,909
was the only one who knew of my crime.

185
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,581
I forced her to commit a crime for me,

186
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,543
but I never gave her my warm regards.

187
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,922
Throughout her service to me,

188
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,300
I suspected her of being the subject
of my mother and uncle

189
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,052
and begrudged her.

190
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,220
She must have believed…

191
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,309
that I would never forgive her,

192
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,103
which would have made her afraid.

193
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,694
She did not take her own life
because she feared punishment from you.

194
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,281
She only did so

195
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,992
as she knew you would forgive her.

196
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,081
As she knew your secret,

197
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,920
she would have believed her death
was the only way to protect you.

198
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,224
The reasons that I cannot forgive
the Principal Director…

199
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,105
are only piling up.

200
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,110
Your Majesty.

201
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,322
With Senior Court Lady Dong gone,

202
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,866
you no longer have a witness.

203
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,744
Do you still intend
to carry out the interrogation?

204
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,623
The court will be against it,
saying that it now lacks merit.

205
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,834
Even Inspector General Kim Je-nam
will not be able to support me.

206
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,002
However,

207
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,755
even if I have to quash
all resistance from the court,

208
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,759
the interrogation will be held.

209
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,596
I cannot overlook
the Principal Director's crimes.

210
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,517
Are you certain…

211
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,021
that Court Lady Dong
died from this poison?

212
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,861
What about the late king?

214
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:25,784
I would have a more accurate result
if I could examine it further.

215
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,245
But based on the looks of the silver spoon

216
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,122
and the time it takes to change colors,

217
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,335
I believe his passing
was caused by the same poison.

218
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,382
You may leave.

219
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,270
Your Majesty.

220
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,191
Do you think the Principal Director
gave Court Lady Dong the order?

221
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,822
I suspect so,
but she did not confess as much.

222
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
What is the matter?

223
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,125
To speak the truth,

224
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,837
my men are chasing after
one of his servants who has disappeared.

225
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,049
And we have learned
that he was headed to the border.

226
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,636
I am concerned that his next move
after giving out an order for your death

227
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,140
may be an attempt to collude
with the Qing's envoy, Jung Je-pyo,

228
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,935
bearing a document approving
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

229
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,862
I did not expect…

230
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,868
that wench to be this foolish.

231
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,162
This is no time to mull over nothing.

232
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,372
What will you do now?

233
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:59,628
Thankfully, His Majesty is a tactician
who calculates all possibilities ahead.

234
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,506
Without Court Lady Dong,
who would have been his witness,

235
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,759
he no longer has the grounds
to summon me as a criminal.

236
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,971
As an interrogation without cause
will only face the court's resistance

237
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,183
and incur the suspicion of Prince Rui,

238
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,977
it will not take place.

239
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,981
What if His Majesty
insists on holding an interrogation?

240
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,566
And what about Kim Myung-ha?

241
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,903
If he gets cold feet and makes a report--

242
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,155
A report shall be fought
with another report.

243
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,536
"Kim Myung-ha
and Yoo Hyun-bo joined hands…

244
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,790
and proposed that we plot treason."

245
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,919
My lord.

246
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,381
I only raised the issue out of concern.

247
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,343
Why are you threatening me
when I am on your side?

248
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,931
Kim Myung-ha cannot make rash moves
because of the Crown Prince,

249
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,224
but you are different.

250
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,852
Humans are creatures of habit.

251
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,603
Your habits have not gone anywhere.

252
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,773
Remember this.

253
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,360
My doom will lead to your doom.

254
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,238
Do you understand?

255
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,286
I will remember that, my lord.

256
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,089
My lady.

257
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,634
The Sixth Royal Secretary is here.

258
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,153
The last words of the late king

259
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,865
were to protect the Grand Prince
and appoint him the Crown Prince.

260
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,575
His Majesty

261
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,036
is carrying out those last words.

262
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,621
Am I wrong?

263
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,834
When did you realize that?

264
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,922
I thought something was off

265
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,924
when the King spared my life

266
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,884
and appointed me
the Executive Assistant of Uiju.

267
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,095
I questioned his decision
as my crime deserved death.

268
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,685
I avoided facing the truth even after
the Grand Prince became the Crown Prince.

269
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,565
But the Principal Director's recent offer
made me realize it.

270
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,442
It was I

271
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,780
who was captivated
by the need for vengeance.

272
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,203
I am relieved

273
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,996
to hear you say so.

274
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,794
Do you think His Majesty

275
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,380
will interrogate the Principal Director?

276
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,009
I am afraid he will push ahead

277
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,679
despite the unfavorable circumstances.

278
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,098
Let His Majesty know

279
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,267
that I shall attend the interrogation

280
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,311
and report the Principal Director
for his attempt to plot treason.

281
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,522
That cannot happen.

282
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,858
If you take action,
His Royal Highness will be in danger,

283
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,112
and His Majesty will not approve of that.

284
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,446
There is no other way.

285
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,615
Without the interrogation,

286
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,493
the Principal Director will cover up
his crimes with aid from Prince Rui.

287
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,619
Were that to happen,

288
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,165
the Qing troops may invade
like they did three years ago

289
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,710
and attempt to take His Majesty away.

290
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,837
We cannot let that happen.

291
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,813
The horses are ready
outside the city walls, my lord.

292
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,566
But where are you going?

293
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,235
I will head to the Qing through Uiju

294
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,571
and seek refuge
under Prince Rui's service.

295
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,282
Hurry up. We must leave
the capital before morning.

296
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,366
Yes, my lord.

297
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,583
Damn it.

298
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,591
I am sure I heard footsteps.

299
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,273
Let us go that way.

300
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,050
Your Majesty.

301
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,843
Did you summon me?

302
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,180
Summon the judges
as I shall hold an interrogation today.

303
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,765
Your Majesty.

304
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,894
Though you ordered us not to appoint one
among the Border Defense Council members,

305
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,397
we will need a minister-level official.

306
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,858
We seek to appoint
Minister of War Min Ji-hwan as one.

307
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,568
Please give us your approval.

308
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,905
You have my approval.

309
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,324
Your Majesty.

310
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,161
Please name the criminal
to be interrogated today.

311
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,089
Principal Director…

312
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,884
Park Jong-hwan.

313
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,683
I shall follow your royal command.

314
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,658
Criminal Park Jong-hwan,
come out and follow the royal command!

315
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,005
Tell them to wait awhile
for me to get changed.

316
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,715
Yes, my lord.

317
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,815
Be honest with me.

318
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,359
Did you know that the spy
who colluded with the Qing

319
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,111
was the Principal Director?

320
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,614
Those are the exact words
I want to ask you.

321
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,869
From what I recall, you were closer to him
than I was three years ago.

322
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,080
I had no idea.

323
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,585
You know how reticent
the Principal Director can be.

324
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,464
What do you think will happen?

325
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,926
As one of the judges,
you should be able to tell how it will go.

326
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,970
Do you think His Majesty
will summon me to the interrogation?

327
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,307
No one knows.

328
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,352
Depending on
what the Principal Director says,

329
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,563
anyone could be summoned.

330
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,912
How dare an accused criminal
wear a court robe?

331
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,498
He must be out of his mind.

332
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,001
Some may even think
he is here to receive commendations.

333
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,085
Here comes His Majesty!

334
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,333
Why is the criminal
dressed in a court robe?

335
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,252
I apologize, Your Majesty.

336
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,422
Strip him of his robe.

337
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,759
Your Majesty.

338
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,470
I only came to clear my name
of the false charges.

339
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,931
I do not stand before you as a criminal.

340
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,100
As I wish to pay my respects to you,

341
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,687
please allow me
to answer your questions in this robe.

342
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,398
That is preposterous, Your Majesty.

343
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:26,069
For a loyal subject,
merely being accused of being a criminal

344
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,862
warrants one to be disrobed

345
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,906
with their hair loosened,
awaiting their punishment.

346
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,741
Please order him to take his robe off.

347
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,787
I shall take off my robe
and await your punishment

348
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,539
if I fail to answer your questions.

349
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,467
Principal Director.

350
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,221
You colluded with the Qing,

351
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,265
brought their troops into our land,

352
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,559
and ordered Senior Court Lady Dong

353
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,937
to…

354
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,451
You also ordered Senior Court Lady Dong

355
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,205
to assassinate the late king.

356
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,290
Do you confess to these crimes?

357
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,585
Your Majesty.

358
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,382
Your question does not make sense.

359
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,261
If I had given out such an order,

360
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,015
for whom do you think
I would have done so?

361
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,476
Then tell me, for whom
did you give her the poisoned rouge

362
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,395
and order her to assassinate me?

363
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,370
Answer my question!

364
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,920
I swear by the heavens' name

365
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,798
that I have never colluded with the Qing

366
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,427
or plotted the late king's death.

367
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,556
Moreover, I have never
even considered harming you.

368
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,062
Do you have evidence or witness
that I have done so?

369
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,539
Without a cause, justice falls apart.

370
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,375
I beseech you to see reason

371
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,880
and stop this reckless interrogation,
Your Majesty!

372
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,100
Your Majesty.

373
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,729
We have a witness
to right the cause and justice.

374
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,774
-Bring them in.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

375
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,471
What on earth are you doing?

376
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,433
I am here on a royal command
to arrest a criminal plotting treason.

377
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,645
Treason? That is ridiculous.

378
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,690
Who informed you of such a lie?

379
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,993
That little…

380
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:09,125
The Principal Director
openly boasted about his misdeeds.

381
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,671
Colluding with the Qing three years ago
to bring their troops into our land

382
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:19,510
and ordering Senior Court Lady Dong
to assassinate the late king

383
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,013
were all claimed as his own doing.

384
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:28,102
Furthermore, when you sought to uncover
his crimes of colluding with the Qing,

385
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,520
he said he would order

386
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,191
Court Lady Dong
to assassinate you as well.

387
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,279
I did not believe his words at first.

388
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,616
But upon hearing her of death,
I came to believe them.

389
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:46,704
Why did the Principal Director
share his intent to plot treason with you?

390
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,084
If you do not confess
your involvement in the treasonous plot,

391
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,590
I shall tell His Majesty
the lies you told three years ago

392
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,885
and request that you be punished
in the same way as my father.

393
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,429
You will then

394
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,600
be slaughtered like an animal
in front of everyone

395
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,852
and face a gruesome death.

396
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,149
That is because…

397
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,947
the Principal Director and I
plotted treason together.

398
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,116
The news of Court Lady Dong's death

399
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,452
led me to finally realize
the wrongs of my ways

400
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,414
-and confess my crimes to you.
-Your Majesty!

401
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,502
Every single word
of Yoo Hyun-bo's attestation is a lie.

402
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,714
I have committed no crimes!

403
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,814
Disrobe the criminal.

404
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,797
Begin the torture.

405
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,119
Do not stop…

406
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,040
until he confesses all his crimes.

407
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,899
Cease the torture.

408
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,114
Leave us for a while.

409
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,575
I must speak with the criminal alone.

410
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,305
Every single one of you shall leave.

411
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,976
-But Your Majesty--
-I seek to question my uncle…

412
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,273
on the disgraceful secrets
of the royal family, so leave.

413
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,276
Yes, Your Majesty.

414
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,780
Three years ago,

415
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,743
the night when my brother passed away,

416
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,876
I told you that I would accept my fate
before the main hall.

417
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,336
Do you remember it?

418
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,968
That was the moment

419
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,388
I set my mind for today.

420
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,481
I ascended to the throne…

421
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,572
for this very moment.

422
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,037
I ensured your ascent to the throne

423
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,831
by fair means and foul.

424
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,835
Is this truly

425
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,173
the reward for my loyalty?

426
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,802
How do you call yourself loyal

427
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,973
when you colluded with the enemy
and assassinated the king?

428
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,683
Uncle.

429
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,396
You are merely a base, treacherous subject

430
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,857
who sought to fulfill your selfish needs

431
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,611
by taking advantage of the king's power.

432
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,411
I took you for a dragon
that inherited our family's blood,

433
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,373
but you were nothing but a lowly worm.

434
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,543
You fool.

435
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,546
You are not a true king.

436
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,382
You are a fool

437
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,886
and nothing but a spy of the late king.

438
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,309
I have mulled over that notion

439
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,604
for the past three years.

440
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,108
"Am I worthy of the throne?"

441
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,571
"Is it right for me
to be this nation's king…

442
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,576
when I ascended to the throne…

443
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,040
with the help of a traitor?"

444
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,918
However, I now clearly understand…

445
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,467
that punishing you for your crimes

446
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,470
is my duty and right

447
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,347
as the king.

448
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,849
I swear to the heavens…

449
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,230
that I will not forgive you
for your crimes.

450
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,944
Your Majesty.

451
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:23,118
I am your one and only kin.

452
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,706
Abandoning me would be
severing the bond set by the heavens.

453
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:34,004
How would you endure
such disgrace and dishonor?

454
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,881
I already told you

455
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,594
that anyone who opposed me
should face death,

456
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,680
even my own kin.

457
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,723
Have you forgotten?

458
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,518
I am the king of this nation.

459
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,728
The king shall not be insulted.

460
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,025
Anyone who opposes me shall face death

461
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,943
and that includes

462
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,655
my kin who shares my blood.

463
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,505
What is your decision?

464
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,255
Look.

465
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,008
Will he be taken to the State Tribunal?

466
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,262
His Majesty commanded
that he be confined to his residence

467
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,014
until his punishment is decided.

468
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,228
There has never been a case

469
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,440
where the Queen Dowager's kin
went through such horrific interrogation

470
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,650
in the history of our nation.

471
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,277
It just may become

472
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,322
a more common occurrence now.

473
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,486
I owe Myung-ha a big debt.

474
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,615
The Sixth Royal Secretary
will not consider it a debt.

475
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:11,036
He now understands
the ordeal you went through

476
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,956
for His Royal Highness.

477
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,333
I am relieved he thinks that way.

478
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,814
Your Majesty.

479
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,359
What is the matter?

480
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,364
I do not understand these feelings.

481
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,828
On one hand,

482
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,163
I feel so hollow.

483
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,958
But at the same time,

484
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,336
I am afraid.

485
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:12,472
You have held on so far
for this day to come, Your Majesty.

486
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,810
As you would have forced yourself

487
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:19,104
to ignore your emotional
and physical exhaustion,

488
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,733
it would be abnormal for you

489
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,402
not to be engulfed by such emotions.

490
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,107
Your Majesty.

491
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,735
Please return to your quarters.

492
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,988
You must rest.

493
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,949
Staying with you…

494
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,746
is resting to me.

495
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,356
"Chu Dal-ha has committed a grave crime.

496
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,151
But as his report on the matter of the spy

497
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,528
has contributed greatly
to the exposure of treason,

498
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,155
his sentence shall be reduced

499
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,199
to being flogged 80 times
and 3 years of hard labor."

500
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,077
I shall sentence him accordingly.

501
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,246
"Yoo Hyun-bo's crimes are serious

502
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,332
as he plotted treason with Park Jong-hwan.

503
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,876
But as his attestation

504
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,420
has averted the treason from taking place,

505
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,174
he shall be exiled
far away from the capital."

506
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,884
I shall sentence him accordingly.

507
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,052
Your Majesty.

508
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,890
What is the punishment for Park Jong-hwan?

509
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,734
I am still deciding.

510
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,448
I only seek to make
the most prudent decision,

511
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,326
so await my verdict.

512
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,046
Wait one moment.

513
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,298
Do you have anyone to see you off?

514
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,385
How dare you presume
that no one would see me off?

515
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,438
Let us just go.

516
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,416
You have a long way ahead of you.
Use it to get some drinks.

517
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,127
Allow me a moment.

518
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,968
Time travels fast.

519
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,929
I will see you soon.

520
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,449
His Majesty requests you inside.

521
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,855
I am here to confess my crimes,
Your Majesty.

522
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,859
What crimes do you mean?

523
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,405
Thanks to Gidaeryeong Kang's help,

524
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,159
I reported Park Jong-hwan
and Yoo Hyun-bo's plots for treason

525
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,493
and avoided being punished.

526
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:29,581
But to speak the truth,
my heart was swayed by their offer,

527
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,374
and I joined hands with them briefly.

528
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,795
As such, please punish me as you see fit.

529
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,428
I have decided…

530
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,266
on the Principal Director's punishment.

531
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,898
He shall be made to drink poison.

532
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,650
Myung-ha,

533
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,362
you shall take the poison to him.

534
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,492
Witnessing the final moments
of the Principal Director…

535
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,329
is your punishment.

536
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,207
Do not be swayed ever again.

537
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,502
Let his end serve as a warning
not to follow in his footsteps.

538
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,301
Your Majesty.

539
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,471
I will engrave your kindness onto my bones
and carry out your command

540
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,431
to the best of my ability.

541
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,371
Your Majesty.

542
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,417
Convention has it that the crimes
of a royalty's kin go unpunished.

543
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,585
If you must punish him, exile him instead

544
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,963
and spare his life.

545
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,550
Mother.

546
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,803
The Principal Director…

547
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,265
must die.

548
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,269
That is the only way to right the wrongs

549
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,896
and make the people

550
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,316
consider me as a true king.

551
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,571
Your Majesty.

552
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,158
Your Majesty.

553
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,202
This is a desperate plea from your mother.

554
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,873
Will you still refuse it?

555
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,472
Escort her away.

556
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,645
Your Royal Highness.

557
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,107
-Let us go.
-Let me go!

558
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,156
I shall…

559
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,992
leave without aid.

560
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,148
Remember this.

561
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,777
This is the reward from His Majesty

562
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,323
for the sacrifices of his loyal subject.

563
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,694
It is truly delectable!

564
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,657
The Principal Director

565
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:03,081
seems to have dispatched a servant
to alert the Qing of his situation.

566
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,212
The Qing's envoy may bring approval
for the appointment of the Crown Prince

567
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,715
or lead the Emperor's general
along with its troops for war.

568
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,342
We cannot know for sure yet.

569
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,010
But should the Qing

570
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,473
attempt to interfere with our matters
using the Principal Director as a pretext,

571
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,228
I will fight back.

572
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,313
Your Majesty.

573
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,984
Your words are just and brave.

574
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:31,985
I shall

575
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,113
put my faith in your will and follow it.

576
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,740
I concur with the Inspector General.

577
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:42,161
And the court officials
will also support you as one.

578
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,040
I feel reassured to have you both.

579
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,169
Minister of War.

580
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,381
You shall keep your eye on the borders
and report back to me.

581
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,674
Yes, Your Majesty.

582
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,602
The Chief Royal Secretary is here,
Your Majesty.

583
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,855
Your Majesty.

584
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,523
Jung Je-pyo has reached Uiju

585
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,610
with a document approving
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

586
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,534
Send the Sixth Royal Secretary
and the Great Lord to receive him.

587
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,702
Yes, Your Majesty.

588
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,634
I have heard of your troubles
on your journey to bring

589
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,844
the document approving
the Crown Prince's appointment.

590
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,472
My travels were nothing

591
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,975
compared to the difficulties I suffered

592
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,519
from the Principal Director's death.

593
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,772
While staying in Uiju,

594
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,316
I had to send word countless times
to Prince Rui in Beijing

595
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,443
to apprise him of the situation.

596
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,862
It was quite troublesome.

597
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,323
In the end,

598
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:04,994
Prince Rui concluded that Joseon's matters
are the purview of the King of Joseon.

599
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,416
I am relieved he thinks that way.

600
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,671
This…

601
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,092
is my gift to you.

602
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:38,069
My greetings to Prince Rui.

603
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,154
The King of Joseon

604
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,991
has become aware of
my communication with the Great Qing

605
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,993
and is attempting to punish me.

606
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:50,081
This is clearly an attempt to drive out
the faction close to the Qing

607
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,166
and cut off the Qing's influence.

608
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,085
I believe it would be prudent

609
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,963
to summon the King to the Qing
to warn him of his actions.

610
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,299
With the Crown Prince
who can inherit the throne,

611
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,720
you would not have to worry
about the aftermath.

612
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,309
Is my gift to your liking?

613
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,563
Yes, it is.

614
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:25,658
What do you mean
Jung Je-pyo wishes to return to Joseon?

615
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,660
It is as it sounds, Your Majesty.

616
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,163
Along with the Emperor's letter,

617
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:34,417
Prince Rui's letter
also contains such content.

618
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:39,422
"I shall send the loyal subject of Qing,
Jung Je-pyo, back to Joseon.

619
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,424
Appoint him an official of your court

620
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,384
and show him your benevolence."

621
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:50,600
So they intend to dispatch a spy openly
and not in secret.

622
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,565
I am almost grateful.
I shall accept the offer.

623
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,401
The court shall discuss
a position to give him.

624
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,611
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,946
We shall do that.

626
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,532
Your Majesty.

627
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,454
I apologize, but Prince Rui's letter
contains another element of surprise.

628
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,374
What is it?

629
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,090
The Emperor…

630
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,136
wishes to play baduk with the gidaeryeong.

631
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:49,700
Your Majesty.

632
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:57,625
Right.

633
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,212
My mind trailed off.

634
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,683
The Qing's envoy

635
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,269
must have caused you distress.

636
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,480
It is nothing new.

637
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,484
Are they perhaps making
unreasonable demands

638
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,944
over the Principal Director's death?

639
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,112
Do not worry.

640
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,531
I do not intend
to give them what they want.

641
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,140
My lord.

642
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,977
It has been a while.

643
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,272
I was waiting for you
upon hearing the maddening news.

644
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,942
What news?

645
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,111
Have you not heard yet?

646
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,655
I hear Prince Rui's letter

647
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,949
contains a request
to have you sent to Beijing.

648
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,927
I told you I would not drink
even a single drop of water.

649
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,306
Do you take my orders as a joke?

650
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,935
Your Royal Highness.

651
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,770
You must drink.

652
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,147
At this rate, you will fall ill.

653
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,233
That is exactly my aim.

654
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,444
I must die

655
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:55,701
to make the King bitterly regret
not coming to visit me even once.

656
01:05:57,244 --> 01:06:00,206
He seems to be busy
receiving the Qing's envoy.

657
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,666
Please do not be upset.

658
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,586
A visit from the Qing's envoy
is nothing out of the ordinary.

659
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,175
Word has it that Prince Rui of the Qing

660
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,886
ordered the gidaeryeong
to be sent to Beijing.

661
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,888
Why would it matter to me

662
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,015
that a lowly gidaeryeong
is being summoned?

663
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,856
How is it that

664
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:30,695
he cannot spare a moment to visit me
because of such a trifling matter

665
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,156
when I am at death's door
from hunger and thirst?

666
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:51,841
What an…

667
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,762
undutiful son I have birthed.

668
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:05,688
Her Royal Highness
has not eaten or drunk for days.

669
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:06,814
At this rate,

670
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,692
something may truly happen to her.

671
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,860
I understand.

672
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,612
I shall prepare herbal medicine for her.

673
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:25,916
You wench!

674
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,169
Watch where you are going!

675
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,880
I apologize, my lady.

676
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,090
You do not use your sight as you should,

677
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,217
but you are eager
to put your tongue to use.

678
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,520
-What is this?
-That is mine!

679
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,404
Whose residence did you steal this from?

680
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,531
I did not steal it.

681
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,825
I received it.

682
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,243
This is highly valuable.

683
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,914
Who would ever give it to you,
and for what reason?

684
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,835
It was given to me…

685
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,756
by the late Senior Court Lady Dong.

686
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,135
Court Lady Dong?

687
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,604
What did she ask you to do in return?

688
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:32,817
What are you waiting for?

689
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,320
Hurry and tell Her Royal Highness
what you have seen and heard.

690
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:39,115
Why are you causing this ruckus?

691
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,450
The matter

692
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,577
pertains to the gidaeryeong.

693
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,706
What about him?

694
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:52,545
When His Majesty left the palace,

695
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,880
he was with another woman.

696
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,258
And this girl saw that woman.

697
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,259
However,

698
01:08:58,926 --> 01:08:59,969
that woman

699
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,930
was the gidaeryeong.

700
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,564
Have you seen it yourself?

701
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:16,360
I will take your life
if you are deceiving me.

702
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,573
How would I dare
speak falsehood before you?

703
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,285
I have seen with my two eyes

704
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:28,372
that the gidaeryeong is a woman.

705
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,138
Jageunnyeon.

706
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,976
What do you think of traveling to Beijing?

707
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,189
Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?

708
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,232
It is where my father is,

709
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:56,901
as is Bun-yeong.

710
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:01,155
They say the place has a market
for all rare items and records.

711
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,201
We could take it as an opportunity
to see the world and travel.

712
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,328
I would go if you would.

713
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,539
But do not even dream about it, my lady.

714
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,209
His Majesty would never approve of it.

715
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,733
Gidaeryeong Kang,
Her Royal Highness summons you.

716
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,151
Let me escort you.

717
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,029
I have prior engagement
with His Royal Highness.

718
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,615
May I ask why I am being summoned?

719
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,701
Could I not go see her later?

720
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:48,786
I am afraid not.

721
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,373
You will have to postpone
your visit to His Royal Highness.

722
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,253
I understand. Lead the way.

723
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:08,472
Master?

724
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:33,080
Why do you look so down
playing your baduk game?

725
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,126
Father.

726
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,046
I came by to see you
play against the gidaeryeong.

727
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,548
Where could he have gone

728
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,967
to leave you all alone?

729
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:47,594
It seemed like

730
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,514
Her Royal Highness had summoned him.

731
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,226
The Queen Dowager?

732
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,144
Yes.

733
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,439
I saw Master being escorted
by Senior Court Lady Han.

734
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:10,743
Your Royal Highness.

735
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,884
Human eyes can be so fickle.

736
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,430
You clearly look like a woman.

737
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,099
How did I not see it before?

738
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,814
You caught my eye
when you first greeted me

739
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,358
at the Queen's quarters.

740
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:49,031
That must have been…

741
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,244
because you were destined
to be my future daughter-in-law.

742
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,335
Let them in.

743
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,670
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

744
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,039
How do you like it?

745
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,793
Does it suit your taste?

746
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,712
Very well.

747
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,384
There.

748
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:55,431
The sewing and embroidery maids
stayed up all night to prepare this robe.

749
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,723
Try it on.

750
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,687
Come on now.

751
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:06,900
Your Royal Highness.

752
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:09,987
Forgive me,

753
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,866
but being His Majesty's gidaeryeong
is enough for me.

754
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,788
Who gave you
the permission to take it off?

755
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,877
Your distasteful habit
of not listening while I am being civil

756
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:29,173
slipped my mind.

757
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,675
Do not just stand about!

758
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,678
Strip her of this unseemly men's attire.

759
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,560
Let me go!

760
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,815
Here comes His Majesty.

761
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:56,241
Your Majesty.

762
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,791
Mother.

763
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,669
What is going on here?

764
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,222
Greetings, Your Majesty.

765
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,427
CAPTIVATING THE KING

766
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:01,056
Send the gidaeryeong to the Qing and issue
a decree for the selection of the queen.

767
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:05,060
They may call you their guest,
but who knows how they will treat you?

768
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,853
I will go to the Emperor.

769
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,689
Why do you insist on taking the risk?

770
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:11,316
I would gain means
to aid you and this nation.

771
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,986
There is no reason for me
to hesitate or dread it.

772
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,154
Even after three years,

773
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,950
I am no different
in that I still cannot protect you.

774
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,077
I promise

775
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,371
to return safely

776
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,541
and give you a chance to win against me.

777
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:35,507
