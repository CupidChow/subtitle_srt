00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,049
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,654
What are you two doing?

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,325
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,122
I asked what you two were doing.

6
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,667
I apologize, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,628
I was so filled with joy

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,464
that I treated the gidaeryeong
with great discourtesy.

9
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,843
What is this joyous occasion you speak of?

10
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,806
While delivering the baduk table,

11
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,352
I ran into Grand Prince Munseong
and Princess Jangryeong

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,397
and gave them my belated greetings
without your approval.

13
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,944
Not informing you
is a great crime in itself,

14
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,071
but I was so elated by the meeting

15
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,199
that I committed a great discourtesy
to the gidaeryeong.

16
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,117
Furthermore,

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,786
I displayed such misconduct
before your very eyes.

18
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,204
I am to blame for all this.

19
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,124
I will suffer whatever punishment,
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,591
The story in itself is trivial,

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,221
but it is rather strange.

22
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,852
How can one confess to their crime
with such confidence and boldness?

23
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,615
As you have reported
the matter regarding the Grand Prince,

24
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,201
I will not punish you on that end.

25
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,247
I am truly grateful, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,542
The punishment for your misconduct
to Mong-woo is not mine to decide.

27
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,501
It is up to him.

28
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,794
What will you do?

29
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,301
As the Sixth Royal Secretary
has acknowledged his misbehavior,

30
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,344
if you do not find it punishable,

31
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,722
I will turn a blind eye as well.

32
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,601
How understanding of you.

33
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,518
In the end,

34
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,271
you are asking me to turn a blind eye.

35
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,940
Is that not right?

36
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,491
Do not stir up trouble again

37
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,119
with such rash behavior.

38
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,914
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,081
I will keep that in mind.

40
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,637
I will head to Yeongchwijeong.

41
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,181
Follow me, Mong-woo.

42
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,468
Have you and Kim Myung-ha
decided to repair your bond?

43
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,055
Excuse my bluntness,

44
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,892
but the Sixth Royal Secretary and I
do not share a bond worth repairing.

45
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,602
Then what bond do you share?

46
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,860
Do you not want to tell me?

47
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,448
Our ties as acquaintances
were severed long ago.

48
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,410
We truly have no bond to speak of.

49
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,205
That is a lie.

50
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,294
Kim Myung-ha was afraid
that I might fault you

51
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,546
and confessed to a crime
before I even inquired.

52
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,798
You also used me as an excuse

53
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,508
and asked me to turn a blind eye.

54
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,885
No pair would act thusly

55
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,596
without a bond between them.

56
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,682
Respectfully,

57
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,893
I must assure you
that I only let the matter go

58
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,228
so as not to disturb you further.

59
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,772
I did not intend to protect him
in the slightest.

60
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,441
It may be so for you,

61
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,359
but Kim Myung-ha

62
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,946
seemed to want a strong bond with you.

63
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,033
He even told you
the shortcut to Yeongchwijeong.

64
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,870
I apologize,

65
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,831
but I have no way of knowing
what he may be feeling.

66
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,625
It would be better
to question him yourself.

67
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,506
You no longer demand to be killed
rather than to be treated with suspicion.

68
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,053
I cannot risk my life
every time I sit at a baduk table.

69
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,816
We shall end it here today.

70
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,330
Is Grand Prince Munseong…

71
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,626
a worthy student?

72
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,213
Yes, Your Majesty.

73
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,090
Does he have talent?

74
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,883
Yes.

75
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,511
His attitude and motivation
are both excellent.

76
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,431
You may ask for anything you need.

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,439
It would be helpful to have
baduk game records he can refer to.

78
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,112
There should be some at the library
for the Grand Prince to look over.

79
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,614
I will let them know.

80
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,202
I shall leave now, Your Majesty.

81
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,441
Your Majesty.

82
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,278
Do you believe in Kim Myung-ha
and Kang Mong-woo's excuses?

83
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,240
Is there a reason not to?

84
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,035
They were implicated
in the false attestation three years ago,

85
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,746
where they tried to
accuse you of being a spy.

86
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,540
It is only natural to suspect them.

87
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,042
I am aware of that incident,

88
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,421
and they both know of my knowledge.

89
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,507
What could they possibly do?

90
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
However, Your Majesty--

91
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,386
I have already killed Mong-woo once.

92
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,766
As he has returned to me alive,

93
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,106
I intend to protect him this time
no matter what happens.

94
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,777
If he is plotting treason against you,

95
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,863
what will you do?

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,409
That is all the more reason
to protect him.

97
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,453
To me, a treacherous thought is loyalty.

98
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,496
Your Majesty.

99
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,541
I know what you are concerned about.

100
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,211
I shall keep that in mind and be alert.

101
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,297
Do not bring up today's incident further.

102
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,384
Yes, Your Majesty.

103
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,695
He seems so familiar.

104
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,405
Excuse me.

105
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,074
Greetings, my lord.

106
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,159
My name is Man-bok.

107
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,663
There is someone
who dearly wishes to meet you.

108
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,747
Please come with me.

109
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,006
The lord you serve

110
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,842
is Third Minister of Rites Yoo Hyun-bo,

111
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,053
-is that not right?
-Excuse me?

112
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,598
Yes, you are right.

113
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,475
I have in fact been waiting for this.

114
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,310
How fortunate.

115
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,734
A new wind will blow in the court.

116
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,237
The gidaeryeong
declined Her Royal Highness's offer

117
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,239
and sided with Her Majesty.

118
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,866
Everything will only get better
from here on out.

119
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,787
My lord.

120
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,164
Have you met the gidaeryeong yet?

121
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,458
He is not someone one can meet easily.

122
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,919
I have not even gotten a glimpse of him.

123
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,463
Come to think of it,

124
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,427
you promised to have the gidaeryeong
on his knees before me.

125
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,886
What is taking so long?

126
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,556
I hope you are not trying to deny
saying those words.

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,603
I was afraid you would think so

128
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,856
and went ahead
and arranged this meeting today.

129
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,733
You mean

130
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,068
the guest who will be arriving soon is…

131
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,613
My lord.

132
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,281
It is me, Man-bok.

133
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,954
Why are you alone?

134
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,789
Where is the gidaeryeong?

135
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,919
What happened?

136
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,463
My apologies, my lord.

137
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,133
The gidaeryeong refused to come
and asked me to convey his message.

138
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,552
What message?

139
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,098
The only person
who can order me to come and go

140
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,601
is His Majesty alone.

141
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,395
If he wishes to see me,

142
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,731
he should come to me.

143
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,864
Are those really the words of that brat?

144
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,532
Well…

145
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,534
Yes, my lord.

146
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,787
He made me repeat it several times,

147
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,831
saying that I must convey
the message word for word.

148
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,924
My lord.

149
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,218
Where exactly is the humor in this?

150
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,138
He is a lowly bastard, not even worthy
of the lowest possible post.

151
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,017
How dare he disobey
a minister-level official's summons?

152
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,439
Since when did the discipline
within the court become so lax?

153
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,403
That lowly bastard
just may become His Majesty's confidant.

154
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,280
Someone who has the guts to decline
Her Royal Highness's offer

155
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,825
would have no reason to be afraid of you.

156
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,162
I must leave.

157
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,958
Please wait, my lord.

158
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,211
I will immediately go
and bring him by his hair.

159
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,295
Let it go.

160
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,423
Do not stir up needless trouble

161
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,092
and focus on getting that
gambling den of yours disbanded.

162
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,365
Where does that brat live?

163
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,285
I hear he is staying in Banchon Village.

164
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,078
I think

165
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,373
you may be able to recognize him, my lord.

166
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,083
You think I would recognize him?

167
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,586
Who is he?

168
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,214
The baduk gambler
who should have died three years ago.

169
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,717
Hongjang's patron.

170
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,012
That is utter nonsense.

171
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,889
How dare you lie to me?

172
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,848
I am only

173
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,559
telling you what I have seen, my lord!

174
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,191
You must have seen a ghost

175
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,568
in your scatterbrained state.

176
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,623
You may enter.

177
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,849
You brat.

178
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,607
So it is true.

179
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,318
You survived.

180
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,114
How did you…

181
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,077
Does His Majesty know about this?

182
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,540
Of course not.

183
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,417
Had he known…

184
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,966
he would not have allowed
a government post to a traitor.

185
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,429
You hold office though you took off
upon hearing the news of war,

186
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,807
persecuted your sister, and had her killed

187
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,435
despite her acts of protecting her family
and staying by her mother's deathbed.

188
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,563
So why can I not hold one?

189
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,359
How dare you condemn me, you bastard?

190
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,907
Here comes His Majesty!

191
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,712
What brings you here, Hyun-bo?

192
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
Well…

193
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,593
Your Majesty.

194
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,721
I have important news
I must share with you.

195
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,806
It is about this man, the gidaeryeong--

196
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,808
What about him?

197
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,019
Your Majesty.

198
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,063
Do you truly not recognize him?

199
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,984
He is the baduk gambler
who gave a false attestation

200
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,487
to frame you as a spy three years ago.

201
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,337
Do you think I have lost my sanity?

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,881
No, Your Majesty.

203
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,800
I would not dare to think that.

204
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,803
It is not as if Kang Mong-woo
is wearing a mask to hide his face.

205
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,014
Unless I have lost my sanity,

206
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,850
why would I not recognize him?

207
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,774
Do you have anything more to say?

208
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,984
I do not.

209
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,402
You are dismissed.

210
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,154
Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,671
I brought the game records
for the Grand Prince.

212
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,547
I will go see him,

213
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,508
so follow me.

214
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

215
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,348
What is going on?

216
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,186
Does everyone know who he is
except for me?

217
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,647
That cannot be.

218
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,900
If everyone had known,
the Great Lord would have known as well.

219
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,194
However, he did not seem to be aware.

220
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:33,200
That means His Majesty is the only one
who knows of this fact.

221
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,664
Why would he keep him by his side?

222
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,379
You always seem to find trouble
whenever you leave my sight.

223
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,755
My apologies, Your Majesty.

224
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,424
You are not to blame.

225
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,552
I am to blame for not foreseeing this.

226
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,972
I will command the Special Firearms Unit

227
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,807
to keep an eye on you at all times.

228
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,725
That is that.

229
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,978
Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,363
Why are you keeping quiet, Grand Prince?

231
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,657
You should express your gratitude
to His Majesty.

232
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,789
Your Majesty,

233
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,459
may I truly accept this?

234
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,211
Why do you ask me such a question?

235
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,297
This book contains

236
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,008
the record of baduk games

237
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,511
between my late father and you.

238
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,057
It is far too valuable for me to read.

239
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,143
You may accept it.

240
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,480
I brought it here to give to you.

241
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,149
Your Majesty.

242
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,818
After I have learned much
from the gidaeryeong

243
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,320
and become a proficient player,

244
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,283
may I request a game of baduk with you?

245
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,952
As my late father passed away
when I was too young,

246
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,081
I do not have much memory of him.

247
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,544
I would like to hear your stories of him
over a game of baduk.

248
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,545
Grand Prince,

249
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,381
you are being impertinent
with an abrupt request.

250
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,591
Be quiet, Princess.

251
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,676
My apologies, Your Majesty.

252
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,057
If you wish to play baduk with me,

253
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,643
being proficient is not enough.

254
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,812
You must be as good as the gidaeryeong.

255
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,563
What do you think?

256
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,816
Do you see his potential?

257
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,985
If one pours their heart and soul into it,

258
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,071
there is no obstacle one cannot overcome.

259
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,740
If His Highness gives it his best,

260
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,285
he will one day become
an even better baduk player than me.

261
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,412
All right.

262
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,374
I will promise you a game,

263
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,210
as Mong-woo has vouched for you.

264
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,715
Your Majesty, I have one more request.

265
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,716
Grand Prince.

266
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,261
What is it?

267
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,346
I…

268
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,391
would like to accompany you
on your upcoming journey.

269
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,398
This is the first gisinje
after the mourning period.

270
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,358
As the late king's son,

271
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,068
I would like to honor him.

272
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,196
I implore you to grant my request.

273
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,547
You cannot enter.
He ordered to keep people away!

274
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,050
My lord.

275
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,636
What insolence is this?

276
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,015
I have an urgent matter
to report to the Principal Director.

277
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,184
You may leave.

278
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,771
Make sure

279
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,524
to report this list
to His Majesty yourself.

280
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,734
I will, Lord Park.

281
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,076
You will regret it
if you do not hear this news.

282
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,621
It is about the identity
of the gidaeryeong.

283
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,630
The identity of the gidaeryeong?

284
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,012
You were not aware, just as I thought.

285
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,766
However, His Majesty was aware of it.

286
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,186
You may leave us.

287
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,907
My lord.

288
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,076
I have a request to make

289
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,411
before I share this news.

290
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
There is an old saying

291
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,583
that a well-fed dog
bites the hand that fed it.

292
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,670
While witnessing Kim Jong-bae's demise,

293
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,463
I made a vow to myself

294
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,216
that regardless of your flattery,

295
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,177
I would not feed you
under any circumstances.

296
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,683
So…

297
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,561
what of the gidaeryeong's identity?

298
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,697
Your Majesty.

299
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,284
That is the list of officials
who will baejong you on your journey.

300
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,994
BAEJONG: ACCOMPANYING THE KING

301
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,582
So many officials are unnecessary
when we are trying to reduce the cost.

302
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,668
Reduce the number by more than half…

303
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,088
and add Grand Prince Munseong to the list.

304
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,762
Your Majesty.

305
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,433
I advise you not to take
Grand Prince Munseong with you.

306
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,435
The journey will be arduous,

307
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,980
and this one in particular will not allow
his servants to accompany him.

308
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,941
It will be too taxing
for the young Grand Prince.

309
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,776
The Grand Prince

310
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,988
is old enough to handle the difficulties
of traveling for filial duty.

311
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
Do not worry about his caretaker.

312
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,577
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo will serve him.

313
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,006
He has never had
the Grand Prince accompany him.

314
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,676
Why is His Majesty taking him this time?

315
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,303
You are wrong.

316
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,222
The Grand Prince is a pretext
to take the gidaeryeong.

317
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,558
That is ridiculous.

318
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,810
We shall see if I am right or not.

319
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,403
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

320
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,197
is the baduk gambler

321
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,825
who tried to harm His Majesty
with a false attestation three years ago.

322
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,954
He is also the man His Majesty kept close
before ascending to the throne.

323
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,211
Myung-ha! Hold on!

324
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,843
You know who Kang Mong-woo really is,
do you not?

325
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,679
What do you mean by that?

326
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,767
You warned me not to get too close
to Kang Mong-woo.

327
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,894
You must have said that for a reason.

328
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,314
Why? Did someone say something?

329
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,567
Yoo Hyun-bo was eagerly claiming

330
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,320
that he had news regarding him
for the Principal Director.

331
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,368
What is going on?

332
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:32,828
Myung-ha!

333
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,883
Greetings, Sixth Royal Secretary.

334
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,972
I am alone.

335
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,267
I came out of concern.

336
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,146
I hear Yoo Hyun-bo has been telling others
about your identity.

337
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,982
Are you all right?

338
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,525
Do not worry.

339
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,654
Yoo Hyun-bo only started talking
at the perfect time as I had intended.

340
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,116
What do you mean by the perfect time?

341
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,495
Did you also intend

342
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,789
the Grand Prince's matter?

343
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,419
Could you ask
if I can accompany His Majesty

344
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,087
on his journey this year?

345
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,634
Why do you not ask him yourself,
Your Highness?

346
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,890
Are you afraid?

347
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,062
It requires bravery
to be resolute despite being afraid.

348
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,231
Be brave.

349
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,569
That way, you will not have any regrets
even if you fail.

350
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,575
It is too dangerous.

351
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,079
It is fortunate that the King
assented without becoming furious,

352
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,790
but the Queen Dowager
and Park Jong-hwan will not sit back.

353
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,084
One cannot plot against the throne

354
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,086
without taking any risks.

355
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,548
Moreover, the true dangers

356
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,009
have already taken place.

357
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,306
The King ascended to the throne
after murdering your father,

358
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,141
Hongjang died,

359
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,061
and all contact with my father was lost

360
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,313
after he was taken
to Shenyang as a prisoner.

361
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,817
Do you not agree?

362
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,571
I am sure

363
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,157
your father is still alive.

364
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,327
If he were,
he would have returned at all costs.

365
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,121
-My lady.
-Do not call me that.

366
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,334
Kang Hee-soo died three years ago.

367
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,212
I am now…

368
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,131
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

369
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,807
Sever all your emotional ties
to Kang Hee-soo.

370
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,017
If you do not do so,

371
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,978
my plans and means will lose power,

372
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,688
and we will fall in danger.

373
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,523
If you are referring to the last time,

374
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,276
do not worry.

375
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,028
I promise not to make another mistake.

376
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,864
The King said
he would not make an issue out of it.

377
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,534
He is already suspicious of us.

378
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,453
He may be laying down traps

379
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,123
just as he did three years ago.

380
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,674
I will not be deceived
by his trickery again.

381
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,011
Make your decision.

382
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,400
You cannot take
Grand Prince Munseong with you.

383
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,945
It will disturb the peace of the court
and bring about disaster.

384
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,449
If the peace of the court
is disturbed by a child like him,

385
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,493
then it is not true peace.

386
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,288
Your Majesty.

387
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,750
Do you truly not understand
what I am concerned about?

388
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,378
Ill rumors are still going around
among the people as is.

389
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,340
There is no reason to start another one.

390
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,758
By ill rumors,

391
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,221
do you mean the one about
how I murdered my own brother?

392
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,061
That is all the more reason
for me to take the Grand Prince with me.

393
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,730
The people should see with their own eyes

394
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,650
that I am close to him
for the rumors to dissipate.

395
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,199
Do not worry.

396
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,994
Letting one child accompany me
will not cause any trouble.

397
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,174
There is one question
that I cannot seem to solve.

398
00:27:56,257 --> 00:28:00,011
How is it that Grand Prince Munseong
is still alive?

399
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,013
To dispose of him,

400
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,266
we must tread carefully while gauging
the scholars' and the people's sentiments.

401
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,601
Otherwise,

402
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,686
the moment we move against him,

403
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,356
His Majesty and the royal family
will fall under suspicion.

404
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,652
Continue speaking.

405
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,445
When the time is right,

406
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,115
I shall have the Grand Prince
leave the palace

407
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,283
and carry out the duty.

408
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:29,290
This chaos arose after Gidaeryeong Kang
was named his baduk tutor.

409
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,254
I sought to get rid of trouble
but ended up causing more.

410
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,676
Why can you not win the King's heart

411
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,429
when even that lowly man could so easily?

412
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,931
His Majesty

413
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,936
is suspecting me
of murdering the late king.

414
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,898
My brother was poisoned to death.

415
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,489
Tell me, who did it?

416
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,703
Are you saying

417
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,832
that is the reason why the King
is wary of his one and only uncle?

418
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,209
Even if that were to be true,

419
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,587
the King ascended to the throne
thanks to you.

420
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,047
I am sure there is another reason.

421
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,383
I apologize,

422
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,636
but there cannot be any other reason.

423
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,145
What will you do about Kang Mong-woo?

424
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,733
Let us keep an eye on him
for the time being.

425
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,904
He might be more useful than I expected.

426
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,901
I would like to accompany you
on your upcoming journey.

427
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,654
This is the first gisinje
after the mourning period.

428
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,614
As the late king's son,

429
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,407
I would like to honor him.

430
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,787
Your Majesty.

431
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,624
Captain Joo Sang-hwa
of the Special Firearms Unit is here.

432
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,917
Let him in.

433
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,144
Your Majesty, did you summon me?

434
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,314
Are your men still tailing Kang Mong-woo?

435
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,315
No, Your Majesty.

436
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,235
I withdrew the order
after confirming where he was staying.

437
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,279
Shall I command them to keep tailing him?

438
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,282
Tail one more person.

439
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,076
Have them follow Yoo Hyun-bo as well.

440
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,538
Not Kim Myung-ha, but Yoo Hyun-bo?

441
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,581
Yes.

442
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,041
Third Minister of Rites Yoo Hyun-bo.

443
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,837
As you wish, Your Majesty.

444
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,098
I will double the amount if you succeed.

445
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,060
Who shall I take care of?

446
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,814
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

447
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,235
Make sure he cannot play baduk ever again.

448
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,704
My lady.

449
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,915
The guest you have been
waiting for is here.

450
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,541
Let them in.

451
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,754
-My lady.
-Bun-yeong.

452
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,095
We finally meet
despite working in a close vicinity.

453
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,473
They say the inner palace
is the most secluded place for a reason.

454
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,266
Thank you for last time.

455
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,394
You really helped me out.

456
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,272
Since you praise me so much,

457
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,566
I am utterly at a loss for words.

458
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,529
Have Master Chu and Se-dong returned?

459
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,030
Not yet.

460
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,408
It looks like they will take longer.

461
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,035
My lady.

462
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,496
Then may we bring food out
for Bun-yeong first?

463
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,248
Yes, you may.

464
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,295
What is all this?

465
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,257
What do you think?

466
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,219
I cooked with all my heart
for my dear daughter.

467
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,098
Here.

468
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,808
Eat up.

469
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,148
It finally feels like I am eating.

470
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,816
What?

471
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,569
Do they still eat meals without you?

472
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,697
That is not it, Mother.

473
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,618
My stomach feels empty
no matter how much I eat in the palace.

474
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,662
Such is the life of any on the payroll.

475
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,499
By the way,

476
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,795
your stipend from last month
was much lower than usual.

477
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,634
I am sorry, Mother.

478
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,678
I was trying to spend less, but…

479
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,475
Her using what small wage she could
to win people's hearts

480
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,352
is what allowed her
to help Lady Hee-soo out.

481
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,189
Fine, I get it.

482
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,649
My goodness.

483
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,235
You have grown a lot, Jageunnyeon.

484
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,572
I used to outrank you by far
on having a glib tongue.

485
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,867
You should change your name
to Keunnyeon, as in mature woman.

486
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,369
I will treat you with due deference
to an older sister.

487
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,747
Your acknowledgment is enough,
little sister.

488
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,582
Goodness me.

489
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,750
Eat up.

490
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,983
You were right.

491
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,984
However,

492
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,655
allow me some time
as it will not be an easy task.

493
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,449
Time to let go of my feelings, that is.

494
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,035
Feelings for whom?

495
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:24,914
Why?

496
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,209
-What is the matter?
-You startled me!

497
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,628
Gosh, my apologies.

498
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,589
I will tread with sound
and cough next time.

499
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,182
What is with him?
Why is he acting so strangely?

500
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,061
Do not tell me

501
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,439
he still has feelings
for Lord Kang Hang-soon's daughter.

502
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,319
It appears so.

503
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,490
I thought he had moved on
as he did not ask after her,

504
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,367
but he still must not have done so.

505
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,288
What brings you here, my lord?

506
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,832
-Are you here for the baduk table?
-Yes.

507
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,418
No, that is not it.

508
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,211
I came to advise you on something.

509
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,755
As you will be accompanying
the Grand Prince on the journey,

510
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,465
it would be good to know this in advance.

511
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,853
Around the time of the gisinje each year,
His Majesty's behavior becomes erratic.

512
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,980
-It is so extreme
-Please forgive me!

513
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,817
that some even wonder
if it is not some seasonal insanity.

514
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,737
He becomes furious
over the smallest blunders.

515
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,072
Even Senior Court Lady Dong,
His Majesty's favorite,

516
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,866
treads lightly during this time.

517
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,122
Is His Majesty well?

518
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,543
He refuses to eat and drink
and stays in Yeongchwijeong day and night.

519
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,504
Court officials implored him
to come out several times.

520
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,177
Then he would suddenly
take the Special Firearms Unit

521
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,596
and leave the palace without a word,

522
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,641
turning the palace upside down.

523
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,562
Are you saying he suddenly behaves so
without showing any signs earlier?

524
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,647
There had been a sign.

525
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,773
In fact, it is…

526
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,070
Actually, I visited the
Royal Astronomical Observatory earlier,

527
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,113
and they said he would be fine this year.

528
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,035
But we should still be careful
as another outburst may hit us whenever.

529
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,342
I came to escort His Highness.

530
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,554
Come on out, Grand Prince.

531
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,362
Master.

532
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,949
Your Highness.

533
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,619
Did you just call me your master?

534
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,745
Yes.

535
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,497
Baduk is a long journey of learning,

536
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,166
which makes you my master.

537
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,462
Shall we?

538
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,484
Your Highness.

539
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,071
Principal Director.

540
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,366
Gidaeryeong.

541
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,577
This is Lord Park Jong-hwan.
Show your respect.

542
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,541
Greetings to you, Principal Director.

543
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,419
I am Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

544
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,888
Please look after His Highness.

545
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,492
The Principal Director
came to see you, Master.

546
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,912
I am aware, Your Highness.

547
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,837
Lady Hee-soo sure is something.

548
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,840
She is accompanying His Majesty
on a journey only a select few can join.

549
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,842
She is indeed a lady of her word.

550
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,927
Do you not agree?

551
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,313
By the way, where did Master Chu
leave so early in the morning?

552
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,774
How am I supposed to know?

553
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,401
I did not even notice him leaving.

554
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,530
It is her memorial day in a few days.

555
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,699
My goodness.

556
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,493
It is Hongjang's memorial day.

557
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,871
Without a grave
to perform a memorial service to,

558
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,207
I keep forgetting the date every year.

559
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,835
What do you mean there is no grave?

560
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,504
Master Chu's heart
is her grave and shrine.

561
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,301
You are right.

562
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,387
Chief Royal Secretary, what is going on?

563
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,680
Where is His Majesty?

564
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,807
I cannot tell you his whereabouts.

565
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,100
How dare you?

566
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,768
You still call yourself
the Chief Royal Secretary?

567
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,604
Great Lord, please calm down.

568
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,813
You back off!

569
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,066
Seeing how composed
the Chief Royal Secretary looks,

570
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,068
His Majesty is well.

571
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,906
I am sure he will return before midnight.

572
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,272
Do not attack.

573
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,900
I bring a letter for His Majesty.

574
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,449
The man before you is His Majesty.

575
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,204
It is a great honor
for a lowly man like me to meet you!

576
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,372
You may stand.

577
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,795
You have a letter for me?

578
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,005
I do, Your Majesty.

579
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,279
Thank you for the letter.

580
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,115
As I shall find what is lost at all costs,

581
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,076
make sure you tell them not to worry.

582
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

583
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,706
I shall make my way back, Your Majesty.

584
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,484
I want to play the game as well.

585
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,611
Forgive me, Your Highness.

586
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,030
They are not playing but training.

587
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,451
His Majesty commanded them
to train like in a real match.

588
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,329
As such, he only discouraged you
from playing out of concern.

589
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,789
Please do not be disappointed.

590
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,043
I shall tour the grounds with my master.

591
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,130
Your Highness.

592
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,893
Your Highness.

593
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,189
I asked with the full knowledge
that I could not play.

594
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,025
This is my first time
away from the palace,

595
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,277
and I wished to do something memorable.

596
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,816
All right! Any more challengers?

597
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,486
-Challenge him!
-Challenge him!

598
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,989
-Challenge him!
-Challenge him!

599
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,829
We have a challenger!

600
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,041
The Grand Prince and the gidaeryeong
are there, Your Majesty.

601
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,639
I have no intention of challenging you.

602
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,409
If you give up,

603
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,119
we shall count it toward your loss.

604
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,664
Let us go easy.

605
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,249
Easy.

606
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,818
When holding a sword,

607
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,695
you must be on your guard at all times.

608
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,312
You are exceptional, Master!

609
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:41,567
-Challenge him!
-Challenge him!

610
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,990
-Challenge him!
-Challenge him!

611
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,241
-Challenge him!
-Challenge him!

612
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,623
One game is enough for me.

613
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,959
I will stop here.

614
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,854
You acted all high and mighty.

615
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,480
Do not act weak now.

616
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,609
Let us finish this.

617
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,954
Your Majesty!

618
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,124
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

619
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,792
Your Majesty.

620
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,680
Master, are you all right?

621
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,938
Your Majesty.

622
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,778
I did command you to train
as if you were fighting our enemies,

623
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,530
but I did not expect you
to obey my command so well.

624
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,283
The gidaeryeong's frame
is much smaller than yours.

625
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,410
As such, I shall face you.

626
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,995
Pardon?

627
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:22,209
How could I dare
to wield a sword against you?

628
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,711
That cannot happen.

629
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,171
I will allow it.

630
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,632
Wield your sword as you please.

631
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,514
Your Majesty.

632
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,641
No, this is too dangerous.

633
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,397
Step back.

634
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,458
You may attack me first.

635
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,426
Put your heart into it.

636
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,786
This is why I tried to hold him back.

637
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,294
Are you injured?

638
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,172
This is a great honor, Your Majesty.

639
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,048
I am not injured at all.

640
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,471
You train…

641
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,099
to protect yourself

642
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,311
as well as your comrades.

643
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,440
You must care for your comrades

644
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,193
as much as yourself
to survive on the battlefield

645
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,486
and become the victor.

646
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,739
No matter how exceptional you are,

647
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,242
should you look down on
and injure your comrade senselessly,

648
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,828
your action will be
considered insubordination

649
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,705
and punished harshly.

650
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,956
Do you understand?

651
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,000
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

652
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,435
What were you doing here?

653
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:46,895
Your Majesty.

654
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,481
I asked him if he could show me around.

655
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,614
It is time for gisinje soon.

656
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,658
You will be held accountable

657
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,868
after we have returned to the palace, so…

658
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,874
What is the matter?

659
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,680
You are bleeding.

660
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,016
I am fine, Your Majesty.

661
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,434
That is ridiculous.

662
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,853
Bring the royal physician immediately.

663
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,854
Yes, Your Majesty.

664
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,825
Are you all right, Your Highness?

665
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,494
I rushed here upon hearing the news
of a royal physician being summoned.

666
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,789
My master was injured, and not me.

667
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,543
Are you saying Kang Mong-woo was injured?

668
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,212
Captain Joo, where is the gidaeryeong?

669
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,092
He is being treated
by the royal physician in there.

670
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,303
Wait, is that not…

671
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,930
His Majesty's residence?

672
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,894
Are you saying he allowed
the gidaeryeong to enter his residence?

673
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,104
Yes.

674
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,324
What do you mean
you do not want to be treated?

675
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,826
This injury was inflicted

676
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,288
by a patrolman's sword three years ago.

677
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,374
As you are aware,

678
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,544
even a physician cannot do much
for such a wound.

679
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,839
And that is why you refuse?

680
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,718
As it is but an old wound acting up,

681
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,596
I should get better with some rest.

682
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,314
Your Majesty.

683
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:58,318
Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha
seeks your audience.

684
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,402
Let him in.

685
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,207
Your Majesty, you must leave now.

686
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,250
It is almost midnight.

687
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,593
This is a royal command.

688
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,804
Tend to Gidaeryeong's wound.

689
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,223
Yes, Your Majesty.

690
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,947
You heard His Majesty.

691
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,490
Please show me your wound.

692
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,250
Please take this back.

693
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,254
I will reward you
three times the agreed amount.

694
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,798
I cannot do it
even if you offer a fortune.

695
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,218
I will pretend none of it ever happened,
so do not seek me again.

696
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,471
You are bleeding.

697
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,431
I am fine, Your Majesty.

698
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,766
That is ridiculous.

699
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,225
Bring the royal physician immediately.

700
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,226
Yes, Your Majesty.

701
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,787
How was the treatment for Kang Mong-woo?

702
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,871
Did he…

703
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,249
show his wound willingly?

704
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,090
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have treated him well.

705
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,717
I see.

706
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,678
That is a relief.

707
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,894
Please, Royal Physician Ji.

708
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,731
Please tell His Majesty
that you have finished treating me.

709
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,318
I did promise Master Choam to aid you,

710
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,903
but this is a royal command.

711
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,696
I cannot go against his command.

712
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,824
I will take responsibility.

713
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,785
There will not be any issues.

714
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,664
Let me at least apply some ointment.

715
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,166
If you give it to me,

716
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,086
I shall do so after resting.

717
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:06,881
As you wish.

718
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,561
Brother.

719
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,357
I shall liberate myself
from the pain of the past

720
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,902
and prepare for what is yet to come.

721
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,825
No amount of fear and disgrace

722
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,704
will be able to stop me.

723
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,878
Please do watch over me
until the very end.

724
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,056
Goodness!

725
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,266
This is troubling!

726
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,644
What is the matter?

727
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,686
Drizzle.

728
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,356
This is the sign
that drives His Majesty into insanity.

729
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,108
I must inform the officials.

730
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,744
This drizzle

731
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,580
is the sign that leads to his insanity?

732
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,086
It cannot be.

733
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:26,557
From now on,

734
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,394
you are Mongwoo.

735
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,399
My manghyeongjiu,

736
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:36,984
Mongwoo.

737
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,254
Why are you outside?

738
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,257
The rain…

739
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,137
It is drizzling.

740
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,226
Indeed.

741
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,981
It has been a while
since we had a mongwoo.

742
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,372
We will catch a cold. Let us go in.

743
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,925
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

744
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,979
You dislike me.

745
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,860
No, Your Majesty.

746
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,825
Do you like me then?

747
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,088
I do.

748
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,346
I…

749
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,814
like you, Mong-woo.

750
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,268
CAPTIVATING THE KING

751
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,563
Do you not mind the rumors going around?

752
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,900
Even if anyone dares to
condemn me for being attracted to men

753
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,526
and laugh at me to my face,

754
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,904
I, too, will laugh aloud with them.

755
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,698
Is there a way to stop the rumors?

756
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,201
The most certain way
is to expel the gidaeryeong.

757
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,413
What harm did Kang Mong-woo inflict on me?

758
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:21,667
Senior Court Lady Dong is officially
spending the night with His Majesty.

759
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,754
I have severed my emotional ties.

760
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,256
Now, it is your turn.

761
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,510
Comb through the capital
and find Kang Mong-woo.

762
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,890
I only had eyes for you
and wanted you from the outset.

763
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:41,854
