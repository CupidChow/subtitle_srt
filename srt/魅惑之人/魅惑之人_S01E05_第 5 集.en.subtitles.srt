00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,423
EPISODE 5

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,232
My lady.

4
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,735
It has been a long time
since I have sent word to you.

5
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,031
The Special Firearms Unit
has been more alert to uncover

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,158
any suspicious behavior
since early last month,

7
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,743
so I had to be cautious.

8
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,996
The vigilance has increased
in and out of the palace

9
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,333
as the First Senior Consort

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,002
was caught sneaking a shaman
into the palace to perform rituals

11
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,713
-in hopes of bearing the King's son.
-How dare you!

12
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,839
-Hurry!
-What are you doing?

13
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,300
-She was expelled and exiled that day.
-Let me go!

14
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,718
However, before she was exiled,

15
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,971
she implored His Majesty that
Her Royal Highness approved the ritual,

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,474
so the palace was turned upside down.

17
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,059
Please forgive me!

18
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,478
Her Royal Highness gave me her permission!

19
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,109
Your Majesty!

20
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,403
It is a greater sin
to be unfilial than disloyal.

21
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,405
Your people are watching.

22
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,323
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,493
Her Majesty and the Great Lord
tried to soothe his anger

24
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,120
but to no avail.

25
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,747
His Majesty refused
to see Her Royal Highness

26
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,792
and stormed out for a walk,
raising an uproar.

27
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,586
Go find His Majesty immediately!

28
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,132
According to the maids
of the King's quarters,

29
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,552
Senior Court Lady Dong
is to blame for all of it.

30
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,097
His Majesty does not care
for Her Majesty and the concubines.

31
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,516
Scandalously, he only favors
Senior Court Lady Dong,

32
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,309
the late king's court lady.

33
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,271
Thus, Her Royal Highness,
who is hoping for a Prince Royal,

34
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,898
had to take drastic measures
and urged the First Senior Consort.

35
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,821
When His Majesty is out for a walk
or is not tending to state affairs,

36
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,406
he always goes to Yeongchwijeong

37
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,449
to play baduk with Prince Deokseong.

38
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,078
I would like to tell you more
about Yeongchwijeong,

39
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,081
but all servants of the court
are forbidden from entering.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,624
Thus, not much has been known.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,377
I will send you word again.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,341
My lady.

43
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,760
I, Chu Dal-ha, send my greetings.

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,974
Prince Deokseong's residence
hosts feasts almost daily,

45
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,226
so I had no trouble getting in.

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,311
My lord.

47
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,398
Recently, he hired baduk players
to play and come up with clever moves.

48
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,360
It seems like it is to prepare tricks
to use against the King.

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,571
He is greedy yet resourceful.

50
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,366
Even the Three Hwans
seem wary of the flaunt of his power.

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,121
Right.

52
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,790
That refers to the Principal Director
of the Privy Council, Park Jong-hwan,

53
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,667
Great Lord Oh Wook-hwan,

54
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,921
and the newly appointed
Minister of War, Min Ji-hwan.

55
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,341
People coined the nickname by playing on
the last syllable of their names.

56
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,915
Prince Deokseong,

57
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,667
I enclose the play explanation

58
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,336
of the baduk player I have recommended.

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,797
I hope you find it helpful.

60
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,483
I send my greetings to you, Master Choam.

61
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,362
I have read the play explanation
you have sent me.

62
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,284
The skills of the baduk player
you have recommended are exquisite.

63
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,661
I must say I am quite satisfied.

64
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,123
"I would like to play baduk
with the player myself.

65
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,002
Please have them visit me
without any delay."

66
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,297
Congratulations.

67
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,008
You became Prince Deokseong's
baduk player as you wished.

68
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,972
I imagined you were looking forward to it.

69
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,099
Why do you look so dispirited?

70
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,686
Are you afraid
now that things have worked out?

71
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,981
I am not afraid,

72
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,818
for I have looked forward to this moment
for three years.

73
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,070
However,

74
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,116
I am concerned
that I may be putting you in harm's way

75
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,827
if I go through with this.

76
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,662
Absolute nonsense.

77
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,332
If you were that concerned,

78
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,668
you would have accepted my plea
to go easy on me during our game.

79
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,760
I shall fend for myself.

80
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,844
Thus,

81
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,638
just worry about yourself.

82
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,560
You have generously taken me in
and cared for a fool like me.

83
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,812
I will never forget your kindness.

84
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,447
My lady, the Sixth Royal Secretary
has been dismissed once again.

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,866
This is the third time already this year.

86
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,452
Why is it so difficult to revive

87
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,414
the peach tree the late king had planted?

88
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,917
Your Majesty,
I have committed an unforgivable sin!

89
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,127
I beg for your forgiveness!

90
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,837
I do not want to see you.

91
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,006
Leave my sight now!

92
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,551
With His Majesty's wrath
becoming greater by the day,

93
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,263
we are all praying
for a flower to bloom on the dead tree.

94
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,391
But I wonder if that day will ever come.

95
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,271
Your Majesty.

96
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,484
You do not look well.

97
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,574
The new emperor of the Qing
has been chosen.

98
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,619
Prince Rui must have compromised,

99
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,080
seeing how he handed over
the throne to his young nephew.

100
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,835
Upon hearing the news
of the Emperor's sudden demise,

101
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,547
I thought there would be
a bloodbath over the throne.

102
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,510
It seems like he made a wise choice.

103
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,096
No matter how strong
Prince Rui's authority is,

104
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,016
one cannot go against nature's orders.

105
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,565
Your Majesty.

106
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,401
That is not what I meant.

107
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,445
You are right, Prince Deokseong.

108
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:54,450
It is only natural for the son
to inherit the throne than a brother.

109
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,285
It is the right way.

110
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,497
It seems I have been completely oblivious

111
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,998
to such a natural and just way.

112
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,919
Your Majesty.

113
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,463
I have committed an unforgivable sin.

114
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,758
I must have become senile with old age.

115
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,803
I beg for your forgiveness.

116
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,226
What is there to forgive
when you have only spoken the truth?

117
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,435
Is that not right?

118
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,074
My lady.

119
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,661
Why are you here?

120
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,540
Were you worried I would have forgotten
my way around the capital?

121
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,750
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

122
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,004
What is it?

123
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,107
Prince Deokseong died suddenly last night.

124
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,118
Rumor in the capital has it
that he was murdered.

125
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,918
Three years of effort
have been destroyed at once.

126
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,130
There is still a way.

127
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,590
You cannot do that.

128
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,508
Why are you always saying no?

129
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,677
The idea you keep pushing forth,

130
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,514
that you will end it all
by killing the King in your own demise,

131
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,391
is an act out of spite and not revenge.

132
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,353
My father and Hongjang
would not have agreed to it either.

133
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,398
Why are you acting like this
when you agreed to follow my plan?

134
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,277
Things may not go as you have planned.

135
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,820
Look what happened to Prince Deokseong.

136
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,822
It will go as planned.

137
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,491
I will not allow failure,

138
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,117
but if I do end up failing,

139
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,412
then you may have your way.

140
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,999
That is a promise.

141
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,751
Why are you being so relentless?

142
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,712
What a way to treat me.

143
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,178
Fine. I promise.

144
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,350
What will you do now?

145
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,228
I am hungry.

146
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,563
Let us eat first.

147
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,735
Shall we?

148
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,343
Your Majesty.

149
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,886
The Principal Director
of the Privy Council,

150
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,180
the Great Lord,
and the Minister of War seek audience.

151
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,351
Let them in.

152
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,161
I believe I mentioned
that I would skip the morning assembly.

153
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
We are aware.

154
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,206
However, as members
of the Border Defense Council,

155
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,252
we have come to make an urgent request
despite the discourtesy.

156
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,343
What is this urgent request you speak of?

157
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,555
I shall inform you, Your--

158
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,140
You answer, Minister Min.

159
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,728
Your Majesty.

160
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,731
We seek to dismiss and punish the
Executive Assistant of Uiju, Kim Myung-ha.

161
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,983
Please grant us your approval.

162
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,861
What is the reason?

163
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,447
When those the Qing wanted
for trespassing on the border ran away,

164
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,157
Kim Myung-ha idly sat by.

165
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,035
He did not agree
to their extradition request either.

166
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,746
As he forsook his duties
to watch over the border,

167
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,457
it is only right
to dismiss and punish him.

168
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,170
I seem to remember
hearing a similar petition.

169
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,673
I knew you would remember, Your Majesty.

170
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,760
A report was once made
about his failure to capture

171
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,555
those who had trespassed the border
under the pretext of harvesting ginseng.

172
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,976
Thanks to your explanation,
I now clearly remember it.

173
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,147
Why did you not punish him back then?

174
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,235
This would not have happened
if you had fulfilled your duties.

175
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,655
Pardon?

176
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,365
Well, Your Majesty,

177
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,700
that was because…

178
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,370
It was clear he had received a bribe
and let them go,

179
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,789
but as we did not have
solid evidence or witnesses,

180
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,415
we could not punish him then.

181
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,587
Are you certain
the same thing will not happen?

182
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,298
Can you see it through this time?

183
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,262
Your Majesty.

184
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,306
If we do not punish
Kim Myung-ha for his crimes this time,

185
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,725
the Qing will not stand and watch.

186
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,103
We must dismiss and punish him

187
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,772
before the Qing's envoy arrives

188
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,149
to prevent their condemnation.

189
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,945
All right.

190
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,072
Summon him to the capital.

191
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,467
Father!

192
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,761
Father!

193
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,806
Father!

194
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,935
Father!

195
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,065
My lord.

196
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,489
Did you look into
the crumbling fortress wall?

197
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,826
I have safeguarded it temporarily,

198
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,079
but it will collapse after one heavy rain.

199
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,709
Jang Mu-dong's family
still lives underneath there, do they not?

200
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,420
Tell them to find another place.

201
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,672
They never listen to me.

202
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,009
It would be perfect
if we could just fix up the wall.

203
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,765
But why is His Majesty summoning you?

204
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,517
Could it be because
we let those escapees go?

205
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,312
I shall know when I get there.

206
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,439
My lord, I have an idea.

207
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,316
Run away tonight.

208
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,318
I shall be your guide.

209
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,780
You should save yourself first.

210
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,201
Stop talking nonsense.

211
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,794
Surely His Majesty will dismiss
Kim Myung-ha this time, will he not?

212
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,754
Who knows?

213
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,673
He never grants the court's petitions.

214
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,054
It has been a while.

215
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,061
It appears that many people
have long waited for my death.

216
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,481
They all look as if
they have encountered a ghost.

217
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,733
I do not know about others,

218
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,652
but my brother was quite anxious.

219
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,154
Your accomplishments,
regardless of their size,

220
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,864
have been eating him out.

221
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,493
His sighs probably made a big dent
in the floor of my family's parlor.

222
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,414
You have not changed.

223
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,041
I am glad that you smile.

224
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,836
Do not be afraid.

225
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,795
Who knows?

226
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,466
Today may not be your funeral,
but your luckiest day yet.

227
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,933
Your Majesty.

228
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,562
Please share your decision
on Executive Assistant Kim Myung-ha.

229
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,528
As of today,

230
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,865
you are dismissed from
the executive assistant position at Uiju.

231
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,620
You shall serve
as the Sixth Royal Secretary instead.

232
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,129
His luckiest day yet.

233
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,422
Your Majesty.

234
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,091
What do you mean by appointing him
to the Sixth Royal Secretary?

235
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,719
You must interrogate
and punish him for his crimes!

236
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,180
I am not done speaking.

237
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:38,891
Pardon?

238
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,686
Yes, Your Majesty. I apologize.

239
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,231
Heed me well, Kim Myung-ha.

240
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,025
Yes, Your Majesty.

241
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,401
Please give me your command.

242
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,321
There is only one duty
for the Sixth Royal Secretary.

243
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,240
Revive the peach tree in the Royal Garden.

244
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,117
If you fail to do so,

245
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,703
you will be dismissed

246
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,082
and you shall be punished severely.

247
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,338
I shall carry out your command
with all my heart.

248
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,391
I am getting quite lonely

249
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,187
spending time alone at Yeongchwijeong.

250
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,899
I would like to appoint a gidaeryeong.

251
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,359
What do you think?

252
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,946
Your Majesty.

253
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,032
Forgive me, but gidaeryeong
is a position I have not heard of.

254
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,202
One serving that role
will come to Yeongchwijeong upon my order

255
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,620
and play baduk with me.

256
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,331
It is a post that only caters to me.

257
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,923
Regardless of class or age,

258
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,842
if they are a capable baduk player,

259
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,303
I shall even allow a palcheon
to take the examination.

260
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,097
PALCHEON: THE EIGHT LOWEST CLASSES
THAT CARRIED OUT MENIAL TASKS

261
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,767
However,

262
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,769
public officials do not qualify,

263
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,523
even those who serve
at the lowest of the lowest rank.

264
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,318
Do not waste more time

265
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,071
and post the announcement.

266
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,012
Your Majesty.

267
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,974
You should have informed me beforehand.

268
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,186
Then I would have found fine baduk players

269
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,645
to send to Yeongchwijeong.

270
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,607
I brought it up during the assembly
to prevent just that from happening.

271
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,858
It was a warning…

272
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,114
not to send anyone in your pocket
to Yeongchwijeong again.

273
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,533
Your Majesty.

274
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,702
I am afraid I do not understand--

275
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,329
I am talking about Prince Deokseong.

276
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,962
I am aware that he was your man, Uncle.

277
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,802
Since when were you aware of it?

278
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,890
Prince Deokseong never tried to
hide the fact from the start.

279
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,227
Therefore, I did not cast him away.

280
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,189
But he died out of the blue.

281
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,694
Mobilizing the Special Firearms Unit
to seek his killer would have been easy,

282
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,612
but I held back.

283
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,031
I could make a fair guess
on who it would be.

284
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,700
However,

285
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,829
I will not hold back
should it happen again.

286
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,793
It would be wise to remember that.

287
00:20:55,712 --> 00:21:00,300
What is your reason for appointing
Kim Myung-ha as the Sixth Royal Secretary?

288
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,512
What is the problem?

289
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,723
I dismissed him as per your request,

290
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,476
and the Sixth Royal Secretary was vacant.

291
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,645
Everyone avoided the position
as if it were a pest,

292
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,605
so I appointed him to that role.

293
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,651
The Qing will not stand back
to his promotion.

294
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,199
It is within my purview as the king
to judge his merits or demerits.

295
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,995
And it is the court's duty
to coax the Qing to accept my ways.

296
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,955
Am I wrong, Uncle?

297
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,129
Your words are correct
a thousand times over, Your Majesty.

298
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,380
You may leave then.

299
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,145
Lord Park.

300
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,522
What did His Majesty say?

301
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,068
He did not say much.

302
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,126
There you are.

303
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,130
Principal Director.

304
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,429
Your father's memorial day
is approaching, is it not?

305
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,348
It is early next month,

306
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,350
five days after
the late king's memorial service.

307
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,811
High treason such as his

308
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,647
would call for the remains
to be desecrated.

309
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,775
Despite being the traitor's son,

310
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,070
you were given a position
and an opportunity to repent.

311
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:47,115
His Majesty's kindness
is truly overwhelming.

312
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,871
You had better not

313
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,041
repay his kindness with evil.

314
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,170
Yes, my lord.

315
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,466
Congratulations on your promotion
to the Sixth Royal Secretary.

316
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,234
How could he bring
a traitor's son into the court?

317
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,361
Why did you not dissuade him?

318
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,322
Prince Rui has conceded the throne
to his young nephew

319
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,491
and has accepted to be a regent.

320
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,120
That must have caused
His Majesty a great amount of distress.

321
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,623
Are you saying he grew anxious that
Grand Prince Munseong would plot treason

322
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,083
with Kim Myung-ha at his side

323
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,587
and that he summoned him
to keep an eye on him?

324
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,136
What good is the Special Firearms Unit?

325
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,139
He could have just ordered them
to find his crime and punish him!

326
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,641
And what is this gidaeryeong nonsense?

327
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,727
Why would he establish a position
that is not even necessary for the state?

328
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,729
What will the people think?

329
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,191
I have no idea what he is thinking.

330
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,318
The gidaeryeong may be useful

331
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,154
in looking into the King's intention.

332
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,866
We need someone
to replace Prince Deokseong, after all.

333
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,410
The King is a very skilled baduk player.

334
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,914
In order to satisfy him,
they must be a very proficient player.

335
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,000
I know of a baduk master.

336
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,378
The gidaeryeong is as good as chosen,

337
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,963
so do not worry.

338
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,093
You make everything sound so easy.

339
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,722
Nothing is as easy as Guan Yu
beheading the leader of his enemies.

340
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,850
It will take
quite a bit of wealth and effort.

341
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,686
And what about Kim Myung-ha?

342
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,439
We cannot sit back and watch.

343
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,650
I have an idea.

344
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,369
Lord Park,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

345
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,084
Did you ask for me, Lord Park?

346
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,129
I asked to see you
as you would be distressed.

347
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,424
The sixth royal secretary
may be among the lowest ranks,

348
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,801
but the position requires one
to relay the royal commands.

349
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,429
It is not something
Kim Myung-ha should handle.

350
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,974
I hope you are not planning to let him be.

351
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,729
I cannot disobey royal command.

352
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,860
Then how about we delay giving him
his official appointment letter?

353
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,864
Yes, my lord. I shall do that.

354
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,546
How incompetent.

355
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,132
It is about time we chejik him.

356
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,133
CHEJIK: TO REPLACE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL

357
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,720
Must I tell you what to do as well?

358
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,808
I will ensure that Kim Myung-ha
does not receive the appointment letter.

359
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,977
Do not worry.

360
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,879
Gidaeryeong?

361
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,507
After Prince Deokseong's death,

362
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,010
I imagined there would be
no more shortcuts.

363
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,011
This is good.

364
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,387
I am against this idea.

365
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,557
What kind of a fool voluntarily
walks into the tiger's den?

366
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,101
Like you said,
I am going in to catch the tiger.

367
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,521
Why are you silent?
You should be convincing her not to!

368
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,441
Are you ready to risk your life?

369
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,738
I have been ready ever since I etched
my vow to my heart three years ago.

370
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,283
All right, then.

371
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,577
I support your decision.

372
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,872
Bollocks. This is crazy.

373
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,000
It looks like no one is willing
to listen to what I say.

374
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,543
Do whatever you want.

375
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,798
Goodness.

376
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,845
Let me know if there is anything you need.

377
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,723
I imagine you would need a baduk table.

378
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,892
It is not necessary,

379
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,186
but sure, get me one.

380
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,229
Yes, my lady.

381
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,145
Why must we endure this torture
on this hot summer day?

382
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,939
This heat is no big deal.

383
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,358
If you play your stones well,

384
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,444
you might enter Yeongchwijeong
and have wealth and fame for generations.

385
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,282
If there was no condition
that public officials could not apply,

386
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,493
you both would be there as well.

387
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,663
-Do you not think so?
-That is not true.

388
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,666
I am not interested
in such a meaningless position.

389
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,334
Is that so?

390
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,178
I guess I got the wrong idea

391
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,764
from your younger brother
playing over there.

392
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,144
I wrongfully thought that your family
had higher hopes for him than you.

393
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,812
Goodness.

394
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,565
Lord Min.

395
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,984
You are crossing the line.

396
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,407
Third Minister,
you are here as the overseer.

397
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,908
Please refrain from jesting.

398
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,202
Overseer, my foot.

399
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,539
The winner is already as good as decided.

400
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,623
Sorry?

401
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,084
What did you say?

402
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,544
What?

403
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,839
I said it was about time
the games were over.

404
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,983
Look at that.

405
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,528
He must have been lingering distastefully
even after he had already lost.

406
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,380
That face.

407
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,216
Wait.

408
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,510
I know that face.

409
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,262
Who was it?

410
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,273
Kang Mong-woo.

411
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,108
Congratulations.

412
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,321
You!

413
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,031
Stop right there!

414
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,115
Hold him there!

415
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,575
Do not let him leave!

416
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,542
You cannot run away this time.

417
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,377
You crook.

418
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,714
My lord, a crook?

419
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,633
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

420
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,676
A misunderstanding?

421
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,762
I beat you three years ago
in a baduk gamble.

422
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:56,104
Do you not remember running away
without giving your table and stones?

423
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,817
Gosh, look here.

424
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,943
Look carefully.

425
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,325
This good-looking face
and graceful figure.

426
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,161
It is hard not to remember.

427
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,249
Did you just laugh?

428
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,793
Why?

429
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,087
What part of it was so funny?

430
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,006
My apologies.

431
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:27,635
I cannot take my eyes off of baduk stones
when I sit down for a game,

432
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,804
so I have trouble
remembering my opponents.

433
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,930
Also,

434
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,766
I rarely lose.

435
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,977
Then it is harder not to remember me.

436
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,770
Think back carefully.

437
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,609
Right. It rained that day.

438
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,027
When you noticed the drizzle,

439
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,529
you threw your stone and bolted out.

440
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,119
Rain.

441
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,954
-It is raining!
-What?

442
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,123
-It really is.
-Indeed.

443
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,750
Mongwoo.

444
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,585
It is your turn.

445
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,506
I lose.

446
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,096
It is impressive

447
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,223
that you remember something
from three years ago.

448
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,518
The victim never forgets.

449
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,979
The late king suddenly passed away then

450
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,898
and the spy incident blew up,

451
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,527
so most of the skilled baduk players
were arrested and interrogated.

452
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,489
Thus, I had given up on finding you.

453
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,241
Now,

454
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,244
hand over the baduk table and stones
you owe me from three years ago.

455
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,038
Give them to me now.

456
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,957
I apologize,

457
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,459
but I cannot give them to you now.

458
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,502
What?

459
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,713
Do not tell me
you are trying to brazen it out.

460
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,256
I am not.

461
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:48,925
However,

462
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:53,221
I need my baduk table and stones
until the gidaeryeong examination is over.

463
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,516
I must train in order to see fruition.

464
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,978
I will pay you back
once I become the gidaeryeong.

465
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,606
You seem to be quite confident.

466
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,609
Well, I may have a chance

467
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,611
since you have not applied.

468
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,783
I guess you are right.

469
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,036
I will see you tomorrow, my lord.

470
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,259
Listen.

471
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,344
Do you know the patron of Kang Mong-woo?

472
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,972
I apologize,

473
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,975
but I only learned of his name just today.

474
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,610
How disappointing.

475
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,864
Should I have followed him?

476
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,178
Kim Hong-du makes his living
by playing baduk on the streets.

477
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,473
Rumor says he was a sage
who used to train in Mount Geumgang.

478
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,059
Na Gang-taek is the great-grandson
of Lord Na Jin-yu,

479
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,977
the former director
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

480
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,898
"Kang Mong-woo"?

481
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,317
Who is this man?

482
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,612
Right, well…

483
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,531
I apologize, but I do not know.

484
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,534
I asked the clerks, but no one knew.

485
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,246
Is he not your man, Minister Min?

486
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,082
He is not.

487
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,750
Why would you think that?

488
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,753
I hear the people group you
with Lord Park and me

489
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,880
and refer to us as the Three Hwans.

490
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,299
It is preposterous,

491
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,676
but you may nurture such ambitions

492
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,180
by becoming the patron of the gidaeryeong
who has access to Yeongchwijeong.

493
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,935
Is that why you became the patron
of the street baduk player,

494
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,312
knowingly risking Her Majesty's honor?

495
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,689
Who says that?

496
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,191
Who says I am Kim Hong-du's patron?

497
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,112
I do not think I mentioned the name.

498
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,575
Do not tell me you tailed me.

499
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,204
I hear that the man has been blabbing on
about how he has prayed

500
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,499
for Her Majesty's recovery
at Mount Geumgang.

501
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,376
Such insolence!

502
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,712
Her Majesty is healthier
than any ladies of the royal palace!

503
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,797
Is that so?

504
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,925
That is a relief then.

505
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,301
Why you little!

506
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,014
So…

507
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,393
you do not know
who is behind Kang Mong-woo?

508
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,230
No, I do not.

509
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,482
He applied to be a gidaeryeong
without a patron?

510
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,901
He must either be utterly naive

511
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,779
or very skilled in baduk.

512
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,197
That is good.

513
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:04,245
This man proves that the
gidaeryeong examination is fair and just.

514
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,666
Report this to His Majesty.

515
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,210
Yes, Lord Park.

516
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,391
Do you want to know who Kang Mong-woo is?

517
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,643
What is this?

518
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,147
Did you lie despite knowing his identity?

519
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,318
You have gotten very bold
since I last saw you.

520
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,361
He is that man from back then.

521
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,071
The baduk gambler from three years ago.

522
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,576
-What?
-The baduk gambler.

523
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,704
He is the very man who won
all the baduk tables in the capital

524
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,789
three years ago.

525
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,618
I shall bet on Na Gang-taek!

526
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,286
-Bring it in.
-All right.

527
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,123
-Any more bets on Na Gang-taek?
-Na Gang-taek!

528
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,591
Now, does anyone want to
bet on Park Se-gye?

529
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,761
Great Lord.

530
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,224
It was you.

531
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,393
I was afraid the Special Firearms Unit
had caught me.

532
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,853
Why would you worry about that?

533
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,814
Do not be concerned.

534
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,733
I have paved the path already.

535
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,278
Are you saying there is someone in the
Special Firearms Unit who takes bribes?

536
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,155
He will lose his life
if Joo Sang-hwa finds out!

537
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,033
Have you ever seen anyone
bite the hand that feeds them?

538
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,244
No one says no to some extra money.

539
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,624
How is the life of a county magistrate
treating you?

540
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,712
It is all very bothersome.

541
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,631
I eagerly wait for the day
you will call me back to the court

542
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,134
as I endure my tenure there.

543
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,094
Do not worry.

544
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,763
I have spoken
to the Principal Director already.

545
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,765
I will put my trust in you, my lord.

546
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,518
All right!

547
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,438
Does anyone want to bet more money?

548
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,066
Here!

549
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,027
-Gosh.
-Kim Hong-du!

550
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,405
I will bet on Kim Hong-du!

551
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,413
Who is he?

552
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,081
He is the servant of the Great Lord!

553
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,584
-Me too!
-I want to bet on him!

554
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,086
-I will make the same bet!
-Quiet, everyone!

555
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,464
The bet on Kim Hong-du has been closed.

556
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,342
-Just take mine!
-That is cheap!

557
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,593
All right!

558
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,595
Who else will you bet on?

559
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,765
Kang Mong-woo!

560
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,731
I will bet on Kang Mong-woo.

561
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,192
"Kang Mong-woo"?

562
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,903
Did he just say Kang Mong-woo?

563
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,280
Does the name sound familiar?

564
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,575
Min Ji-hwan says otherwise,
but I think Kang Mong-woo is his man.

565
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,370
Is that all?

566
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,663
What do you mean?

567
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,999
Do you know how much this is?
This is all I have!

568
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,545
That is a lot.

569
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,089
Great.

570
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,133
Come forward
if you wish to bet on Kang Mong-woo!

571
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,761
Kang Mong-woo? Who is that?

572
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,930
It sounds like a lost dog's name.

573
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,062
I hope you will not regret it
after you get bitten by that dog.

574
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,815
Who is Kang Mong-woo?

575
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,858
Kang Mong-woo?

576
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,492
How is that funny to you?

577
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,285
That means you are the underdog, my lady.

578
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,788
I told you so, did I not?

579
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,707
I said no one would bet on Kang Mong-woo

580
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,418
and that was exactly what I wanted.

581
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:25,297
Those ignorant fools
were only betting on the Three Hwans' men.

582
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,135
I was furious inside
and almost caused a scene there.

583
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,511
Good job holding it in.

584
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,512
Thank you for your work.

585
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,514
I will get going then.

586
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,356
Kim Myung-ha has returned to the court?

587
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,066
Yes.

588
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,652
The King went against
the court officials' will

589
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,238
and appointed him
as the Sixth Royal Secretary.

590
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,740
Why would he do that?

591
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,743
I assume it is to keep a close eye on him.

592
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,164
Seeing that the King gave him
a position no one coveted,

593
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,000
it must be to punish him
should an opportunity arise.

594
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,127
Do you think that is all?

595
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,671
Is something bothering you?

596
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,591
Why now?

597
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,552
He stayed put for the last three years

598
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,554
indulging in drinks,
women, and games only.

599
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,098
So why is he suddenly making moves?

600
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,101
That is what the King always does.

601
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,313
You are right.

602
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,858
With the Three Hwans leading the court,

603
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,778
he could be sending the court a message
not to look down on him as the king.

604
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,448
Right.

605
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,366
That must be it.

606
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,174
How the time flies.

607
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,928
It seems like yesterday
that Master Chu barely managed to return

608
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,765
and we found Lady Hee-soo
and went into hiding in the mountains.

609
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,642
Search thoroughly!

610
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,809
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

611
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,928
Are you crying?

612
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,305
As if.

613
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,140
The smoke got in my eyes. That is all.

614
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,560
Do not be concerned.

615
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,353
Lady Hee-soo is exceptional.

616
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,940
She will beat all those nobodies
and become the gidaeryeong.

617
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,401
I am not worried that she will lose.

618
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,987
I am worried because she will win.

619
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,446
You are right.

620
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:59,159
The palace and whatnot will only be filled
with obstacles for her.

621
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,209
Do you remember the prince
who used to play baduk with the King?

622
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,379
They say he suddenly met his end
while being carried on the palanquin

623
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,674
because he got
on the bad side of the King.

624
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,175
No way.

625
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,012
They say Monk Yusim,
who suddenly passed away last year,

626
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,098
was also poisoned to death
by the King's assassin.

627
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,852
He poisoned his own older brother

628
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,104
and his sister-in-law.

629
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,272
Gosh.

630
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,358
I mean, not even venomous snakes
bite their own kin.

631
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,904
You must tell Lady Hee-soo

632
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,991
never to eat anything
when she is in the palace.

633
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,118
I do not want to hear it.

634
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,412
Stop saying such sinister things!

635
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,541
Why are you yelling all of a sudden?

636
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,209
I am just worried.

637
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,720
-What is with her?
-It is not like I made things up.

638
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,852
Consider Master Choam's efforts
and drink up every single drop.

639
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,479
You and your nagging.

640
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,481
Are you still worried?

641
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,108
Worried, my foot.

642
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,860
Why would I be worried?

643
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,821
With your skills, becoming the gidaeryeong
is a piece of cake.

644
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,368
And after that, the heavens will help you
punish those who deserve it.

645
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,912
I do not need the heavens' help.

646
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,538
I will do it.

647
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,292
I will punish them myself.

648
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,671
Of course.

649
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,422
Those bastards.

650
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,716
They should croak
before they can even utter an oath.

651
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,312
This is the list of people
who won today's game.

652
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,980
Read them to me.

653
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,149
Yes, Your Majesty.

654
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,116
"Kim Mal-son, Kim Hong-du,

655
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,243
Na Gang-taek,

656
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,161
Park Se-gye,

657
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,913
Hong Yun,

658
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,790
Kang Mong-woo,

659
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,042
An Du-eon…"

660
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,253
Wait.

661
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,799
What did you just say?

662
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,845
Are you referring to An Du-eon?

663
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,394
KANG MONG-WOO

664
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,858
Is something wrong, Your Majesty?

665
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,027
It is nothing.

666
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,322
I would like to be alone now.

667
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,493
Yes, Your Majesty.

668
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,911
Have a pleasant night.

669
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,395
It is Mongwoo.

670
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,940
This will be the prize of our bet.

671
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,905
It cannot be.

672
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,744
It must be someone with the same name.

673
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,642
I had my doubts,

674
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,769
but you survived.

675
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,149
I stand before you as I survived.

676
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,073
Why have you returned?

677
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,120
You and your discourtesy have not changed.

678
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,580
Answer me.

679
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,126
So you have come.

680
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,965
I was worried you might not show up

681
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,841
after all my threats yesterday.

682
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,262
How can I not come when I will win?

683
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,431
Your confidence would top them all.

684
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,101
Let us go before you are late.

685
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,393
An Gyeong-yeop!

686
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,274
Kang Mong-woo!

687
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:30,991
What is the issue?

688
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,577
As it happens,
there are no more plates left.

689
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,203
No more left?

690
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,664
What shall we do, Lord Min?

691
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,000
In such a case,

692
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,586
it would be right to give him a free win.

693
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,129
That cannot be.

694
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,299
Here comes His Majesty!

695
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,717
Stop.

696
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,561
Raise your head.

697
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,537
What is your name?

698
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,877
It is Kang Mong-woo, Your Majesty.

699
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,478
He should be in the middle of a game.

700
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,896
Why is he not playing?

701
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,984
We did not have enough players
to match with him,

702
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,694
so we were discussing what to do.

703
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,905
In such cases,
it is common practice to give him a win.

704
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,824
But some voiced that it would be unfair.

705
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,244
-What should we do?
-The Sixth Royal Secretary shall play.

706
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,623
Your Majesty.

707
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,375
Forgive me, but I am present

708
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,419
as well as my brother, the overseer.

709
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,588
Why might you be ordering
Kim Myung-ha to play?

710
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,341
I have stated that public officials
cannot apply to become a gidaeryeong.

711
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,218
Thus, you are all disqualified.

712
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,262
I named Kim Myung-ha specifically

713
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,973
as he is eligible, not having received
his appointment letter yet.

714
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,310
Would you be willing
to resign from your post for this?

715
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,562
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

716
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,356
I had not thought it through.

717
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,358
Begin the game.

718
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,830
You will lose to me at this rate.

719
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,159
I lose.

720
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,872
Would you like to count the stones?

721
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,916
I shall do that.

722
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,139
Protecting this spot led
to the Sixth Royal Secretary's defeat.

723
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,642
He saved a stone
when he should have discarded it.

724
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:12,314
I thought I could expand my territory
after saving the stone.

725
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,317
Saengbulyeosa.

726
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,485
Even if you do save it,

727
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,323
a life without any merit
is a pointless one.

728
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:24,576
It is better to discard a stone
that has been cornered

729
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,620
rather than to strive to save it.

730
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,332
I respectfully disagree, Your Majesty.

731
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,959
How insolent!

732
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,296
How dare you share your opinion
when he did not even ask for it?

733
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,214
I apologize, Your Majesty.

734
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,300
He is ignorant of the court etiquette.

735
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,259
What are you doing?

736
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,094
-Beg for his forgiveness.
-Leave him be.

737
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,055
You may continue.

738
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,854
Had the Sixth Royal Secretary
not given up and reinforced this region,

739
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,815
I would have lost the game.

740
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,405
If one examines closely,

741
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,241
one will always find a way
to save a cornered stone.

742
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,163
A likely story.

743
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,792
Kim Myung-ha is not good enough
to be the victor of this game.

744
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,210
Why would he trouble himself

745
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,213
when he will lose anyway?

746
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,508
Why do you look up at the sky

747
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,011
when you will die anyway, Your Majesty?

748
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,014
You impertinent fool!

749
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,976
How dare you speak out of turn
before His Majesty?

750
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,813
You cannot let his arrogance slide,
Your Majesty.

751
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,233
Why are you standing about, Captain Joo?
Drag him out immediately!

752
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,449
As many have witnessed your impertinence,

753
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,619
I must give the order to drag you out

754
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,206
and pull your pompous tongue out
to preserve my dignity as the king.

755
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,376
Do you have any last words?

756
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,006
Baduk is shared between two players.

757
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:05,802
While the two engage in a game,
they only converse through their stones.

758
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,388
They share a conversation

759
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,975
that transcends age, status,
and even loyalty.

760
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,978
If you still think
I deserve to be executed,

761
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,938
the gidaeryeong you should appoint

762
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:21,276
will have to be someone
perceptive and eager to please.

763
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:27,365
That way, you can avoid the hassle
of pulling out a tongue every time.

764
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,534
You brat!

765
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,828
-That is enough, Minister Min.
-Your Majesty…

766
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,790
I apologize.

767
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,007
How audacious of you.

768
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,761
You have one damnable tongue.

769
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,351
It is to my liking.

770
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,990
I will tell you a way
to save yourself from punishment.

771
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,917
Become the gidaeryeong at all costs.

772
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,878
Should you disappoint me,

773
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,342
I will pull your tongue out myself.

774
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

775
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,916
Let us head to
the Queen Dowager's quarters.

776
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,042
Yes, Your Majesty.

777
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,255
His Majesty wishes to visit
the Queen Dowager's quarters!

778
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,260
Here comes His Majesty.

779
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,524
Welcome, Your Majesty.

780
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,485
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

781
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,744
Your Majesty.

782
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,205
Did something good happen?

783
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,749
It is quite rare
to see you in high spirits like this.

784
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,130
I cannot hide anything from you, Mother.

785
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,426
I visited Chundangdae
to watch the gidaeryeong examination.

786
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,345
You must have found someone
to your liking.

787
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,388
Indeed.

788
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,183
There is someone I quite like.

789
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,518
Is that true?

790
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,937
I am very curious.

791
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,316
So, what is his name?

792
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,901
Mong-woo.

793
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,278
His name is Kang Mong-woo.

794
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,412
Your Royal Highness, you do not seem well.

795
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,081
-Do you feel ill?
-No.

796
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,667
Do not worry about me

797
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,920
and look after yourself, Your Majesty.

798
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,924
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

799
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,428
Mother.

800
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:40,225
Even my eyes are telling me
that you do not look well.

801
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,143
Are you sure you are all right?

802
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,231
Of course, I am.

803
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,152
I hope the man you are fond of
makes it to the end

804
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,488
and becomes the gidaeryeong.

805
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,365
Do not be concerned.

806
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,867
He will become the gidaeryeong

807
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,578
without a hint of doubt.

808
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,062
Who became the gidaeryeong?

809
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,318
It looks like a three-year-old debt
returned to me as pure gold.

810
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,454
Who gave you the permission
to start playing?

811
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,252
My apologies.

812
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,047
I was not aware of your presence,
Your Majesty.

813
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,723
That seat

814
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,643
was occupied by

815
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,771
Prince Deokseong for the past three years.

816
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,774
Prince Deokseong…

817
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,571
was my first baduk master.

818
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,539
You must be deeply distressed

819
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,958
to have lost your baduk friend
so suddenly.

820
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:07,098
I remember receiving a report
of your death three years ago.

821
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,603
I was at death's door.

822
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,273
But I survived through sheer luck.

823
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,237
Then your best move
would have been to run away.

824
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,530
What is the reason

825
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,657
for your return?

826
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,455
The entire land of Joseon is yours.

827
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,039
Where could I run to?

828
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,042
I thought it would be better

829
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,795
to come before you
and seek a way to survive.

830
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,848
Why are you hiding your real name
and using the name Mong-woo?

831
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,395
I am not hiding my name.

832
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,564
You would have forgotten,

833
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,150
but I only play baduk when there is a bet.

834
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,943
-And--
-You only tell your real name

835
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,612
to an opponent who beats you.

836
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,743
It is an honor.

837
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,412
I did not expect you to remember--

838
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,457
I remember everything about you.

839
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,629
So stop hiding behind
all those nonsensical formalities

840
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,632
and answer my question immediately.

841
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,091
Why have you returned?

842
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,349
Shall I answer for you?

843
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,730
You have returned

844
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,191
to get revenge.

845
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,487
You harbor treasonous ambition
of murdering me, no?

846
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,288
Saengbulyeosa.

847
01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:00,044
You have survived,
yet you are no better than the dead.

848
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,921
What will you do now?

849
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,261
Answer me
with that wicked tongue of yours.

850
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,470
What will you do?

851
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,263
CAPTIVATING THE KING

852
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,432
I will be your patron.

853
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,850
No man can resist

854
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:59,353
power, wealth, and beautiful women.

855
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,771
I would like to

856
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:04,275
become a dependable patron for you.

857
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:05,943
Do not worry.

858
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,904
You are the gidaeryeong and my person.

859
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,989
I shall protect you too.

860
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,116
Why would I risk my life

861
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,035
for something that will clearly fail?

862
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:17,413
If you want to live,
examine closely before answering.

863
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,874
That way, you will see a way
to save yourself.

864
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,502
The opportunity to get revenge
on the enemy who slayed your father.

865
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,296
Will you join hands with me?

866
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,843
