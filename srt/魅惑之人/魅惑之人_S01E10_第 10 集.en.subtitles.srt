1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,073
Fourth Investigator.

3
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,825
This is not the way to the State Tribunal.

4
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,787
Upon whose command are you arresting me?

5
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,562
I will take it from here.

6
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,189
Untie the rope.

7
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,565
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

8
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,256
Go on inside.

9
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,769
What took you so long?

10
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,814
Did you forget your duties
as the gidaeryeong

11
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,774
to come running to me upon my summon?

12
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,071
This will not do.

13
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,948
I shall have to punish you harshly.

14
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,037
Do not think for a second
that I will overlook your crimes

15
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,831
due to that night.

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,918
I cannot dare to think in such a manner.

17
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,087
I have…

18
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,882
already erased my memory of that night.

19
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,344
You did what?

20
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,014
Upon whose orders?

21
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,819
I have missed you.

22
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,716
Why are you not saying anything?

23
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,472
I thought…

24
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,310
that you might never summon me again.

25
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,564
I returned to the palace without a word

26
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,983
and ordered you to stay confined

27
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,946
to deter the court from attacking you.

28
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,408
What is going to happen to me now?

29
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,038
You must have heard about the bet I made.

30
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,707
I shall order Sang-hwa

31
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,461
to stay vigilant
so that word inside the palace

32
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,672
does not travel beyond the palace walls.

33
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,967
Please tell me.

34
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,554
You are my gidaeryeong.

35
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,682
You must come running
whenever I summon you.

36
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,977
I shall do the same.

37
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,566
If you call for me,

38
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,905
I shall come running to you.

39
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,859
Who do you think will win?

40
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,986
No matter who wins,

41
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,654
Kang Mong-woo is in a tight spot.

42
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,823
He is indeed stuck
between a rock and a hard place.

43
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,802
This is…

44
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,222
a jangsaeng.

45
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,307
A jangsaeng?

46
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,768
What is a jangsaeng?

47
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,604
It means that the victor cannot be decided

48
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,648
as the game has reached an impasse.

49
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,442
So in other words, a tie.

50
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,987
How could this be?

51
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,323
He made it.

52
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,366
He will live.

53
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,419
Such an auspicious sign is said to be seen

54
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,796
once in a thousand years.

55
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,302
Never have I seen this
in my entire life of playing baduk.

56
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,596
He has played baduk all his life,

57
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,099
but this is the first time
seeing such an auspicious sign.

58
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,186
This is my first time
seeing a jangsaeng as well.

59
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,646
What a bummer.

60
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,107
Had I won,

61
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,235
I would have taken him to the Great Qing

62
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,613
and offered him
as a tribute to our Emperor.

63
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,243
As our Emperor loves baduk as well,

64
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,414
he would be quite amazed
to hear of what happened today.

65
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,296
I am pleased that you are satisfied.

66
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeongchwijeong.

67
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,801
I have heard stories of the place.

68
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,095
May I take a look inside?

69
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,807
I do not allow visitors normally.

70
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,310
However,

71
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,688
I will open its doors just for you.

72
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,151
Let us go.

73
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,409
Did you not hear His Majesty?

74
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,578
You stay here.

75
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,383
Rumor has it

76
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,261
that you are His Majesty's confidant.

77
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,432
I am merely a gidaeryeong
who responds to His Majesty's call

78
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,393
for a game of baduk.

79
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,365
Did you intentionally
end the game in a tie?

80
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,409
With all due respect,

81
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,745
it is extremely difficult
to reach a tie in baduk.

82
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,791
We only reached a tie out of sheer luck.

83
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,587
By that claim, you are suggesting
that the heavens are helping you.

84
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,506
Those are some arrogant words, indeed.

85
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,844
I am curious to see how long
the heavens will stay on your side.

86
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,416
Was it truly through luck?

87
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,295
Yes, I was lucky enough

88
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,466
to spot the move that would force a tie.

89
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,928
At any rate,
I am relieved that you are back.

90
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,263
It took a load off my mind.

91
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,058
We will truly need luck on our side

92
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,310
from this point on.

93
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,901
The envoy has arrived,

94
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,195
but he has not said anything unusual.

95
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,697
It appears your concern is in vain.

96
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,535
I also hope that my prediction is wrong.

97
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,712
You sounded so confident.

98
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,509
And yet, your plans
to cast the gidaeryeong away

99
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,678
have failed once again.

100
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,350
I suppose you are
not the only one to blame

101
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,019
as the King broke his promise first.

102
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,773
But how could he have refused
when the Qing's envoy was insisting?

103
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,614
Principal Director.

104
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,741
Are you listening?

105
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,036
Tonight,

106
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,667
His Majesty has humiliated me
before the Qing's envoy

107
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,460
and all the members of his court.

108
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,297
I have endured unbearable sufferings

109
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,466
to help His Majesty ascend to the throne,

110
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,594
stayed on as the Principal Director,
a mere honorary position,

111
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,140
and spent all these years
as his loyal subject.

112
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,434
However,

113
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,769
he dishonored all my sacrifices.

114
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,066
Not even high treason
would call for such a humiliation.

115
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,156
Even if I stepped down from my post
and left for our family's hometown,

116
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,284
no one would condemn me.

117
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,577
Leave for our hometown?

118
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,371
I understand
that you are deeply insulted, but…

119
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,501
Nonetheless,

120
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,214
the King is my one and only family
before he is my lord.

121
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,675
We are bound by the heavens.

122
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,930
How could one dare to discard a bond
established by the heavens?

123
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,184
If anyone dares to attempt it,

124
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,480
whoever it may be, I, Park Jong-hwan,
will not condone such behavior.

125
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,028
Of course, I understand your true heart.

126
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,782
The King, too, will come to understand
your profound insight one day.

127
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,045
By the way,

128
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,547
what about the letter?

129
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,424
That matter,

130
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,053
you need not worry about.

131
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,013
Are you sure?

132
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,057
I have confirmed it with Jung Je-pyo.

133
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,477
Your biggest concern

134
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,313
shall disappear soon.

135
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,120
What do you mean?

136
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,499
There is another letter
apart from the one from the Emperor?

137
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,876
It is a letter
written by Prince Rui himself.

138
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,462
I did not get to read it,
as I am the Emperor's subject,

139
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,465
but Jung Je-pyo did,
as he is Prince Rui's subject.

140
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,219
He will deliver it to you soon in person.

141
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,639
For what reason
has Prince Rui sent a letter?

142
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,350
Merely mentioning it as much
turns me into a spy,

143
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,144
which is punishable by death.

144
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,855
It is only out of our friendship
forged in Shenyang

145
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,066
that I am sharing this news.

146
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,403
Please tell me.

147
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,738
What is the content of that letter?

148
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,493
"I shall take the Princess of Joseon,

149
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,121
Princess Jangryeong, to be my wife."

150
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,290
"With my marital ties
to the royal family of Joseon,

151
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,420
I hope to strengthen
the bond between our two nations."

152
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,053
Prince Rui has sent a letter

153
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,056
requesting Princess Jangryeong's hand
in marriage.

154
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,893
It is a request in name only,

155
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,270
when it is an order in truth.

156
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,189
Even a commoner's marriage proposal

157
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,150
is carried out with respect
per the proper customs.

158
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,818
This is beyond discourteous.

159
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,697
You should not accept
this marriage proposal.

160
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,162
A letter from Prince Rui himself

161
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,623
is as good as a marriage proposal
from him in person.

162
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,791
Its refusal

163
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,086
may bring extreme adversities
that cannot be overcome.

164
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
Your Majesty.

165
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,383
Envoy Escort Yoo Hyun-bo

166
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,344
has obtained a piece of information
from Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo.

167
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,262
Report it to me.

168
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,937
Jung Je-pyo proudly stated

169
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,066
that Prince Rui's authority stands strong
and his future is bright

170
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,151
and the court officials who follow him

171
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,071
are greater in number than those
who follow the young Emperor.

172
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,906
As such, if the marriage goes through,

173
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,534
the Qing would thus bestow
its full trust upon Joseon.

174
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,579
He stated that this would serve
as a great benefit to Joseon.

175
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,546
Your Majesty.

176
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,507
If you do not wish
to part with Princess Jangryeong,

177
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,552
choose another young woman
who shares a close kinship with you

178
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,429
and offer her as an alternative.

179
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,264
That cannot happen.

180
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,935
Sending anyone other than the Princess
would be no different from a rebuff.

181
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,396
Emperors and kings of the past
all made similar compromises.

182
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,356
We can at least propose this to him.

183
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,859
-Your Majesty--
-I have heard all your thoughts.

184
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,236
I shall…

185
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,909
accept Prince Rui's request

186
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,328
for the Princess's hand.

187
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,550
Make preparations for her wedding.

188
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,154
Princess.

189
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,620
I implore you, Your Majesty.

190
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,206
Please do not command me
to marry Prince Rui.

191
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
Do not just stand about.

192
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,758
Hurry up and escort her out of here.

193
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,135
Your Highness.

194
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,678
You should not act thusly.

195
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,309
Your Majesty.

196
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,437
Considering your generosity
toward both my brother and me,

197
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,689
I am more than duty-bound
to follow your orders.

198
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,692
I also understand
I do not even deserve Prince Rui

199
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,778
and that this marriage is a duty

200
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,448
I must carry out to serve you,
the court, and the royal family.

201
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,285
Continue.

202
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,996
However,

203
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,877
I also have the duty
to abide by my late mother's last words.

204
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,841
If I cannot even uphold her last wish
to protect my one and only brother,

205
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,760
how could I manage a married life
that is crucial in maintaining peace

206
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,137
between the Qing and Joseon?

207
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,682
I must confess

208
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,601
that I am lacking and foolish,

209
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,855
which will cause distress
to the Qing's court and Prince Rui.

210
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,773
This would mean

211
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,317
that I will cause distress
to you and this nation.

212
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,863
I dare not hope to survive
after committing such a grave crime.

213
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,948
Even after death,

214
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,868
how will I bear facing my late parents?

215
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,288
Your Majesty.

216
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,208
If you have the slightest pity for me,

217
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,461
please let me avert this marriage.

218
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,478
I understand. You should stand up now.

219
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,451
If I could let my emotions rule me,

220
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,164
I would never send you at any cost.

221
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,667
However,

222
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,213
I am the king of this nation.

223
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,842
As I cannot neglect my duties as the king,

224
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,848
I cannot grant your request.

225
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,620
What would you do, Mong-woo?

226
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,914
In what way

227
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,127
would you save this gonma?

228
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,545
GONMA: A STONE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SAVE

229
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,509
Should you wish not to send Her Highness,

230
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,636
there is just one way.

231
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,186
Though belated,
you can decline the marriage offer.

232
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,484
That is what I wish to do.

233
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,156
However,

234
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,283
I cannot.

235
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,452
If…

236
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,746
I were to decline this marriage offer

237
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,583
and refuse to send the Princess,

238
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,543
what would happen?

239
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,504
Prince Rui's regency will not last.

240
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,965
He will have to relinquish
his powers to the Emperor.

241
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,553
As such, Prince Rui
is testing Joseon's loyalty.

242
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,556
If Joseon declines his offer of marriage,

243
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,683
the Qing's court will feel anxious.

244
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,313
They will swiftly impose a ban
on the repatriation of your people

245
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,774
and wage war.

246
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,574
Prince Rui's sudden request
for the hand of Joseon's Princess

247
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,328
was to keep the young Emperor in check

248
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,288
and lay out plans for the future.

249
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,970
I desired power.

250
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,684
I thought it was the only way
to protect those that I wished to protect.

251
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,021
Hence, I ascended to the throne.

252
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,275
I was foolish.

253
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,613
Protecting my seat on the throne…

254
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,494
always came before
protecting what I truly wished.

255
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,090
The king has power,

256
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,385
and yet, he is powerless.

257
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,975
That is as it should be,

258
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,147
and it is therefore agonizing.

259
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,021
I was naive.

260
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,193
After seeing the King
take His Highness to gisinje,

261
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,652
I had let my guard down.

262
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,365
It was only a scheme
to silence the ill rumors.

263
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,369
Do not blame yourself, my lord.

264
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,538
In situations like this,

265
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,832
you must stay
all the more composed and rational.

266
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,466
I suspect

267
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,677
that this marriage ploy
not only targets Her Highness

268
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,888
but also His Highness.

269
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,392
I agree.

270
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,478
When Her Highness leaves,

271
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,189
talks of His Highness's marriage
will begin soon after.

272
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,816
It can only be easier to act against him

273
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,401
if he is outside the palace.

274
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,529
What do you propose that we do?

275
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,450
As the King has approved the marriage,

276
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,287
it will take its place no matter what.

277
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,499
We can neither refuse nor avoid it.

278
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,960
However,

279
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,046
we can take advantage of it.

280
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,552
What do you mean?

281
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:55,971
Here is my plan.

282
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,265
Through this marriage,

283
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,184
I seek to plant a spy
in Prince Rui's inner circle.

284
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,856
Her Highness may be astute,

285
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,567
but she cannot act as a spy.

286
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,988
First of all, she does not speak
the Qing's language.

287
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,991
Further, she has no notion
of keeping her thoughts secret.

288
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,868
I am suggesting
that we send a spy in her place.

289
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,207
Do not tell me…

290
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,459
you are suggesting a substitution?

291
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,802
That cannot happen.

292
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,887
If we were to get caught,

293
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,725
Her Highness and His Highness
would both fall in danger.

294
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,938
In any case, this is not for us to decide.

295
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,691
We need the approval and determination

296
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,860
of Their Highnesses.

297
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,624
To speak the truth,

298
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,588
I do not understand what the point is.

299
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,301
The Grand Prince and I will be
separated nonetheless.

300
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,722
It is hard to believe that there is a way
to avoid getting caught.

301
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,141
I am afraid

302
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,228
that this plan may place
the Grand Prince in more danger.

303
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,023
Your Highness.

304
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,400
What you say is right.

305
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,612
What are your thoughts, Myung-ha?

306
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,948
Do not mind my opinion.

307
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,744
If you two disagree with the plan,
we will not carry it out.

308
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,288
Who would this benefit?

309
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,545
It would benefit
this nation and its people.

310
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,008
This is the one and only way

311
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,594
we can learn Prince Rui's
thoughts and plan

312
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,263
for this nation.

313
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,640
Are you certain?

314
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,935
Can you swear
that this plan was not concocted

315
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,770
for your personal gain?

316
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,444
As Her Highness has already stated,

317
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,115
this is indeed a risky plan
that may bring more risks than benefits.

318
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,659
Were it for my personal gain,

319
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,703
I could always resort to easier ways.

320
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,873
If you cannot trust my sincerity,

321
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,875
do not approve of the plan.

322
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,046
I will follow your wishes.

323
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,890
I do not wish to endanger
the Grand Prince further for my sake.

324
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,559
-So--
-I…

325
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,769
approve.

326
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,731
Do you mean that, Grand Prince?

327
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,066
You do not have to do this for me.

328
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,486
To speak the truth,

329
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,282
the idea of you marrying a man
who lives tens of thousands of li away

330
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,367
is detestable to me.

331
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,580
However, that is not my only reason.

332
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,374
It is because I trust you, Master.

333
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,462
Also, it will aid this nation
and its people.

334
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,006
How could I not approve of the plan?

335
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,644
Now then, shall we play baduk?

336
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,239
Grand Prince.

337
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,847
It bothers me
that the Great Lord suggested

338
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,308
sending another woman
from the royal family

339
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,893
during the assembly earlier.

340
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,854
Are you suggesting
they might substitute the Princess?

341
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,028
Your concern is in vain.

342
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,990
The Grand Prince and the Princess
do not have the nerve to do so.

343
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,951
No one knows for sure.

344
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,702
Furthermore…

345
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,878
We should of course
take measures if that is the case.

346
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,675
But if the King finds out,

347
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,301
he will be infuriated.

348
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,513
His Majesty heads out for a hunt
with Envoy Podan tomorrow.

349
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,182
No issues will arise
if we use that window of opportunity.

350
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,649
Would you like to
accompany me to the hunt?

351
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,073
It would be better for me to stay here.

352
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,745
I…

353
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,331
would like you to accompany me.

354
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,380
It would be difficult for me
to hide my feelings when I am with you.

355
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,842
People will catch on
and begin to suspect me.

356
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,845
Would you not mind that?

357
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,850
Goodness.

358
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,150
Podan will be very disappointed.

359
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,285
Three years ago,

360
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,334
if we had not met,

361
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:05,924
you would be living a peaceful life
as someone's wife.

362
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,641
As I cannot live as your woman,

363
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,311
I will stay by your side
as your gidaeryeong.

364
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,259
I do not think this is right.

365
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,220
How can you get revenge when you love him?

366
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,308
My feelings for him
do not change anything.

367
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,645
I will take advantage of them.

368
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,815
I will fool the King with my love

369
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,775
and achieve my goal.

370
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,236
I will make sure…

371
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,948
that he is dethroned.

372
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,909
My lady.

373
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,121
Our hearts aren't like baduk stones.

374
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:05,668
They cannot be controlled
the way you set stones on the table.

375
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,088
I am afraid.

376
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,802
You could hurt yourself
and end up at death's door again,

377
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,763
and that scares me.

378
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,145
What is there to be scared about?

379
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,190
All the events that I fear
have already happened.

380
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,858
Death?

381
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,778
As I have already experienced it before,

382
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,447
it frightens me no longer.

383
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
Good night.

384
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,542
What is the matter?

385
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,089
Forgive me, but I am afraid

386
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,425
that I cannot ride a horse
due to the return of my chronic illness.

387
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,264
How is an aching knee a chronic illness?

388
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,105
I understand.

389
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,316
Have the Royal Clinic brew herbal medicine

390
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,193
for the Principal Director's knees.

391
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,445
Yes, Your Majesty. I shall.

392
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,115
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

393
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,963
There is no need for herbal medicine.

394
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,257
Yes, Lord Park.

395
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,323
Please wait, my lady.

396
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,993
How dare you get in her way?

397
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,843
You should have started off with this.

398
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,136
My lady.

399
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,931
Please take good care of Bun-yeong.

400
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,809
I shall try.

401
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,815
Goodbye, my lady.

402
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,920
My lady.

403
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,838
What brings you here at this hour?

404
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,091
I am here to convey
Her Royal Highness's order.

405
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,843
You and the court maids here

406
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,388
are to be transferred
to another residence immediately.

407
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,517
Pardon? Another residence?

408
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,269
-This is too--
-We have no time for explanation.

409
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,436
Get out of here now.

410
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,491
You. Stop right there.

411
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,006
As you are new here, you may stay.

412
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,591
Yes, my lady.

413
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,736
Last night,
upon the Queen Dowager's orders,

414
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,448
the court maids at the service
of Her Highness were all removed.

415
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,578
Thankfully, I managed to avert the crisis
and stayed at Her Highness's quarters.

416
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,039
I do not need your service.

417
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,957
I will only let this maid tend to me,

418
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,667
so you may all leave.

419
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,254
Her Royal Highness
will not approve of this.

420
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,886
I am the future spouse of Prince Rui.

421
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,347
How dare you stand there
when I ordered you to leave?

422
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,442
Your Highness.

423
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,532
It was a risky situation,

424
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,618
but it passed without trouble.

425
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,298
You have been summoned.

426
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,551
Has His Majesty returned already?

427
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,594
No, my lord.

428
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,930
Her Majesty has summoned you.

429
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,567
I called you to ask that you look after
the Grand Prince and the Princess.

430
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,319
Last night,

431
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,156
all of the court ladies and court maids
at the Princess's quarters were replaced.

432
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,493
So I see.

433
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,038
I would like to help,

434
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,041
but I am afraid
I might cause even bigger trouble.

435
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,169
As such, I have a request.

436
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,801
Could you stand by
the Grand Prince and the Princess?

437
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,683
However meager my influence is,
I shall abide by your order

438
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,351
and assist Their Highnesses.

439
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,562
Please do not be concerned.

440
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,400
Thank you.

441
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,319
Your Majesty.

442
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,946
Senior Court Lady Dong is here.

443
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,407
Shall I tell her to come back later?

444
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,743
No, let her in.

445
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,050
Your Majesty.

446
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,719
-Did you summon me?
-You wench.

447
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,805
Do you truly have a death wish?

448
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,684
How dare you replace the court maids
and court ladies serving the Princess?

449
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,439
Your Majesty,
there must be a misunderstanding.

450
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,773
I would not dare to try

451
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,735
to replace them
on a whim and without an order.

452
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,612
How dare you feign ignorance?

453
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,032
I know you have been secretly controlling
the matters of the palace.

454
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,496
It is against the rules
to discuss the matters of my superiors,

455
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,541
but I will share this information
to resolve your deep misunderstanding.

456
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,044
Yesterday's incident

457
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,546
was carried out
upon Her Royal Highness's order.

458
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,220
Is that true?

459
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,224
Why would I inform you of an obvious lie?

460
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,019
If you do not believe me,
you should ask Her Royal Highness.

461
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,437
Or…

462
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,357
shall I ask her on your behalf?

463
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,742
Your Majesty.

464
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,995
Do you have any other requests for me?

465
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,667
No.

466
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,337
I shall remember your warm words today

467
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,967
and keep them in my heart
until the end of my days.

468
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,862
You may leave.

469
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,740
You as well.

470
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,432
Life is so interesting.

471
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,726
To think I live in a world

472
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,146
where a talent for a game can secure
a post and a superior's fondness.

473
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,814
Do you not agree?

474
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,901
You flatter me.

475
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,916
I wondered why His Majesty
was so smitten with a lowly baduk player.

476
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,128
I can see why after seeing you up close.

477
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,505
You are a man,

478
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,467
yet peculiar.

479
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,306
It is in His Majesty's nature

480
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,309
to take pity on those
who do not have friends or wealth.

481
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,394
Such was my case too.

482
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,273
He has treasured me since my days
as the Queen Dowager's court maid.

483
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,776
People may point fingers

484
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,154
at His Majesty and I
and condemn us for depravity,

485
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,989
but that hardly matters.

486
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,408
The first man I gave my heart to

487
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,869
was His Majesty
back when he was a grand prince.

488
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:28,082
And he is well aware of that fact.

489
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,211
Do you understand what I mean?

490
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,588
His Majesty

491
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,425
may cast away a gidaeryeong
the moment he loses his interest.

492
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,553
But he can never cast me away.

493
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,808
Is that so?

494
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,229
Are you implying

495
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,982
that you do not believe my words?

496
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,985
I am His Majesty's senior court lady.

497
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,780
I can be appointed a concubine
whenever I wish.

498
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,492
I am not to be looked down upon

499
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,702
by someone of such low rank as you.

500
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,625
I did not intend to offend you, my lady.

501
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,127
However,

502
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,257
I do not understand the reason

503
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,885
why you are explaining
His Majesty's heart to me

504
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,596
when you are so sure of his affection.

505
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,806
What did you

506
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,975
just say?

507
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,729
The Qing's vice envoy wishes to meet you,
Your Highness.

508
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,530
Tell him to come back later.

509
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,867
When His Majesty returns from the hunt,

510
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,660
I shall confirm his approval and--

511
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:29,870
I apologize,

512
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,748
but Her Royal Highness
has already approved it.

513
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,837
Tell him

514
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,173
to wait for a moment.

515
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,175
Yes, Your Highness.

516
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,352
Your Highness.

517
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,020
What am I to do?

518
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,876
Please follow me inside.

519
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,817
Your Highness.

520
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,946
I must deliver the gift
Prince Rui prepared for you.

521
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,865
Please allow me to see you.

522
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,578
All right.

523
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,308
I must say

524
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,352
it is a great honor

525
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,813
to see you myself, Your Highness.

526
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,774
These are the wedding gifts

527
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,860
from Prince Rui.

528
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,835
May I ask

529
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,171
what these are?

530
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,841
It is the bridal wear of the Qing royalty.

531
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,385
The moment
you dress yourself in that attire,

532
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,679
you will no longer be a princess of Joseon

533
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,849
and become the consort
of the Qing's regent.

534
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,894
Such an honor
will not come again to Joseon.

535
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,480
I congratulate you once again.

536
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,028
Thank you.

537
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,714
Pretend today's meeting did not occur.

538
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,679
Yes, my lord.

539
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,936
Are you relieved now that
you have seen the Princess in person?

540
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,771
Of course.

541
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,776
Prince Rui will be very satisfied.

542
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,010
Earlier today, Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo

543
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,012
confirmed the Princess's visage.

544
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:20,892
How can that…

545
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,978
Keep walking.

546
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,363
This means

547
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,532
we cannot substitute her.

548
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,952
Thankfully, Bun-yeong
managed to think on her feet

549
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,122
and changed clothes with the Princess
before meeting Jung Je-pyo.

550
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,336
I wondered why you wanted her as your spy.

551
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,505
I can see why now.

552
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,676
When is the envoy leaving?

553
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,928
In a few days.

554
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,514
Has everything been prepared?

555
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,102
There is one last thing I must ascertain.

556
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,738
I am so full.

557
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,365
I cannot eat anymore, Mother.

558
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,285
Your stomach just might explode if you do.

559
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,002
I should get going
after saying my goodbye to Lady Hee-soo.

560
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,420
Wait one minute.

561
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,473
What is this?

562
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,271
Oh, my.

563
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,232
Is this not a waistband?

564
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,942
The embroidery is rather crude, no?

565
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,945
I told her I would do it,
but your mother insisted.

566
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,490
What kind of mother would let
somebody else prepare her child's things?

567
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:03,870
Mother.

568
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,499
Why is it so hard and heavy?

569
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,043
I put some silver coins inside.

570
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,716
They would weigh one geun at the least.

571
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,221
I told her your back would give in
if you wore that much weight on you,

572
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,014
but she would not listen.

573
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,186
I added a little extra
to your stipend so far.

574
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,690
I know it is heavy,
but wear it with you at all times.

575
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,275
Who knows?

576
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,985
It might come in handy.

577
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,578
Mother.

578
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,622
I will wear it with me at all times,

579
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,667
even if my back breaks.

580
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,904
If you do not wish to do this,

581
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,155
you do not have to.

582
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,241
You can say you want to quit.

583
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,036
If you refuse to do it,

584
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,830
I will not send you away.

585
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,003
My lady.

586
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,466
Do you know how overjoyed I was

587
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,136
when my birth mother passed away?

588
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,891
For as long as I can remember,

589
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,768
my mother always said

590
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,272
that she did not want to die
in the land of the outlanders

591
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,191
who ravaged our land
and killed her husband.

592
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,611
She said she wanted to die back home
even if it came to that

593
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,154
whenever she saw me.

594
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,326
What we only dreamt of then became true.

595
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,414
I managed to bring my mother,
who was being abused by a violent master,

596
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,376
back to her motherland.

597
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,545
I was also able
to look after her myself for a year

598
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,591
and let her pass away in peace.

599
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:27,180
All of that was possible
as you paid the ransom on our behalf.

600
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,353
It…

601
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,981
It was not my doing.

602
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,150
You did the deeds yourself.

603
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,783
I must undertake this task.

604
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,747
I have to do it for those
who died wrongfully like my parents

605
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,168
and for those who are still suffering.

606
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,170
And I must do it

607
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,382
to prevent any more children

608
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,635
from losing their parents
in the war like me.

609
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,513
I truly wish to do this.

610
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,275
I am

611
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,820
giving you too big of a burden.

612
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,076
Do not worry.

613
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,746
I know I can handle this.

614
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,081
Princess.

615
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,000
Have you come to terms with this matter?

616
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,046
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,258
I apologize for worrying you.

618
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,933
Survive and return at all costs.

619
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,520
I am your only elder brother,

620
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,190
and you are my only younger brother.

621
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,569
Your injuries are my injuries.

622
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,282
So please return home safely.

623
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,996
Yes, Brother.

624
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,882
As…

625
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,926
the king of this nation

626
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,641
and as your uncle, my sins are too great.

627
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,356
Your Majesty.

628
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,942
The incident before happened

629
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,112
because I acted rashly

630
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,281
from being overcome with fear.

631
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,992
As such,

632
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,537
I want to say

633
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,584
that I hold no resentment toward you.

634
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,793
Do not worry.

635
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,797
I know too well

636
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,632
why you acted thusly.

637
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,886
I will not forget you for a moment

638
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,097
and send word regularly
to see if you are well.

639
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,766
Do not worry about the Grand Prince

640
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,438
and be safe and sound.

641
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,400
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

642
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,528
Though I will be in faraway,

643
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,698
I shall pray

644
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,992
for your health and long life

645
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,078
and the peace of this nation.

646
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,029
Stay seated.

647
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,448
Please let me bow to you, Sister.

648
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,749
From this moment on,
you are my older sister.

649
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,842
Greetings, Your Highness.
I am Great Lord Oh Wook-hwan.

650
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,552
Minister of War Min Ji-hwan and I

651
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,555
will be escorting you out
upon His Majesty's orders.

652
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,312
Your Highness.

653
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,356
Please step into the palanquin.

654
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,360
Open the door.

655
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,395
As you are new here, you may stay.

656
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,772
Yes, my lady.

657
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,583
You!

658
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,383
You brat, stop right there!

659
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,104
I told you to stop!

660
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,703
Where on earth did she go?

661
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,670
Principal Director.

662
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,006
Thank you for your work.

663
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,091
It is all thanks to you,
Your Royal Highness.

664
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,019
I have returned, Your Royal Highness.

665
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,353
Welcome back.

666
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,689
Did the Princess leave
without any trouble?

667
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,441
Yes.

668
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,860
I watched the palanquin leave.

669
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,455
What is the matter?

670
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,750
Forgive me.

671
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,085
It may not be of any importance,

672
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,505
but there is something
that weighs on my mind.

673
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,049
You may speak without hesitation.

674
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,930
One of the court maids
who served in the Princess's quarters

675
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,098
seems to have run away with her things

676
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,351
instead of accompanying Her Highness.

677
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,021
What did you say?

678
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,565
-How ridiculous is that?
-When did that happen?

679
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,192
You startled me.

680
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,903
What is the matter, Principal Director?

681
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,530
I asked you when it happened!

682
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,949
Well, it was…

683
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:48,950
It was…

684
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,954
Just who on earth is she
to make him act thusly?

685
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,248
Surely one court maid going missing
is not that important.

686
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,755
Unless…

687
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,519
Principal Director.

688
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,815
Where did you smuggle her to?

689
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,403
I apologize,
but I do not understand your question.

690
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,697
No confession without evidence,
is that it?

691
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,116
All right.

692
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,619
I will go see Princess Jangryeong
with my own two eyes.

693
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,333
Principal Director.

694
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:46,048
As my farewell to Princess Jangryeong
seems lacking in hindsight,

695
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,758
I am meaning to go send her off.

696
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,969
Will you accompany me?

697
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,512
Pardon?

698
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,056
Yes, my lord.

699
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,225
Surely I shall follow your command.

700
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:12,074
Why is the Principal Director
behaving so strangely?

701
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,285
Sending off the Princess out of the blue?

702
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,995
Please take these for me.

703
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:17,705
Wait…

704
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,665
Myung-ha.

705
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,211
My lord, where shall we head to?

706
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,130
They will have left
Mohwa Guesthouse already.

707
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,924
We should get ahead of her then.

708
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,967
-Let us head to Byeokjegwan.
-Yes, my lord.

709
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,285
Your Highness.

710
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,289
Do you still feel distressed?

711
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,125
I feel guilty

712
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,211
for deceiving His Majesty.

713
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,561
Can we speak in private?

714
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,022
What is the matter?

715
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,818
It is about a request
I made of him earlier.

716
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,117
What is this about?

717
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,038
It seems like
the Principal Director caught on.

718
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,333
He left just now to go see Her Highness.

719
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,315
What brings you here, Lord Park?

720
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,608
On Her Royal Highness's orders,

721
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,653
I am here to bid my farewell
to Princess Jangryeong.

722
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,365
After all those years
of you giving her the cold shoulder?

723
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:18,868
Wait here for a moment.

724
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,828
I shall ask her permission first…

725
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,371
Lord Park! What insolence is this?

726
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,457
Great Lord, please calm down.

727
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,374
Move!

728
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,459
Stay still.

729
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,378
-You will hurt yourself.
-Your Highness!

730
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,221
Your Highness.

731
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:44,060
Her Royal Highness ordered me
to give you her final regard.

732
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,686
I apologize,

733
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,231
but I would like to speak to you
without the veil.

734
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,610
Will you please remove it for a moment?

735
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,368
Your Highness.

736
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,548
Your Highness!

737
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,177
You are acting strange tonight.

738
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,972
It is not a difficult play,

739
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:07,017
so how come you are mulling over it
for such a long time?

740
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,397
Could it be that you are feeling ill?

741
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:16,235
No, I am fine, Your Majesty.

742
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,950
You are hardly fine with such a fever.

743
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:31,542
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

744
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,003
Come in.

745
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,219
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan
seeks an audience urgently.

746
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,345
What shall I do?

747
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,973
The hour is late.

748
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,933
Tell him to come back tomorrow morning.

749
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:49,935
I apologize,

750
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,646
but he said the matter
requires your immediate attention.

751
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,193
All right.

752
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,445
I shall go to the hall of governance.

753
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,613
Yes, Your Majesty.

754
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,661
Let us stop here for today.

755
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,872
Go back home and rest.

756
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,631
Your Majesty.

757
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,138
I have an urgent matter to inform you of.

758
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,934
Must you tell me now?

759
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,147
Your matter is of most importance to me,

760
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,609
but as you have heard,
the Principal Director is waiting.

761
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:45,783
It is regarding the matter
the Principal Director seeks to tell you.

762
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:51,914
What is it?

763
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,008
What is the matter?

764
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,921
CAPTIVATING THE KING

765
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,631
I must report to you
the treacherous subjects

766
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:46,051
who dared to go against the royal command
and deceived you and the court.

767
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,511
Substitution?

768
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:48,721
Are you certain?

769
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,889
Are you saying
you will take all the blame?

770
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,975
I have plotted everything.

771
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:56,395
Did you expect me to forgive your crimes
because I am in love with you?

772
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,813
My crime against you

773
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,024
does not render my love for you false.

774
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:04,361
So it begins.

775
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,572
Before I die,

776
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,658
I wish to be of support
to the Grand Prince.

777
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,077
Do you know Lord Kang Hang-soon
by any chance?

778
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,998
I will endure any sufferings
that may follow.

779
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:21,253
