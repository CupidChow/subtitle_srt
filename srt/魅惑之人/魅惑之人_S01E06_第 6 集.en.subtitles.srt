1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,014
You have returned

3
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,516
to get revenge.

4
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,228
You harbor treasonous ambition
of murdering me, no?

5
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,322
Saengbulyeosa.

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,368
You have survived,
yet you are no better than the dead.

7
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,162
What will you do now?

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,374
Answer me
with that wicked tongue of yours.

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,584
What will you do?

10
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,969
Are you suddenly lost for words?

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,596
Why are you not answering me?

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,475
Say something.

13
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,936
Your life depends on
that despicable tongue of yours.

14
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,652
Upon hearing your words,

15
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,196
I must dare to ask.

16
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,450
Why do you suspect me of treachery?

17
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,876
Because you lost
your beloved friend, Hongjang.

18
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,881
Because despite your desperate pleas
to spare her life,

19
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,510
I chose not to save her.

20
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,478
If one examines closely,

21
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,565
one will always find a way
to save a cornered stone.

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,782
The moment you said that

23
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,828
one could always save a cornered stone
by examining it closely,

24
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,413
I deciphered

25
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,583
your motive behind returning before me.

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,503
Can you deny
that it is not for a treacherous intent?

27
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,180
It is true that I treasured Hongjang,

28
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,266
but my life is of greater value to me.

29
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,935
Unless one has gone mad,

30
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,479
no one would dare
brew such intent over a single loss.

31
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,440
A friend who trusts and relies on you.

32
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,193
A friend you want to
and must protect at all costs.

33
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,156
The kind of friend
that gives your life meaning.

34
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,243
If such a friend loses their life
to a wrongful death,

35
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,624
one may go mad.

36
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,133
I did not expect you
to acknowledge her wrongful death.

37
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,597
Hongjang's spirit in the Underworld
will be shedding tears of joy.

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,142
If you want to live,
examine closely before answering.

39
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,811
That way, you will see a way
to save yourself.

40
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,066
If you still doubt my sincerity,

41
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,068
then kill me right this moment.

42
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,820
I will decide to choose
where and when to kill you.

43
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,033
My apologies.

44
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,871
I had forgotten for a moment

45
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,957
that you have already
chosen my death once.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,667
Do not ever forget that.

47
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,172
You are dead to me.

48
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,134
I can have you killed whenever I wish,
and it would be a child's play.

49
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,219
Do you understand?

50
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,477
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,689
I will remember your words.

52
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,242
EPISODE 6

53
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,204
Is Mong-woo still in Yeongchwijeong?

54
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,083
He should be going home soon.

55
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,627
Surely they are not playing
on the first day, are they?

56
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,506
Are you leaving?

57
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,842
Let us wait and leave with Kang Mong-woo.

58
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,678
A feast may be too much,
but a celebratory drink will do.

59
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,888
A celebratory drink?

60
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,767
Are you trying to bribe him
to your side already?

61
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,977
My goodness.

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,729
Do you think so little of me?

63
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
It is not bribery…

64
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,357
but forging friendship.

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
That is a suitable expression.

66
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,446
He became the gidaeryeong thanks to me.

67
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,031
Can I not hope for this much?

68
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,074
Do you not agree?

69
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,996
Do not get too close to Kang Mong-woo.

70
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,082
What do you mean?

71
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,633
What a random thing to say.

72
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,437
My gosh.

73
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,648
You said baduk is shared
between two players,

74
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,570
and the two should only converse
through their stones.

75
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,614
Those words

76
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,493
reminded me of the day
when I first played against you.

77
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,746
I was so immersed in playing with you…

78
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,709
that I did not even realize
it had begun to rain.

79
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,911
I have not enjoyed such an immersion
since I ascended to the throne.

80
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,164
All of my companions

81
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,001
were scheming vipers
bent on reading my mind

82
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,005
to use that as leverage
for their personal gain.

83
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,383
So how am I to believe

84
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,469
that you are different from them?

85
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,099
What can I do

86
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,060
to alleviate your suspicion?

87
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,813
Please advise me how.

88
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,029
I will be your patron.

89
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,374
Countless people
will come to you to win your heart.

90
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,920
The court officials,
members of the royal family,

91
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,841
and the ladies in and out of the palace
will attempt to curry favor with you.

92
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,969
They may flaunt their power to coax you,

93
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,139
offer you an unfathomable fortune,

94
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,349
or tempt you with an incomparable beauty

95
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,311
that would easily melt any man's heart.

96
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,777
Does simply imagining these things
make you happy?

97
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,739
No man can resist

98
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,036
power, wealth, and beautiful women.

99
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,460
If you want to win my trust,

100
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,505
you cannot be swayed by anything.

101
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,131
Do not think to deceive me.

102
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,551
The moment I find any deceit,

103
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,723
the Captain of the Special Firearms Unit,
Joo Sang-hwa, will have your head.

104
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,775
Of course, Your Majesty.

105
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,631
Do you have something to say to me?

106
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,385
No.

107
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,409
I am here to serve
herbal medicine to His Majesty.

108
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,744
Give it to me.

109
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,289
-I shall give it to him.
-Stand back, Captain Joo.

110
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,124
It is my duty

111
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,792
to serve him herbal medicine.

112
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,962
It may be so in the King's quarters,

113
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,047
but not here in Yeongchwijeong.

114
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,174
As you are aware,

115
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,511
only a select few may enter Yeongchwijeong
per the King's orders.

116
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,930
So this random nobody can enter the place,

117
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,642
but I, His Majesty's loyal servant,
am barred from entering?

118
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
That is correct.

119
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,620
How dare you?

120
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,664
Are you stopping me
from carrying out my duties?

121
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,293
I am merely carrying out
the royal command.

122
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,212
Your duties are none of my concern.

123
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,218
The herbal medicine will go cold.

124
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,834
Her glare was sharper than any blade.

125
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,586
Even I was holding my breath.

126
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,089
Seeing how she tried to force her way in
with the herbal medicine,

127
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,383
Court Lady Dong
must have been intrigued by you.

128
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,343
But then again,

129
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,345
you may become His Majesty's confidant.

130
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,430
No wonder she was curious about you.

131
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,891
By Court Lady Dong, you mean…

132
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,851
Your guess is correct.

133
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,062
She served the late king
and now serves the current king.

134
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,149
She seemed to have bad blood with the
Captain of the Special Firearms Unit.

135
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,151
How could she not?

136
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,571
She is the reason the whole nation
is pointing fingers at His Majesty

137
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
for being depraved.

138
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,327
As Captain Joo's duties include regulation
and management of the rumors,

139
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,538
she is a big nuisance to him.

140
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,748
I see.

141
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,919
I must say, I would feel deeply wronged
if I were Court Lady Dong.

142
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,797
His depravity
is through no fault of her own.

143
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,425
Do you not agree?

144
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,759
What?

145
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,055
Are you a good drinker, by any chance?

146
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,433
Forgive me.

147
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,435
Having spent days preparing for the games

148
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,437
without sleeping or eating properly,

149
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,938
my energy is depleted.

150
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,774
I must return home immediately
and get some rest.

151
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,901
Then forget about tonight.

152
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,778
How about tomorrow?

153
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,658
My duty from now on
is to be at His Majesty's beck and call.

154
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,078
Thus, it would be difficult
to arrange a schedule in advance.

155
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,042
If you will excuse me.

156
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,092
I shall see you tomorrow.

157
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,930
Goodness.

158
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,192
What do you think of Mong-woo?

159
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,988
I find it suspicious that a traitor
would return of his own accord.

160
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,240
I have ordered my men to tail him

161
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,659
and look into his dealings
for the past three years.

162
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,827
Until then,

163
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,705
please refrain from admitting him here
and keep an eye on him.

164
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,626
He lived well enough
without ever disclosing his real name.

165
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,505
Even if your men searched
every nook and cranny of this nation,

166
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,756
they would not be able to find

167
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,135
a trace of a man named Kang Mong-woo
that matches his description.

168
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,931
May I ask why you have
let him enter Yeongchwijeong

169
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,768
though you are aware
of his questionable background?

170
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,646
It is entertaining.

171
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,566
It is clear as day
that this post will bring him doom.

172
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,027
And yet, he feigns joy

173
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,948
and stands before me
as if he is unaware of the fact.

174
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,367
Do not make that face.

175
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,620
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Whatever may have prompted his return,

176
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,456
I will not let him sway me.

177
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,629
Report to me immediately
even at a hint of suspicious activity.

178
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,797
Do you understand?

179
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

180
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,134
What about the other matter?

181
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,930
As you ordered, I have arranged a meeting
before the gisinje.

182
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,056
GISINJE: MEMORIAL SERVICE
FOR THE KING OR THE QUEEN'S DEATH

183
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,182
Good work.

184
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,393
You may leave.

185
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,727
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,295
"The gidaeryeong is as good as chosen."

187
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,463
Did you not assure me so?

188
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,757
Yes, I did.

189
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,678
My men were referred to
as masters of calculation and baduk.

190
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,056
You said it was as easy as Guan Yu
beheading the leader of his enemies.

191
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,975
What will you do now?

192
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,978
Please do not be enraged
over such trivial matters.

193
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,814
It does not matter
who became the gidaeryeong.

194
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,692
We still have the most certain option.

195
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,738
Summon Kang Mong-woo
and make him an offer.

196
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,032
Just as Prince Deokseong did,

197
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,659
Kang Mong-woo
will not refuse your patronage.

198
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,662
As if the King would be happy
learning that I summoned him!

199
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,582
Have you forgotten how he banished

200
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,584
the First Senior Consort?

201
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,753
It is not that complicated.

202
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,548
You can summon him in secret
while His Majesty is away.

203
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,426
I will

204
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,678
arrange a meeting.

205
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,649
Gosh, my lord!

206
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,111
Why are you coming home so late?

207
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,280
We have already cleaned the pot.

208
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,158
I hurried over to be in time for dinner.

209
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,910
Am I too late?

210
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,870
Of course you are.

211
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,374
We already finished
every single grain of rice there was.

212
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,833
There is no helping it then.

213
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,918
Do not worry about me.

214
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,420
By the way,

215
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,548
how did your work go today?

216
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,592
The baduk.

217
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,387
I won.

218
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,434
You should have led with that!

219
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,311
Jageunnyeon!

220
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,022
Put the pot on the fire again!

221
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,107
All right!

222
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,177
I will return to save you.

223
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,056
Do not worry and wait. Do you understand?

224
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,361
As you did not return
past the expected hour,

225
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,864
we got jumpy and even considered
barging into the palace.

226
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,657
My goodness! My lady!

227
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,701
My lady!

228
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,792
Your Majesty.

229
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,794
Please spare Hongjang's life.

230
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,048
Hongjang did not say a word.

231
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,299
So please,

232
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,968
spare her life.

233
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,305
This is the final request
of your manghyeongjiu.

234
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,940
I am no longer an ordinary man.

235
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,860
I am the king of this nation.

236
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,028
A king

237
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,031
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

238
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,534
He keeps no such thing as friends.

239
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,818
I guess you understand
the gravity of your sin.

240
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,322
I do not care what nonsense
comes out of your mouth.

241
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,783
Lady Hee-soo cannot go back to the palace.

242
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,995
-Jageunnyeon.
-Stay still.

243
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,498
I am going to explode
if you provoke me further.

244
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,793
We will all regret it if we stop here,
including her, me, and even you.

245
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,711
Bollocks.

246
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,297
Regret it or not,
my feelings are none of your concern.

247
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,383
Enough, both of you.

248
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,971
I only fainted from
staying out in the sun for too long.

249
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,431
It will not happen again. I promise.

250
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,562
You need to take your herbal medicine,

251
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,855
so keep the talk short.

252
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,867
He threatened to kill you
if you sought a patron?

253
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,911
That must be why the King
had Prince Deokseong killed.

254
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,205
I wonder who his patron was.

255
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,584
Surely it was Park Jong-hwan,
the Principal Director.

256
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,712
Had it been Oh Wook-hwan or Min Ji-hwan,

257
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,131
they would have died
along with Prince Deokseong.

258
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,175
Park Jong-hwan is his uncle

259
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,385
and has his mother's support.

260
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,013
Thus, he only killed
Prince Deokseong as a warning.

261
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,849
It is a warning not to have
the Queen Dowager as your patron.

262
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,351
The Queen Dowager and Park Jong-hwan

263
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,645
will propose an offer
you will not be able to refuse.

264
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,106
And if you do,
they will find whatever fault they can

265
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,441
and exploit it to harm you.

266
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,027
The King foresaw this
and issued an empty threat

267
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,528
under the pretext of suspicion.

268
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,822
It was not an empty threat.

269
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,577
He said I was already dead to him

270
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,956
and that killing me
would be a child's play.

271
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,549
I tried to take the initiative,

272
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,012
but I neglected the fact that
the King was a skillful tactician.

273
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,182
I let my guard down
when he promised to spare my life.

274
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,268
He outplayed me right then and there.

275
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,231
Do not beat yourself up.

276
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,442
It is only the start.
We have a ways to go.

277
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,364
I must reassess.

278
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,584
KANG MONG-WOO

279
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,370
Your Majesty.

280
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,331
What has you so deep in thought?

281
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,043
It is nothing.

282
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,340
Your Majesty, I have a request.

283
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,884
What is it?

284
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,265
Please grant me access to Yeongchwijeong.

285
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,061
Do you not know
what kind of a place Yeongchwijeong is?

286
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,317
I am well aware
that you established the place

287
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,820
to play baduk in peace
without any interference.

288
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,657
I will provide you with extra comfort
should you grant me access.

289
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,617
Please grant me your approval.

290
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,746
I will not.

291
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,789
However, Your Majesty--

292
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,875
I already gave you my answer.

293
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,006
Your Majesty.

294
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,592
Have you perhaps

295
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,470
forgotten the promise you made to me
three years ago?

296
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,973
I cannot handle

297
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,142
such an important duty.

298
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,520
I shall grant your request

299
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,314
no matter

300
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,108
what it may be about.

301
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,780
I believed in your words back then

302
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,531
and risked my life for you.

303
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,116
And I continue to do so even now.

304
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,372
Have I ever forsaken that promise?

305
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,502
Have I ever not granted your request?

306
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,670
No, not even a single time.

307
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,673
Thus,

308
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,969
I have no doubt
that you will grant my request this time.

309
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,271
Fine.

310
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,443
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

311
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,569
However,

312
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:32,119
I have clearly stated
to the court officials

313
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,122
that only talented baduk players
may enter Yeongchwijeong.

314
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,374
As I cannot make an exception for you,

315
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,169
I shall grant you entrance
when your skill has become proficient.

316
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:44,965
But Your Majesty.

317
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,552
Captain Joo has access to Yeongchwijeong

318
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,053
despite his ignorance in baduk!

319
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:50,971
Sang-hwa…

320
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,852
carries his sword around.

321
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,739
If you feel wronged,

322
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,700
challenge him in a fight and win.

323
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,955
Is anyone outside?

324
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,128
Yes, Your Majesty. Did you call for me?

325
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,214
As I skipped today's afternoon study,
I shall have nighttime study.

326
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,175
Summon the Nightshift Royal Secretary.

327
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,551
I shall, Your Majesty.

328
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,107
Your Majesty.

329
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,235
Did you use me as an excuse
to Court Lady Dong again?

330
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,947
She requested access to Yeongchwijeong,
so I had no choice.

331
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,077
You are the best excuse
that I can use against her.

332
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,624
Has Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
come to the palace yet?

333
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,000
He has not.

334
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,670
Order him to come to Yeongchwijeong
as soon as he does.

335
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,671
Your Majesty.

336
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,965
You have a morning assembly
at the hall of governance today.

337
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,217
Right.

338
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,677
Order him to be there
as soon as the assembly is over.

339
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,845
I will, Your Majesty.

340
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,998
You may await His Majesty's orders here.

341
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,084
Could you do me a favor?

342
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,669
Please speak.

343
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,089
This is the list of officials
awaiting promotion.

344
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,717
You shall write up
their official appointment letters.

345
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,344
Yes, my lord.

346
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,407
So it seems Yoo Hyun-bo
will be returning to the court after all.

347
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,035
Where are the petitions for His Majesty?

348
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,594
Did I not order you to remove this one?

349
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,346
My lord.

350
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,890
This pertains to an urgent matter
at the border region.

351
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,518
I believe it should be
reviewed by His Majesty.

352
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,146
It is against our treaty with the Qing

353
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,981
to repair collapsed fortresses.

354
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,525
An envoy from the Qing will be here soon.

355
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,153
If the matter causes a diplomatic issue,

356
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,405
will you take responsibility?

357
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,993
However, His Majesty should be informed.

358
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,454
Do you think he is in the dark?

359
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,708
Do not be pompous
and lay low as if you were dead.

360
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,795
Never forget that
there are people ready to drag you down.

361
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,006
Do you understand?

362
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,009
Yes, my lord.

363
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,433
What is it?

364
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,018
The gidaeryeong
has asked for a baduk table.

365
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,186
What shall I do?

366
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,730
You take care of it.

367
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,399
Gather the petitions and follow me.

368
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,400
Yes, my lord.

369
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,948
I did not expect you to come yourself.

370
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,744
Did you not ask for a baduk table
to see me?

371
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,829
Even if that had been my intention,

372
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,456
you could have chosen not to come.

373
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,378
Why did you return?

374
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,466
Was the pain from three years ago
not enough?

375
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,843
If you wish to discuss
the pain I experienced then,

376
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,554
you should ask for my forgiveness first.

377
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,599
You forged an attestation
that I had never given.

378
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,937
I do not need

379
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,439
your forgiveness.

380
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,109
I only did what I had to.

381
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,446
You have become rather brazen.

382
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,866
I must say that it is quite a relief.

383
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,539
To go against the King who has mastered
all trickery and deception,

384
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,083
such brazenness would be necessary.

385
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,881
What do you mean

386
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,134
by going against the King?

387
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,472
You asked why I have returned.

388
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,935
I have returned to bring down the King
who tricked his way onto the throne

389
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,772
by fooling the world
with his wicked wiles.

390
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,609
I shall offer you an opportunity as well.

391
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,030
The opportunity to get revenge
on the enemy who slayed your father.

392
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,951
Will you join hands with me?

393
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,984
I thought you might have run away in fear
after our conversation last night.

394
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,281
Is that why you ordered
the Special Firearms Unit to follow me?

395
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,409
It would be a waste to lose
my precious baduk opponent, would it not?

396
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,663
Do not be concerned.

397
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,083
I will not run away of my own volition,

398
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,045
not unless I die or am expelled.

399
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,006
That means there is something
you want from me.

400
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,633
What is it?

401
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,514
As you are aware,

402
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,059
I only play baduk when there is a bet.

403
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,653
You dare to suggest
a game of baduk gamble?

404
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,531
If you win,

405
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,325
you may decide my fate
however you see fit.

406
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,993
If I win,

407
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,663
I beg you to grant me a wish,
whatever that may be.

408
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,917
You want me to retract my promise of death
should you get a patron?

409
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,253
Your Majesty,

410
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,090
I will not beg you to spare my life.

411
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,851
It all sounds like
I would be losing out greatly.

412
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,526
All right.

413
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,653
I shall approve of your proposal.

414
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,405
Thank you, Your Majesty.

415
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,249
It would not be proper to withdraw
all the stones for a fresh game, would it?

416
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,796
You should have
made your proposal earlier.

417
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,047
My apologies.

418
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,477
So…

419
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,313
who won?

420
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,983
As we played while calculating
10 to 20 moves ahead of each other,

421
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,651
the game did not progress much.

422
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,862
It will take a few days at the least
to see who wins.

423
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,826
Will Kim Myung-ha join hands with you?

424
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,079
It will take a few days for him as well.

425
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,582
What about Yoo Hyun-bo?

426
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,044
We must get payback for Se-dong.

427
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,256
Go collect all his winnings
and leave nothing behind.

428
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,059
Hey.

429
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,978
Why do we not
leave this much as their cut?

430
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,065
The order was to collect everything.

431
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,316
Everything?

432
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,111
All right then.

433
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,870
Hold on now.

434
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,163
Where are you guys off to?

435
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,123
Damn it. Did I not tell you?

436
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,042
I said we needed to give them their cut.

437
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,268
Halt.

438
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,487
What is going on?

439
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,824
These lowly bastards were being shameless,

440
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,159
so I was teaching them some manners.

441
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,748
Who are you

442
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,751
-to teach them manners or fault them
-My lord.

443
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,586
-for being shameless?
-My lord…

444
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,467
What are you staring at? Get lost.

445
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,852
Let us leave. Come on.

446
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,531
Man-bok was right to cut in.

447
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,491
Why did you let those lowly brats go?

448
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,328
I did not want to let them go either.

449
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,622
Then why?

450
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,791
Do not tell me that
it was because of the onlookers.

451
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,960
Were you worried your promotion
would be withdrawn

452
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,420
if the Special Firearms Unit
were to find out?

453
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,214
My lord.

454
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:15,720
Why do you think those brats
placed their bets on Kang Mong-woo?

455
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,888
What do you mean why?

456
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,598
They just got lucky.

457
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:24,562
They placed their bets
knowing he would win.

458
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,938
And how would they have known?

459
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,400
As they work for him.

460
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,114
Do you now understand why I let them leave
with their lives intact?

461
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,118
Do you mean you did so
to win Kang Mong-woo's favor?

462
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,245
Still, it was too much.

463
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,998
Is it not a waste
to give them all that fortune?

464
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,334
Why would you think that is a waste?

465
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,504
Once you become Kang Mong-woo's patron,

466
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,133
you can make him cough up 10 times,
or even 20 times the amount.

467
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,179
That is easier said than done.

468
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,474
In return for your efforts
to bring me back into the court,

469
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:06,395
I will bring Kang Mong-woo
and make him kneel before you.

470
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,858
Have a drink.

471
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,362
By the way,

472
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,449
did you ever commit
a discourtesy to the Principal Director?

473
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,078
He made up all kinds of excuses
to go against your promotion.

474
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,289
I barely got his approval
only after spending a hefty sum.

475
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,919
I can only wonder in question

476
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,796
at his disapproval of me.

477
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,063
Principal Director, have you been well?

478
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,191
We have not conversed in a long time.

479
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,403
I wish to visit you often
to seek your counsel.

480
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,950
Since you speak of my counsel,
I shall offer one for you.

481
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,326
Please do.

482
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,413
Your promotion

483
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,456
was only approved
thanks to the Great Lord's plea,

484
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,459
despite your performance review being
marked out by His Majesty multiple times

485
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,462
to be reinforced for further inspection
and disciplinary actions.

486
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,965
If you get caught by the
Special Firearms Unit and dismissed,

487
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,176
the Great Lord will be in a pickle.

488
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,510
Therefore,

489
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,930
you had better sever ties
with your indecent business.

490
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,641
I am referring to the gambling den.

491
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,479
I will heed to your words, my lord.

492
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,461
Just ignore him.

493
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,759
Myung-ha.

494
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,398
Even the lowest Royal Secretary
must enjoy some prestige.

495
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,902
You look very well indeed.

496
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,127
Such cheek from a mere traitor's son.

497
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,809
Where are you going?

498
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,104
I am on my way to Yeongchwijeong.

499
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,939
Why do you ask?

500
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,195
Yoo Hyun-bo has returned to court
as the Third Minister of Rites.

501
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,781
If you go this way,

502
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,533
you will run into him.

503
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,745
I have no reason to avoid him.

504
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,964
No one avoids feces out of fear.

505
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,257
One does so because of its filth.

506
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,137
There is another route to Yeongchwijeong.

507
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,388
Follow me.

508
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,986
This must be that famous peach tree.

509
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,115
The tree that the late king planted
with His Majesty in mind.

510
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,495
Reviving it would be a challenge indeed.

511
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,004
Head straight this way,
and you will find Yeongchwijeong.

512
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,715
You have not given me an answer yet.

513
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,468
It is best to stay silent
to a ridiculous proposition.

514
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,346
Please reconsider.

515
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,766
My answer will not change,
even if I do reconsider a thousand times.

516
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,518
What is the reason?

517
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,443
Since you are being deliberately obtuse,

518
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,195
I shall point out the flaws clearly.

519
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,864
The goal that you dream of

520
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,909
is difficult to achieve
even with a just cause, suitable means,

521
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,078
and a blessing from the heavens.

522
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,164
Why would I risk my life

523
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,333
for something that will clearly fail?

524
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,254
While I cannot move the heavens,

525
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,134
if I prove to you that I have the plan
and means to reach my goal,

526
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,512
will you trust me?

527
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,268
I shall arrange an audience

528
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,729
with Grand Prince Munseong
and Princess Jangryeong.

529
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,486
You would need approval
from Her Royal Highness to that end.

530
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,905
Do you think she will grant her approval

531
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,740
when I am a thorn in her side?

532
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,910
Furthermore, even if she did,

533
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,413
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan
would not sit back.

534
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,998
You can wait and see.

535
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,047
Here comes His Majesty!

536
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,565
Your Majesty.

537
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,777
What are you doing here?

538
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,363
We were on our way to Yeongchwijeong.

539
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,699
With so many inquisitive eyes
on the gidaeryeong--

540
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,410
Hold your tongue.
The question was for Mong-woo.

541
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,458
As I have not yet mastered
the ins and outs of the palace,

542
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,003
the Sixth Royal Secretary was aiding me
to find my way to Yeongchwijeong.

543
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,171
How amusing.

544
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:11,051
You dared to enter Yeongchwijeong
when I did not even summon you?

545
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,805
I had not thought it through.

546
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,975
I beg your pardon for my foolishness.

547
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,226
I do not want to see you.

548
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,479
Go and wait for my command.

549
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,898
As you wish, Your Majesty.

550
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,366
I see it now.

551
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,494
The two of you conspired

552
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,664
and had Kang Mong-woo
apply to become the gidaeryeong.

553
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,792
That is not true, Your Majesty.

554
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,045
Until I was ordered to play
baduk against him

555
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,671
at Chundangdae upon your command,

556
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,423
I did not even know he was alive.

557
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,468
You once boasted about
your close friendship with him.

558
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,304
There was a time

559
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,766
when I sought to
become close to Kang Mong-woo.

560
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,227
However, ever since
the incident three years ago,

561
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,854
I had long forgotten him and moved on.

562
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,191
As for Kang Mong-woo,
I am certain he has a grudge against me.

563
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,275
And…

564
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,612
you do not have any grudge against him?

565
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,534
Despite my unforgivable crime,

566
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,077
you have shown me great kindness

567
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,579
by sparing my life
and giving me a government post.

568
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:25,000
My only wish is that
bygones can be bygones.

569
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,509
Have you found a way to save the tree?

570
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,640
I have made countless inquiries
and found a few promising ways.

571
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,558
And?

572
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,727
Some suggested replacing the soil,

573
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,772
and others suggested
replanting the tree in fertile land.

574
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,357
What shall I do?

575
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,235
You may not replace the soil

576
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,113
or replant the tree elsewhere.

577
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,075
Find another way.

578
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

579
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,618
Has His Majesty summoned me
to Yeongchwijeong?

580
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,910
No, my lord.

581
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,537
He commanded you to return home.

582
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,858
Your Majesty.

583
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,319
An urgent matter requires your attention

584
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,279
regarding your travel for the gisinje.

585
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,572
My ears are open.

586
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,949
I apologize for saying this,

587
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,952
but many offices have petitioned
for the reduction of the troops

588
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,747
to be mobilized for the said event.

589
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,588
Do not generalize and state clearly.

590
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,383
Who discussed what and where?

591
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,555
During a meeting at the Ministry of War,

592
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,393
some raised concerns about the high number
of troops being mobilized for the event.

593
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,196
What do you mean high?

594
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,699
Some may suspect

595
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,119
that you are inspecting the troops
under the pretense of traveling.

596
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,747
That is what the Ministry of War
is concerned about.

597
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,293
And who would dare raise such suspicion?

598
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,339
The Qing's envoy is arriving soon.

599
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:22,219
"Do not do anything that may arouse
suspicion from the Qing's envoy."

600
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,346
Is that what you are implying?

601
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,389
Your Majesty.

602
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,183
That is not what I meant to convey--

603
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,894
What else did they say about the matter?

604
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,276
Your Majesty.

605
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,986
I apologize,

606
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,781
but the cost of your travel rises
in proportion to the number of troops.

607
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,826
The officials at the Ministry of Taxation
also warned

608
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,163
that the costs might not be met
without levying a tax for your journey.

609
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,792
The purpose of my travel

610
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,670
is for the first gisinje of the late king

611
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,589
after the three-year mourning period.

612
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,716
If we cut the number of troops,

613
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,511
the people will think
that I lack honor for the late king.

614
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,639
Thus, the offices' petition
will not be granted.

615
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,557
However,

616
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,727
I will ride a horse
instead of a royal palanquin.

617
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,023
I will reduce the number of officials
and court ladies in attendance as well.

618
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,192
The officials traveling with me

619
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,694
shall do the same.

620
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,406
Would that soothe your concerns?

621
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,411
What a wise answer, Your Majesty.

622
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,997
We will follow your commands.

623
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,207
I am done here.

624
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,544
Everyone here shall shoot an arrow
before they leave.

625
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,546
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

626
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,263
I mean,

627
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,182
what is so bad about placating the Qing?

628
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,185
Why would he rage over a petition
seeking to prevent trouble?

629
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,980
I cannot seem to wrap my head around
what His Majesty is thinking.

630
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,818
His Majesty is placating the people,
not the Qing.

631
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,737
The people?

632
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,614
Despite Joo Sang-hwa's efforts,

633
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,033
the rumors about His Majesty
continue to spread across the land.

634
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,118
The public sentiment will only worsen

635
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,371
if they find the gisinje lacking.

636
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,831
How could he not get enraged

637
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,583
to see his court stirring up trouble?

638
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,210
Principal Director.

639
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,255
What do you think about
Minister Min's opinion?

640
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,800
Let us speak in privacy, Great Lord.

641
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,516
You have enraged him
with your nonsense, Minister Min.

642
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,150
Pardon?

643
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,195
But that is…

644
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,321
Why?

645
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,407
Can you not do it?

646
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,785
Of course I can.

647
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,912
I will speak to Her Majesty.

648
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,249
Then I shall convey this
to Her Royal Highness.

649
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,427
You want me to summon
Kang Mong-woo, the gidaeryeong?

650
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,555
His Majesty would be furious
if he were to find out.

651
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,850
I cannot do it.

652
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,102
I have nothing to ask of the gidaeryeong.

653
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,604
Father.

654
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,189
If you want to become
the patron of the gidaeryeong,

655
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,816
please find another way.

656
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,067
Your Majesty.

657
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,696
I would not have brought it up
if that had been the case.

658
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,198
Is it…

659
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,784
the Principal Director's command?

660
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,245
No,

661
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,789
it must be Her Royal Highness's command.

662
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,253
She could just summon him
to her quarters instead.

663
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,136
It is to avoid His Majesty's wrath
when he finds out.

664
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,972
They need a scapegoat.

665
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,768
They only sent you to me
to prevent me from telling His Majesty

666
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,812
that Her Royal Highness is behind it
like the First Senior Consort did.

667
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,772
Am I wrong?

668
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,023
Your Majesty.

669
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,819
Just consider this your duty
as a daughter-in-law to prevent discord

670
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,280
between a son and his mother.

671
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,389
You have been waiting for this,
have you not?

672
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,265
Thank you, as always.

673
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,226
It is nothing.

674
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,646
What about the herbal medicine
for Her Majesty?

675
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,731
It will be ready soon.

676
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,863
Her Majesty takes herbal medicine?

677
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,990
Her chronic migraine has come back.

678
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,120
-What happened?
-Is it not obvious?

679
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,040
Her Royal Highness is forcing her
to carry out a distasteful task.

680
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,918
She was forced to do so
when the First Senior Consort was exiled.

681
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,964
She went to plead with His Majesty
upon Her Royal Highness's orders

682
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,632
and earned his ire for no reason.

683
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,936
I will skip the morning assembly today
and inspect the Directorate of Training.

684
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,564
-Lead the way.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

685
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,761
His Majesty is away
to visit the Directorate of Training.

686
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,431
Tell the Queen
to carry out my order today.

687
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,099
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

688
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,926
I am writing to you
as an urgent matter came to my attention.

689
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,720
Last night,
Her Majesty's illness worsened.

690
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,430
According to the female physicians,

691
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,016
it is due to Her Royal Highness.

692
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,687
Gidaeryeong Kang,
Her Majesty has summoned you.

693
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,320
As you have told me to send word
should Her Royal Highness make a move,

694
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,072
I send you this letter just in case.

695
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,786
Your Majesty.

696
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,288
Gidaeryeong Kang is here.

697
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,874
Let him enter.

698
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,530
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
at your service, Your Majesty.

699
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,244
Please wait.

700
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,038
The person you should
offer your services to

701
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,081
will be here shortly.

702
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,667
Your Majesty.

703
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,335
Forgive me,

704
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,921
but you seem distressed.

705
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,383
You have keen eyes.

706
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,635
I am distressed.

707
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,099
I have a way to rid you of your concern.

708
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,227
Would you like to hear it?

709
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,648
Just how would you know what concerns me?

710
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,985
Is it not because Her Royal Highness

711
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:21,197
is coming to your quarters to see me
while His Majesty is away?

712
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,243
How did you know?

713
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,581
His Majesty has left the palace
on purpose.

714
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,000
When Her Royal Highness comes to see me,

715
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:35,587
His Majesty will rush here
at that very moment.

716
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,548
What…

717
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,091
What could I do?

718
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,135
At this rate,

719
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,554
His Majesty's wrath will be upon me.

720
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,182
I have an idea.

721
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,309
We have no time,

722
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,978
so allow me to ask a few questions
before I share my idea.

723
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,064
Ask me anything.

724
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,296
Your Majesty, Her Royal Highness is here.

725
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,978
Is the Grand Prince inside?

726
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,647
Grand Prince Munseong
left for the Royal Garden earlier.

727
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,316
Do you know where he is
in the Royal Garden?

728
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,444
Gidaeryeong.

729
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,363
You may raise your head.

730
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,956
My goodness.

731
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:59,754
How come no one told me
he was such a fine-looking young man?

732
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,381
My apologies.

733
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,551
It was my first time seeing him today,

734
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,885
so I could not inform you.

735
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,471
I was not talking to you, Your Majesty.

736
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,141
Just stay silent.

737
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,143
I apologize, Your…

738
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,520
Royal Highness.

739
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,484
You may sit comfortably, Gidaeryeong.

740
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,279
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Royal Highness.

741
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,244
I am told that you are
exceptional at baduk.

742
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,663
I hear His Majesty is quite satisfied.

743
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,958
Tell me, how does it feel
being the gidaeryeong?

744
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,627
Some may praise my skill,

745
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,005
but it is nowhere close to His Majesty's.

746
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:45,508
I head to Yeongchwijeong daily
hoping to learn from him.

747
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:51,473
I finally understand
why His Majesty is so fond of you.

748
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,558
I apologize,

749
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,852
but I am unsure of his affections.

750
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,229
He has not summoned me
for the past few days.

751
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,566
If he does not like someone,
he does not hesitate to exile them

752
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,693
and never sees them again.

753
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,986
I believe

754
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,281
he is in the process of molding you
into the companion of his liking.

755
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,870
Your words are putting my heart at ease,
Your Royal Highness.

756
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,039
Is that so?

757
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,209
Then we should see each other often.

758
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,131
I would like to

759
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,803
become a dependable patron for you.

760
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,679
What do you say?

761
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,768
I am very grateful,

762
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,896
but the offer is excessively generous.

763
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,731
It is not excessive.

764
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,566
Do not read too much into it.

765
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,152
As it is something I cannot handle,

766
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,488
I must beg you to withdraw your offer.

767
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:54,119
How dare you decline
despite my repeated requests?

768
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,747
I wonder why you are being so arrogant.

769
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,624
Tell me.

770
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,710
Here comes His Majesty!

771
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,566
Welcome, Your Majesty.

772
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,325
Do not walk away.

773
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,289
Did you just return to the palace?

774
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,499
It is quite disappointing

775
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,878
to learn that you would come here
before visiting my quarters first.

776
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,629
I went to your quarters first

777
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,756
and came here
as the court ladies directed me.

778
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,218
What brings you all the way
to the Queen's quarters?

779
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,433
I came by to give my regards
after hearing that she was unwell.

780
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,312
That is quite strange.

781
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:06,441
You have never masked your discontent
at the news of the Queen's ailments.

782
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,779
And yet, you came
all the way here to see her?

783
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,156
Also,

784
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,993
what brings you here, Mong-woo?

785
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,330
Your Majesty, I--

786
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,540
Her Majesty must have summoned him.

787
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,085
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

788
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,132
Did you summon the gidaeryeong, My Queen?

789
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:39,307
Yes, I did.

790
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,227
This is becoming even more strange.

791
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,563
You do not know how to play baduk

792
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,566
and are not even feeling well.

793
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,735
So why would you summon the gidaeryeong

794
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:56,658
who should only answer to me
while I happened to be away?

795
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,037
I wanted to discuss the matter
of Grand Prince Munseong with him.

796
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,996
And what could have

797
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,333
prompted you to discuss a matter
regarding the Grand Prince

798
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,711
with a complete stranger
like the gidaeryeong?

799
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,005
Well…

800
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,840
Because…

801
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,844
I was going to inform you in advance,

802
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,429
but I failed to do so.

803
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,475
I was not aware
that you were out of the palace.

804
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,977
My goodness.

805
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,064
Seeing as she cannot speak straight,
she must be very ill.

806
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,233
Let us leave so she can rest.

807
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,818
Mong-woo, you answer me.

808
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,446
Why did the Queen summon you?

809
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:42,620
I do not know why Her Majesty summoned me,

810
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,372
but I will inform you of our conversation.

811
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,833
Her Majesty questioned me

812
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:51,045
if I would be willing to teach
baduk to Grand Prince Munseong.

813
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,883
And what did you say?

814
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:01,514
I replied that I could not do so
without your approval.

815
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,435
And how come you sought
a baduk tutor for the Grand Prince?

816
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,479
The truth is,

817
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:13,484
Grand Prince Munseong asked me
to get him a baduk table a while ago.

818
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,194
I assume

819
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,489
that the news of the gidaeryeong
sparked his curiosity.

820
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,161
Mother,

821
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,496
did you happen to hear their conversation?

822
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,250
I did not.

823
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,253
It must have taken place
before my arrival.

824
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,338
Is that so?

825
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,174
Is anyone outside?

826
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,679
Did you summon me, Your Majesty?

827
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,973
Bring Grand Prince Munseong immediately.

828
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,142
As you wish, Your Majesty.

829
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,521
Your Majesty.

830
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,234
Surely an offhand request
for a baduk table from the Grand Prince

831
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,278
cannot be so important.

832
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,155
Depending on his answer,

833
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,200
this may become an important matter.

834
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,372
If he answers
that no such request was made,

835
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,542
it means the Queen and the gidaeryeong
have both lied to me.

836
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:12,460
And if so,

837
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,171
I must find out…

838
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,676
why they have done so.

839
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,444
Your Majesty,

840
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,780
Grand Prince Munseong is here.

841
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,758
Welcome, Grand Prince Munseong.

842
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,344
Grand Prince.

843
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,556
Have you ever asked the Queen
to get a baduk table for you?

844
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,147
Yes, Your Majesty.

845
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:18,860
I have indeed asked her to get one for me.

846
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,238
How come you turned to the Queen
instead of me?

847
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,783
I wanted to inform you

848
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,035
after learning the basics of baduk first.

849
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,456
I thought you might then find joy
in my interest in baduk--

850
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:36,461
It appears the Grand Prince
wanted to win your heart over with baduk.

851
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,255
No, that is not--

852
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,840
How dare you talk back?

853
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,925
Is that all you have learned from me?

854
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,929
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

855
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,601
Your senseless meddling

856
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,269
ended up leading to trouble!

857
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,772
Your Majesty.

858
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,191
If Her Royal Highness gets angry,

859
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,486
beg for her forgiveness
and ask to be punished.

860
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:05,656
That way, His Majesty's wrath
will not fall upon you.

861
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,493
Please forgive me.

862
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,870
This happened due to my foolishness,

863
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,373
so please punish me
and do not condemn Grand Prince Munseong.

864
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,961
Grand Prince Munseong.

865
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,005
Yes, Your Majesty.

866
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,674
Do you really wish to learn baduk?

867
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,510
Do not mind him, Your Majesty.

868
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,428
He does not know what he is saying.

869
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,347
He only feigned interest
as a means to an end.

870
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,016
-Is that not true, Grand Prince?
-Speak up.

871
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,853
Do you want to learn baduk?

872
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,023
If you would allow it,

873
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,150
I would like to learn.

874
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,655
All right then.

875
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,366
I will get you a baduk table,

876
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,786
so learn from the gidaeryeong.

877
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,790
I am very grateful, Your Majesty.

878
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,958
That will not do.

879
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,378
You will only spoil him
if you grant his request easily.

880
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,339
With you in charge of his education,

881
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,508
what could possibly go wrong?

882
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,096
Though that is quite true…

883
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,975
You must teach him with all your heart.

884
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,936
Of course, Your Majesty.

885
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,605
I will try my best to become a good tutor.

886
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,050
Was involving Grand Prince Munseong
your idea or the Queen's?

887
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,016
As Her Majesty was distressed,

888
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,018
I merely showed her a way out.

889
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,730
However, I did not fabricate
the Grand Prince's interest.

890
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,773
How come you helped the Queen?

891
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,319
Her Majesty and I
were about to fall into the snares

892
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,655
that the two most noble persons
had prepared for one another.

893
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,699
I could not sit back and watch.

894
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,912
I simply helped her as it was the only way
to ensure my own survival.

895
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,624
Are you certain that is all?

896
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:23,878
Yes, Your Majesty.

897
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,172
That is all there is to it.

898
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:36,015
The Queen Dowager, the woman
who gave birth to me and raised me,

899
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,226
will not admit defeat so easily.

900
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:45,232
Nor will she excuse you
for helping out the Queen.

901
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,692
She will do whatever it takes…

902
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,071
to have you groveling on your four

903
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:54,075
while begging for her forgiveness
with tears flowing from your eyes.

904
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,870
How do you plan on avoiding her wrath?

905
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,293
I have no means to avoid that.

906
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:08,798
However, risking her wrath was inevitable

907
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,633
to uphold your command regarding patrons.

908
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,303
All I can do now
is turn to you for your help.

909
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,439
Do you still expect help from me?

910
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,536
Do not worry.

911
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,664
You are the gidaeryeong and my person.

912
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,834
As you have adhered to my royal command,

913
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,714
I shall protect you too.

914
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,189
Your Majesty.

915
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,984
Forgive me, but may I ask you a question?

916
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,322
It seems like you have much to ask for.

917
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,033
What is it?

918
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:20,286
How come you granted
Grand Prince Munseong's request?

919
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,418
I learned baduk when I was his age.

920
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,463
I granted his request
as it reminded me of my past.

921
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,803
Do not dream of using
the Grand Prince's tutoring

922
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,514
as an excuse to neglect
your duties as the gidaeryeong.

923
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,766
Am I understood?

924
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,896
Of course, Your Majesty.

925
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,044
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
at your service, Your Highness.

926
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,547
This is the gidaeryeong
I told you about, Sister.

927
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:18,969
Greetings.

928
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,725
Where is the baduk table?

929
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:28,562
It is in the pavilion. Let us head there.

930
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,003
Myung-ha?

931
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,183
Your Highnesses.

932
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,519
Have you been well?

933
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,189
I apologize for the belated greetings.

934
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:15,276
Please forgive me for failing my duties.

935
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,570
No.

936
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,030
Do not say such things.

937
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,580
Your Highness,

938
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,665
do you not remember him?

939
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,333
To speak the truth,

940
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,377
I do not recognize him.

941
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,754
It is natural you do not.

942
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,758
Did I not mention that Myung-ha
became the Sixth Royal Secretary?

943
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,635
You did.

944
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,389
When will you teach me baduk?

945
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,266
We have no time.

946
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,227
Her Royal Highness
only granted an hour of learning.

947
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,479
Let us begin now.

948
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,126
Let us stop here for today.

949
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,461
As you wish, Your Majesty.

950
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,551
I will head to Yeongchwijeong.

951
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,802
Summon Kang Mong-woo.

952
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,180
Your Majesty.

953
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:29,683
The gidaeryeong is currently tutoring
the Grand Prince at the Royal Garden.

954
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,143
Yes, that is right.

955
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,895
It slipped my mind.

956
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,149
It did not slip your mind.

957
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,193
You are simply too engrossed
in a single matter.

958
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,946
On what, exactly?

959
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,989
The gidaeryeong you keep summoning,

960
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,284
Kang Mong-woo.

961
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,833
Enough of that nonsense.

962
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,216
No one shall follow me.

963
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,600
So?

964
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,102
Have you reached a decision?

965
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,020
My answer is no.

966
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,442
I cannot put Their Highnesses at risk
solely to achieve my goal.

967
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,027
I doubt that is your true reason.

968
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,572
You are afraid
that the incident three years ago

969
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,533
may repeat itself.

970
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,497
Losing your kin again for aiding me
would be a tragedy you want to avoid.

971
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,209
If that is how you feel,

972
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,877
I will not insist.

973
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,014
You are right.

974
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,724
I am afraid.

975
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,435
I am afraid…

976
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,895
I might hurt you again.

977
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,194
Will you join hands with me?

978
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,867
I will.

979
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,667
CAPTIVATING THE KING

980
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,712
The story in itself is trivial,
but it is rather strange.

981
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:07,966
The Sixth Royal Secretary and I
do not share a bond worth repairing.

982
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,762
Kim Myung-ha seemed
to want a strong bond with you.

983
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,765
What a mysterious man.

984
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,768
He is hogging His Majesty's attention.

985
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,020
Sever all your emotional ties
to Kang Hee-soo.

986
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,398
The King is already suspicious of us.

987
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,066
As he has returned to me alive,

988
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:28,695
I intend to protect him this time
no matter what happens.

989
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,281
How do you…

990
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,992
sever your feelings for another?

991
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:41,333
