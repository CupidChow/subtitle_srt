1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,819
That is enough.

3
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,200
That will not shield me

4
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,744
from the heavens' will to punish me.

5
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,373
Punish, Your Majesty?

6
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,125
That is unreasonable.

7
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,919
You have no idea…

8
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,885
of the tremendous
and serious crime I am hiding.

9
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,229
It is about time
that the crimes come to light…

10
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,942
and justice is served.

11
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,491
EPISODE 12

12
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,250
Let her know I am here.

13
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,878
Your Royal Highness.

14
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,839
His Majesty has arrived.

15
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,847
Welcome, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:35,113
I came worried that you might be startled
by the thunder and lightning,

17
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,741
but it seems I was concerned needlessly.

18
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,204
As I am the eldest member
of the royal family,

19
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,708
it would be inappropriate for me

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,669
to cause a ruckus
over some thunder and lightning.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,338
Mother.

22
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,509
The peach tree in the Royal Garden

23
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,636
was struck by lightning
and went up in flames.

24
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,766
I did not know
such a disaster had occurred.

25
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,104
Senior Court Lady Han must not have
told me to avoid startling me.

26
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,943
It is an ominous sign
that lightning struck the palace,

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,654
but on the bright side, no one was hurt.

28
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,448
Let us consider that good luck.

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you truly believe it to be good luck?

30
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,917
My late brother handpicked that peach tree
and had it planted for me.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,670
Why do you think
the heavens struck it with lightning?

32
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,341
I am afraid

33
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,802
that my ascension to the throne

34
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,139
might have been
against the heavens' wishes.

35
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,265
Nonsense!

36
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,435
Why do you make
such a fainthearted remark?

37
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,728
Mother.

38
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,066
Are you not afraid?

39
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,947
What should I be afraid of?

40
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,910
Do you truly have nothing
that burdens your heart?

41
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,625
Your words are stranger
than the thunder and lightning.

42
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,462
The people will be stirred yet again
by this incident.

43
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,798
We cannot have you
be the first one to be so affected.

44
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,133
Stay resolute.

45
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,807
I only asked out of the agony in my heart.

46
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,393
Do not think much of it.

47
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,163
I apologize, Your Majesty.

48
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,469
The world thinks
that I poisoned my brother to death.

49
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,102
You know…

50
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,898
who poisoned
my brother to death, do you not?

51
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,664
I will…

52
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,334
order them to bring a new one.

53
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,586
There is no need.

54
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,716
That will be all for the night.

55
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,721
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,341
I should have had
that peach tree chopped down

57
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,302
and thrown it into the fire long ago.

58
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,139
Why is he trembling in fear
over a mere tree?

59
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,433
His Majesty regards that tree

60
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,436
as himself.

61
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,524
That is why he went
above and beyond to save it.

62
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,402
Do not be foolish.

63
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,656
This is because he does not have
an heir to continue his line.

64
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,618
Had he had a son and heir with the Queen,

65
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,996
he would not be so easily swayed
by a mere strange event.

66
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,627
It seems that it is more urgent
to find a new queen

67
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,254
than Grand Prince Munseong's spouse.

68
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,381
You have a point.

69
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,717
I shall see to it.

70
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,017
Even under normal circumstances,

71
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,145
rumors about His Majesty
spread like wildfire.

72
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,439
With such a bizarre incident,

73
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,150
word will spread wider and faster.

74
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,986
The peach tree
is the chink in His Majesty's armor.

75
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,490
Stand back
in the morning assembly tomorrow

76
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,326
and let the state councilors handle it.

77
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,119
Yes, Lord Park.

78
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,164
How is the Great Lord doing these days?

79
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,501
As Her Majesty's illness
is more serious than we thought,

80
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,962
he is seeking a way
to acquire a cure for her.

81
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,298
I hear he will not be attending
the morning assembly tomorrow.

82
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,343
The Queen Dowager
is quite distressed as well.

83
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,308
Let us soon discuss

84
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,435
a marriage arrangement.

85
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,231
Yes, Lord Park.

86
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,285
Please return safely, my lord.

87
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,876
Brother.

88
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,755
What did the Principal Director mean
by the marriage arrangement?

89
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,924
It seems our family
will have a queen again

90
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,093
after a century of waiting.

91
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,136
Sorry?

92
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,888
So the marriage arrangement he spoke of

93
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,850
was referring to the selection
of a new queen?

94
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,770
Do not speak of this to anyone.

95
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
Of course not.

96
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,589
Last night,

97
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,552
a strange event occurred, burning down
the peach tree in the Royal Garden.

98
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,387
This must be a sign…

99
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,435
to set me on the right path.

100
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,771
What do you all think?

101
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,450
Your Majesty.

102
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,036
May I answer your question?

103
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,122
You may.

104
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,916
Your Majesty.

105
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,087
Before I could carry out
your royal command to save the tree,

106
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,880
it was lost to lightning.

107
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,176
This is clearly the heavens punishing me

108
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,677
for my negligence.

109
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,263
As such, I will await your punishment.

110
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,850
Please punish me as you see fit.

111
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,942
Myung-ha.

112
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,695
You have admitted your mistake

113
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,031
and stood before me
to take responsibility for it.

114
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,659
I am truly impressed.

115
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,329
That is enough,
so do not wait for my punishment.

116
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,086
Your Majesty.

117
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,587
Forgive me for my words,

118
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,047
but what is the reason

119
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,675
for not punishing him
when his crime is so clear?

120
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,510
Goodness, Right State Councilor.

121
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,720
Do you think
the roaring thunder and lightning

122
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,890
was to dismiss
a mere sixth royal secretary?

123
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,977
I did not mean to suggest that.

124
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,354
-However--
-If you truly wish to soothe the heavens

125
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,730
by having someone seek punishment,

126
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,649
the high-ranking officials
should do so first,

127
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,234
and I, the king,

128
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,737
must do so as well.

129
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,202
The strange event by the heavens' hand

130
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,872
was to send its message to me,
not Kim Myung-ha.

131
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,419
Do you not agree, Principal Director?

132
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,301
You are right on all counts, Your Majesty.

133
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,555
In my humble opinion,
I believe the heavens struck lightning

134
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:49,852
to keep you vigilant
as they treasure you as a king.

135
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,903
I, Inspector General Kim Je-nam,

136
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,613
would like to share my thoughts.

137
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,573
I am listening.

138
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,244
Please use this as an opportunity
to right the wrongs of the land

139
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,997
that is sickening our nation
and harming our people.

140
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,584
Then, the recent disaster
will be transformed into a blessing.

141
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,965
Your words of advice…

142
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,676
are pleasing to hear.

143
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,011
Listen, Chief Royal Secretary.

144
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,096
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,973
Command me as you wish.

146
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,602
Each office shall investigate in detail
the wrongs within their organization

147
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,438
and make a report of their solution.

148
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,440
This applies to everyone,

149
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,110
from the overseers of offices
to those of lower posts.

150
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,278
Do you understand?

151
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,989
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

152
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,491
Heed my words, Left State Councilor.

153
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,497
Submit a recommendation of officials
to be named as special royal commissioners

154
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,457
who will investigate

155
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,794
corrupt and greedy magistrates,
including the former ones.

156
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,256
I shall carry out your command,
Your Majesty.

157
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,895
Choam.

158
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,523
Please wait.

159
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,198
Did you call me?

160
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,450
My greetings are belated.

161
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,619
Congratulations on becoming
the Inspector General.

162
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,163
I am not sure

163
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,001
receiving congratulations
is appropriate on a day like this,

164
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,129
but I am flattered by your warm welcome.

165
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,799
The recent event should not hinder me
from offering congratulations.

166
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,678
I wish to arrange a gathering for you
in the near future.

167
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,388
When would suit you best?

168
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,267
Forgive me,

169
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,019
but I do not think I can attend.

170
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,731
His Majesty has appointed me
Inspector General himself.

171
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,526
I should not fraternize with a powerhouse
without a just cause.

172
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,486
Also,

173
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,157
please refrain from calling me Choam.

174
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,366
That name

175
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,494
is only reserved for my friends.

176
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,350
Master.

177
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,021
Do you really think the heavens
struck lightning to crumble this nation?

178
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,777
What is your opinion,

179
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,196
Your Highness?

180
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,365
In my opinion,

181
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,369
I do not think
the heavens would be that heartless.

182
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,835
However, I am worried.

183
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,172
The peach tree
that my late father planted burned down.

184
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,634
I am sure His Majesty is grieving over it.

185
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,388
But I am uncertain
what to say to console him.

186
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,099
Your Highness.

187
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,435
Are you not afraid of His Majesty?

188
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,020
Of course, I am.

189
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,316
When I have committed a crime
against him like the last time, that is.

190
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,945
But at other times, not at all.

191
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,409
I heard the court maids gossiping

192
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,413
that His Majesty will harm me one day.

193
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,042
Even after hearing such words,

194
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,628
you are still not afraid of him?

195
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,673
His Majesty that I know
will never harm me.

196
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,302
He will protect Myung-ha as well.

197
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,855
Your Highness.

198
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,358
See? Did I not tell you?

199
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,992
It is good news
that His Highness trusts the King.

200
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,785
Hostility toward the King

201
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,621
would only put him at a greater risk.

202
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,582
However,

203
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,668
His Highness will come to see one day

204
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,463
what a heinous man

205
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,215
the King is.

206
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,843
My father

207
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,721
died before my eyes by the King's sword.

208
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,973
He slaughtered my father
in front of everyone.

209
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,141
Even beasts…

210
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,520
hold a grudge when one of its own
is slaughtered like so.

211
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,985
Even if the King spares my life
and forgives me a thousand times over,

212
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,904
he is still…

213
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,948
the enemy who killed my father.

214
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,811
Your Majesty, His Majesty has arrived.

215
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,609
Greetings, Your Majesty.

216
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,613
I apologize, but Her Majesty
is making herself presentable,

217
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,406
so please give her a moment.

218
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,921
I have finished, Your Majesty.

219
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,098
Tell me.

220
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,475
When will Her Majesty recover?

221
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,980
We can only learn about her symptoms
by checking her pulse.

222
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,482
We shall check her pulse
every morning and evening

223
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,651
and bring her herbal medicine.

224
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,614
Great Lord.

225
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,577
Please mind your manners

226
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,954
before His Majesty.

227
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,791
I apologize, Your Majesty.

228
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,876
Do not mind it.

229
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,882
The Queen will not be able to get her rest
if I stay here too long,

230
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,593
so I will excuse myself now.

231
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,346
Your Majesty, please stay a little longer.

232
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,518
It has been so long
since I have seen the two of you together.

233
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,065
Would that be all right?

234
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,279
If it is all right with you,

235
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,531
please stay longer.

236
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,370
I will.

237
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,085
Bring some tea for His Majesty.

238
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,024
Could the Queen

239
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,361
have been poisoned like my brother?

240
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,320
No, Your Majesty.

241
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,823
Her Majesty was innately weak,

242
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,742
and her chronic illness simply worsened.

243
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,120
How long does she have?

244
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:53,085
I am afraid to predict
the matters of her life,

245
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,881
but it seems her time is running out.

246
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,651
I have a matter
I wish to discuss with the Great Lord.

247
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,827
What could this be about
for you to seek privacy?

248
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,705
It may be painful for you to hear,

249
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,292
but please bear with me until the end.

250
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,004
If it is a painful matter, do not speak.
I will not listen.

251
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,588
Father.

252
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,079
Go ahead.

253
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,460
I am afraid

254
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,628
I will be

255
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,257
leaving you soon.

256
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,844
That is not true.

257
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,889
It is only your illness
that is making you dispirited.

258
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,100
A talented fortuneteller
from Mount Paektu swore to me

259
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,812
that you were born
with an extremely rare fate

260
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,898
and that you will bear His Majesty's heir

261
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,025
and live a long life.

262
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,029
Father.

263
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,156
Please hold on just a little longer.

264
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,617
I will find a talented physician
to cure you

265
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,203
even if I have to empty out my fortune.

266
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,918
People may point fingers at you

267
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,712
and call you a greedy miser,

268
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,257
but you have always been so generous

269
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,052
and understanding toward me.

270
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,808
The prospect of traveling
to the cold Underworld all alone

271
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,477
makes me feel hopeless

272
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,437
and terrified.

273
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,660
But as you have always treated me
with kindness despite my foolishness,

274
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,289
I will remember the warmth of your hands

275
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,166
as I face my death.

276
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,886
Father.

277
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,223
I have one wish.

278
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,518
I hope you will grant it.

279
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,396
I wish to

280
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,191
secure Grand Prince Munseong's safety
before I die.

281
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,280
I understand your affection for him.

282
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,741
But securing his safety is no easy feat.

283
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,953
If he becomes the Crown Prince,

284
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,831
his safety will be ensured.

285
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,335
Please attend the assembly

286
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,255
and petition His Majesty.

287
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,709
Be sure to mind your manners
in front of Her Royal Highness.

288
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,835
I understand.

289
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,694
These are highly valuable
100-year-old wild ginseng.

290
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,781
Hoping for your long and full life,

291
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,742
I went through great efforts
to acquire it.

292
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,286
Thank you.

293
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,038
I will gladly accept it.

294
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,506
Bring some tea.

295
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,693
So,

296
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,320
how old are your nieces?

297
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,905
Your Royal Highness.

298
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,702
The older one is 17,
and the younger one is 16.

299
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,541
Both girls are well-behaved and strong

300
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,710
without any illnesses.

301
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,713
My family

302
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,840
is also blessed with many sons.

303
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,342
I understand your meaning,
Third Minister Yoo.

304
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,886
Please drink the tea before it turns cold.

305
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,138
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

306
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,598
Why did you bring Yoo Hyun-bo,
not Min Ji-hwan?

307
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,018
He seems greedy
and without any class or wisdom.

308
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,145
That is what makes him perfect.

309
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,691
To avoid people pointing fingers at me
for being a domineering kin of the King,

310
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,487
I humbled myself, even bearing
the nickname of the Three Hwans.

311
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,030
But I cannot do so indefinitely.

312
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,824
To ensure my best service to His Majesty,

313
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,203
I decided that I could
no longer split the power

314
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,413
among the three of us.

315
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,378
You have made a wise decision.

316
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,923
But would Min Ji-hwan stand back?

317
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,342
I am sure he is full of anticipation.

318
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,260
I shall explain to him with reason.

319
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,638
Will your words be enough?

320
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,406
What did you just say?

321
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,158
A spouse for Grand Prince Munseong?

322
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,620
I misheard you, did I not?

323
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,288
You heard me right.

324
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,916
What do you think of him
as your daughter's spouse?

325
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,042
Lord Park.

326
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,462
Did you not mention
that she would be the queen?

327
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,589
I only said that we would discuss
marriage arrangements.

328
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,675
I never mentioned
that she would become the queen.

329
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,802
Do not tell me…

330
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,304
you chose Yoo Hyun-bo.

331
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,598
That is none of your concern.

332
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,727
What wrong did I ever do to you?

333
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,312
Do not think of this marriage offer
as a punishment.

334
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,856
It is no reward either!

335
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,820
Then what about everything
you have received until now?

336
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,452
Think carefully and get back to me.

337
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,670
You brats!

338
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,465
What took you so long to open up?

339
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,387
Brother, why are you so upset?

340
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,681
I am not upset.

341
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,393
I came to tell you that we have guests.

342
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,272
What impolite people
have barged in at this late hour?

343
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,408
What brings you to my house,

344
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,076
Gidaeryeong Kang
and Sixth Royal Secretary?

345
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,288
I came to give the Third Minister
the baduk table I owed him

346
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,291
and have been waiting for you
to greet you before leaving.

347
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,668
Forgive me for the inhospitality,

348
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,753
but please leave.

349
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,005
I am very exhausted.

350
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,175
You must have been shaken to learn

351
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,677
that the marriage offer
was not for the next queen.

352
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,973
Did you tell them, Sang-hyo?

353
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,476
Absolutely not.

354
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,145
But is he right?

355
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,688
Was the offer not for the queen?

356
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,233
The Principal Director's offer

357
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,152
would have been
the spouse of Grand Prince Munseong.

358
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,156
So the baduk table was an excuse.

359
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,326
I will speak in detail inside.

360
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,791
Accept the marriage offer

361
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,376
to Grand Prince Munseong.

362
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,879
You are asking me
to take a leap into the abyss.

363
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,964
Brother.

364
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,634
You must know what will follow
should you refuse the marriage offer.

365
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,761
My family will be destroyed.

366
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,138
For what reason
would the Principal Director

367
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,099
bring such a disaster to our family?

368
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
He had the Great Lord

369
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,520
and you, Minister Min,
at his side as his two wings

370
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,980
when ascending His Majesty to the throne.

371
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,691
He controlled the court
and exploited his power

372
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,734
while hiding behind the nickname,
Three Hwans.

373
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,612
Then Kim Je-nam was appointed.

374
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,657
He would have felt the need
to seize all power himself.

375
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,952
And as you would likely not acquiesce
when you hold the military power,

376
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,745
he sought to cripple you

377
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,540
by offering marital ties
to the Grand Prince.

378
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,085
Were a queen to emerge from our family,
our influence would grow.

379
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,921
So he took the initiative
to nip it in the bud.

380
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,299
What is it that you want to say?

381
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,718
I will have the two wings
the Principal Director abandoned

382
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,804
become Grand Prince Munseong's wings

383
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,723
and have him

384
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,184
become the Crown Prince,
His Majesty's heir.

385
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,813
It is up to you, Minister Min.

386
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,149
What do you say?

387
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,193
It is easier said than done.

388
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,531
Merely suggesting the idea
of appointing him the Crown Prince

389
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,366
would have one branded as a traitor.

390
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,493
One way or another,

391
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,371
your family is set out to be doomed.

392
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,666
Am I wrong?

393
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,051
I must know
how His Majesty feels about this.

394
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,313
Gidaeryeong Kang.

395
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,942
His Majesty summons you.

396
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,526
Follow me.

397
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,952
I have wanted to do that since long ago.

398
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,871
But I have yet to discuss it
with the court.

399
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,876
Then I shall report to you again
after coming up with a detailed plan.

400
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,336
Please do.

401
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,214
If you will excuse me now, Your Majesty.

402
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,645
Your Majesty.

403
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,313
The gidaeryeong is here.

404
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,627
Why are you looking at me so intently?

405
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,714
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

406
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,884
It is just that you seemed
quite distressed last night.

407
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,764
However, I am relieved
that you seem bright.

408
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,853
One's heart is truly a fickle thing.

409
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,732
To wish for life when you love them…

410
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,444
and death when you hate them.

411
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,158
Wishing them to live
while wishing them to die.

412
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,412
That paradox
is what it means to be captivated.

413
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,752
These are the words of the wise scholars
that the late king enjoyed reciting.

414
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,173
I used to think that it meant
a king should not be captivated.

415
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,884
But I finally understand its meaning.

416
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,763
This tree may be gone,

417
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,434
but it found a place
to put down roots in my heart.

418
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,811
And it will continue to grow there.

419
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,857
Thinking so put my mind at ease.

420
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,238
Will you leave this spot empty?

421
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,824
I have already given an order
to have another tree planted.

422
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,161
The peach tree that turned into ashes

423
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,750
will serve as a good ground
for the new tree.

424
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,841
So he ordered for another tree

425
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,677
as the burnt tree
would serve as a good ground?

426
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,598
What does this mean?

427
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,225
I believe that it means

428
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,727
he is looking for an heir
who will inherit his throne.

429
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,898
And how can you be so sure
that he has the Grand Prince in mind?

430
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,818
No one in the royal family
will satisfy His Majesty.

431
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,778
Only Grand Prince Munseong will.

432
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,490
I have never once thought

433
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,451
that His Majesty saw him as his successor.

434
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,329
Please convey this to your brother.

435
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,414
I shall.

436
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,625
But I cannot promise you anything.

437
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,420
My brother is a cautious man
who meticulously assesses his moves.

438
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,297
I am aware.

439
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,052
Right, that baduk table was great.

440
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,222
Let us play baduk with a bet sometime
without His Majesty's knowing.

441
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,431
It would be my pleasure.

442
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,518
I do not know when it will be,
but I shall keep it in mind.

443
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,280
I do not think
we can convince Min Ji-hwan.

444
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,323
Even I cannot believe

445
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,826
that the King wants
Grand Prince Munseong as his heir.

446
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,871
There is no chance
Min Ji-hwan will believe it.

447
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,289
I am sure of this.

448
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,334
The King intends
to give the throne to His Highness.

449
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,129
Last night,

450
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,215
I had the same impression
as you repeated the Grand Prince's words.

451
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,177
It seems to me

452
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,305
that you want to believe the King.

453
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,479
Great Lord.

454
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,946
How is Her Majesty doing?

455
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,947
Why do you ask?

456
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,533
Are you counting down
the days she has left?

457
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,787
You may find it hard to believe,

458
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,831
but I am concerned as well.

459
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,501
The Principal Director

460
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,005
seems to have offered Yoo Hyun-bo
the chance to become the next queen's kin.

461
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,262
I suspected as much.

462
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,065
I seek to petition His Majesty
to appoint the Grand Prince

463
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,277
as the Crown Prince
upon Her Majesty's request.

464
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,779
Will you join hands with me?

465
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,158
Are you trying to drag me down with you?

466
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,536
This is the last resort for us.

467
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,580
We cannot let him put us down
like some useless hounds.

468
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,893
I shall accept the marriage offer

469
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,646
to Grand Prince Munseong.

470
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,275
Tell me your conditions.

471
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,777
I will step down from my position

472
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,155
and petition to be replaced.

473
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,072
In return,

474
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,826
appoint me as the headmaster
of the Royal Confucian Academy.

475
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,120
So you wish to protect your family

476
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,414
in return for relinquishing
the military power?

477
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,586
I mean to take on a position
where I will not be a threat to you.

478
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,630
I understand.

479
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,841
I will arrange that.

480
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,370
Something is off with Minister Min.

481
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,040
He is not the type
to meekly accept the offer.

482
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,750
It does not matter.

483
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,754
The Min Family will not be able to
gain power in court again.

484
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,715
In tomorrow's morning assembly,

485
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,301
you must petition His Majesty

486
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,928
that as the Grand Prince has matured,

487
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,430
he should get married
and leave the palace.

488
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,224
Repeat those very words.

489
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,310
Yes, my lord.

490
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,745
That is enough.

491
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,000
Go rest, Grand Prince.

492
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,546
Please do not mind me.

493
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,800
I will stay by your side
until you fall asleep.

494
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,963
Righting the wrongs of every office
will take days.

495
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,089
Before that,

496
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,633
we must have a countermeasure

497
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,510
to put the people's minds at ease.

498
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,599
When such disasters struck,

499
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,351
we had daesaryeong to soothe the people.

500
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,020
DAESARYEONG: ROYAL COMMAND FOR AMNESTY

501
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,439
Freeing criminals and offering relief

502
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,067
will be effective
in combating the ill rumors

503
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,861
that are swaying the people.

504
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,530
Such temporary measures have limits.

505
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,116
Are there any other thoughts?

506
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,209
Your Majesty.

507
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,878
Please allow me to speak.

508
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,298
Go ahead.

509
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,940
The recent strange event

510
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,609
was brought upon by

511
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,403
my family and I.

512
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,240
What do you mean by that?

513
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,994
If the future of our nation
was ensured by your heir,

514
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,666
the heavens would not have
struck lightning into the palace.

515
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,543
The people's minds

516
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,629
would not have been rattled
this much either.

517
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,466
As an unfortunate coincidence,

518
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,010
Her Majesty has fallen ill.

519
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:40,558
Thus, it is clear that this disaster
was caused by my family and I.

520
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,684
Father-in-law.

521
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,522
Do not think that way.

522
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,940
I have never once

523
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,235
considered this to be your fault.

524
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,281
Your Majesty.

525
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,118
As you have consoled me
with your benevolence,

526
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,040
I would like to muster up the courage
and request a petition.

527
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,588
Your Majesty!

528
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,092
I entreat you in tears!

529
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,097
Please appoint Grand Prince Munseong
to be the Crown Prince

530
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,977
and ensure the future of this nation!

531
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,270
Your Majesty!

532
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,230
The Great Lord's petition

533
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,983
would harm the safety of this nation
and your reign.

534
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,570
His words are no different
from those of any traitor!

535
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,239
I advise you to have the Great Lord
interrogated immediately

536
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,659
and punished harshly for high treason!

537
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,257
Do you all concur
with the Principal Director?

538
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,891
I humbly advise you

539
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,935
to grant the Great Lord's petition.

540
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,562
Inspector General.

541
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,689
Do reconsider.

542
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,567
You must remember

543
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,070
that offering support to a traitor
makes you one as well.

544
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,071
Inspector General.

545
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,409
For what reason should I approve of it?

546
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,788
Appointing the Grand Prince as your heir

547
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,831
offers three benefits.

548
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,251
First, with the Grand Prince
as the Crown Prince,

549
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,003
this nation's future will be ensured.

550
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,548
Second, it would calm
the anxious minds of the people.

551
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,591
And third,

552
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,719
the ill rumors will subside by themselves.

553
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,597
There is no other measure
better than this, Your Majesty.

554
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,350
What you have spoken
is absolutely foolish!

555
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,937
Grand Prince Munseong
is the son of the late king.

556
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,023
Should he become the Crown Prince,

557
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,401
that would make His Majesty
an intruder to the lineage.

558
00:44:56,276 --> 00:45:00,406
Then, His Majesty's sovereignty
shall seem illegitimate to the people.

559
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,076
This will inevitably endanger his reign

560
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,204
and give a pretext to the traitors!

561
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,289
That is not an issue.

562
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,340
You can simply adopt
the Grand Prince as your son

563
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,092
and appoint him the Crown Prince

564
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,261
and easily prevent any potential issues.

565
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,765
Do you not agree, Principal Director?

566
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,684
Your Majesty!

567
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:33,313
I have petitioned this request
with that very intent!

568
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,400
This is my final request.

569
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,195
Please adopt the Grand Prince
as Her Majesty's issue

570
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,449
before she passes away

571
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,659
so that he may perform

572
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,495
the memorial service for her
after her passing!

573
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,406
Here comes His Majesty.

574
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,511
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

575
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,430
I have not made myself presentable yet.

576
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,267
You are still weak, so stay as you are.

577
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,771
I come with a question.

578
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,696
Leave us.

579
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,295
During today's assembly,

580
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,839
your father petitioned me…

581
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,887
to appoint Grand Prince Munseong
as the Crown Prince.

582
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,520
Were you aware of this?

583
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,442
It is what I wish for.

584
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,696
For what reason?

585
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,997
Your Majesty.

586
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,916
I am a sinner to you.

587
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,669
And to the Great Lord,

588
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,838
I am an undutiful daughter.

589
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,922
Do not…

590
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,805
Do not say such words.

591
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,150
It is a pity that I am only now realizing…

592
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,195
what a kind person you are.

593
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,780
It is my fault.

594
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:31,783
Until now,

595
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,328
I have been…

596
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,584
an awful husband to you, My Queen.

597
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,340
No, Your Majesty.

598
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,470
It was through no single person's fault.

599
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,932
I will answer your question.

600
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,268
Your Majesty.

601
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,313
As my last service to you before death,

602
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,651
I wanted to remove
a burden on your shoulders.

603
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,944
I also thought

604
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,324
that Grand Prince Munseong's position
would become more secure this way.

605
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,705
Is this sincerely and entirely your idea?

606
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,916
Yes.

607
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,959
It is…

608
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,296
my idea.

609
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,761
If you do not feel comfortable,

610
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,513
please do not approve of it.

611
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,724
I dare ask

612
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,851
that you punish me for the suggestion

613
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,187
and not…

614
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:48,694
the Great Lord and Grand Prince Munseong.

615
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,792
I shall go to Yeongchwijeong.

616
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,544
Summon Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

617
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,628
Yes, Your Majesty.

618
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,479
The Great Lord petitioned today.

619
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,984
Did you advise the Queen on this?

620
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,113
Yes, Your Majesty.

621
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,659
As Her Majesty was concerned
about the safety of the Grand Prince,

622
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,953
I told her a way.

623
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,956
Do you understand
the gravity of your action?

624
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,083
If the court sets its mind on it,

625
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,127
the Great Lord,
as well as the Grand Prince,

626
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,380
may be branded as traitors and face death.

627
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,258
I have only done what you wished for.

628
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,011
Watching the ashes of the peach tree,

629
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:59,306
you said it would serve
as a good ground for the new tree.

630
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,810
You now dare to read my heart?

631
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,106
I can read it like an open book.

632
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,902
Please do not try to deceive me as well.

633
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,497
Please stop trying to sway me.

634
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,753
You will end up in danger.

635
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,384
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

636
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,601
Her Royal Highness
requests an urgent audience.

637
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,064
All right.

638
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,509
The ones who petitioned this request,

639
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,636
Great Lord Oh Wook-hwan
and Minister of War Min Ji-hwan,

640
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,514
and the one who supported it,
Inspector General Kim Je-nam,

641
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,974
must be dismissed and punished.

642
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,310
The Queen should also be
stripped of her position and expelled!

643
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,069
Your Majesty.

644
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,656
I hope you are not considering
adopting the Grand Prince as your son.

645
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,949
As I have mentioned,

646
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,452
it is difficult for me to sire an heir.

647
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,746
The only closest kin I have

648
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,040
is the Grand Prince.

649
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,417
That is ridiculous!

650
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,878
If only you change your mind,

651
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,297
you can always sire an heir.

652
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,175
Forgive me,

653
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,680
but I have made up my mind.

654
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,018
I will…

655
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,229
appoint the Grand Prince
as the Crown Prince.

656
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,149
That can only happen

657
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,652
over my dead body.

658
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:56,942
Do you think His Majesty
will accept the Great Lord's request?

659
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,235
Yes.

660
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,281
Inspector General Kim Je-nam's remarks
would have convinced him.

661
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,575
It is indeed the best measure

662
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,953
to soothe the people's minds.

663
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,039
You are all speaking nonsense.

664
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:15,085
You should not concur
with something so unacceptable.

665
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,462
Mind your tone and manners,
Third Minister Yoo!

666
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,468
I was just too frustrated.

667
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,679
Please forgive me.

668
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,891
Anyway, we shall follow
His Majesty's decision

669
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,185
if he approves.

670
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,410
My lord.

671
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,161
Are you going to sit back and watch?

672
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,595
My lord.

673
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,910
Please hold onto this.

674
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,246
I will take it back

675
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,790
the next time there is a drizzle.

676
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:37,917
All right.

677
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,172
I will keep it safe until then.

678
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,737
You brat, what insolence is this?

679
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,198
Withdraw your sword immediately.

680
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,574
Your Majesty.

681
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,284
What shall I do?

682
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,039
Principal Director.

683
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:04,254
Did you forget that no one can enter here
without my permission?

684
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,340
Your Majesty,

685
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,093
I have come to request a private audience.

686
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,514
You may leave.

687
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,608
Your Majesty.

688
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,487
Are you truly considering
approving the Great Lord's petition?

689
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,822
I will approve it.

690
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,116
The Inspector General had a point

691
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,034
when he said that ensuring
the nation's future

692
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,412
would silence the ill rumors.

693
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,539
It is a foolish thought, Your Majesty.

694
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,210
I have struggled on and on
to protect your reign.

695
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,338
What wisdom could he have
after years away from the capital?

696
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,549
You must not let him sway you.

697
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,342
I just cannot accept it.

698
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,471
Please come to your senses!

699
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,735
Are you the king of this nation, Uncle?

700
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,492
How dare you raise your voice at me

701
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,535
and lecture me
on what is acceptable or not?

702
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,249
I apologize, Your Majesty.

703
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,085
-I was only--
-In your eyes,

704
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:31,925
I must still look like a weeping child
holding onto my mother's skirts.

705
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,552
I cannot dare to think that way.

706
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,012
I was only concerned

707
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,556
that you were lending your ear

708
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,642
to the words
of the cowardly and disloyal--

709
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,768
Shut your mouth!

710
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,526
What exactly have you done for my reign?

711
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,153
Stop taking the credit
and tell me of your exploits.

712
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,244
The appointment of the Crown Prince

713
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:03,831
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

714
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,963
When the people's minds are put at ease,
I can expel and banish him from the palace

715
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,673
and then eliminate him.

716
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:15,468
You are the one who should stop
being foolish and come to your senses.

717
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,264
If you dare to disrespect me

718
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,432
and display insolence ever again,

719
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,688
you will not go unpunished
even with protection from my mother.

720
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,816
If the court opposes your decision

721
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,277
to expel the Crown Prince,

722
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,446
what will you do then?

723
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,914
I am the king of this nation.

724
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,294
The king shall not be insulted.

725
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,840
Anyone who opposes me shall face death

726
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,799
and that includes

727
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,636
my kin who shares my blood.

728
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,233
I finally understand

729
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:18,156
why my late brother hated me so much
and wanted me dead.

730
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,451
The power of the king

731
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,163
is not to be shared with anyone else.

732
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,286
Your Majesty,
Grand Prince Munseong is here.

733
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,122
Let him in.

734
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:05,805
Take it.

735
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,475
This is a token of my vow

736
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:14,021
that I will adopt you as my son
and appoint you the Crown Prince.

737
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,701
I promise to serve you as your son
with all my heart

738
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:30,413
and carry out the duties
of the Crown Prince.

739
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:55,646
I will call you Mother from now on.

740
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,070
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

741
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,825
This is all…

742
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,828
thanks to you, Father.

743
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,208
I can finally

744
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,127
close my eyes in peace.

745
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,943
Your Majesty.

746
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,154
Mother.

747
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,825
Your Majesty.

748
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,451
Mother.

749
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,079
Mother.

750
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,581
Mother.

751
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,477
Your Majesty…

752
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:23,609
Your Majesty…

753
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,255
Her Majesty has passed away.

754
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,429
His Majesty ordered you
not to enter the palace

755
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,972
during her funeral.

756
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,434
I understand.

757
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,183
The time has come.

758
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,438
With the King still alive,
the Grand Prince's life will be at risk.

759
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,608
Please make your decision now.

760
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,613
The appointment of the Crown Prince

761
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:55,076
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

762
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:01,123
When the people's minds are put at ease,
I can expel and banish him from the palace

763
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,917
and then eliminate him.

764
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,712
You are the one who should stop
being foolish and come to your senses.

765
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,176
My lady.

766
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,684
I will do it.

767
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,145
I started this,

768
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,399
so I want to finish it myself.

769
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,401
I cannot allow that.

770
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,529
I must end the King's life
with my own hands.

771
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:32,822
That is the only way…

772
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,201
to soothe Hongjang's resentment.

773
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:51,882
All right.

774
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,302
Do as you wish.

775
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,307
My lady.

776
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:46,771
My lady.

777
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,908
I was arrogant.

778
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,789
I thought I lost myself three years ago…

779
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,628
and had nothing left
to lose or be afraid of.

780
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,842
But I still must have kept hopes…

781
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,972
to live out my life as Kang Hee-soo

782
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,813
and to believe in the King.

783
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,281
I am clueless…

784
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,536
as to what to do with my feelings.

785
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:52,503
You are breaking my heart, my lady.

786
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,492
I am the one who went through
the mourning for the Queen,

787
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,203
and yet, you look worse off than me.

788
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,583
It must be due to my guilty conscience

789
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,960
for my crimes against her.

790
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,755
The Queen relied on you.

791
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,385
She would not wish for you to be in pain.

792
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,474
You said if I called for you,

793
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,021
you would come running to me.

794
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,983
I wish…

795
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,945
to see you tonight.

796
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,116
I also wish for the same thing.

797
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,665
Then…

798
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,501
I shall wait for you there.

799
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,895
Let the King enter first

800
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,272
and come in a moment later.

801
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,901
I must

802
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:43,447
remain a nameless assassin
who snuck in to murder the King.

803
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,409
You must pretend to have been ignorant.

804
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,495
Do you understand?

805
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,125
If you do meet Hongjang,

806
01:10:58,128 --> 01:10:59,588
please give her my regards.

807
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,180
I shall.

808
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:26,091
Wait outside.

809
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,176
Yes, Your Majesty.

810
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,292
I…

811
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,882
must have given you a hard time.

812
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:19,103
What must I do to stop your tears?

813
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,938
What is the matter?

814
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,701
You are trembling. What is wrong?

815
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,167
You cannot…

816
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,755
go inside.

817
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,850
Do you have another lover waiting inside?

818
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,524
Or…

819
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:55,199
is there an assassin hiding to kill me?

820
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,207
CAPTIVATING THE KING

821
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,418
Did something happen to His Majesty?

822
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:52,005
Is His Majesty the man
who lost his consciousness from a wound?

823
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,216
If you truly care for Grand Prince Jinhan,

824
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,926
become the King's woman.

825
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:59,930
"You know who poisoned
the late king to death, do you not?"

826
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,766
She must have used all her might
to get here.

827
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,851
Where is His Majesty?

828
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:08,188
You decided to kill me

829
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,691
because you became afraid and sick of me.

830
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,278
Due to the grudges they hold,
Kang Mong-woo and Kim Myung-ha

831
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,488
must have given the order
to assassinate you.

832
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,699
Summon the members
of the Border Defense Council.

833
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,410
I will interrogate the traitor myself.

834
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:26,498
