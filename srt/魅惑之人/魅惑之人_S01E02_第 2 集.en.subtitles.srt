00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,969
EPISODE 2

3
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,728
That is enough.

4
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,038
My lord?

5
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,167
How is he?

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,126
Did the physician come?

7
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,211
What does he say?

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,463
His Highness did not want a physician,

9
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,507
so I did not call for one.

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,716
Why not?

11
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,843
He bled a lot.

12
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,055
He said the blade fortunately
did not reach his bones.

13
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,432
And as he had many such wounds before,

14
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,267
he knew how to care for them.

15
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,936
He told me not to worry.

16
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,108
His Highness wishes to see you.

17
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,777
What do you want to do?

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,668
Your Highness.

19
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,013
Your Highness?

20
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,150
Your Highness.

21
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,364
Goodness.

22
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,785
Why are you running away
when you are here to see me?

23
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,121
Have you perhaps…

24
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,499
done wrong without my knowing?

25
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,131
Please do not accuse me of running away.

26
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,177
I only tried to leave
as I had thought you were asleep.

27
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,597
Is that right?

28
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,557
Yes.

29
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,150
Are you certain
you do not want to see a physician?

30
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,403
Even a physician cannot do much
for a wound like this.

31
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,241
It will heal after a few days of rest.

32
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,664
I caused you unnecessary suffering,
Your Highness.

33
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,290
It is not your fault.

34
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,835
It is all on him. That contemptible man.

35
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,258
I will leave you to rest.

36
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,637
Your Highness, could you please…

37
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,356
I know a way

38
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,650
that will relieve me of this pain.

39
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,112
What is it?

40
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,281
A round of baduk.

41
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,033
Sorry?

42
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
Are you serious?

43
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,080
Of course, I am.

44
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,377
When Guan Yu was treated by Hua Tuo
after being struck by a poisoned arrow,

45
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,921
he overcame his pain by playing baduk.

46
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,514
How baffling. Why are you so hesitant?

47
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,391
When we were at the valley,

48
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,894
you distinctly said you wanted to
play against me if you had the chance.

49
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,606
Back then…

50
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,361
I did not know you

51
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,405
as I do now.

52
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,576
What about back then?
Finish your sentence.

53
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,789
As you may be aware,

54
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,459
I only play baduk when there is a bet.

55
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,966
I did not bring my baduk table,

56
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,509
so I will bet what you want.

57
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,802
What is it?

58
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,389
I will let you know upon winning the game.

59
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,354
Help me up.

60
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,197
How heartless.

61
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,493
You have won by one jip.

62
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,747
What is it that you want?

63
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,927
It is raining.

64
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,225
Mongwoo, at long last.

65
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,769
"Mongwoo"?

66
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,813
It is a fine shower
that sprinkles densely like a haze.

67
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,691
It is also a nickname that I treasure.

68
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,201
I have thought of what I want.

69
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,848
Please write my nickname here.

70
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,524
What is your nickname?

71
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,320
It is Mongwoo.

72
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,366
This will be the prize of our bet.

73
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,538
And you choose
not to share your real name?

74
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,878
Suit yourself.

75
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,522
MONGWOO

76
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,440
There.

77
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,567
From now on,

78
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,403
you are Mongwoo.

79
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,325
My manghyeongjiu,

80
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,577
Mongwoo.

81
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,454
MANGHYEONGJIU: FRIENDS
WHO SHARE A CROSS-CLASS BOND

82
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,332
Had you asked for more,

83
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,375
such as treasures and gold,

84
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
I would have gladly given them to you.

85
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,966
You have made a big mistake.

86
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,033
Will you just keep staring at it?

87
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,397
Help me with that too.

88
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,686
And my tassel belt.

89
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,352
That one as well.

90
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,471
I finally see through you.

91
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,019
Seeing as you have beautiful hands

92
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,023
and cannot even tie a hat on properly,

93
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,485
you were born into a wealthy family

94
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,696
and had servants attend to you
at all times.

95
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,240
Is it not true?

96
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,830
You are all set, Your Highness.

97
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,167
When can I see you again?

98
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
Sorry?

99
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,673
-That is…
-Right.

100
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,134
You said though you love to win,
you cannot put up with boredom.

101
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,386
Now that you have won,

102
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,388
am I just another boring opponent to you?

103
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,435
When there is another mongwoo,

104
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,647
I shall give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

105
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,277
Fine then.

106
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,571
When mongwoo falls,

107
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,282
let us meet here again.

108
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,028
Your Highness.

109
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,867
You seem cheerful
for someone who shed blood today.

110
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,787
It must be because of Mongwoo.

111
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,123
Are you talking about the rain,
Your Highness?

112
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,666
No.

113
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,211
Not this one, but Mongwoo from earlier.

114
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,548
He did not tell me his name,
so I gave him one.

115
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,051
How dare he not disclose his name?

116
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,469
I shall teach him a lesson.

117
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,637
No need.

118
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,973
He is not someone
who will be taught a lesson easily.

119
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,020
He has a silver tongue and a big heart.

120
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,606
He will end up giving you a lesson.

121
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,693
Shall we return home?

122
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,781
No. I must stop by somewhere.

123
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,708
Did the game just finish?

124
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,627
Yes.

125
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,506
Did you come by during the game?

126
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,593
I came by several times
while you two were playing.

127
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,136
Did you not notice?

128
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,264
I had no idea.

129
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,353
"Mongwoo"?

130
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,939
It is a nickname His Highness treasures.

131
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,565
He gave it to me.

132
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,652
Does that mean you won again?

133
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,154
Yes.

134
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,992
No. Actually,

135
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,160
I did not.

136
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,205
But I acted like I did.

137
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,166
I could not say I lost.

138
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,546
It is my first time
hearing of you losing, my lady.

139
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,506
It is my first time losing.

140
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,009
Except when I was learning from my father.

141
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,180
But why do you say
you could not say that you lost?

142
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,601
I am not sure.

143
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,812
I suppose I did not want to lose.

144
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,400
No.

145
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,610
That is not it.

146
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,241
My lady.

147
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,410
Are you all right?

148
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,622
What is wrong with me?

149
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,459
My heart is racing.

150
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,629
I must have been shocked
to see His Highness's get hurt.

151
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,923
I feel feverish,
and my cheeks are burning.

152
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,217
Right?

153
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,434
It seems like

154
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,978
you have fallen for His Highness.

155
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,315
What does that mean?

156
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,403
It means developing feelings for someone
and ending up loving them.

157
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,364
Love?

158
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,161
That is not the case.
I am still shaken, that is all.

159
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,247
This must be why people meddle.

160
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,627
Players may be oblivious to the plays
that are obvious to the onlookers.

161
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,381
Have I truly

162
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,967
fallen for His Highness?

163
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,308
Who is it?

164
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,479
Who are you to wander around
the Minister of War's house so late?

165
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,446
I did not recognize you
and spoke out of turn, Your Highness.

166
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,073
Please forgive me.

167
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,199
No need to apologize.

168
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,828
I am to blame for visiting
without sending word first.

169
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,456
My name is Kim Myung-ha.

170
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,500
The Minister of War is my father.

171
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,047
I have come to speak with your father.

172
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,382
I see.

173
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,675
Please follow me inside.

174
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,013
Your men injured Grand Prince Jinhan?

175
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,101
Do you mean they made him bleed?

176
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,605
My men's intent was to catch
and question a baduk gambler

177
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,440
under the Grand Prince's patronage.

178
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,819
But they were caught in the act
by the Grand Prince himself,

179
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,155
leading to the accident.

180
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,578
Just how incompetent are you?

181
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,204
I apologize, my lord.

182
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,291
What shall I do?

183
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,542
What else is there to do?

184
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,212
Exile your men out of the capital.

185
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:38,844
Though the Grand Prince
has earned His Majesty's ire,

186
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,387
he is still of the royal family

187
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,681
and the son of the Queen Dowager.

188
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,767
Would exiling them be enough?

189
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,354
In the case that the Grand Prince
decides to punish me,

190
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:54,484
not only you but even Her Majesty
may suffer consequences.

191
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,237
Shut your mouth.

192
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,115
Who are you to threaten me?

193
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,825
My apologies, my lord.

194
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,578
Father, it is me, Myung-ha.

195
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,627
You may enter.

196
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,805
Father.

197
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,933
Grand Prince Jinhan is here.

198
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,545
Your Highness.

199
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,758
What brings you to this humble place?

200
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,720
How do you call
such a massive residence a humble place?

201
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,098
You are excessively modest.

202
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,144
I only spoke as such

203
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,397
because for someone like you,

204
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,566
who frequented the Qing's Imperial Palace
as Prince Rui's favorite,

205
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:22,197
even such a residence
would appear too small and shabby.

206
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,411
Are you admitting that you believe
in the vile rumors that are going around?

207
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,620
Or…

208
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,749
are you trying to cover
for the sins of the man hiding inside

209
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,085
by being disrespectful?

210
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,297
A man hiding?

211
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,801
I do not understand
what you are saying, Your Highness.

212
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,473
Your Highness!

213
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,475
The incident earlier

214
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,186
was carried out by my men
without my knowledge.

215
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,647
Though I did not conduct the doing myself,

216
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,566
my negligence is partly to blame.

217
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,568
Please show me mercy,

218
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,363
and I will see to it
that they are punished, Your Highness.

219
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,406
How interesting.

220
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,286
If you believe so, why are you here
instead of the State Tribunal?

221
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,705
That is because

222
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,750
I wanted to seek Minister Kim's counsel

223
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,711
on how best to report my faults to you,
Your Highness.

224
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,547
Please do not misunderstand.

225
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,132
You call that an excuse?

226
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,133
Myung-ha.

227
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,136
Do not interfere.

228
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,930
His Highness is questioning him.

229
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,892
I apologize, Your Highness.

230
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,185
Minister Kim.

231
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,229
Yes, Your Highness.

232
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,565
Please speak.

233
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,822
I am not here to threaten you

234
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,033
by using the misdeed
committed by Yoo Hyun-bo.

235
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,495
I simply came by to converse with you.

236
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,797
Please come inside.

237
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,685
Tell me the true motive
behind your visit tonight.

238
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,605
I…

239
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,235
wish to become
the most loyal subject of His Majesty.

240
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,739
I am confident that my loyalty
is unmatched by all others.

241
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,451
So do not think that I covet
the title of the Crown Prince.

242
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,331
You are here to warn me
to stop doubting your intentions

243
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,042
and being wary of you.

244
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,254
I am more than willing
to bear with your wariness.

245
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,339
I do not doubt for one second

246
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,259
that such action is born
out of your loyalty to His Majesty.

247
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,971
However, subjecting innocent people

248
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,933
to the same suspicion and persecution
for their acquaintance with me

249
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,686
is simply unacceptable.

250
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,564
They are also His Majesty's people

251
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,066
and those you must protect.

252
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,362
It is truly a shame that I am the only one

253
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,657
who gets to hear
such a reasonable and just speech.

254
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,581
Do you have

255
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,875
anything more to say?

256
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,005
I hear an envoy from the Great Qing
will arrive soon.

257
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,801
They will want a definitive answer
on the issue of conscription.

258
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,845
If there is anything I can help you with,

259
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,221
do not hesitate to tell me.

260
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,098
I shall help to the best of my ability.

261
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,266
Of course, Your Highness.

262
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,809
When the envoy arrives,

263
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,020
I shall make sure

264
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,856
to ask for your advice.

265
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,694
I am truly grateful

266
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,031
for your understanding.

267
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,296
Who is it?

268
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,682
Do you have more to say?

269
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:24,147
I was waiting
as you have not forgiven me yet.

270
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,318
Please forgive me for my mistakes.

271
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,196
Do not seek forgiveness from me

272
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,908
but from the baduk gambler
and your sister.

273
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,202
I shall forgive you

274
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,496
once they have done so.

275
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,623
You may leave.

276
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,764
His words are all lies.

277
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,225
He must have given an order
with ill intent.

278
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,726
I am well aware.

279
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,770
But to punish him,

280
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,897
I must be prepared to go against

281
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,942
Minister Kim
and those who are behind his back.

282
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,153
I cannot do that.

283
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,459
Ask for forgiveness to those lowly brats?

284
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,088
Who does he think I am?

285
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,342
Man-bok.

286
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,970
Yes, my lord.

287
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,725
Do you want to live to a ripe old age
with all your limbs intact?

288
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,980
Or do you want to die a horrible death
with all your limbs cut off?

289
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,565
I want to live, my lord.

290
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,607
Then…

291
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,154
keep an eye on
Hongjang's courtesan house at all times.

292
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,450
Report to me all the comings and goings,

293
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,785
including Grand Prince Jinhan,
that baduk gambler,

294
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,914
and any of Hongjang's guests.

295
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,750
-Do you understand?
-Yes, my lord.

296
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,263
Your Highness!

297
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,849
Your Highness.

298
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,269
Why are you calling me in such a hurry?

299
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,146
Her Royal Highness
has summoned you to the palace

300
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,398
as His Majesty is gravely ill.

301
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,832
-Uncle.
-Princess Jangryeong.

302
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,294
It has been far too long.

303
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,386
Uncle, what is happening?

304
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,098
His Majesty has been showing symptoms
of acute gastroenteritis since dawn.

305
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,267
He is refusing to receive treatment
or grant an audience.

306
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,895
We are all waiting helplessly.

307
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,652
I shall go inside with the medicine,
so report to His Majesty immediately.

308
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,864
Why are you just standing there?

309
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,865
Your Majesty.

310
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,827
Please calm down.

311
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,997
The King has decreed that only
Senior Court Lady Dong may enter.

312
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,417
I have

313
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,711
long wondered about this matter

314
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,006
ever since you sent her
to be His Majesty's senior court lady.

315
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,007
What purpose…

316
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,053
does Court Lady Dong serve?

317
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,890
How come you always side with her?

318
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,975
Your Majesty.

319
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,688
How dare you disrespect and question me?

320
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,359
You should be on the floor
begging for forgiveness

321
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,319
for failing to keep
His Majesty in good health.

322
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,780
Your insolence is unacceptable.

323
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,949
Must I remove you
from His Majesty's quarters with force

324
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,701
to have you come to your senses?

325
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,204
Go ahead and try.

326
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,251
You will never be able to
unless you kill me.

327
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,212
Do you truly wish to be expelled

328
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,840
for disrespect and disloyalty?

329
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,926
Mother.

330
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,478
You are here, Grand Prince Jinhan.

331
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,814
I will go in and meet His Majesty.

332
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,774
Report to him.

333
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,901
Your Majesty.

334
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,862
Grand Prince Jinhan has come.

335
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,534
Let him in.

336
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,314
Your Majesty, it is Jinhan.

337
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,775
There you are.

338
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,780
I was not aware of your condition.
I apologize for not coming faster.

339
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,783
Do not worry.

340
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:31,162
Your loyalty will not be measured
based on how quickly you came.

341
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,958
If in such order, the Queen Dowager

342
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,127
and the Queen would be considered
the most loyal.

343
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,506
However, the Queen Dowager
will have rushed here in joy,

344
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:46,678
thinking that her nuisance of a stepson
is finally at death's door.

345
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,139
And the Queen will have hurried here,

346
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,476
worried that I may pass away

347
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,688
before the Prince Royal
is appointed as the Crown Prince.

348
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,274
Either way,

349
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,735
they both want me to die

350
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,281
and not survive the day.

351
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,033
There is herbal medicine ready.

352
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,245
I shall taste it before you take it,
so let them bring it in.

353
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,706
What is the point?

354
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,542
I will not be able to keep it down anyway!

355
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,918
However, Your Majesty…

356
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,650
Where do you stand?

357
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,239
Do you wish for me to die

358
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,118
or to live?

359
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,252
I humbly wish

360
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,212
that you would…

361
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,885
recover your will and spirit

362
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,304
to oversee all matters of state as before.

363
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,519
How glib you are with your lies

364
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,191
when you rushed here
only to receive my yugyo.

365
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,776
YUGYO: THE KING'S LAST WORDS

366
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,514
Bring in the herbal medicine.

367
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,852
Grand Prince Jinhan will taste it.

368
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,981
Yes, Your Majesty.

369
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,124
His Majesty has finally realized

370
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,918
Grand Prince Jinhan's good intentions.

371
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,926
By the way, Your Majesty.

372
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,056
I did not send Court Lady Dong
to aid His Majesty.

373
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,561
The King took her by force
to let his hatred toward me be known.

374
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,980
I am saying that it was his doing.

375
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,106
Do you understand?

376
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,743
Ever since Grand Prince Jinhan
tasted the herbal medicine,

377
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,746
His Majesty has been
treating him differently.

378
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,832
The court officials who promised
to support the Prince Royal

379
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,459
are also acting differently.

380
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,377
What shall we do?

381
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,504
Do not worry.

382
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,674
Jung Je-pyo,
who is coming as the Qing's envoy,

383
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,886
promised to support
the Prince Royal's appointment

384
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,929
as the next Crown Prince.

385
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,057
For him to hold sway,

386
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,477
His Majesty must agree
to the conscription demand from the Qing.

387
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,604
Do you think he will approve of it

388
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,647
against the disapproval of the court?

389
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,776
Even if we have to go far
as to provoke His Majesty,

390
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,862
we must make it happen.

391
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,948
That cannot happen.

392
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,912
The court officials and even the scholars

393
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,747
will condemn me.

394
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,373
Your Majesty.

395
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,919
I am well aware of that.

396
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,839
However, according to
what I heard from Interpreter Jung,

397
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,926
the Qing's court has learned of your
hesitance to comply with conscription…

398
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,476
and expressed their regrets

399
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,771
for not replacing you
with Grand Prince Jinhan.

400
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,527
Their court…

401
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,657
had the idea of replacing me with Jinhan?

402
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,622
Tell me.

403
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,624
Who

404
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,211
and during what event
did one voice such an idea?

405
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,757
I did not hear it myself,

406
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,093
-so I cannot be sure--
-How dare you share

407
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,053
uncertain information with me!

408
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,351
Do not try to breed enmity
between Jinhan and me without evidence!

409
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,396
Attempting at a trick with an obvious lie

410
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,525
is an insult to your sovereign.

411
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,990
Your Majesty.

412
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,867
If we refuse conscription again,

413
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,079
the Great Qing will grow suspicious
that we are serving the Ming over them.

414
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,957
This may give them a pretext
to wage another war.

415
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,041
I am

416
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,128
only afraid of such events.

417
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,671
I beg

418
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,340
for your understanding!

419
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,315
How could he go behind our backs

420
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,567
and get His Majesty's approval on his own?

421
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,819
Minister Kim Jong-bae's abuse of power

422
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,238
should not be overlooked.

423
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,323
He is right.

424
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,075
We must file a petition
for his dismissal immediately

425
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,703
to express the court's opinion
on this matter to His Majesty.

426
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,079
I agree.

427
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,497
The Three Censorate Offices

428
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,499
shall come together and file a petition.

429
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,378
How come you are staying silent
on this matter, Chief State Councilor?

430
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,340
Are you against filing the petition?

431
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,508
That is not it.

432
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,386
I am merely concerned about

433
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,098
what the envoy will say upon learning
that the Minister of War,

434
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,059
who was in charge of conscription,

435
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,102
has been dismissed from office.

436
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,271
If the Qing persecutes us regarding this,

437
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,774
the Ming's envoy will praise us

438
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,735
for upholding our duty to them
and maintaining order

439
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,403
when he comes to visit again.

440
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,492
What do you say, Principal Director?

441
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,869
Come to me before you file the petition.

442
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,413
I will be happy to sign my name.

443
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,332
That is great.

444
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,335
Then let us go draft our petition.

445
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,170
-Let us go.
-Let us go.

446
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,811
Lord Kang.

447
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,065
Do you think His Majesty
will grant the petition?

448
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,528
Are you referring
to Kim Jong-bae's dismissal?

449
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,948
I cannot say.

450
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,785
His Majesty will decide
based on the consensus.

451
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,871
You shame me with your wise answer.

452
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,709
If you will excuse me then.

453
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,556
That crafty fox.

454
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,642
Who knows what he is thinking?

455
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,769
At times,
he sides with Grand Prince Jinhan,

456
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,354
but at other times,
he sides with Minister Kim.

457
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,857
If it were not for his crafty conduct,

458
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,026
he would have been dismissed already.

459
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,945
What will you do now?

460
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,863
At this rate,

461
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,991
the court will demand that Prince Royal
be appointed as the Crown Prince soon.

462
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,286
We must meet the Grand Prince
and let him know of our will.

463
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,247
I will arrange it soon and let you know.

464
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,498
Yes, my lord.

465
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,633
Chief State Councilor.

466
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,844
His Majesty urgently calls for you.

467
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,680
Did he also call for a Royal Secretary
and an official historian?

468
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,807
He only asked for you, my lord.

469
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,856
I have given it much thought,

470
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,818
and I do not feel comfortable
betraying the Ming.

471
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,532
How about we alert them
not to resent the deployment of troops

472
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,242
as it was done against our will

473
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,579
due to the Qing's pressing demand?

474
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,710
Are you suggesting
we send a spy to the Ming?

475
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,880
That is correct.

476
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,882
Your Majesty.

477
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,760
You must be very cautious
when sending a spy.

478
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,595
If the Qing catches on,

479
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,682
they will invade us
before they strike the Ming.

480
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,726
Do you think I am not aware of that?

481
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,189
We can send one in utmost secrecy
so that the Qing would not notice.

482
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,778
This is a royal command.

483
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,073
Do not talk back and carry out the plan.

484
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,007
My shoes are worn out
and need to be repaired.

485
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,343
Let us visit Banchon Village.

486
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,095
Yes, my lord.

487
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,602
Take a look, my lord.

488
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,857
Thank you.

489
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,275
Thank you.

490
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,779
I must speak to Chu Dal-ha.

491
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,032
Please send him my word.

492
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,244
Yes, my lord.

493
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,165
Not a single cloud in the sky.

494
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,673
How dare you?

495
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,009
It is me, my lady.

496
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,970
Master Chu.

497
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,347
Have you forgotten already?

498
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:20,102
When someone tries to steal from you,
it is safer to give them what they want.

499
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,146
I have told you so countless times.

500
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,899
How will I make money for ransom that way?

501
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,734
They say a mad dog can kill a tiger.

502
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,904
It is better to show them
that I am not someone they can mess with.

503
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,824
So how much ransom money did you make?

504
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,299
The baduk gambler is here.

505
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,094
-That man there…
-Do you know him?

506
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,348
He is Chu Dal-ha, who repatriated
Lord Yoo's sister against his will.

507
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,807
I must inform him immediately.

508
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,941
What do you think?

509
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,027
Enough to bring back
at least ten, is it not?

510
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,113
Ten is a long shot.

511
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,116
As the rich noblemen
matched whatever the Qing demanded

512
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,077
to expedite their return,

513
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,871
the ransom price skyrocketed.

514
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,209
How pathetic of them.

515
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,754
When Grand Prince Jinhan was in Shenyang,

516
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,799
he negotiated with the Qing's court
to regulate the price.

517
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,677
But as that is not an option now,
I am worried about what is to come.

518
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,305
Did the Grand Prince
do things like that too?

519
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,767
That may be why there is a rumor
accusing him of being Prince Rui's spy.

520
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,979
After all, I assume he had to
pay back what he received.

521
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,365
Please have me carry such things, my lady.

522
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,787
Had I received word beforehand,

523
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,206
I would have prepared better food.

524
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,291
I apologize.

525
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,875
Please do not apologize.

526
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,669
They all look delicious.

527
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,810
Goodness.

528
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,186
I should get going.

529
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,106
Already?

530
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,275
The sun is still up.

531
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,945
I must see Lord Kang,
so let me escort you back home.

532
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,822
-Let me just finish this and--
-No need.

533
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,074
My father will not be back
until hours later.

534
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,744
You can come
after you eat everything here.

535
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,203
You better finish it all.

536
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,371
Do you understand?

537
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,790
How am I supposed to finish all this…

538
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,378
I will finish everything before I go.

539
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,844
Just sit down. No need to see me out.

540
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,262
But still…

541
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,476
I now understand why people meddle.

542
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,812
Like you said,
some things are obvious to the onlooker.

543
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,453
Please eat up.

544
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,496
Yes, my lady.

545
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,462
My goodness.

546
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,761
Am I seeing things?

547
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,472
Am I thinking
about the Grand Prince too much?

548
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,210
Thank you for coming, Your Highness.

549
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,172
It is an honor to greet you,
Your Highness.

550
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,549
I am Oh Wook-hwan,
the Third Minister of Taxation.

551
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,426
Greetings, Your Highness.

552
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,094
I am Min Ji-hwan, Assistant Section Chief
of the Ministry of War.

553
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,433
Uncle, why did you want to see me?

554
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,187
Let us take our seats first.
I will get to the point in time.

555
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,156
I am sure you are aware
that Minister Kim Jong-bae

556
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,243
has received His Majesty's approval
to deploy troops to the Qing

557
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,871
by seeking a private audience
with him recently

558
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,247
without the court's consent.

559
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,334
Only one thing could have motivated
Minister Kim to do such a thing.

560
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,252
He wants the Royal Prince
to be appointed as the heir

561
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,630
and receive gomyeong
from the Emperor of Qing.

562
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,173
GOMYEONG: A DOCUMENT APPROVING
THE APPOINTMENT OF AN HEIR

563
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:42,883
Is that so?

564
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,095
Why else would he want a child
named as the King's heir?

565
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,182
It is obvious
he wants to play the king himself!

566
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,936
How can he play king
when His Majesty is alive?

567
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,230
Sorry?

568
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,065
Well…

569
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,192
I did not mean it that way…

570
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,027
Then what did you mean?

571
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,324
Forgive me for my words,

572
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,161
but His Majesty has been ill
for a long time.

573
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,579
The Chinese mainland

574
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,249
is in turmoil due to the strife
between the Ming and the Qing.

575
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,836
This is a turbulent time as the conflict
may reach Joseon at any minute.

576
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,256
Thus, His Majesty's heir must be

577
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,092
someone with wisdom, authority,
and power to combat the national crisis.

578
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,177
I believe such a person

579
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,680
is you, Your Highness.

580
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,769
So…

581
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,023
what you are saying
is that I must succeed His Majesty

582
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,610
over the Prince Royal,
who is his legitimate heir?

583
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,153
Yes, Your Highness.

584
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,573
If you are willing,

585
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,284
we will give you our support.

586
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,350
-Your Highness.
-Stand back.

587
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,436
If I had brought my sword with me,

588
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:22,941
I would have beheaded all of you,
including you, Uncle.

589
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,527
Your Highness.

590
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,614
Please calm down and allow us to continue.

591
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,240
What more is there to hear?

592
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,242
You are suggesting we plot treason!

593
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,204
You are the blood of the late king.

594
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,457
How is this plotting treason

595
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,375
when we only seek
to ensure the nation's safety

596
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,127
by having you ascend to the throne?

597
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,254
I will make myself clear.

598
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,380
I…

599
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,134
do not wish to take the throne.

600
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,553
Do not attempt to sway me

601
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,097
by bringing up the nation's safety
and national crisis.

602
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,309
It is what I despise
the most in this world.

603
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:00,520
I will serve my brother
until the day I die.

604
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,813
Do not think for a moment…

605
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,360
that I will change my mind.

606
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,904
As my brother's subject,

607
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,157
I will not sit back and watch.

608
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,244
Why are you so afraid to seize your fate?

609
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,832
I am convinced

610
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,335
that ascending to the throne,

611
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,630
having the world at your command,
and governing this nation as its king

612
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,424
is your fate.

613
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,052
Do not deny it.

614
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,228
Your Highness.

615
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,466
Bollocks.

616
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,476
You…

617
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,105
Oh, goodness!

618
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,031
Are you

619
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,659
in league with them?

620
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,705
No, Your Highness.

621
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,791
I do not even know who they are.

622
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,543
Then how come you are here?

623
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,214
I saw you while walking down the streets.

624
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,467
And before I knew it…

625
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,937
So you followed me
because you were happy to see me?

626
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:10,692
Yes.

627
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,529
Do you expect me to believe that?

628
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,492
Do not believe me if you would rather not.

629
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,705
Did you hurt yourself badly?

630
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,755
I only followed you because I was worried.

631
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,926
I was told that is what friends do.

632
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,851
Let me help.

633
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,311
Let me go.

634
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,487
Come with me. There is a stream nearby.

635
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,365
You will feel better
after you soak your foot in cold water.

636
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,407
Let us head there.

637
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,660
Do as I say.

638
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,495
Come on. Be careful.

639
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,040
I told you to do as I say.

640
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,004
Careful.

641
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,766
Sit down.

642
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,810
Go on then.

643
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,815
Let me.

644
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,984
I will take it off myself.

645
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,777
Your High--

646
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,322
Here.

647
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,783
Oh, that is cold!

648
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,329
What was that

649
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,707
childish sound you just made?

650
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,460
That is cold.

651
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,132
You also sound like a child
when surprised.

652
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,825
I apologize.

653
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,786
I was not

654
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,581
accusing you of anything earlier.

655
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,251
I was simply ashamed to face you…

656
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,340
and upset about
what you would think of me.

657
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,508
I was rash.

658
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,719
Forgive me.

659
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,599
All right.

660
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,685
Since you have apologized,

661
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,021
I will forgive you just this once.

662
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,858
Thank you.

663
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,903
Since you have forgiven me,

664
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,739
please forget what happened today.

665
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,910
Please do not worry.

666
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,955
I have terrible eyesight and poor hearing,

667
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,457
so I have not seen or heard anything.

668
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,754
That is a relief.

669
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,447
What a pleasantly soothing scent.

670
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,536
What scent are you talking about?

671
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,956
The smell of the wind.

672
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,417
The wind?

673
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,588
Are you talking about
the smell of grass and dirt?

674
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,091
You may not understand

675
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,676
as you have never left this land.

676
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:10,056
Does the wind smell differently
in the land you stayed?

677
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,934
It does.

678
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,565
The scent of blood, sweat, and tears
of the innocent people of Joseon…

679
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,402
pervades the wind there.

680
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,075
I vowed to myself on the day
I smelled that wind for the first time.

681
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,453
That I would survive and return to Joseon

682
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,831
and serve the people and the nation
until the day I die.

683
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,874
That I will not…

684
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,420
let such tragic events happen ever again.

685
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,098
What am I saying right now?

686
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,226
As you have terrible eyesight
and poor hearing,

687
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,980
I must feel relaxed enough
to ramble on about these things.

688
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,526
Sorry?

689
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,446
What did you just say?

690
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,581
Right.

691
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,666
Hongjang told me

692
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,503
you take your opponent's stone
when you win a baduk game.

693
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,590
I do when they bet
their baduk tables and stones.

694
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,344
As you have given me a name,
I will consider your stone received.

695
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,263
Wait here. I will find one in no time.

696
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,265
There is no need.

697
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,725
Your Highness!

698
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,310
Goodness!

699
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,951
Here.

700
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,873
What do you think?

701
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,333
Is any of them to your liking?

702
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,343
Is it really all right for me
to take this stone from you?

703
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,388
What do you mean?

704
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,809
I was the first to play,
but I only won by one jip.

705
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,105
You won that day, Your Highness.

706
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,776
Is that not true?

707
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,746
Do not be so fastidious.

708
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,500
A loss is a loss,
no matter how small it is.

709
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,755
Please hold onto this.

710
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,301
I will take it back

711
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,636
the next time there is a drizzle.

712
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,141
All right.

713
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,192
I will keep it safe until then.

714
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,403
Yes, Your Highness.

715
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,377
Father.

716
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,340
What kind of a person
is Grand Prince Jinhan?

717
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,177
He is a man among men

718
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,429
and one who plays baduk as well as you do.

719
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,393
He was born with the talent and authority

720
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,938
to rule and command the world.

721
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,692
And that makes him…

722
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,572
a target and a threat.

723
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,415
Not only that,

724
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,252
his life is sad and pitiful.

725
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,339
He was fated to ascend to the throne

726
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,758
despite not being able to do so.

727
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,469
Despite his loyal heart,

728
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:20,473
treacherous men
will flock to him like moths to a flame.

729
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,814
Do not worry, Father.

730
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,861
His Highness is not someone
who will be swayed by such people.

731
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,990
That is a strange thing to say.

732
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:42,620
You speak as if you are
a close acquaintance of His Highness.

733
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,458
That is silly, Father.

734
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:52,088
How could I be of acquaintance
with His Highness?

735
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,424
I just assumed

736
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,844
listening to you speak about him.

737
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,930
I hope

738
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,058
that you are right.

739
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,470
I am sorry.

740
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,515
I always give you duties
that require you to risk your life.

741
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,144
No need to apologize.

742
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,855
I am more than content
with your faith in me.

743
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:25,973
What a heartless man.

744
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,811
How come he never bids goodbye
before he leaves?

745
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,897
He has gone like the wind,

746
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,691
so he shall return like one too.

747
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,527
How understanding of you.

748
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:39,946
Goodness.

749
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,996
The rain has been scarce this year.

750
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,874
I wonder when it will rain again.

751
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,294
Are you waiting for mongwoo?

752
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,463
What?

753
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,299
Well, yes.

754
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,219
It must rain for the crops to grow.

755
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,888
My lady.

756
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,015
Why are you playing innocent?

757
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,935
I asked if you were waiting
for Grand Prince Jinhan.

758
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,523
I was not playing innocent.

759
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,609
I simply do not know what to do.

760
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,071
What do you mean?

761
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,742
Do you think he will be surprised

762
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,368
when I tell him who I am?

763
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,748
He will probably be shocked.

764
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,791
I assume he will get furious

765
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,170
by the fact that he has been deceived
by a mere woman.

766
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:40,882
My lady.

767
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,594
Have you decided to tell him who you are?

768
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,226
I am not saying I will do so right now.

769
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,312
I will when the time is right.

770
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,523
He called me his manghyeongjiu

771
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,609
and even gave me the name Mongwoo.

772
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,238
I do not think it is right to befriend him
while hiding behind a mask.

773
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,119
Of course,
I shall not be too rash with the decision

774
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,455
since you played a part in the ruse.

775
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,417
I am all for telling him the truth.

776
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,630
You are?

777
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:25,301
Yes, so do not mind me
and tell him when the right time comes.

778
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,821
We must do something
before the Prince Royal grows older.

779
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,657
Do not worry.

780
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,868
I have a plan for Grand Prince Jinhan.

781
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,122
I will put my trust in you.

782
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,174
Bullseye!

783
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,304
I remember hearing that His Highness
injured his arm recently.

784
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:11,973
He did.

785
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:15,017
He is hitting the bullseye
with every shot despite his injury.

786
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,687
I should stop attending archery practice.

787
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,108
Bullseye!

788
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,819
Your excuse to avoid training
is becoming more base.

789
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,364
You caught on?

790
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,490
Sang-hyo.

791
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,200
Shut that mouth of yours!

792
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,078
Yes, Brother. I will keep it shut.

793
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,920
I am planning to go on a hunt

794
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,881
to find the famed baduk gambler tomorrow.

795
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:45,882
Do you want to join?

796
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,467
-A baduk gambler?
-Bullseye!

797
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,720
Why are you interfering with
Hanseong Magistracy's affairs?

798
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,557
They could never catch him.

799
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,978
Only those who have
mastered baduk can catch him.

800
01:04:59,061 --> 01:04:59,937
And that

801
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,690
is me, Min Sang-hyo.

802
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:09,155
If we are to play baduk, I will visit
the Chief State Councilor's house instead.

803
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:11,866
Well,

804
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:16,871
I would also like to meet his daughter.

805
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,001
Do not even dream of it.

806
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,643
Bullseye!

807
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,773
My lord!

808
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,860
We found the baduk gambler you spoke of.

809
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,987
You did? Where is he?

810
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,327
Please hurry, my lord!

811
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,459
Do you see them over there?

812
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,711
He is there.

813
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:13,844
Thank you.

814
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,930
-Well done.
-Thank you, my lord!

815
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,306
We will gladly serve you again!

816
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,688
Watch closely how I beat him.

817
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,860
Why are you just standing there?

818
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,740
I am sorry.

819
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,534
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

820
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,161
An urgent matter? Out of the blue?

821
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,759
Are you that famous expert baduk player?

822
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:58,222
Are you aware that I only play
when there is a bet?

823
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,599
Of course, I am.

824
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,019
Today is the day you will lose.

825
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,439
Since you are so confident,

826
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,774
I will go first.

827
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,234
Wait.

828
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,488
How generous.

829
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,710
What play is that?

830
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,421
I was just thinking that too.
What a strange play.

831
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,639
Were you caught off guard
by my sneaky play?

832
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,561
It is quite a rare play, indeed.

833
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,732
Now, shall we actually get started?

834
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,951
Gosh, he is done for.

835
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,038
Look at him having trouble catching up.

836
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,707
What is with the chatter?

837
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:10,669
When it comes to baduk,
you never know who will win until the end.

838
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,301
How did this happen?

839
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:21,764
Rain.

840
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:22,973
It is raining!

841
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:24,642
-What?
-What?

842
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,936
-It really is.
-Indeed.

843
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:28,687
Mongwoo.

844
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,440
It is your turn.

845
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,321
I lose.

846
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:39,990
-What?
-What?

847
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,788
Did you all see me beat that man?

848
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,915
Why did he forfeit the game he won?

849
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,041
Tell me about it.

850
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,043
Maybe nature was calling him.

851
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,419
That must be the case.

852
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,088
Nature's call, my foot.

853
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,424
He forfeited the game
because he knew he could not win.

854
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,474
I need to know his name.

855
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:09,520
My table! I need to get his baduk table!

856
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,268
What is wrong?

857
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,023
It is nothing.

858
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:02,615
My lady.

859
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:22,444
I was worried
you might have forgotten our promise.

860
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,780
But I was worried for nothing.

861
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,618
How could I forget a promise to my friend?

862
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,520
Have you prepared yourself?

863
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,355
I will not go easy on you today.

864
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,108
I was just about to say the same.

865
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,485
Let us have a proper game.

866
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,668
Your Highness.

867
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,800
Myung-ha.

868
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,556
I did not expect to see you here.

869
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,819
I did not expect to see you here either,
Your Highness.

870
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,034
Have you been well?

871
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,290
Do you two…

872
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,959
know each other?

873
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:03,962
Yes, Your Highness.

874
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,798
Very well, at that.

875
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,009
Is that not true?

876
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:10,696
CAPTIVATING THE KING

877
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,116
What he hides from me,
I am sure he shares with Kim Myung-ha.

878
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,826
Does he know his name too?

879
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:17,619
What if it is to seek
the Emperor's approval

880
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,957
to have Grand Prince Jinhan
ascend to the throne?

881
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,587
Grand Prince Jinhan and that baduk gambler

882
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,548
shall both accompany you
to the underworld.

883
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,675
Find a way to save the Grand Prince.

884
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:34,178
Stop torturing innocent people

885
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,430
and question me directly.

886
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,516
His Highness will save us no matter what.

887
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:44,104
You must also be careful
not to be captivated, Your Highness.

888
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:50,110
