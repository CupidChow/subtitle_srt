1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,005
FINALE

3
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,214
Come on now.

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,592
Your Royal Highness.

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,636
Forgive me,

6
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,098
but being His Majesty's gidaeryeong
is enough for me.

7
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,396
Who gave you
the permission to take it off?

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,361
Your distasteful habit
of not listening while I am being civil

9
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,282
slipped my mind.

10
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,035
Do not just stand about!

11
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,329
Strip her of this unseemly men's attire.

12
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,044
Let me go!

13
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,716
Here comes His Majesty.

14
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,185
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,025
Mother.

16
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,861
What is going on here?

17
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,533
Greetings, Your Majesty.

18
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,676
Order them to let go of the gidaeryeong

19
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,427
right this instant.

20
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,428
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,972
Please allow me a moment.

22
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,475
I was about to have her
try on the perfect outfit

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,769
I bestowed upon her.

24
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,733
If you do not order them
to release her, I will have to.

25
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,696
Shall I have all your servants
dragged out of your quarters?

26
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,875
Senior Court Lady Han.

27
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,004
Release the gidaeryeong and leave.

28
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,186
You may leave as well, Mong-woo.

29
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,648
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,445
Word has it

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,198
that the Qing Emperor
wants to play baduk with her.

32
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,707
I will relieve you of this distress.

33
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,086
Appoint the gidaeryeong as a concubine.

34
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,589
Not even the Emperor of the Qing

35
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,551
can summon the spouse
of Joseon's King at his will.

36
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,518
That idea eluded me.

37
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,396
All the better,

38
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,942
I could make her the new occupant
of the queen's quarters.

39
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,527
What do you think, Mother?

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,119
How is it that you are responding
to my concerns with a jape?

41
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,746
Were you not japing?

42
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,208
In that case, let me be clear.

43
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,585
I will not

44
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,047
send the gidaeryeong
to the Emperor of the Qing

45
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,092
or appoint her as my concubine.

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,225
If you thought you could control me

47
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,144
by using the gidaeryeong,

48
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,896
I advise you to perish the thought.

49
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,981
Do you think

50
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,026
I want that wicked and deceiving wench
as your future spouse

51
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,736
out of my fondness for her?

52
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,573
You must sire a son
who will inherit the throne

53
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,659
and preserve your legacy.

54
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,161
I already have a son.

55
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,289
The Crown Prince is the late king's son,

56
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,999
not yours.

57
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,793
Do you not remember
how the late king persecuted us?

58
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,545
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

59
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:01,009
If he ascends to the throne,
a bloodbath will be inevitable.

60
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,805
That will happen when I am dead and gone.

61
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,391
There is nothing I can do about that.

62
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,356
If that is what you truly want, then fine.

63
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,651
I will no longer

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,945
reside in the palace with you.

65
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,531
If I leave the palace,

66
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,537
the whole nation will learn
that you are the most undutiful son.

67
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,748
Do you truly believe

68
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,001
your authority will hold
even while going against my will?

69
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,634
It will not do

70
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,929
to have you leave the palace.

71
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,644
I shall ieo myself.

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,937
IEO: RELOCATION OF THE KING'S RESIDENCE

73
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,105
Your Majesty!

74
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,940
Promise me one thing.

75
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,983
Do notâ€¦

76
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,403
summon the gidaeryeong

77
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,739
under any circumstances.

78
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,618
Gidaeryeong Kang
should only answer to my calls.

79
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,464
I shall leave now.

80
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,146
How could you
treat your mother so harshly?

81
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:51,077
How could you be this cruel
to your own mother?

82
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,416
Were you hurt

83
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,296
because of my refusal
to appoint you as my concubine?

84
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,384
If you had ordered me

85
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,221
to abandon my current post
and become your concubine,

86
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,057
I would have resented you

87
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,560
and cut you out of my life.

88
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,276
I almost stepped right into trouble.

89
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,404
To speak the truth,

90
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,243
my mother's words
did sway me for a moment.

91
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,373
What made you change your mind?

92
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,042
I selfishly desired

93
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,880
to have you confined to the palace
so you would only see and think about me.

94
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,552
It seemed as if my mother
had seen through me, which shamed me.

95
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,597
And only then could I think straight.

96
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,937
When were you planning to tell me

97
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,648
that the Emperor had summoned me?

98
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,360
I was never going to tell you.

99
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,489
I have no intention
of sending you away anyway.

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,410
-Your Majesty.
-My mind has been set.

101
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,120
Do not try to argue with me.

102
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,091
Your Majesty.

103
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,471
If you do not send
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo to the Qing,

104
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,766
they may use the execution
of the Principal Director as a pretext

105
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,434
and pressure you further.

106
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,357
I cannot sacrifice the gidaeryeong

107
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,859
to evade their unreasonable requests
and interference.

108
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,987
Punishing the Principal Director

109
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,448
has improved public sentiment,

110
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,785
but there is another challenge
that is yet to be overcome.

111
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,958
It is Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

112
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,213
Your Majesty, I implore you.

113
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,715
Send the gidaeryeong to the Qing

114
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,759
and issue a decree
for the selection of the queen.

115
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,595
If you select a new queen,

116
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,348
the people will trust
and follow you wholly.

117
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,350
Only then

118
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,354
can we abolish the Border Defense Council
without the court's resistance

119
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,733
as you have desired and reform the court.

120
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,320
Please reconsider your decision.

121
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,629
Master Choam.

122
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,548
Thank you.

123
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,509
I did not make the request for you.

124
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,597
I only offered His Majesty my advice

125
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,391
as I did not think
you should remain by his side.

126
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,228
That was why I asked you to advise him.

127
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,814
Without sincerity,

128
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,650
no advice can bend his will.

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,323
I do not know

130
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,826
what decision he will come to.

131
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,495
His Majesty

132
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,208
knows the truth in your words
better than anyone.

133
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,419
Though it may take some time,

134
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,589
he will make the right decision.

135
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,975
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

136
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,143
You may enter.

137
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,574
How did it go?

138
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,619
I conveyed your order
to Senior Court Lady Han.

139
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,497
I told her that should a rumor
that the gidaeryeong is a woman spread,

140
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,499
she would be expelled
and punished severely

141
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,126
as the Queen Dowager's quarters
would be assumed the rumor's origin.

142
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,629
She said she would take it to her grave.

143
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,633
Is there any news about Jung Je-pyo?

144
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,843
After voyaging across the nation,

145
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,346
he has been staying
in Iksan Magistracy for the last few days.

146
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,350
Observe the people he meets
and their topics of discussion

147
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,019
and report back to me.

148
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

149
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,039
Your Majesty.

150
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,042
I have a question.

151
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,752
What is it?

152
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,048
Punishing the Principal Director

153
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,635
equates to declaring war against the Qing.

154
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,097
But they offered peace

155
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,559
by requesting you to send me
instead of invading with their troops.

156
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,686
It is strange.

157
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,110
It means they cannot mobilize
their troops at their will.

158
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,323
They would have to engage
with the remaining forces of the Ming,

159
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,452
and the young Emperor and Prince Rui

160
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,954
may have begun their struggle for power.

161
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,207
Your Majesty.

162
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,127
I will go to the Emperor.

163
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,132
I will look into the situation
they are in.

164
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,553
Did I not tell you already
that I would not be sending you away?

165
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,056
Do you think they would accept that
without a challenge?

166
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,811
Finding a way to take advantage
of the situation would be preferable,

167
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,896
would it not?

168
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,273
Do you think they will not
see through your intent?

169
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,609
They will consider you a spy,

170
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,486
keep their eyes on you at all times,

171
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,113
and find any means to persecute you.

172
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,032
Why do you insist on taking the risk?

173
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,243
Because I would be leaving to play baduk

174
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,829
and it would be the Qing Emperor
I would converse with there.

175
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,290
Should I earn his goodwill,

176
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,792
I would gain means
to aid you and this nation.

177
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,921
There is no reason for me
to hesitate or dread it.

178
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,720
-No.
-Your Majesty.

179
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,434
There is another reason I must go.

180
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,690
I wish to see

181
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,068
my long-yearned father in Beijing.

182
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,303
I failed to protect you three years ago.

183
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,974
But even after three years,

184
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,478
I am no different
in that I still cannot protect you.

185
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,069
Why must I, even as the king,

186
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,117
face continued failures in protecting you?

187
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,292
Your Majesty.

188
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,593
You have my approval.

189
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,387
You may leave to the Qing.

190
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,522
Thank you, Your Majesty.

191
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,652
I shallâ€¦

192
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,365
live up to your expectations.

193
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,022
Do not make those faces.

194
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,608
I am not going there as a criminal

195
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,652
but as the Emperor's guest.

196
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,278
They may call you their guest,

197
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,656
but who knows how they will treat you?

198
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,824
My lady.

199
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,662
Does that mean
you are going as the gidaeryeong?

200
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,290
I must step down from the post when I go.

201
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,588
And yet His Majesty gave you
his approval for you to go to the Qing?

202
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,632
I asked for his approval myself.

203
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,926
I would like to see my father as well.

204
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,557
I might as well take this opportunity
and join Lady Hee-soo

205
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,560
to see how Bun-yeong is doing
and go sightseeing in Beijing.

206
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,105
I will be traveling
with the envoy's group,

207
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,857
so I can only take two other people.

208
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,734
Then Jageunnyeon should stay.

209
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,278
Yes, it would be better for us to go.

210
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,990
There will be loads to pack.

211
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,033
When are we leaving?

212
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,203
We will be leaving in a month's time.

213
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,455
A month's timeâ€¦

214
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,795
I cannot send Mong-woo to the Qing alone.

215
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,799
How about you select a few men
from my unit to watch over her?

216
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,677
There is someone
more suited for that role.

217
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,388
Do you mean Chu Dal-ha?

218
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,436
I shall order the Chief Royal Secretary

219
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,272
to prepare a royal decree
granting him amnesty.

220
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,191
Go and deliver it
as soon as the document is prepared.

221
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,776
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,476
I hear my days in exile came to a close.

223
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,145
The gidaeryeong

224
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,606
will be leaving for Beijing.

225
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,527
His Majesty granted you amnesty
so you could watch over her.

226
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,544
What is it?

227
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,296
I apologize,

228
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,633
but could I ask for a few days' time?

229
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,719
I must tie up a loose end.

230
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,137
It is Yoo Hyun-bo, is it not?

231
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,892
Do you plan to kill him?

232
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,942
Killing an exiled criminal
for personal reasons

233
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,236
is against this nation's law.

234
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,949
You would be committing another crime
against His Majesty despite his kindness.

235
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,582
You have three days.

236
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,709
That is it.

237
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,440
I was wondering where you went.

238
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,693
I see you went to get some wood.

239
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,196
It was so cold at night

240
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,158
that I almost froze to death.

241
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,993
Start the fire to heat the floor.

242
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,996
There will be no heating
until winter frost sets in.

243
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,291
Do remember this is not some
luxurious residence, will you?

244
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,750
Good grief.

245
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,754
That little bratâ€¦

246
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,348
What is it?

247
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,896
Over there.

248
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,856
What?

249
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,358
What was it?

250
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,443
Someone I know

251
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,031
was standing there just now.

252
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,199
Over there.

253
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,826
Goodness.

254
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,244
Someone you know?

255
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,996
Unbelievable.

256
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,208
This is not some market in the capital
where people can bump into each other!

257
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,043
Wait.

258
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,463
He was there just a moment ago.

259
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,797
Step away.

260
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,549
Stop playing games

261
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,675
and go back inside.

262
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,762
You will be flogged
if the magistrate sees you.

263
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,721
Do you understand?

264
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,436
Get back inside.

265
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,201
What is this?

266
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,536
It is your meal.

267
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,830
That was not the point of my question.

268
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,251
Did I not give you money
for food yesterday?

269
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,711
Do not put on such airs
for some petty change.

270
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,133
You bastard!

271
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,928
Do you know who I am?

272
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,723
You can have this lousy food.

273
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:13,397
I will head straight to the magistracy
and inform the magistrate of this!

274
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,401
Acting like a nobleman

275
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,653
when you are but a traitor, are you?

276
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,484
I knew it. It really was you.

277
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,574
I was worried that I might not
get to kill you before leaving,

278
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,285
but the heavens are on my side.

279
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,000
Your knife is rather small.

280
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,337
You should have brought a longer sword.

281
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,424
This will be more than enough

282
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,386
to kill a mangy hyena.

283
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,930
If you kill me,

284
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,183
you will die as well
for murdering an exiled criminal.

285
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,687
Killing a murderous runaway
is an exception.

286
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,317
When I go to the Underworld
and meet that wench, Hongjang,

287
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,777
I shall have to ask her this.

288
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:11,032
"How did you end up taking a lover
as lowly as Chu Dal-ha?"

289
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,865
You will not be meeting Hongjang
in the Underworld

290
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,119
since you will fall straight
into the burning pits of hell.

291
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:23,980
Lord Kim.

292
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,899
What brings you here?

293
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,741
Did you come knowing that
today is my last day in the palace

294
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,701
serving as the gidaeryeong?

295
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,332
Yoo Hyun-bo died.

296
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,088
He seems to have run away
after murdering his exile overseer

297
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,257
and met his end at the hand of a bandit.

298
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,557
Are you all right?

299
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,437
Yoo Hyun-bo

300
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,983
persecuted and harmed Hongjang,

301
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,986
but he was her only kin.

302
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:17,284
I thought I would be in agony
for the rest of my life,

303
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,412
unable to decide
whether to forgive him or not.

304
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,710
I did not expect it to end like this.

305
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,090
When are you leaving?

306
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,018
I shall bid my farewell
to His Majesty tomorrow

307
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,728
and leave the day after.

308
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,149
I wish you

309
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,401
a safe journey.

310
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,822
Thank you.

311
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,115
Please do not worry.

312
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,008
Your Royal Highness.

313
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,428
I wanted to see you for the last time
before I left the palace.

314
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,269
Master.

315
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,817
I shall remember all your teachings
until we meet again.

316
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,658
I shall also look forward to

317
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,578
our reunion.

318
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,505
Please give my regards

319
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,882
to my sister in Beijing.

320
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,845
Yes, Your Royal Highness. I shall.

321
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,723
Please stay strong and healthy

322
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,351
until the day we meet again.

323
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,229
I will, Master.

324
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,893
I am back.

325
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,980
Look who we have here, my lady.

326
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,025
My lady.

327
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,157
How did you manage to return?

328
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,786
His Majesty granted me a pardon

329
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,830
so that I could escort you to Beijing.

330
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,834
But something feels so off about you.

331
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,627
You do not have the look

332
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,547
of a haggard criminal
who suffered a punishment.

333
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,715
Am I wrong?

334
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,175
I must agree.

335
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,052
You look as bright as the moon.

336
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,181
Dal-ha, shining like the moonlight.

337
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,735
Yoo Hyun-bo died.

338
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,988
He seems to have run away
after murdering his exile overseer

339
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,157
and met his end at the hand of a bandit.

340
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,620
How are you feeling?

341
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,500
Are you all right?

342
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,213
Do not worry about me, my lady.

343
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,131
I feel fine and at ease.

344
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,053
That is good enough for me.

345
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,656
My lady, you should come out for a moment.

346
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,991
Why are you acting so fussy?

347
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:48,888
Captain Joo.

348
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,432
What brings you here?

349
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,017
His Majesty summons you.

350
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,901
I was getting ready to go to the palace.

351
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,112
Please allow me a moment.

352
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,114
I shall prepare myself and come back.

353
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,907
Wait.

354
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,833
What is this?

355
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,294
His Majesty has bestowed upon you
a set of attire.

356
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,379
Get changed and come outside.

357
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,463
I will be waiting.

358
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,938
Look at this, my lady.

359
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,484
What is the matter?

360
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,528
Do you not like it?

361
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,365
That is not it.

362
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,534
I like it.

363
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,871
I wish

364
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,957
His Majesty would not send you away.

365
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,252
Jageunnyeon.

366
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,254
I know it cannot happen.

367
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,633
I am only saying how I feel.

368
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,764
Your Majesty.

369
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,930
You did not summon me to Yeongchwijeong,

370
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,767
so I was afraid
I would have to leave without seeing you.

371
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,478
I did not summon you

372
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,940
as I was afraid my resolve
would waver upon seeing you.

373
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,739
How come you summoned me today?

374
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,701
I summoned youâ€¦

375
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,623
because I wished to spend the day
wholly with you.

376
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,755
A whole day for us
to be an ordinary man and woman.

377
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,015
Will you join me?

378
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,076
Do you know how to skip stones?

379
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,342
The best stone for this game

380
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,096
is a flat stone like this one.

381
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,432
Here I go.

382
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,607
Give it a try.

383
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,668
You sure have a talent
for all games with stones.

384
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,835
Your Majesty.

385
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,545
I am fine.

386
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,132
Here.

387
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,565
Are you all right?

388
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,693
I am.

389
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,367
Let me.

390
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,398
What thought has you smiling thusly?

391
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,236
I was reminded of a past event.

392
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,530
Years ago,

393
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,116
when you ascended to the throne

394
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,119
and I was jailed in the State Tribunal,

395
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,245
I had a dream.

396
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,000
I dreamt that you came by

397
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,043
to see me while I was sleeping.

398
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,256
It was not a dream.

399
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,594
I did visit you then
without anyone knowing.

400
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,187
No wonder it felt so real.

401
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,356
There are requests I must make to you.

402
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,861
No matter how upset you get,

403
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,282
do not go against the Emperor rashly.

404
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,578
Seeing your eyes go ablaze

405
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,623
might make the Emperor fall for you.

406
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,257
If you do get to play baduk
with the Emperor,

407
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,469
remember to lose one out of three games.

408
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,473
Having the Emperor
insist on keeping you until he winsâ€¦

409
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,435
will not do at all.

410
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,568
Yes, Your Majesty. I will remember.

411
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,739
Do you have any other requests for me?

412
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,115
No matter where you are,

413
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,248
do not forget that you are my gidaeryeong.

414
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,423
I have a request to make as well.

415
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,764
Even if days go by without mongwoo,

416
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,226
do not be upset or harass Captain Joo.

417
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,979
Do not shed tears at the sight of mongwoo

418
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,566
or stay all alone in Yeongchwijeong.

419
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,236
One more thing.

420
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,948
Do not leave the queen's quarters
vacant for too long.

421
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,826
The court will be concernedâ€¦

422
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,848
What else?

423
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,476
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

424
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,650
Your Majesty.

425
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,321
Why do you not ask

426
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,366
for my name?

427
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,291
You said it is the rule of your baduk bet.

428
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,545
You only tell your name
to the opponent who beats you.

429
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,882
I have not beaten you yet,

430
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,093
so how could I ask for your name?

431
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,560
I promise

432
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,730
to return safely

433
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,150
and give you a chance to win against me.

434
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,363
Here is my promise.

435
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,993
I will beat you when that day comes

436
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,622
and have you say your name.

437
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,316
I will not come to Yeongchwijeong
until Mong-woo returns.

438
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,902
Shut the gate to the place
until I command otherwise.

439
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,148
Are you doing well, Mong-woo?

440
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,402
It has already been nine months
since you left for the Qing.

441
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,071
There have been
many events, small and big,

442
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,698
in and out of the palace
while you were gone.

443
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,870
His Majesty has ordered us
to find a way to right the wrongs

444
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,039
that are harming our people.

445
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,792
What do you think that means?

446
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,419
He is referring to the wrongs

447
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,004
regarding the tribute offering
and the military service.

448
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,299
Do you assume

449
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,219
the noblemen will also have to pay taxes
to be exempt from military service?

450
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,887
His Majesty said it was unfair

451
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,558
for the commoners to suffer alone
while the noblemen made no sacrifices.

452
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,981
The court and the scholars
will be against this.

453
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:38,193
Even the scholars' resistance
will not work on His Majesty.

454
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,697
After the Chief State Councilor
and Right State Councilor

455
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,407
requested to be dismissed
and left the capital,

456
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,409
His Majesty appointed
the Left State Councilor

457
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,869
as the Chief State Councilor,

458
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,579
the Inspector General
as the Minister of Personnel,

459
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,582
and the Chief Royal Secretary
as the Minister of Rites.

460
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,209
The palace and the court
must right their wrongs

461
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,044
for the people to follow.

462
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,339
Therefore, I will right the wrongs
of the royal family as well.

463
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,134
Expose all the crimes

464
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,678
of members of the royal family
and their relatives

465
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,764
who went against the national law
and monopolized the salt manufacture

466
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,477
or stole lands that were cultivated
through people's hard work and sacrifice.

467
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,771
And see to it
that they are severely punished.

468
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,360
My brother requested to be dismissed,
but His Majesty disapproved.

469
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,614
He was offered the position
of the governor of Gyeonggi Province

470
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,324
which he surprisingly accepted.

471
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,911
The days he used to be called
one of the Three Hwans

472
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,413
are long behind him.

473
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,667
His Majesty is reforming the court
with a strong initiative.

474
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,127
But what questions me the most

475
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,756
is that he lets Jung Je-pyo,
the Supreme General of the Privy Council,

476
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,216
abuse his powers and seek more

477
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,760
with the Qing as his trusted patron.

478
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,558
The Third Minister of War is here,
my lord.

479
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,602
Welcome, Myung-ha.

480
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,906
Were you writing a letter
to send to Beijing again?

481
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:10,035
Why do you continue to send one
when you have not received any replies?

482
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:14,039
Must there be a reason
for a friend to send a letter to another?

483
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,835
After I heard the news
of the Princess's return

484
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,963
after the sudden death of Prince Rui,

485
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,174
I have been hoping Mong-woo
would accompany her.

486
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,052
But you heard the rumor too, did you not?

487
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,430
They say Kang Mong-woo
may become the Emperor's gidaejo.

488
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,683
GIDAEJO: A GOVERNMENT POST
FOR THE EMPEROR'S BADUK COMPANION

489
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,768
I cannot sit back and watch that happen.

490
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,896
What could you possibly do

491
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,982
when even His Majesty has his hands tied?

492
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,276
That also upsets me.

493
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,779
He locked up Yeongchwijeong
and forbade us from mentioning Mong-woo.

494
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,535
He does not seem like the man
who favored him more than anyone else.

495
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,623
Have you been well, Your Royal Highness?

496
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,500
How did you know I was here?

497
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,087
I went to the temporary palace
to uphold a royal command to greet you,

498
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,548
and your maids directed me here.

499
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,510
Did the King order you to find out

500
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,846
whether I am dead or alive?

501
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,099
Of course not, Your Royal Highness.

502
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,062
His Majesty is constantly concerned
about your well-being--

503
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,981
Tell him that I am well.

504
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,069
Your Royal Highness.

505
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,363
Forgive me,

506
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,199
but His Majesty charged me
to ask you a question.

507
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,452
It has been months
since you went away for a retreat,

508
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,329
so when might you be returning to the--

509
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,039
Why are you asking me that?

510
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,416
Tell the King to come by himselfâ€¦

511
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,838
to have me consider
the matter of my return.

512
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,565
Your Majesty,
I come bearing an urgent matter.

513
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,859
I was on my way
to the Directorate of Training

514
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,361
and the Royal Commandery Division.

515
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,404
What is the matter?

516
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,283
Your Majesty.

517
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,205
The Qing's envoy has reached
the Mohwa Guesthouse.

518
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:05,419
I was wondering if I could go welcome
the envoy and his party.

519
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,545
Your Majesty.

520
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,339
Two officials dispatched to Uiju
have received

521
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,175
and accompanied the envoy
ever since his arrival there.

522
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,345
There is no need
for the Supreme General to join them.

523
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,056
Your Majesty.

524
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,766
I have known

525
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:24,604
the Qing's current envoy for a long time,
and I am on good terms with him.

526
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,357
I only seek to prevent
any discomfort to you

527
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,110
before your departure
from the palace tomorrow,

528
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,362
so please give me your approval.

529
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,823
You have my approval.

530
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,409
As Princess Jangryeong
will need to be escorted,

531
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,494
take Third Minister of War
Kim Myung-ha with you.

532
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,455
I shall, Your Majesty.

533
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,133
Your Majesty.

534
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,178
It is clear that Jung Je-pyo
volunteered to go to the Mohwa Guesthouse

535
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,347
to satisfy his selfish needs
by colluding with the Qing's envoy

536
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,726
and to inform the matters
of the Joseon court to the Qing.

537
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,229
As his reliable patron,
Prince Rui, is now long gone,

538
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,023
he seeks to contribute to their court

539
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:12,444
and prove to the Emperor
his competence as a spy.

540
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,116
Your concerns are duly noted.

541
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,996
I have a plan in mind,

542
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,041
so do not worry.

543
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,796
Make way!

544
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,092
Even a snail is faster than you lot.

545
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,636
Go faster!

546
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,519
Hey, what do you think you are doing?

547
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,986
I will leave you behind
if you do not come to your senses!

548
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,989
Let us go. Hurry.

549
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,874
Is Se-dong here?

550
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,709
Goodness.

551
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,753
Welcome, my lord.

552
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,296
Oh my.

553
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,549
I hope you have been well.

554
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,592
I am here to see the gidaeryeong.
Where is she?

555
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,136
Sorry? What do you mean?

556
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,888
I know she is back.

557
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,139
Do not play dumb.

558
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,561
We are not playing dumb--

559
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,230
Must I search the place
for you to tell me the truth?

560
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,067
Lord Kim.

561
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,621
Lord Kim.

562
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,374
It has been a while.

563
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,014
How come you returned without a word?

564
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,349
Has your father not returned with you?

565
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,644
He is still in Beijing.

566
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,772
Master Chu said he would stay by his side,

567
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,442
so only I accompanied
Bun-yeong back to Joseon.

568
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,405
So you do not plan on
informing His Majesty of your return.

569
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:26,036
Nothing good will come of
letting him know.

570
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,831
What will you do now?

571
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,709
After I see Her Highness and Bun-yeong

572
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,836
safely return to their respective posts,

573
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,047
I will leave again.

574
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,341
Until then,

575
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,385
please do not tell anyone.

576
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,426
My greetings to you, Your Majesty.

577
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,595
My name is Bun-yeong.

578
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,225
It must have been very difficult for you.

579
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,772
Your detailed reports
on the Qing royal family

580
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,774
benefited me greatly.

581
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,444
I did not consider my task
to be a difficult one.

582
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,532
Ever since you executed your kin,
the Principal Director,

583
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,326
Prince Rui began to fear you.

584
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,497
"There is nothing stronger than a monarch
who has won the people's hearts."

585
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,873
He spoke thusly

586
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,377
and recognized Joseon as a nation
the Qing could no longer meddle with.

587
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,591
Indeed.

588
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,596
I shall reward you.

589
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,099
You may request anything you would like.

590
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:19,899
Though I have committed a grave crime
of taking Her Highness's place,

591
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,818
you have forgiven my crime

592
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,319
and spared no effort

593
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,573
to have me return safely
after Prince Rui's sudden demise.

594
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,368
You have already shown me
great generosity, Your Majesty.

595
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,288
I do not wish for more.

596
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,999
I am proud of you.

597
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,919
I will never forget your contribution.

598
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,137
Please give my thanks to the Emperor

599
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,932
for the safe repatriation
of Princess Jangryeong.

600
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,189
He asks you to convey his gratitude
to the Emperor.

601
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,152
Now that you have your princess back,

602
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,987
it is your turn to return the favor.

603
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:10,158
When will you send back the criminal
who committed a crime against the Emperor?

604
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,913
Wait.

605
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,374
Who is the envoy referring to?

606
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,586
The criminal?

607
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,797
He did not mention this yesterday.

608
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,510
He is asking when you will relinquish
the criminal to his care.

609
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,886
I will do so now.

610
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,723
Take him.

611
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,352
Arrest the criminal.

612
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,229
Your Majesty.

613
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,231
No!

614
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,487
A criminal?

615
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,406
I, a criminal?

616
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,408
Your Majesty.

617
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,370
There must be a misunderstanding.

618
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,122
No.

619
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,415
This is a command
from the Emperor of the Great Qing.

620
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,668
Heed well, Criminal Jung Je-pyo.

621
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,837
"Evidence surfaced
that proves that Prince Rui

622
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,131
had plotted treason
before his sudden death.

623
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,217
Prince Rui's loyal subject, Jung Je-pyo,
shall return immediately,

624
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,970
confess his crime before the Emperor,
and receive his punishment."

625
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,139
Take him.

626
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,518
Your Majesty.

627
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,395
Let me go!

628
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,313
Let me go!

629
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,357
Your Majesty!

630
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,817
Your Majesty!

631
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,615
Your Majesty.

632
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,910
I am a man of Joseon

633
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,414
and your loyal subject.

634
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,960
The Emperor of the Qing
has no right to punish me.

635
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,712
Do you not agree?

636
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,342
It has been countless years
since you have not been a man of Joseon

637
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,304
but a man of Qing.

638
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,689
You told me those very words years ago.

639
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,192
Have you forgotten already?

640
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,112
The horrific deaths met by Joseon's people

641
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,949
and the cruel treatment
suffered by the captives

642
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,536
are solely on Joseon's King and its court.

643
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,624
I have been the Great Qing's loyal subject
for many years now,

644
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,959
but I cannot hold my head high

645
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,545
from the shame
of being formerly of Joseon.

646
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,011
Your Majestyâ€¦

647
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,140
Your Majesty.

648
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:44,521
I have committed
an unforgivable crime against you.

649
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,606
Please.

650
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:51,569
I plead with you to punish me instead.

651
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,198
Please do not hand me over
to these outlanders.

652
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,324
Please, Your Majesty.

653
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,166
I sincerely wish
that I could punish you myself.

654
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,379
It is unfortunate that I cannotâ€¦

655
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,969
as you were never my subject.

656
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,391
Your Majesty.

657
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,233
Your Majesty.

658
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,573
Your Majesty!

659
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,782
Take him away.

660
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,535
Your Majesty!

661
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,662
Save me!

662
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,165
Save me, Your Majesty!

663
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,169
Your Majesty, please!

664
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,546
Your Majesty!

665
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,427
You did so well.

666
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,054
I am so proud of you.

667
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,015
You did great.

668
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:07,562
I will not go anywhere
and live with you and Father.

669
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,856
Stop crying.

670
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,942
Why are you crying
on such a happy occasion?

671
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,193
My goodness.

672
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,071
Let us all head inside.

673
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,158
I am going to prepare a feast tonight.

674
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,075
Gladly.

675
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,497
His Majesty charged me

676
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:31,294
to grant Bun-yeong and the two of you
a large residence and great fortune.

677
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,881
If you so wish,
he will award you a government post.

678
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,382
My goodness.

679
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,052
Such a suggestion alone
fills me with gratitude.

680
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,219
Unfortunately,

681
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,681
I have lived my entire life as a shoemaker

682
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,808
and I intend to live as one
for the rest of my life.

683
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,603
The residence, fortune,
and the government post

684
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,563
are of no use to me.

685
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,441
On top of that,
if Lord Kang returns from Beijing,

686
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,401
he will require my services.

687
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,696
I wish to stay here in case that happens.

688
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,366
Right. What about Bun-yeong?

689
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,912
If you have a wish,
ask His Majesty for it.

690
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,747
He will probably grant it.

691
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,834
No, Father.
I will follow your will as well.

692
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,423
I understand.
I will convey your message to His Majesty.

693
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,259
Let us go in.

694
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,891
What will you do now?

695
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,147
I will leave the capital upon daybreak.

696
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,526
May I ask where you will be heading to?

697
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,240
I am considering Master Choam's house,
a place where I have stayed before.

698
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,158
I have no set plans

699
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,577
for where I will go or what I will do

700
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,871
after that.

701
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,210
Wherever it may be,
please send word from time to time.

702
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,255
Sang-hyo is gravely worried about you.

703
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,842
Do not look forward to it all that much.

704
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,255
Hey.

705
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,633
What has you so deep in thought?

706
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,595
Let us head inside
for the morning assembly.

707
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:48,723
There will not be one,
so there is no need to.

708
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,683
What do you mean by that?

709
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,437
I was wondering where you two were.

710
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,275
I am going home,

711
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,068
so if anyone looks for me,
tell them I left.

712
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,280
Are you not attending
the assembly, Great Lord?

713
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,616
Have you not heard the news?

714
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,203
His Majesty has suddenly postponed it.

715
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,250
Myung-ha.

716
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,045
How did you know
His Majesty would postpone it?

717
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,175
Here he goes again.

718
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,156
Give that to me. I will carry it.

719
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,243
No, it is fine. This is nothing.

720
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,204
Then let us rest there.

721
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,060
There is not a single speck of cloud.

722
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,646
That is fortunate.

723
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,316
This journey would be harder if it rained.

724
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,822
It is fortunate indeed.

725
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,286
Stay here, my lady.

726
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,998
I am going to look for a spring
and get some water.

727
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,624
Be safe.

728
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,584
All right.

729
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,184
Your Majesty.

730
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:22,103
What took you so long?

731
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,397
I have been waiting for you for hours.

732
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,484
Did you know

733
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,821
I would come by this place?

734
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,008
There is nothing I do not know about you.

735
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,806
Myung-ha told me

736
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,559
that you would pass by this place.

737
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,734
Were you truly planning to leave
without seeing me?

738
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:17,867
Do not tell meâ€¦

739
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,037
you have found another lover.

740
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,877
I have no room for another.

741
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,757
How is it

742
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,009
that you are still alone, Your Majesty?

743
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:38,387
What do you mean? I was never alone.

744
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,641
I always had youâ€¦

745
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,270
in my heart, Mong-woo.

746
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,568
To tell the truth,

747
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,738
I thought a mongwoo

748
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,618
just might grant me a chance to see you.

749
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:04,538
So you were planning to wait
until there was rain?

750
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,499
And here I was, dying to see you.

751
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,378
I guess you did not miss me as much.

752
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,304
Whether mongwoo,

753
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,306
snow,

754
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,770
sprinkle, or leaves fall from the sky,
it does not matter anymore.

755
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,150
I will no longer wait for youâ€¦

756
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:37,988
while aimlessly looking up at the sky.

757
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,068
Bollocks.

758
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,363
What took you so long?

759
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:20,990
Lady Hee-soo

760
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,577
has waited dearly for His Majesty.

761
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,583
I am sorry.

762
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,338
Please do not cry.

763
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,759
Why are you crying?

764
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,765
Because I could not be any happier!

765
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:26,722
Prepare yourself.

766
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,850
I will beat you this time

767
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,102
and have you say your name.

768
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,317
It is Kang Hee-soo.

769
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:57,378
Kang Hee-soo.

770
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,179
So that is the name that I longed for
and sought after even in my dreams.

771
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:11,934
Hee-soo.

772
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,396
I will no longer

773
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,940
be separated from you

774
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,778
and spend the rest of my life with you.

775
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:07,299
