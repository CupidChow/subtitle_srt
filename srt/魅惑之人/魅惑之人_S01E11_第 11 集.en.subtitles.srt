00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,797
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,519
Now that it has come to this,

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,773
we must inform the King
before the Principal Director does.

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,983
That is the only way

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,819
to prevent the Grand Prince
from being suspected by the King.

7
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,450
I understand.

8
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,286
I will confess everything to the King.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,831
If you tell him a lie
to hide your treacherous heart,

10
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,958
he will only grow more suspicious.

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,711
Leave it up to me.

12
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,879
Please look after

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,715
the Grand Prince for now.

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,718
Are you saying
you will take all the blame?

15
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,262
Just how much are you planning
to disgrace me?

16
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,972
If you cannot bear this much,

17
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,559
you might as well give up the plan
to ascend the Grand Prince.

18
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
The King

19
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,692
will have you executed.

20
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,948
One must sacrifice something
to protect another.

21
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,493
If my life can salvage our plan,

22
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,497
we should consider ourselves lucky.

23
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,734
Lord Park.

24
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,070
Are you entering the palace
at this late hour?

25
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,705
I have come to report
an urgent matter to His Majesty.

26
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,135
It seems I have underestimated you,
Sixth Royal Secretary.

27
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,763
What do you mean?

28
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,974
Princess Jangryeong.

29
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,523
How will you handle
the consequences of such an act?

30
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,456
What is the matter?

31
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,755
Why are you hesitating?

32
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,800
Is it regarding your identity?

33
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,720
No, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,472
It is not about me,

35
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,350
but Her Highness.

36
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,145
Her Highness?
Do you mean Princess Jangryeong?

37
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,815
The one who is on her way
to the Qing to marry Prince Rui

38
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,652
is not Princess Jangryeong.

39
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,366
It is one of the court maids
who serve Her Highness.

40
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,747
Seeing as you are aware of this,

41
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,919
are you the person
who orchestrated her substitution?

42
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,264
Who ordered you to do this?

44
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,432
I did not do it on anyone's orders.

45
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,142
I did it on my own will.

46
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,269
My decision

47
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,105
to have the Princess wed Prince Rui

48
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,817
was to maintain the repatriation system
for the war captives

49
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,485
and prevent another war.

50
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,364
Why did you substitute the Princess
despite knowing this?

51
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,200
It was for that very reason

52
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,121
that I thought I had to help Her Highness,
even if no one else would.

53
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,249
Her pain and loneliness

54
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,544
from having her plea denied
and failing to protect her loved one

55
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,131
is something I understand
better than anyone.

56
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,475
How did the Principal Director find out?

57
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,645
A court lady of the Queen Dowager

58
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,315
noticed Bun-yeong's absence
and reported it to her.

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,276
Is Bun-yeong the court maid
who replaced the Princess?

60
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,278
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,825
Who else knows about this?

62
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,785
Me,

63
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,165
Her Highness, and Bun-yeong,
the three of us.

64
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,875
Grand Prince Munseong is unaware?

65
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,210
The Princess would not have hidden

66
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,296
such an important matter
from her only brother.

67
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,007
Well…

68
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,051
Is Kim Myung-ha aware of this?

69
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,435
Speak the truth!

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,188
Is Kim Myung-ha aware of this or not?

71
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,941
I have plotted everything.

72
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,697
I convinced the unwilling Grand Prince
and the Sixth Royal Secretary into it.

73
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,456
The crime you have committed

74
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,084
is high treason against me

75
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,920
that would call for an execution.

76
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,131
So why are you confessing?

77
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,178
Did you think

78
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,099
I could not take your life anymore?

79
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,936
Did you expect me to forgive your crimes
because I am in love with you?

80
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,565
Is it wrong to expect as much?

81
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,614
My crime against you

82
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,492
does not render my love for you false.

83
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,598
Is there anything else I should know?

84
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,269
Do not leave anything out and tell me.

85
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,489
Your Majesty.

86
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,867
It is disturbing to bring you this news.

87
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,162
I must report to you
the treacherous subjects

88
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,750
who dared to go against the royal command
and deceived you and the court.

89
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,422
Whose and what kind of deceit
are you talking about?

90
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,299
At Grand Prince Munseong's behest,

91
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,259
Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha

92
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,846
substituted Princess Jangryeong
with a court maid.

93
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,849
The Qing's Chief Envoy, Podan,
was enraged by the fact

94
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,768
that he stopped his journey
and now stays in Gaegyeong,

95
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,063
awaiting your arrival, Your Majesty.

96
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,732
Substitution?

97
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,400
Are you certain?

98
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,989
I went to Byeokjegwan myself
and confirmed it in the afternoon.

99
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,451
We must interrogate the Grand Prince
and Kim Myung-ha before daybreak

100
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,120
and arrest all those
who were in league with them.

101
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,790
Should you go to Gaegyeong after that,
you will be able to soothe Podan's anger.

102
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,834
I will interrogate them myself.

103
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,295
Heed my order, Sang-hwa.

104
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,465
Yes, Your Majesty.
Please give me your command.

105
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,301
Send the Special Firearms Unit
to the Grand Prince's quarters

106
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,928
and prohibit servants from entering.

107
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,097
And arrest Sixth Royal Secretary
Kim Myung-ha and bring him here.

108
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,475
I shall carry out the royal command.

109
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,772
Eunuch Kim,
summon the Chief Royal Secretary.

110
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,736
Your Majesty.

112
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,864
I shall gather the Border Defense Council

113
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,659
and prepare for the interrogation.

114
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,580
Wait.

115
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,543
Before that,

116
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,423
there is something
I must confirm with you.

117
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,890
Listen up.

118
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,976
You will head
to Grand Prince Munseong's quarters

119
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,686
and bar the servants from entering.

120
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,145
-You will follow me.
-Yes, my lord.

121
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,606
You should serve His Majesty
for the time being.

122
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,649
Yes, Eunuch Kim.

123
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,045
So it begins.

124
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,606
Are you all right, Your Highness?

125
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,330
-Your Highness.
-What insolence is this?

126
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,590
Principal Director.

127
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,761
What is all the ruckus about?

128
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,182
I am here to convey
Her Royal Highness's final regard.

129
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,517
She seems to have startled herself

130
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,853
while attempting to avoid me
for some reason.

131
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,021
It is only natural.

132
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,190
Why would she welcome you?

133
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,777
Yet you are forcing her to receive you,
which must be why she is avoiding you.

134
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,236
I will leave after I give my regards.

135
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,404
Lord Park!

136
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,575
You are putting me

137
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,494
in a difficult spot.

138
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,622
If your impudence to Her Highness

139
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,791
becomes known to Prince Rui,

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,169
he will be infuriated.

141
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,886
I understand.

142
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,430
Then Vice Envoy Jung,

143
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,725
please give this back
to Her Highness yourself.

144
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,155
Your Highness.

145
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,496
Please allow me to apologize
on his behalf.

146
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,541
Please forgive him

147
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,001
for his discourteous behavior.

148
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,837
Thank you.

149
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,152
My lord.

150
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,736
What is going on?

151
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,078
What is the matter, Lord Park?

152
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,457
Please let me know
if this is something I should know.

153
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,126
There is no issue here.

154
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,920
You may return to your duty.

155
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,466
Yes, Lord Park.

156
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,888
My lord.

157
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,100
Your words convinced me
that she was substituted.

158
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,269
But that does not seem to be the case.

159
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,770
She is a substitute.

160
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,689
Were it not the case,

161
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,693
she would not have tried so hard
to hide her face.

162
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,778
However, Jung Je-pyo

163
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,865
saw Her Highness's visage.

164
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,284
I fell into my own trap.

165
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,703
The substitution must have taken place

166
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,289
before Jung Je-pyo
delivered the wedding gifts.

167
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,043
What will you do now?

168
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,419
I will report this to His Majesty

169
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,797
and punish those who replaced
the Princess with another woman.

170
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,134
But you were not able to see her face.

171
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,429
Would your case stand
without any evidence?

172
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,307
If I could not see her face,

173
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,726
that means no one else could.

174
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,773
So no one can confirm it

175
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,777
even if you insist
that a substitution took its place.

176
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,320
I am only reporting

177
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,823
to plant a seed of suspicion
in His Majesty's mind.

178
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,911
Once it takes its roots, it will grow
by absorbing the blood of others.

179
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,082
When the interrogation begins,
they will die whether they confess or not.

180
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,669
From Grand Prince Munseong,
Kim Myung-ha, to Kang Mong-woo.

181
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,172
Even if I interrogate
and execute all the nuisances,

182
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,801
no one would dare try to prove me wrong.

183
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,273
Is there anything else I should know?

184
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,818
Do not leave anything out and tell me.

185
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,155
Jung Je-pyo was granted an audience
with Her Highness by the Queen Dowager.

186
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,741
Bun-yeong had replaced her then.

187
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,120
Jung Je-pyo will not suspect Bun-yeong.

188
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,874
She understands
what is at stake in this matter.

189
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,752
She would not have shown her face
to the Principal Director.

190
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,671
As such,

191
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,717
if the Principal Director
reports that he saw Bun-yeong himself,

192
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,803
he is deceiving you.

193
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,181
Principal Director.

194
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,518
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,021
I am curious.

196
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,192
You said that you confirmed it yourself
at Byeokjegwan earlier today.

197
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,863
Does this mean
that you have seen the Princess,

198
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,906
I mean,

199
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,366
the court maid…

200
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,703
yourself?

201
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,958
I…

202
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,003
have not seen her face myself.

203
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,758
Jung Je-pyo found out
that she was not the Princess

204
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,552
and informed Podan.

205
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,056
How could he confirm that it was not her?

206
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,683
He has never even seen
the Princess's shadow.

207
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,356
Principal Director.

208
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,233
I apologize,

209
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,113
but I do not know
how Jung Je-pyo found out.

210
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,745
I have never heard you say
that you do not know.

211
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,625
I thought you knew the royal family
and the court's matter inside out.

212
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,835
Your Majesty.

213
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,589
How can I know everything?

214
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,675
Then I should summon someone who does.

215
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,635
Is anyone outside?

216
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,392
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

217
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,770
Summon Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

218
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,814
Yes, Your Majesty.

219
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,296
Tell me what you have seen and heard
about Jung Je-pyo.

220
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,218
While you were away from the palace
for your hunting trip,

221
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,095
I witnessed Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo

222
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,639
enter Her Highness's quarters.

223
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,852
I later learned that he received
Her Royal Highness's approval

224
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,520
to greet Her Highness

225
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,356
and present her
with the bridal attire from Prince Rui.

226
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,484
Were you not aware, Principal Director?

227
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,320
I beg your pardon

228
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,074
for my negligence.

229
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,452
Thanks to Gidaeryeong Kang's testimony,

230
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,414
it is now certain that Jung Je-pyo
knows of the Princess's visage,

231
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,916
thus assuaging your suspicion.

232
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,169
Gidaeryeong Kang.

233
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,130
I am truly grateful.

234
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,761
Your Majesty, please excuse…

235
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,928
Stop right there.

236
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,105
If Jung Je-pyo had realized

237
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:50,235
that the Princess was replaced
before Podan did,

238
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,156
he would not have informed Podan.

239
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,953
It would have been his prime opportunity
to impress Prince Rui, whom he serves.

240
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,040
Why would he inform Podan,
a man who serves the Emperor?

241
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,333
Do you not agree?

242
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,420
Your Majesty, forgive me for saying this,

243
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,505
but how shall I know

244
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,383
what Jung Je-pyo is thinking?

245
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,096
I have no choice then.
I will summon him and ask him myself.

246
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,472
Are you outside, Sang-hwa?

247
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,231
Your Majesty, did you call for me?

248
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,484
Head for Gaegyeong immediately
and bring Jung Je-pyo here.

249
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,946
If he refuses to come with you,

250
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,615
convey my message to Podan with respect.

251
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,616
Then…

252
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,868
he will send Jung Je-pyo to me.

253
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,912
Your Majesty.

255
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,915
Please wait.

256
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,834
I shall

257
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,796
answer the question you have asked me.

258
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,298
Please order the others to leave.

259
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,718
You may leave.

260
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,251
As you have trusted me
and confessed everything,

261
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,337
I shall trust you in return…

262
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,386
and not make this an issue.

263
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,020
Your report

264
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,938
is a lie.

265
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,773
It is not a lie.

266
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,153
I am certain of the Grand Prince
and Kim Myung-ha's crimes.

267
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,447
If you do not believe me,

268
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,784
please head to Gaegyeong this instant
and confirm it yourself.

269
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,161
If I head to Gaegyeong

270
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,166
and cause a controversy
that the Princess is an imposter,

271
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,463
I would be giving Prince Rui
a pretext to wage war against us.

272
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,008
It is a necessary sacrifice

273
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,511
to uncover the traitors' crimes.

274
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,098
Those words are utterly appalling!

275
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,645
Are you saying that you do not care
if another war occurs?

276
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,567
Our land will be ravaged
by the Qing cavalry

277
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,029
and our people will bleed to death,
slaughtered by their swords and spears.

278
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,489
Are you saying that is acceptable?

279
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,618
Of course not, Your Majesty.

280
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,789
However, my priority
is to maintain your reign

281
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,000
and punish all traitors.

282
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,794
Let me make this clear.

283
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,962
The Princess…

284
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,132
was not substituted.

285
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,553
I will consider your report unheard.

286
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,681
So do not…

287
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,102
mention this matter ever again.

288
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,438
Even if you silence me,

289
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,691
Prince Rui's ears are open.

290
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,236
If he learns of this incident,

291
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,991
I will assume that you have sent a spy
to Qing to inform him

292
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,328
and have you punished for high treason.

293
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,668
You may leave.

294
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,354
Sixth Royal Secretary.

295
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,814
His Majesty summons you.

296
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,083
Confess your crimes.

297
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,090
Your Majesty.

298
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,886
I am deeply grateful
to be given a chance to confess my crimes.

299
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,305
Captivated by my personal emotions,

300
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,600
I led the Grand Prince and the Princess
down the wrong road,

301
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,644
went against the royal command,

302
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,772
and disturbed the peace
between Joseon and the Qing.

303
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,982
I have also

304
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,860
endangered Your Majesty,
the court, and the people.

305
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,029
Furthermore,

306
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,283
I forsook your generosity
in forgiving my past crimes

307
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,495
and giving me a post at the court again.

308
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,208
My crimes are so great
that I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

309
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,793
You failed to mention a crime.

310
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,842
Despite committing those crimes,

311
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,386
you hid behind Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

312
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,393
I will not deny…

313
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,646
my crimes.

314
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,273
I will suffer whatever punishment,

315
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,066
Your Majesty.

316
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,694
You deserve to be executed
a thousand times over…

317
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:13,160
assuming that the report
of Princess's substitution is true.

318
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,836
As for me,

319
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,797
I have sent the Princess to Prince Rui,

320
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,260
and the peace between Joseon
and Qing is undisturbed.

321
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,720
So I shall not

322
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,389
hold you accountable for it.

323
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,811
Forgive my asking,

324
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,022
but may I assume

325
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,566
that this is your promise

326
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,402
that no harm will come to the Grand Prince

327
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,156
on account of my crimes?

328
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,532
There is no need for a promise.

329
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,658
If you are…

330
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,955
truly concerned about the Grand Prince,

331
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,959
see to it that such an event
never repeats itself.

332
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,169
Do you understand?

333
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,180
I am grateful for your generosity,
Your Majesty.

334
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,288
What is going on at this late hour?

335
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,045
Chief Royal Secretary,
His Majesty calls for you.

336
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,769
Gidaeryeong Kang has gone home.

337
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,656
I will warn you as the Captain
of the Special Firearms Unit.

338
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,324
From this point on,

339
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,787
it would be wise
for you to mind your actions.

340
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,433
I will entrust you with the task.

341
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,937
I shall carry out your order
with utmost sincerity.

342
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,707
Make sure that the word
regarding tonight's event

343
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,625
does not spread anywhere.

344
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,254
I will do my best,
so you will not be worried.

345
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,195
What you saw and heard
in the hall of governance tonight

346
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,947
shall not be shared with anyone.

347
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,576
If you get caught doing so,
your life will be forfeit.

348
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,287
Do not worry.

349
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,082
I will make sure that the palace eunuchs,
adjunct overseers,

350
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,709
and servants of the court
do not speak of this.

351
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,381
What I am worried about
is your life, Eunuch Kim.

352
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,433
Did you think I was unaware of your
correspondence with the Queen Dowager?

353
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,813
Mark my words.

354
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,399
Do you understand?

355
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,694
I understand.

356
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,043
What happened?

357
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,254
The Principal Director has returned home

358
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,423
and His Majesty is still
at the hall of governance.

359
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,424
What about Eunuch Kim?

360
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,218
He only said
it was no different than usual

361
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,095
and that there was nothing to report.

362
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,768
Was the Principal Director's concern
a misunderstanding?

363
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,773
What on earth is going on?

364
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,028
Summon Senior Court Lady Dong.

365
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,363
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

366
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,870
Inform her
that I will not answer her summons.

367
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,039
You must have lost your mind.

368
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,208
How dare you refuse
Her Royal Highness's order?

369
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,341
Mind your words.

370
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,596
I am a court lady who has received
private quarters from His Majesty.

371
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,059
If you know what it means to be grateful,
you should accept her calling.

372
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,525
That is the very reason
why I have refused.

373
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,279
If I get caught by Captain Joo

374
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,532
while taking orders
from Her Royal Highness

375
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,951
and the news reaches His Majesty,

376
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,579
would that not be a bigger problem?

377
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,127
That is the current situation.

378
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,796
Who knows what will happen

379
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,672
in the future?

380
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,475
Convey these words.

381
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,352
I am no longer

382
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,230
the Senior Court Lady Dong

383
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,983
who put her life at risk
for mere words of promise.

384
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,153
If she wishes to use me,

385
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,949
she must give me something in return.

386
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,418
Did that arrogant wench
truly say those words?

387
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,213
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

388
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,601
Your Royal Highness.

389
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,688
It is better
than asking for nothing in return.

390
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,985
I thought she was a fool,

391
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,446
but she just may come in handy.

392
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,205
Your Majesty.

393
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,249
You do not seem well.

394
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,046
Did something happen
in the hall of governance today?

395
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,175
Why do you ask?

396
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,973
Did the Queen Dowager
order you to gauge my mood?

397
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,728
Ordinarily,

398
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,481
you have trouble sleeping
when you are even slightly distressed.

399
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,818
I was only asking out of concern.

400
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,030
You are right.

401
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,533
I do not think
I will get a good night's sleep tonight.

402
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,952
Shall I prepare some warm tea?

403
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,037
Yes.

404
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,853
If Prince Rui learns of this incident,

405
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,650
I will assume that you have sent a spy
to Qing to inform him

406
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,403
and have you punished for high treason.

407
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,283
Kang Mong-woo
must have persuaded His Majesty

408
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,868
to cover up the matter.

409
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,122
I am certain he came up with the idea
to replace the Princess.

410
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,042
Continue to speak.

411
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,920
I shall find evidence

412
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:48,633
that Kang Mong-woo
and Kim Myung-ha joined hands

413
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,093
to plot this incident.

414
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,261
That matter is already in the past.

415
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,556
We need a new crime
to report to His Majesty.

416
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,266
Something like

417
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,979
conspiring against the king, per se.

418
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,858
Please leave it to me,

419
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,236
my lord.

420
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,541
Everything almost fell apart.

421
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,002
However,

422
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,799
the King trusted your words

423
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,593
and covered up the report
from Park Jong-hwan, his own man.

424
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,221
I cannot believe it.

425
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,267
I was lucky that the Principal Director
made a mistake.

426
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,649
They will keep a closer watch
on you and the Sixth Royal Secretary.

427
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,152
From now on,

428
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,030
I will meet him outside in your stead.

429
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,077
Is Her Highness safe and sound?

430
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,249
Se-dong and Jeomine escorted her safely
to the hideout outside the capital.

431
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,625
Upon daybreak,

432
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,794
they will head to Master Choam's house.

433
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,757
Her Highness will head to a place
of the King's choosing.

434
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,844
Where might that be?

435
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,378
I am here to escort Your Highness
upon His Majesty's orders.

436
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,048
Where are you taking me?

437
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,552
His Majesty has specially commanded me
to ensure your well-being.

438
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,056
We are going to a safe place,
so please do not worry.

439
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,005
I have a royal command for you.

440
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,640
Should rumors about Her Highness
spread in the capital,

441
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,102
you can consider your lives forfeit.

442
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,312
Do you understand?

443
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,398
Of course, my lord.

444
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,150
I will not speak a word.

445
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,404
Here, take this.

446
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,407
His Majesty has bestowed this upon you.

447
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,874
All right, let us go.

448
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,137
I am not sure
if we should let her go like this.

449
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,722
What do you mean?

450
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,308
Think about the rumors of poisoning.

451
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,311
I am just worried
for Her Highness's safety.

452
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,855
Come on now. That is just a rumor.

453
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,025
-What?
-And do you not know Lady Hee-soo?

454
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,612
Do you think she would
place Her Highness in danger?

455
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,947
That is true.

456
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,621
-My goodness.
-Are you not coming?

457
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,916
Wait for me!

458
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,251
Wait for me!

459
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,628
Goodness, look!

460
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,340
Your Highness, the gidaeryeong is here.

461
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,230
Greetings, Master.

462
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,733
You look unwell, Your Highness.

463
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,571
He has not slept a wink
crying over the Princess.

464
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,114
That is not true.

465
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,408
Believe me.

466
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,828
Your Highness.

467
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,789
I really did not cry because of that.

468
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,211
Here comes His Majesty!

469
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,470
Your Majesty.

470
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:51,018
I was hoping to play baduk with you
instead of the gidaeryeong.

471
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,813
What do you say, Grand Prince?

472
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,196
It would be my honor.

473
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,790
You do not have to follow us.

474
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,709
Return to your post and await my orders.

475
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,129
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,271
You have improved very much.

477
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,025
I merely followed
the teachings of the gidaeryeong.

478
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,279
What do you think is the duty of the king?

479
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,701
It is to govern his people well.

480
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,202
You are right.

481
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,332
It is to help them live
without any concerns.

482
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,709
To that end,

483
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,170
what should one be wary of?

484
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,007
One should be wary of a war.

485
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,550
Correct.

486
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,678
Preventing war ahead of time.

487
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,806
That is the king's most important duty.

488
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,225
It is because the people suffer

489
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,479
even if the nation wins the war.

490
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,149
Do you understand

491
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,944
why I am telling you this?

492
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,076
My sister is not at fault.

493
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,536
I plotted everything.

494
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,878
Did sending the Princess to the Qing
make you feel wronged and resentful?

495
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,216
The fact that I had no power to help her
when she had been my devoted caretaker

496
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,052
agonized me

497
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,263
and made me feel terrible.

498
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,897
Do you think…

499
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,568
I would not understand
the agony that you two feel?

500
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,656
She told me

501
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,326
that you were once taken
as the Qing's captive

502
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,913
on behalf of my late father.

503
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,334
That was why my heart ached even more

504
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,629
as I knew I was deceiving you.

505
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,386
I am glad you have learned a lesson.

506
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,140
Mark this incident in your heart

507
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,268
and do not ever forget it.

508
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,438
Yes, Your Majesty.

509
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,064
I will keep your words in mind.

510
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,658
Your Majesty, shall I escort you
back to your quarters?

511
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,496
Your Majesty.

512
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,665
Shall we head to Yeongchwijeong?

513
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,998
Please tell me
where you have taken Her Highness.

514
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,625
I do not know what you are saying.

515
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,709
My lord.

516
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,213
Do you wish to be executed?

517
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,509
Do not ask and do not seek to know.

518
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,178
It is His Majesty's orders.

519
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,645
It seems you have absolutely no trust
in His Majesty.

520
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,820
Why do you think
His Majesty gave you, a traitor's son,

521
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,322
a position at the court

522
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,783
despite the objection
from the Principal Director?

523
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,411
I do not know.

524
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,373
Do you?

525
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,544
It was because you risked
the court's disapproval

526
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,504
to stand by the people

527
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:33,926
despite the precarious position
that you were in yourself.

528
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,431
I must dare to say

529
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,685
that I find your words hard to believe.

530
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,730
You simply do not wish to believe them.

531
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,214
The Principal Director has summoned you.

532
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,011
Where is he?

533
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,376
I appreciate your assistance
earlier at the hall of governance.

534
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,213
I almost committed a serious crime
against His Majesty,

535
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,133
but I averted it thanks to you.

536
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,302
I am flattered.

537
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,471
Only a few seemed to know
that you are the baduk gambler

538
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,181
from three years ago.

539
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,892
It is not something to boast about.

540
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,312
I was going to spare your life back then,

541
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,522
but His Majesty insisted otherwise.

542
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,071
He said you were a necessary sacrifice
for his ascension to the throne.

543
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,242
He is quite impressive
but at the same time, terrifying.

544
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,043
For what reason are you telling me this?

545
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,715
Do you know Lord Kang Hang-soon
by any chance?

546
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,263
Though His Majesty
regarded him as his master,

547
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,431
even he was abandoned.

548
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,142
The same applies to you.

549
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,310
His Majesty is someone

550
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,022
who easily abandons his subjects
after taking advantage of their loyalty.

551
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,607
Do not forget that.

552
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,042
Watch where you are going.

553
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,912
They are there, just not noticeable.

554
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,247
Look closely.

555
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,833
Ten steps away. Now, fifty steps away.

556
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,710
Now, 100 steps away.

557
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,962
My men are on duty
while keeping their distance.

558
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,547
You should be careful.

559
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,469
What had you so deep in thought
that you did not notice me following you?

560
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,984
Tell me about Bun-yeong.

561
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,197
She lost her parents during the war

562
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,033
and was raised by her stepparents
before entering the palace.

563
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,370
As she is bright and respectful,

564
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,914
she will easily adapt
to the Qing royal family.

565
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,125
I made arrangements to have the Princess
looked after while in Beijing.

566
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,252
The caretaker

567
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,380
will look after Bun-yeong as well.

568
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,758
Is that person trustworthy?

569
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,556
I trust them more than myself.

570
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,189
The king should be protecting his people,
but the people are protecting the king.

571
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,817
I am reminded again

572
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,571
that a nation and its king
cannot exist without the people.

573
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,327
I thought you were angry at me.

574
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,706
I am indeed angry.

575
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,292
However, my anger is not directed at you…

576
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,837
but at myself.

577
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,050
I repeatedly pondered over your words
that you helped the Princess

578
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,344
because of the pain you suffered
three years ago.

579
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,472
Not only did I make you suffer
despite your innocence,

580
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,933
but I also made you suffer
the same pain again.

581
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,813
I could not hold back the anger
I felt toward myself.

582
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,192
Your Majesty.

583
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,737
Are you implying

584
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,742
that you believe my words
that I did not falsely attest back then?

585
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,244
Did you not say three years ago

586
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,496
that you had not given
any attestations about me,

587
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,916
be it true or false?

588
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,917
I have never…

589
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,213
doubted those words.

590
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,884
But why did you…

591
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,512
A king

592
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,265
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

593
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,311
He keeps no such thing as friends.

594
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,815
He said you were a necessary sacrifice
for his ascension to the throne.

595
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,403
He is quite impressive
but at the same time, terrifying.

596
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,454
I do not know what to think of your words.

597
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,125
In this moment,

598
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,463
I sit before you

599
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:30,050
as an ordinary man who loves a woman
and not as the king of this nation.

600
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,682
I have made you suffer

601
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,643
and I understand
that pain is still lingering.

602
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,686
I know…

603
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,231
that you have returned to me

604
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,526
because of that very pain.

605
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,737
I hope…

606
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:58,286
a day will come when I can tell you
about all the past events in honesty.

607
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,082
But in the end,
what I offer would only be excuses.

608
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,336
I am aware that I do not deserve

609
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,213
your forgiveness.

610
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,139
What do you wish to hear from me?

611
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,062
I will be the king
until the end of my days.

612
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:29,317
I cannot dare to neglect this great duty
that I must uphold.

613
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,235
That is why…

614
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,075
I may end up

615
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,411
causing you

616
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,705
pain again.

617
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,254
Do you still wish to stay by my side?

618
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,348
I will wait patiently
and not press for your answer.

619
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,309
When you have made up your mind,

620
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,187
come to Yeongchwijeong.

621
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,136
Since when have you been tailing me?

622
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,683
I went to escort you home
as I was worried.

623
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,820
Mong-woo.

624
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,494
It looked like you had been swaying
since that day.

625
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,083
I have misread the situation, have I not?

626
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,713
-My lady.
-I cannot believe

627
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,089
that I am thinking this way.

628
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,843
But I wonder

629
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,139
if the King perhaps
has his reasons I am not aware of.

630
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,020
You are well aware
that it is the King's tactic.

631
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,732
I trusted the King once,
but I was sold to the Qing.

632
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,609
Your father was taken
to the Qing in his stead

633
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,777
as he was also deceived by such tactics.

634
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,697
How are you so certain

635
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,408
that it was the King
who sold you off back then?

636
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,579
The Qing official
who plucked my eye out kindly told me.

637
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,749
He said if I confessed
my visitation to the Ming,

638
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,169
the Qing Emperor
would summon the late king

639
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,548
and have his brother, Grand Prince Jinhan,
ascend the throne.

640
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,011
Those were the Qing Emperor's words.

641
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,680
That does not prove
that the King was the spy then.

642
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,353
Then how about this?

643
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,607
The King executed Lord Kim Jong-bae,
who accused him as a spy

644
00:53:56,107 --> 00:54:00,654
and punished you for false attestation
and silenced the spy incident.

645
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,991
The person who rose to the highest place
from the most dangerous one.

646
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,745
That person must be the spy.

647
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,748
Am I wrong?

648
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,920
Seeing as you cannot answer,

649
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,339
I shall have my way.

650
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,592
If you assassinate the King,

651
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,304
Principal Director Park
will choose a king to his taste

652
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,016
and the plans we seek to achieve
will not be able to see light.

653
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,602
Is that the kind of revenge

654
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,230
you seek?

655
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,525
The kind of revenge I seek

656
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,319
is the death of my sworn enemy.

657
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,410
I will let you know when it is time.

658
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,413
You can have your way then.

659
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,336
Can I believe in your words?

660
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,215
Have I ever forsaken a promise?

661
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,681
A word from Master Choam
arrived this afternoon.

662
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,435
He received an official appointment letter
as the Inspector General.

663
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,187
He will arrive at the capital at daybreak.

664
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,209
Greetings, Your Majesty.

665
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,503
Kim Je-nam at your service.

666
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,131
Welcome.

667
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,050
Now that I see you in court,

668
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,971
I cannot contain my joy.

669
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:54,434
I promise to do my utmost
to advise you to the best of my ability

670
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,436
and combat the evils of the court

671
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,982
to establish discipline and order.

672
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,570
From this point on,
I will see through your eyes,

673
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,697
listen through your ears,

674
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:12,660
and engrave every word of your advice

675
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,246
deep in my heart.

676
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,390
Why does it have to be Kim Je-nam?

677
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,435
If he needed someone
who lived a secluded life,

678
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,313
I am sure you could have recommended
other more suitable talents.

679
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,941
His Majesty appointed him to his post

680
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,110
without asking for
the court's recommendations.

681
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,364
Who could dare to oppose him?

682
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,283
Please do not be so concerned.

683
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,412
As he is a stickler for integrity,
he has no faction to speak of

684
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,748
and would not even consider forming one.

685
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,335
He will seek a dismissal soon enough.

686
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,337
What about Princess Jangryeong's incident?

687
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,091
Are you planning

688
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,137
to let this pass by
without telling me anything?

689
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,182
The matters I do not inform you of

690
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,768
are matters you do not need to know.

691
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,896
To maintain the bond
between you and His Majesty

692
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,690
as a mother and son,

693
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,151
that is for the best.

694
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,824
Now,

695
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,870
the only remaining task
is to find a spouse for the Grand Prince.

696
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,788
I have already found an ideal partner.

697
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,915
I will have them greet you soon.

698
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,960
I think we should look for
a new queen as well.

699
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,256
Is the Queen's illness

700
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,134
that serious?

701
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,927
For the past few days,

702
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,847
she has not even come to greet me.

703
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,158
Your Majesty!

704
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,451
Are you all right?

705
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,038
Your Majesty!

706
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,969
Your Majesty.

707
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,515
I will visit more often.

708
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,310
Please recover soon.

709
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,494
Your Majesty, the gidaeryeong is here.

710
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,831
Your Majesty, have you summoned me?

711
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,459
Gidaeryeong Kang.

712
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,591
Are you startled to see
how weak my illness has made me?

713
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,846
I was planning to see you
after recovering,

714
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,060
but I have summoned you
as I do not think I can recover.

715
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,897
Your Majesty.

716
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,820
Grand Prince Munseong

717
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,073
visits me several times a day.

718
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:41,828
He tries his best
to put on a smile to console me,

719
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,415
but the apparent loneliness
in his young face

720
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,960
makes my heart ache for him.

721
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,549
Before I die,

722
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,677
I wish to be of support
to the Grand Prince.

723
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,097
Is there any way I could?

724
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,939
There is a way,

725
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,734
but it is difficult to achieve.

726
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:17,739
Moreover, if things go wrong,
you and the Grand Prince may be in danger.

727
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,908
As such, I am hesitant to share this.

728
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,537
Please do not hesitate and tell me.

729
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,291
If it is within my power, I will do it.

730
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,179
The only way to protect His Highness…

731
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,522
is to have him appointed
as the Crown Prince.

732
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,072
If he fails to become one,

733
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,450
he will…

734
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,829
leave this world before you do,
Your Majesty.

735
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,193
My lady.

736
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,570
It is late.

737
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,740
You should come in.

738
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:47,912
Jageunnyeon.

739
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,747
Yes, my lady.

740
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,459
As Master Choam has arrived,

741
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,337
we should go on an outing.

742
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,257
An outing?

743
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:22,864
Master Choam.

744
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,574
Welcome.

745
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,159
Give us a minute.

746
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,179
Can you take back a move?

747
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,430
Please give up.

748
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,517
Taking back one move
will not win you the game.

749
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:55,980
I lose.

750
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,815
Do not be disappointed.

751
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,569
You have improved very much.

752
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:02,987
Is that so?

753
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,329
All right. I should get going then.

754
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,081
Already?

755
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,082
But Master Choam.

756
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,877
I thought you returned
to aid Lady Hee-soo.

757
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,629
That was my intention

758
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,840
until His Majesty
appointed me Inspector General.

759
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,263
I cannot join hands with you.

760
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:33,392
You are well aware
that I do not possess the talent

761
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,979
of working for different parties
simultaneously.

762
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,532
You seem composed

763
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,827
as if you had already known

764
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,954
that I would back out.

765
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,165
I considered the possibility

766
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,294
upon hearing the news
that you were appointed Inspector General.

767
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,339
This is why I can never beat you.

768
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:11,138
As you have met the King,
may I ask your opinion on him?

769
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,981
I think you would know him better than me.

770
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,525
Please tell me.

771
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,444
He seemed more resolute

772
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,905
than I had thought,

773
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,200
but softer than you think.

774
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,704
What do you mean?

775
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,917
I expected him to be a mere puppet
of Principal Director Park Jong-hwan.

776
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,712
But I do not think that is the case.

777
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,840
For a tyrant who supposedly
succumbed to temptations

778
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,717
and stole his young nephew's throne,

779
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,137
his eyes seemed far too clear.

780
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,265
In any case,

781
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,975
whether I live or die,

782
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,645
I want to know
what kind of man His Majesty is.

783
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:16,037
I was joyful
that he became the Inspector General.

784
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,165
I did not expect him to act thusly.

785
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,292
What will you do now?

786
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,294
We do not have the power
to dethrone the King,

787
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,421
and the Grand Prince is still at risk.

788
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,633
Do not worry.

789
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,136
Before the year passes,

790
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,056
His Highness
will be appointed Crown Prince.

791
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,224
What do you mean?

792
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,728
Regardless of the King's reason
behind Master Choam's appointment,

793
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:42,855
his appointment alone is enough

794
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,191
to intimidate
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan.

795
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,652
When he seeks to claim all the power

796
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:51,405
he has so far shared with the Great Lord
and the Minister of War,

797
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,367
that moment

798
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,203
will be our window of opportunity.

799
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,230
What do you wish to hear from me?

800
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,274
I will be the king
until the end of my day.

801
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,278
I cannot dare to neglect this great duty

802
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,739
that I must uphold.

803
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,657
That is why…

804
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,660
I may end up

805
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,204
causing you

806
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,415
pain again.

807
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,003
Do you still wish to stay by my side?

808
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,618
Your Majesty.

809
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,288
I am here to answer your question.

810
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,767
I will endure any sufferings
that may follow.

811
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,105
I will stay by your side.

812
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,528
Your Majesty!

813
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,946
There is trouble.

814
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,157
Lightning struck the palace
and started a fire.

815
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,662
Where?

816
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,123
Where did the fire start?

817
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:02,132
CAPTIVATING THE KING

818
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,345
You know who poisoned
my brother to death, do you not?

819
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,430
I will have the two wings
the Principal Director abandoned

820
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,432
become Grand Prince Munseong's wings

821
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,894
and have him become the Crown Prince,
His Majesty's heir.

822
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,730
That can only happen

823
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,357
over my dead body.

824
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,109
The appointment of the Crown Prince

825
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:24,071
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

826
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,950
Let the King enter first
and come in a moment later.

827
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,369
I am clueless

828
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:33,289
as to what to do with my feelings.

829
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:38,210
