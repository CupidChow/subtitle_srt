1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,298
TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED
SINCE THE QING INVADED JOSEON.

3
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,968
THE PEOPLE FOUGHT BACK BUT TO NO AVAIL.

4
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,555
THE QING DEMANDED THAT JOSEON
CUT TIES WITH THE MING

5
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,016
AND DECLARE THE QING AS THEIR ALLY.

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,397
EPISODE 1

7
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,015
Your Highness.

8
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,227
Shall I ask
if there are more surviving militia?

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,480
Someone is coming!

10
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,902
Your Highness.

11
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,612
We have jeongyo from the capital.

12
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,697
JEONGYO: A ROYAL COMMAND

13
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,759
What is His Majesty's order,
Your Highness?

14
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,439
We are to stop recruiting militia for war

15
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,900
and return.

16
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,779
What does that mean?

17
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,867
It seems His Majesty
has decided to surrender.

18
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,534
Let us go.

19
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,620
Get up.

20
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,961
"King of Joseon."

21
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,924
"As you have shown remorse for your wrongs
and requested to pledge your allegiance,

22
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,761
I will forgive all the sins
you have committed thus far

23
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,555
and establish rules

24
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,892
for you to faithfully adhere to
for generations as my subject."

25
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,521
"Relinquish the royal patent
and the seal issued by the Ming,

26
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,190
sever your allegiance to the Ming,

27
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,775
discard their era name,

28
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:24,073
and use the Qing's almanac
in all your official documents."

29
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,951
"Moreover,

30
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,663
as you do not have a firstborn son yet,

31
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,999
your younger brother

32
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,710
shall be held hostage."

33
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,339
"If in any case,

34
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,635
an unexpected event befalls you,

35
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,973
the hostage that I have taken…

36
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,976
will inherit

37
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,189
the throne."

38
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,084
Your Majesty.

39
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,126
Unfortunately,

40
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,545
Her Royal Highness is with the
Principal Director of the Privy Council.

41
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,756
I see.

42
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,802
Is Her Royal Highness

43
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,137
distressed by what is to happen
to Grand Prince Jinhan?

44
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,848
She did not express it to me,
Your Majesty.

45
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,520
I will be back tomorrow.

46
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,991
The King's sins

47
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,245
will now cost my son's life.

48
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,747
Your Royal Highness.

49
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,958
I understand your deep distress,

50
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,835
but how could you say the King sinned?

51
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,587
I am afraid others might hear.

52
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,673
That is the point!

53
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,716
Must I walk on eggshells around the King

54
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,261
when Grand Prince Jinhan
is about to be taken away?

55
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,595
Please calm down!

56
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,640
Do you want to get him in trouble

57
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,600
even before he is taken away by the Qing?

58
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,609
Where is the Grand Prince?

59
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,948
My lack of insight

60
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,743
and failure to deny my court's request

61
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,788
that I stay loyal to the former ally
and keep the Qing at bay

62
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,333
has brought on the current crisis.

63
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,793
Your Majesty,

64
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,171
please do not blame yourself.

65
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,173
Your decision then

66
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,924
only came from your wish

67
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,719
to do what is best
for the people and the nation.

68
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,557
It feels as if the clamor of people
condemning and cursing me

69
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,101
can almost reach the palace.

70
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,106
I cannot bear this excruciating agony.

71
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,444
You, too, must resent me.

72
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,197
The only thing I bear

73
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,952
is the sin of failing
to support you, Your Majesty.

74
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,206
I do not bear any resentment.

75
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,459
Even though I am handing you over to them
without a proper fight?

76
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,377
Being taken by the Qing

77
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,756
is my duty as your kin

78
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,382
to serve

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,677
you and the nation.

80
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,000
Grand Prince Jinhan.

81
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,921
Yes, Your Majesty. Please speak.

82
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,800
You may raise your head.

83
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,853
Survive and return at all costs.

84
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,024
I will not forgive you

85
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,403
if you do not abide by this order.

86
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,487
Do you understand?

87
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,034
I will keep that in mind, Your Majesty.

88
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,206
Call me your brother.

89
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,085
Like you used to when you were young.

90
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,589
I want to hear you say it.

91
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,263
Brother.

92
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,396
That is right.

93
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,234
I am your only elder brother,

94
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,071
and you are my only younger brother.

95
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,035
Your injuries are my injuries.

96
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,789
So please return home safely.

97
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,337
Yes, Brother.

98
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,596
This is a relief.

99
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,059
I was concerned that the Queen Dowager
would refuse to send the Grand Prince

100
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,185
and be unreasonable.

101
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,354
Not even the Queen Dowager

102
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,732
can possibly go against
the Qing Emperor's orders.

103
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,651
Without the Grand Prince,

104
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,737
the proud Queen Dowager
and Park Jong-hwan's Faction

105
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,781
will be discouraged.

106
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,366
They say a crisis is an opportunity.

107
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,659
The time has come

108
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,328
for our family
to take control of the court.

109
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,747
Your Majesty.

110
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,084
You must produce an heir to His Majesty

111
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,920
as soon as possible.

112
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,269
Your Highness.

113
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,401
Master.

114
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,946
Please take good care of my brother
until I return.

115
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,200
That is my life's duty, so do not worry.

116
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,162
How do you feel?

117
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,377
If you are asking whether I am afraid
of being taken by the Qing,

118
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,382
then yes, I am afraid.

119
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,176
However,

120
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,888
my anticipation supersedes my fear.

121
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,102
I wish to learn
how the Qing, once a small nation,

122
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,897
rose to power to threaten the Ming Empire

123
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,026
and even claim the Chinese mainland.

124
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,155
Once we finally learn about them,

125
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,118
we may be able to find a way
to triumph over them.

126
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,875
This reminds me of the time
when I first met you, Your Highness.

127
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,045
Even at your tender age,

128
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,132
you were never easily discouraged.

129
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,511
Was I?

130
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,764
Your Highness.

131
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,434
Please…

132
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,978
stay safe.

133
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,319
Do not worry about me.

134
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,282
I will send word
as soon as I arrive in Shenyang.

135
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,061
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

136
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,979
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

137
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,024
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

138
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,486
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

139
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,780
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

140
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,740
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

141
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,494
Your Highness!

142
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,584
Your Highness!

143
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,308
You wish to return to your hometown?

144
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,394
What do you mean?

145
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,981
Do not tell me you consider
surrendering to the outlanders

146
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,608
too great a shame to hold public office.

147
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,860
There is no shame in surrendering.

148
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,573
However, we failed to surrender
before their slaughter began.

149
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,034
What shames me to no end
is that I have failed to prevent a war

150
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,036
that need not have happened.

151
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,497
The court needs

152
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,250
someone like you more than ever.

153
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,711
Please reconsider your decision

154
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,046
for the King and this nation.

155
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,757
I am also torn.

156
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,134
However,

157
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,345
I cannot stand the power struggle
among the Queens' families

158
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,806
when the nation is still in dire straits.

159
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,183
It is unbearable for me.

160
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,694
-Faster!
-Faster!

161
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,070
Faster!

162
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,864
Hurry up!

163
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,533
Come on.

164
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Go faster!

165
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,038
Come on!

166
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,956
Faster!

167
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,917
Faster!

168
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,426
Get up!

169
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,387
On your feet!

170
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,931
Stand up!

171
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,641
Stop this moment!

172
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,434
You bastards!

173
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,228
Let him do what he wants.

174
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,607
We need him in one piece.

175
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,739
Hey.

176
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,908
Are you okay?

177
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,495
-Wake up.
-He is already gone.

178
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,208
Get rid of the body.

179
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,125
Yes, sir.

180
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,391
Interpreter Jung!

181
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,479
I must see General Ma immediately.

182
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,773
General Ma is busy.

183
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,817
You can speak to me.

184
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,114
We may be captives and hostages,

185
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,742
but walking tens of li
without any rest is too much.

186
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,911
If this continues,

187
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,206
no one will survive this.

188
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,124
Your Highness,

189
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,378
it seems you are deeply mistaken
about the situation.

190
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,839
This war

191
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,758
was not caused
by the loutish foreign intruders.

192
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,805
Your foolish and incompetent King
and his court brought it on themselves.

193
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,142
The horrific deaths met by Joseon's people

194
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,895
and the cruel treatment
suffered by the captives

195
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,649
are solely on Joseon's King and its court.

196
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,029
However, you make it sound like

197
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,156
the Great Qing is to blame.

198
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,452
I cannot tell if you are shameless

199
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,787
or thoughtless.

200
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,374
I have been the Great Qing's loyal subject
for many years now,

201
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,251
but I cannot hold my head high

202
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,962
from the shame
of being formerly of Joseon.

203
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,468
You are not a guest
but a hostage of the Great Qing.

204
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,596
So act like one.

205
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,599
Do you understand?

206
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,937
-Move it!
-Hurry!

207
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,565
-Go faster!
-Go!

208
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,203
SHENYANG, THE GREAT QING

209
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,163
Master,

210
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,208
I am sending you word
as I have safely reached Shenyang.

211
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,796
Recently, I have been playing baduk
almost daily with Prince Rui,

212
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,215
the Qing Emperor's favorite brother.

213
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,969
I have come to see the value
of being a good baduk player

214
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,930
here in the Qing.

215
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,850
While playing a match
with Prince Rui yesterday,

216
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,853
I spoke to him about the ransom
for our people in captivity.

217
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,109
Your letter reached me safely,
Your Highness.

218
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,071
Next time, do not send it
along with official reports.

219
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,825
I will send a messenger from my end.

220
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,579
Master, I send this letter with good news.

221
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,082
Prince Rui pleaded with the Emperor

222
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,085
and earned his promise
not to raise the ransom anymore.

223
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:53,132
To wish for your
and the captives' safe return,

224
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,552
His Majesty handpicked a peach tree

225
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,637
and had it planted in the Royal Garden.

226
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,599
He even gave a royal command
to the Sixth Royal Secretary

227
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,270
to take care of the tree
as if it were you, Your Highness.

228
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,116
Master,

229
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,952
I cannot fully express my joy

230
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,996
at the news of the birth
of the Prince Royal.

231
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,039
Just as the court had predicted,

232
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,334
the Emperor demanded the Prince Royal
be sent to the Qing as a hostage,

233
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,171
but Prince Rui mediated
and prevented it from happening.

234
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,383
In return, I am to travel far
to fight in a battle with Prince Rui.

235
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,386
Thus, I will not be able
to send word for a while.

236
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,022
Sang-hwa!

237
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,483
-Sang-hwa!
-Yes, Your Highness.

238
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,902
There you are.

239
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,701
-Come here.
-Master.

240
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,330
Prince Rui has finally approved my return.

241
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,248
My heart's desire

242
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,044
to play baduk with my brother
under the peach tree within the year

243
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,879
-is finally coming true.
-You brat!

244
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,881
Why are you so heavy?

245
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,424
Goodness.

246
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,555
His Highness has returned!

247
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,157
Your Highness.

248
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,870
I am afraid His Majesty has yet to approve
your entrance to the palace.

249
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,415
I must ask you to wait here.

250
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,551
All right.

251
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,512
Your Majesty.

252
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,892
We cannot keep
Grand Prince Jinhan standing outside.

253
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,771
Please let him enter the palace,
so he can greet you.

254
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,732
No, Your Majesty.

255
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,276
He is said to have brought
the Emperor's gifts

256
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,944
he earned with Prince Rui's help.

257
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,822
If you let him enter,

258
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,324
you will have to kneel before him,

259
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,618
bow, and accept the Emperor's gift.

260
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,501
"If in any case,
an unexpected event befalls you,

261
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,588
the hostage that I have taken

262
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,468
will inherit the throne."

263
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,180
Your Majesty,

264
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,391
it is true that he has received gifts
from Prince Rui.

265
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,727
-However--
-However what?

266
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,522
The gifts are not objects.

267
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,150
They are our people
who were taken away during the war.

268
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,568
Grand Prince Jinhan

269
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,571
declined the gifts
the Emperor bestowed on him

270
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,283
and pleaded that his people
be let go instead.

271
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,373
Proving himself
a benevolent prince, I see.

272
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,313
Your Highness.

273
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,065
Shall I bring some water?

274
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,442
No. I will have some
after I see His Majesty.

275
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,862
Yes, Your Highness.

276
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,991
Chief State Councilor.

277
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,577
Grand Prince Jinhan is not a criminal.

278
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,497
How can you just stand there

279
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,499
and watch the King treat him so poorly?

280
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,960
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

281
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,711
Stop repeating your apology,

282
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,131
and answer me with a solution!

283
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,924
Your Royal Highness.

284
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,300
Please calm down.

285
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,762
What on earth were you doing
to show up so late, Principal Director?

286
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,472
I came here after seeing

287
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,183
the Grand Prince enter
the hall of governance.

288
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,604
That is more like it.

289
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,693
I have heard that
you were Prince Rui's favorite.

290
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,613
Perhaps that is why you look so fine.

291
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,118
I hope things have been
good for you too, Brother.

292
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,161
Shut your mouth.

293
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,457
Do not call me your brother.

294
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,420
I am the King of the nation
before I am your brother.

295
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,132
The strict hierarchy
between the king and his subjects

296
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,884
shall not be flouted by the likes of you.

297
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,887
Do you understand?

298
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,849
Yes, Your Majesty.

299
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,143
I will keep that in mind.

300
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,825
Your Highness.

301
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,203
It has been a while.

302
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,999
My brother…

303
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,084
No.

304
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,753
His Majesty

305
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,547
does not seem well.

306
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,759
It has not been long
since I received your last letter.

307
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,303
Would you care to explain?

308
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,141
-Your Highness.
-Chief State Councilor.

309
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,484
I must speak to you urgently.

310
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,194
What is it?

311
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,906
I was conversing with His Highness.

312
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,244
It is a confidential matter
regarding His Majesty and the government.

313
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,960
My apologies, Your Highness.

314
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,921
I will send you word soon.

315
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,925
We shall meet then
and catch up on everything.

316
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,178
Understood. Let us do that.

317
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,858
Let us go, my lord.

318
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,328
Chief State Councilor.

319
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,955
What do you think of my nephew, Myung-ha,

320
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,583
as your prospective son-in-law?

321
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,797
His standards were too high,
so he missed his window to get married.

322
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,302
I hear your daughter
is at the prime age of marriage.

323
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,471
What do you think?

324
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,057
If our families become one
through their marriage,

325
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,519
the Prince Royal would feel reassured
as if he gained the world.

326
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,355
Do you not agree?

327
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,236
Your Majesty.

328
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,614
Marriage is the event of a lifetime.

329
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,909
How come you demand his decision
on the spot?

330
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,829
Please do not press
the Chief State Councilor.

331
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,540
That was not my intent…

332
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,758
Then please consider my offer
and do let me know.

333
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,556
I will do that, Your Majesty.

334
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,154
Did I act too rashly and botch the matter?

335
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,740
Lord Kang's attitude
would not have changed

336
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,202
even if you had acted differently.

337
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,495
This is all because

338
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,582
Grand Prince Jinhan
did not die and returned alive.

339
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,543
On the bright side,

340
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,296
His Majesty has realized
the true nature of the Grand Prince

341
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,133
and has thus become wary of him.

342
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,138
His Majesty's symptoms
are worsening by the day,

343
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,641
but he will not let us speak
of the appointment of the Crown Prince.

344
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,018
That is what concerns me the most.

345
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,062
If he passes away all of a sudden,

346
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,605
what do we do then?

347
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,858
Before that happens,

348
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,154
I shall secure the appointment
of the Prince Royal as the Crown Prince.

349
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,072
Please do not be concerned.

350
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,492
How dare the King treat him like a traitor

351
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,036
when he should be showered with rewards?

352
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,582
I cannot hold this anger!

353
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,043
Uncle, please tell me what happened.

354
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,129
Kim Jong-bae filed a petition
not so long ago

355
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,716
to urge His Majesty to appoint
the Prince Royal as the Crown Prince.

356
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,553
But that only angered His Majesty
and turned the court upside down.

357
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,014
Ever since then,
Kim Jong-bae has been defaming you

358
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,310
to make up for his blunder.

359
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,397
What kind of defamation?

360
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,150
There have been rumors
in and out of the capital

361
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,069
that you have been serving
Prince Rui as his spy

362
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,947
in desire of the throne.

363
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,534
I hope you have measures to protect him.

364
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,994
Right.

365
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,622
The northwestern region
is brimming with furious tigers.

366
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,540
How about we evacuate him to safety

367
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,335
under the pretense
of a tiger hunting trip?

368
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,004
He must not leave the capital.

369
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,672
The King and Kim Jong-bae

370
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,925
will view such a move
as an attempt to plot a treason.

371
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,927
And they will use it as a pretext

372
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,889
to eliminate the Grand Prince
as well as anyone who follows him.

373
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,517
Then what do you propose?

374
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,769
For now,

375
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,607
it is best to lie low
to avoid drawing their attention.

376
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,164
Your Majesty.

377
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,334
Her Royal Highness
has sent herbal medicine.

378
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,365
Do not come by to greet me.

379
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,118
Seeing you disgusts me,

380
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,870
worsening my illness.

381
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,498
Do not greet the Queen Dowager either.

382
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,167
You are to stay out of the palace
until I order you to.

383
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,293
Do you understand?

384
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,049
Yes, Your Majesty.

385
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,363
The Grand Prince
must be treated with warm hospitality.

386
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,865
Have you made all the preparations?

387
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,702
Of course.

388
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,578
I have prepared thoroughly,

389
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,871
so do not worry.

390
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,710
You must be on your toes at all times.

391
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,962
Yes, my lord.

392
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,427
Bring me more alcohol.

393
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,108
Why are you empty-handed
when I asked for more alcohol?

394
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,195
I brought something better.

395
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,623
Do you know who I am?

396
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,833
No, I do not.

397
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,003
But I can get to know you starting now.

398
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,464
You could die
should you get to know me better.

399
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,675
Please kill me then.

400
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,595
It is my greatest wish.

401
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,394
My lord.

402
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,106
You should not treat a lady
in such a crude manner.

403
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,275
You must go slower,
especially when you are feeling impatient

404
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,069
to get my heart racing

405
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,780
and tease me
with a thrill of anticipation.

406
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,573
I do not know of such ways.

407
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,830
Try reciting a line from a poem you favor.

408
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,975
My lord.

409
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,769
What do those lines mean?

410
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,110
To wish for life when you love them…

411
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,366
and death when you hate them.

412
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,164
Wishing them to live
while wishing them to die.

413
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,085
Such paradox of fickleness.

414
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,258
That is what it means to be captivated.

415
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,219
My lord.

416
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,186
My lord.

417
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,395
Where are you going?

418
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,147
Did I do something wrong?

419
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,481
It is not your fault.

420
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,027
I just had a change of heart.

421
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,113
My lord!

422
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,826
-My lord.
-Come to me.

423
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,608
Tail him.

424
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,330
He could not have gone far.
Spread out and find him!

425
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,331
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

426
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,176
Shall I scare them off
so they will not dare to tail you again?

427
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,261
There is no need.

428
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,723
Let us not cause a ruckus.

429
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,675
Please get up.

430
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,802
You should not sleep here.

431
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,472
Are you afraid someone might see?

432
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,390
If I may be so bold,

433
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:16,145
I do not understand
why you are feigning to be a carefree rake

434
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,063
which you are not.

435
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,066
You must be disgusted by me.

436
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,319
Just let it slide.

437
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,988
I am only trying to survive.

438
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,700
Please wait here.

439
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,035
I shall bring a horse.

440
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,081
Goodness.

441
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,835
Gosh. Who would have thought of that?

442
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,920
How did he see that?

443
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,505
That was some move.

444
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,345
Look at that play.

445
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,013
How come I did not see it?

446
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,599
I knew that stone would be placed there.

447
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:40,104
I wonder what he will do next
given he has lost all his major chains.

448
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,648
He must find a way out of this.

449
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,191
That was plain useless.

450
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,026
Even I could say as much.

451
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,570
As if you know much about baduk!

452
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,405
-What?
-How silly of you.

453
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,614
Be quiet.

454
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:56,996
Wait!

455
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,876
Darn it!

456
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,420
I cannot focus
with all this noise around me.

457
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,589
My lord.

458
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:10,134
Were you placing the stone on the board
or throwing it?

459
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,052
The latter. I lose.

460
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,348
-You should keep playing.
-No need.

461
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,601
What is the point
when I have no more plays?

462
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,270
Then as you have promised,

463
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,482
I shall take the table and the stones.

464
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,276
Unbelievable.

465
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,697
Goodness.

466
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,576
Wait.

467
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,037
Let us play another game tomorrow.

468
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,498
Say the word,
and I will grant you anything you want.

469
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,501
Respectfully, I must decline.

470
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,710
But why?

471
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,838
I love to win,

472
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,300
but I cannot put up with boredom.

473
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,224
Not against me,
but a gigaek who can beat you.

474
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,934
GIGAEK: A PROFESSIONAL BADUK PLAYER

475
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,935
My lord.

476
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,147
There is no player who can beat me
within a ten-li radius of the capital.

477
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,608
Except for one, that is.

478
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,944
And who is that?

479
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,240
Grand Prince Jinhan,
who returned from Shenyang recently.

480
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,034
If I could get the chance,

481
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,912
I would like to play against him.

482
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,622
Forget it.

483
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:26,085
He was indeed once praised
as a master of baduk,

484
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,753
but that was a long time ago.

485
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,672
He is right.

486
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:35,052
Do not forget the awful rumor
going around in the capital lately.

487
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,222
The rumor that he is a spy of Prince Rui?

488
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,058
Yes. No matter how much
he may crave the throne,

489
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,352
how could he possibly do that?

490
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,146
An official of the court told me that--

491
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,106
Bollocks.

492
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,733
Do you poop with your mouth
and eat with your behind?

493
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,152
I cannot stand
your repulsive stories anymore.

494
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,030
How dare you! I went easy on you
as you were a good baduk player,

495
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,657
but what is this insolence?

496
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,285
Apologize to him immediately
if you do not wish to be flogged!

497
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,202
Bollocks.

498
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,704
Apologize?

499
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,872
You are the ones who should be flogged.

500
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,791
Did the Grand Prince
ask to be taken to the Qing?

501
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:09,837
He was taken hostage against his will
and returned after all sorts of hardships.

502
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,213
Yet you dare to call him a spy?

503
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,173
Where there is smoke, there is fire.

504
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,968
He groveled before the foreigners
and was loved by them!

505
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,720
I would have done the same.

506
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,640
Anyone would listen to the emperor
in a new land of foreigners.

507
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,641
Am I wrong?

508
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,101
What kind of idiot would do otherwise?

509
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,353
Assume that the Grand Prince
was too prideful

510
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,688
and went against the Emperor.

511
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,356
Then who would have suffered the most?

512
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,150
It would have been
the captives who were taken

513
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,901
and the people of Joseon.

514
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,903
And the whole nation
would have then been ravaged

515
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,197
and irreparably damaged for good.

516
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,705
What is with you?

517
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,664
Something to say?

518
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,713
Go on.

519
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,634
You lot are all so slow.

520
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,220
No wonder I won all your baduk tables,
for none of you can think ahead.

521
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,473
You little brat.

522
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,808
-Let us leave, my lord.
-Yes, let us go.

523
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,353
Today does not seem to be your day.

524
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,938
I am the one who should be saying that.

525
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,025
-You…
-That little…

526
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,000
Darn it.

527
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,587
Quit your obsession
with Qing baduk tables, you hypocrites.

528
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,260
That table is a valuable item
that is extremely hard to come by.

529
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,513
I did advise you not to play, my lord.

530
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,265
I told you you were no match for him.

531
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,892
My goodness.

532
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,686
It feels as if I have been bewitched.

533
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,521
Let me ask you something.

534
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,857
What is his name?

535
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,652
Who is he and where does he live?

536
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,904
I do not know.

537
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,825
He earned his fame by his promise
to tell his name to one who defeats him.

538
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,577
But he has yet to lose a single game,

539
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,162
so no one knows his name.

540
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,289
Not even his last name?

541
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,249
No.

542
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,210
By the way, who are…

543
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,212
-Wait.
-Hey.

544
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,635
-Your Highness, I apologize for--
-Did you see

545
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,138
a young man carrying a baduk table
on his back on your way here?

546
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,055
Sorry?

547
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,723
Well, yes. Just a moment ago…

548
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,641
Good.

549
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,351
Your Highness.

550
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,604
Wait…

551
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,400
Who is he and why are you chasing him?

552
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,860
He is a total stranger.

553
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,486
Sorry?

554
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,280
Then why are you going after him?

555
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,073
Hurry. We might lose him.

556
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,533
Yes, Your Highness.

557
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,286
Come take a look.

558
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,792
Just how…

559
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,920
How did he climb down so fast
like a squirrel?

560
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,714
My goodness.

561
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,591
Maybe I missed him on the way.

562
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,178
We seem to have lost him.

563
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,808
Over there!

564
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,402
I got you!

565
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,697
-What are you doing?
-Forgive me.

566
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:28,076
I had to resort to discourtesy
as I do not know your name.

567
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,122
Did you tail me up from the valley?

568
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,124
If you are trying to pick a fight--

569
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,209
It is not that.

570
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,752
I am here

571
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,296
to grant your wish.

572
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,298
My wish?

573
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,176
What are you talking about?

574
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,179
Playing a game of baduk.

575
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,306
What?

576
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,060
Right. I do love expensive baduk tables.

577
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,062
However, it is late today.

578
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,105
So we shall play next time.

579
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,240
This is unacceptable.

580
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,991
Then what is acceptable?

581
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,125
My lord.

582
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,170
You must be quite confident.

583
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,883
I know all the skilled baduk players
in the capital.

584
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,677
Which one are you?

585
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,388
Which patron is providing you
with room and board?

586
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,602
Well, that is…

587
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,538
I have thoroughly searched
every courtesan house in the capital,

588
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,082
and this is the final one.

589
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,834
Answer my question.

590
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:04,256
Has Grand Prince Jinhan
been here yesterday or today?

591
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:09,052
I have already told you
that I have not even seen his shadow.

592
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,349
My lady!

593
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,685
You lie through your teeth.

594
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,189
It is indeed very difficult
to correct bad habits.

595
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,901
I guess lying runs in the family.

596
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,243
Perhaps I have been
going too easy on you lately.

597
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,163
I will make sure
to teach you a lesson today.

598
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,581
Prepare yourself.

599
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,667
Do as you please.

600
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,462
I sure will.

601
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,807
Who is it?

602
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,018
Who is the lunatic
that dared to attack me?

603
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,521
You must have been looking for me all day.

604
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,986
You seem familiar.

605
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,031
Greetings, Your Highness.

606
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,575
I am Yoo Hyun-bo, Assistant Section Chief
of the Ministry of Rites.

607
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,496
An official of the Ministry of Rites
causing a scene at a courtesan house?

608
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,040
It is certainly a behavior
that is unheard of.

609
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,211
Did Lord Kim Jong-bae
order you to dig up dirt on me?

610
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,504
Please do not misunderstand.

611
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,507
It is not what you think, Your Highness.

612
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,050
-Misunderstand?
-"Your Highness"?

613
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,053
Then what am I to make of
you tailing me last night

614
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,890
and causing a ruckus here
even before I got here?

615
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,267
Your Highness.

616
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,479
-That--
-What is the point of excuses

617
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,814
when the stench of lies is obvious?

618
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,565
Be gone!

619
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,678
Excuse me.

620
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,305
He called you, "Your Highness."

621
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,058
Are you perhaps Grand Prince Jinhan?

622
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,511
That baduk gambler

623
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,890
needs to be taught a lesson.

624
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,309
Go take care of him.

625
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,894
Yes, my lord.

626
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,872
How interesting.

627
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,500
Your Highness. It is me, Sang-hwa.

628
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,543
Yes, you may enter.

629
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,849
Its original owner
would weep to see its state.

630
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,143
I am glad Yoo Hyun-bo managed to dodge it.

631
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,770
Or else it would have been trouble.

632
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,314
He seemed to have a history
with Hongjang, the courtesan.

633
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,357
He does.

634
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,734
According to the head courtesan,
they are family.

635
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,903
Family?

636
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,697
Does that mean she is from a noble family?

637
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,493
Yes. She is one of the repatriates
who was once held captive by the Qing.

638
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,579
What an awful man.

639
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,749
How could he persecute his own sister
when he failed to protect her?

640
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,751
Your Highness.

641
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,045
You may enter.

642
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,565
My name is Hongjang.

643
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,692
Please allow me
to serve you a drink tonight.

644
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,360
Sure.

645
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,321
Have the baduk gambler
from earlier come in.

646
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,324
He deserves
more credit than I do for today.

647
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,202
Your Highness.

648
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,704
I am sorry to tell you this,

649
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,455
but he is already gone.

650
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,375
What did you say?

651
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,085
Already gone?

652
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,128
Yes, Your Highness.

653
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,256
He said he had somewhere to go
before sunset.

654
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,679
Tell me his name.

655
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,181
Please forgive me.

656
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,059
Though I do know his name,

657
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,854
I shall not disclose it
without his permission.

658
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,773
Is he your lover?

659
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,569
He is my savior

660
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,280
who paid for my ransom.

661
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,741
He always complained

662
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:26,202
that the money earned from baduk tables
was not enough to help many people.

663
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,705
When he heard the news
of your deal with Prince Rui

664
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:32,125
to release the captives
who were taken during the war,

665
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,502
he was filled with joy.

666
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,301
What else? Go on.

667
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,764
He also said this nation will change

668
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,350
now that you have returned.

669
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,357
Gosh, you startled me.

670
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,609
Do let me know before coming in.

671
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,027
Oh.

672
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,029
Gosh, my heart.

673
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,033
I am coming in, my lady.

674
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,092
I have given some thought

675
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:09,055
as to why you are startled senseless
even at the smallest peep.

676
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,475
It must be your guilty conscience speaking

677
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,061
because you sneak out every day
to play baduk dressed as a man.

678
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,355
Did we not reach a conclusion
on this topic?

679
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,648
Bollocks.

680
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,735
You always reach a conclusion
all by yourself.

681
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,902
Stop saying that.

682
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,073
Your habitual cursing
has stuck to my way of talking.

683
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,744
Do you know how many times
I cursed in front of him today?

684
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,912
"Him"?

685
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,206
Who do you mean?

686
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,543
That is none of your business.

687
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,881
-Could it be--
-No. It is not Lord Kim, the drafter.

688
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,133
Then who?

689
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,181
You are frustrating me to death.

690
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,933
It is about time you get married,
but you only wander around outside.

691
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,393
Marriage, my foot.

692
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,936
Who says I am getting married?

693
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,064
Lord Kim says so.

694
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,816
Ridiculous.

695
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,652
I shall forbid him from entering my house.

696
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,780
It is already too late for that.

697
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,407
What do you mean by that?

698
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,743
Your father came home just now,

699
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,746
and he brought Lord Kim with him.

700
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:15,789
What?

701
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,832
Why are you telling me this now?

702
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,336
You are the one
who stopped me from talking.

703
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,046
Goodness.

704
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,589
My lady.

705
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,840
Your hair.

706
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,193
I am sorry, Father.

707
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,487
I did not know you came home.

708
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,448
Not to worry. Come sit down.

709
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,959
How have you been lately, my lady?

710
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,002
You came by but five days ago,

711
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,421
so your salutation seems unsuitable.

712
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,260
I came to play baduk with you.

713
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,095
I have already told you

714
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,223
that I do not play against someone
that I have beaten

715
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,352
and that I will not marry someone
who cannot beat me.

716
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,728
That is why I am here.

717
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,232
I must win to marry you,

718
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,567
and in order to win,

719
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,153
I must keep visiting
to play a game with you.

720
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,824
I will not marry you, my lord.

721
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,910
But I will marry you at all costs.

722
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,374
Do not look at me like that.

723
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,168
I am falling for you even more.

724
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,009
Father, I shall return to my room.

725
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,011
Go ahead.

726
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,323
My lord.

727
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,034
Please allow me to marry your daughter.

728
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,829
I understand

729
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,791
your deep filial devotion
to Her Majesty and your father.

730
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,877
Do you think my motive
is a sense of filial duty?

731
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,546
Even if my aunt and father
were against the match,

732
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,215
I would have asked for her hand.

733
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:31,841
I have no intention

734
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,886
of marrying Hee-soo off against her will.

735
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,764
I know how much you adore your daughter.

736
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:38,848
However,

737
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,393
she will have to grow out of
being your daughter one day.

738
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,604
Do you not agree?

739
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,945
Hee-soo.

740
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,949
Do you really hate it that much?

741
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,079
Yes.

742
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,706
Then what do you like?

743
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,921
I like sitting down with you
for a game of baduk.

744
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,425
During the war,

745
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,512
I left you alone and took off
when you were motherless.

746
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,180
Do you not resent me?

747
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,603
I did when I was young.

748
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,149
However, Jageunnyeon took me in
when I was a crying child

749
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,068
to feed, clothe, and hold my hand.

750
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,405
She was also only a little girl back then.

751
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,074
Getting by alone
would have been difficult enough.

752
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,787
There were many times
when she would cry as well.

753
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:47,083
There was someone to take care of us
whenever such times came.

754
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,627
Everyone knew
you were fighting a tough battle

755
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,214
alongside the Grand Prince
while supporting him.

756
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,179
Is it that you dislike marriage

757
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,889
or Kim Myung-ha?

758
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,519
I will get married.

759
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,606
When I find the right man, that is.

760
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,067
You mean someone
who can beat you at baduk?

761
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,112
What if he is a white-haired sage?

762
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,531
If that is my fate,

763
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,242
I must accept it.

764
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,414
Well, that is troublesome.

765
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,300
I shall be back.

766
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,093
Yes, Father.

767
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,034
My lady!

768
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,079
Here we go again
after a few days of good behavior.

769
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,914
You can go over my dead body!

770
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,791
Jageunnyeon.

771
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,876
Do you want to get on my bad side?

772
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,878
How could you say that?

773
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,381
I worry about you every minute I am awake,

774
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,299
even in the privy!

775
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,510
Jageunnyeon.

776
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,844
Do not even call me!

777
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,722
Must you get in the way
when you know why I am doing this?

778
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,892
How could I not know
that your kind heart is guiding you

779
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:32,146
to help the people
just as they helped us during the war?

780
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,564
-But--
-The ransom was increased,

781
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,316
making repatriation even more difficult.

782
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,568
If I can help them with my talent,

783
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,362
it would be my greatest honor to do so.

784
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,532
To me,

785
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,535
you are much more important
than the captives, my lady.

786
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,417
Fine.

787
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,379
Once I earn enough money for ransom
to send with the winter envoy,

788
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,380
I shall retire.

789
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,549
Do you promise?

790
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,134
I promise.

791
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,181
Unbelievable.

792
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:13,896
Principal Director.

793
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,690
Chief State Councilor.

794
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,609
I heard you had no time

795
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,987
to catch up with the Grand Prince
after his return.

796
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,073
I would like to host a feast
to celebrate his return.

797
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,408
When would suit you best?

798
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,953
I cannot burden you unnecessarily.

799
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:33,124
I shall catch up
with the Grand Prince in private.

800
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,793
Chief State Councilor.

801
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,267
I did not want to speak so bluntly,

802
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,810
but you leave me no choice.

803
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,229
Now that the Grand Prince is back,

804
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,026
it is about time you show where you stand.

805
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,654
Are you asking me to choose

806
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,783
between the north, south, east, and west?

807
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:07,909
That is correct.

808
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,869
So which is it?

809
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,123
The sun rises in the east
and sets in the west.

810
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,293
The seasonal changes begin in the north
and finish in the south.

811
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,754
What hidden meaning
could there be to them?

812
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,506
However,

813
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:26,469
I do not intend to be involved
in a political fight

814
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,430
between the Queen's family.

815
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,748
The Grand Prince
has been visiting every day.

816
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,417
Will you keep avoiding him?

817
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,004
I said bollocks.

818
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,381
Twice, at that.

819
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,302
I also said, "Do you poop with your mouth
and eat with your behind?"

820
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,638
I cannot bear to see him.

821
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,641
He did not seem like the type
to mind such words.

822
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,768
But I am.

823
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,071
Stay safe.

824
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:45,965
What do I do?

825
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:50,344
If only I had not said bollocks,

826
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,930
I would seek an audience with him.

827
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,795
How bold of you to humiliate my lord?

828
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,631
What are you waiting for?

829
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,049
Get him.

830
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,016
Stop!

831
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,211
Your Highness.

832
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,629
I am glad I got here in time.

833
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,967
How did you know I was here?

834
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,388
I went to the courtesan house today,
hoping to see you.

835
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,431
Hongjang told me…

836
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,367
Your Highness.

837
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,744
You are bleeding.

838
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,802
This is nothing.

839
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,930
The wound is not as deep as you might…

840
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:02,893
Your Highness.

841
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,563
Are you all right?

842
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,443
You are more skittish than you seem.

843
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,530
It is a relief

844
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,200
that I took the knife instead of you.

845
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:28,312
CAPTIVATING THE KING

846
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:29,772
Your Highness.

847
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,067
-Goodness.
-Why are you running away

848
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,235
when you are here to see me?

849
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,320
I only play baduk when there is a bet.

850
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,405
I did not bring my baduk table,

851
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,116
so I will bet what you want.

852
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,242
What is it?

853
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,285
He was fated to ascend to the throne

854
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,746
despite not being able to do so.

855
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,999
So do not think that I covet
the title of the Crown Prince.

856
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,501
That makes him

857
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,628
a target and a threat.

858
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:53,838
It is raining!

859
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,507
-Mongwoo.
-When mongwoo falls,

860
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,385
let us meet here again.

861
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:05,850
