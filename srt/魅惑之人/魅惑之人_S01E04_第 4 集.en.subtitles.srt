1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,994
I swear on the heavens…

3
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,793
that I have never plotted treason.

4
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,963
Do not defile the heavens' name.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,383
It is treason in itself

6
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,345
to audaciously point a sword at me!

7
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,578
What do I have to do

8
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,206
to make you believe me?

9
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,179
Confess your crimes as the spy…

10
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,599
and take your own life.

11
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,691
Why?

12
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,776
Can you not do it?

13
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,447
Do you remember

14
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,910
what you said to me
before I was taken to Shenyang?

15
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,538
It has been years.

16
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,124
How am I to remember such a thing?

17
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,294
"Survive and return at all costs.

18
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,632
I will not forgive you

19
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,970
if you do not abide by this order.

20
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,561
I am your only elder brother,

21
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,315
and you are my only younger brother.

22
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,277
Your injuries are my injuries.

23
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,739
So please return home safely."

24
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,452
I must not have been myself back then,

25
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,332
seeing that I blabbered such lies.

26
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,044
There is no use
trying to hurt me with your words.

27
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,714
You have adored me since I was young.

28
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,176
And I know that better than anyone.

29
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,677
Yes, I did adore you!

30
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,474
That was the only way to escape
the persecution of the Queen Dowager

31
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,309
and keep myself safe

32
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,604
until I ascended the throne.

33
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,444
I…

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,448
have…

35
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,621
never loved you.

36
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,307
I…

37
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:33,731
have always loved you, Brother.

38
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,736
Have you decided to beg for your life
with such a transparent lie?

39
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,989
I cannot take my own life.

40
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,408
Please end my life with your own hands.

41
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,742
Fine!

42
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,288
If that is your wish,

43
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,960
I shall do so

44
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,130
with my own hands.

45
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,176
Do not resent me.

46
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,055
You have brought this upon yourself.

47
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,183
Do not worry.

48
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,187
I will leave this world

49
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,691
with no resentment or grudge.

50
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
Please…

51
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,655
free yourself from captivation…

52
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,037
and become a virtuous king.

53
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,851
Brother!

54
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,853
Brother!

55
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,690
What is going on?

56
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,574
Did you drink the herbal medicine
that was not tasted?

57
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,750
Is anyone there?

58
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,796
Is there no one outside?

59
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,382
Did you call…

60
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,302
Your Majesty.

61
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,846
Bring the royal physician immediately!

62
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,931
Pardon?

63
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,890
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,767
Your Majesty…

65
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,369
If…

66
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,748
I die right now,

67
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,836
only one person…

68
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,134
stands to gain from it.

69
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,769
Earlier,

70
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,399
you told me…

71
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,322
that you have never plotted treason.

72
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,871
Can you swear…

73
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,169
that your words hold no shroud of deceit?

74
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,089
Yes.

75
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,383
I swear.

76
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,687
These are my last words.

77
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,357
Find…

78
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,862
the one who harmed me

79
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,324
and punish them.

80
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,202
And see to it

81
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,039
that the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne.

82
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,852
Do not…

83
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,648
Do not trust anyone.

84
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,568
No one…

85
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,154
Please…

86
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,744
preserve your energy, Your Majesty.

87
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,956
In…

88
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,715
My brother,

89
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,968
In.

90
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,933
I…

91
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,482
have…

92
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,327
Brother.

93
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,915
Brother.

94
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,377
Your Highness!

95
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,212
The royal physicians are here!

96
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,012
My brother has temporarily
lost consciousness.

97
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,097
Treat him immediately.

98
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,991
Why are you backing away?

99
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,160
Forgive me.

100
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,412
Please take my life instead!

101
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,708
Take your life?

102
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,878
What do you mean?

103
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,881
His Majesty…

104
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,551
has already passed.

105
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,081
Hongjang.

106
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,335
Please hang in there.

107
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,673
His Highness will save us no matter what.

108
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes, my lord.

109
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,980
Your Highness.

110
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,703
I came running as soon as I heard the news
of His Majesty's passing.

111
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,677
If I die right now,

112
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,431
only one person…

113
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,479
stands to gain from it.

114
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,580
These are my last words.

115
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,000
Find…

116
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,505
the one who harmed me

117
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,008
and punish them.

118
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,803
And see to it

119
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,765
that the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne.

120
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,733
Your Highness.

121
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,612
I understand you are deeply distressed

122
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,365
about His Majesty's sudden passing.

123
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,911
But it was an inevitable event
as his chronic illness had been worsening.

124
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,416
My brother

125
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,460
was poisoned to death.

126
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,633
Who would have dared to commit
such an atrocious and treasonous act?

127
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,602
Tell me, who did it?

128
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,041
Now that the tiger is gone,

129
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,627
packs of hyenas will run wild.

130
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,296
They will reveal their indecent motives

131
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,090
and jump on you to rip your throat open.

132
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,058
Do you remember
what you told me last time?

133
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,354
By last time, do you mean…

134
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,980
You told me that ascending to the throne,

135
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,070
having the world at my command,
and governing this nation as its king

136
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,864
is my fate and to not deny it.

137
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,413
I will

138
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,916
accept that fate.

139
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,169
A wise choice, Your Highness.

140
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,092
Let us head
to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

141
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,513
Your Highness.

142
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,890
Why are you hesitating?

143
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,058
Her Royal Highness's command

144
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,310
will not be enough
to convince Kim Jong-bae.

145
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,479
However,

146
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,857
there is nothing else we can do for now.

147
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,532
I must wipe off the blood first.

148
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,654
Forgive me, Your Highness.

149
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,824
Did His Majesty

150
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,078
leave any last words?

151
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,580
Please forgive me,

152
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,500
but I was not able to
stay by his side when he passed.

153
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,127
He passed unexpectedly.

154
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,505
No one could have kept his side
to receive his last words.

155
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,423
You are all wrong.

156
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,593
His Majesty did leave his last words.

157
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,598
Who is the subject
who received his last words?

158
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,059
It is me.

159
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,270
I received his last words.

160
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,234
His Majesty passed suddenly.

161
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,694
How could you have heard his last words?

162
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,953
It is thanks to you, Minister Kim.

163
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,873
I came to plead my innocence to him

164
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,417
and ended up receiving his last words.

165
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,131
So…

166
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,425
what were His Majesty's last words?

167
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,348
He entrusted me with the nation's future.

168
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,940
With the nation's future?

169
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:10,983
What…

170
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,110
could that possibly mean--

171
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,028
"Ascend to the throne."

172
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,701
"Protect and maintain peace
for the nation and its people."

173
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,050
Nonsense!

174
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,639
His Majesty could not have left
such lies as his last words!

175
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,932
How dare you?

176
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,477
How dare you suspect him?

177
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,937
His Majesty…

178
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,985
was wary of Grand Prince Jinhan
ever since his return from Shenyang.

179
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,903
And yet,

180
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,113
his last words
were for a mere grand prince

181
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,240
to ascend to the throne
over the legitimate heir,

182
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,992
the Prince Royal?

183
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,037
The very Grand Prince
who is being suspected of being

184
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,330
the man behind the spy?

185
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,919
I was just as shocked
upon hearing his words.

186
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,173
However,

187
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,760
His Majesty

188
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
recognized my loyalty.

189
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,809
And his last thoughts were for the nation
and its people facing perilous times.

190
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,562
Thus,

191
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,148
he chose me

192
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,359
over the young Prince Royal.

193
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,073
Do provide evidence

194
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,492
that your words are true.

195
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,917
There is someone else
who heard the King's last words.

196
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,008
And who might that be?

197
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,096
Come in and tell them.

198
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,990
This is a sacred meeting.

199
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,076
Hence, you must not commit perjury.

200
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,788
Is it true that His Majesty left

201
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,749
his last words to the Grand Prince?

202
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,256
Yes, it is true.

203
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,351
I will ask again.

204
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,272
Think carefully before you answer.

205
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,734
Did you clearly hear…

206
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,738
His Majesty

207
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,199
command Grand Prince Jinhan

208
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,120
to be his successor

209
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,291
and ascend to the throne?

210
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,509
Yes.

211
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,596
I clearly heard His Majesty

212
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,515
give those very commands.

213
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,671
I swear to the heavens and the earth

214
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,550
that I received His Majesty's last words.

215
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,970
However,

216
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:15,477
I do not wish to ascend to the throne
against the court officials' will.

217
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,901
If even one person from the Royal Family

218
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,196
or any of the civil
and military officials oppose it,

219
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,990
I will not ascend to the throne.

220
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,972
You should not have said that.

221
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,475
Whether they are against you or not,

222
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,979
your reign was as good as secured
if Her Highness appointed you a successor.

223
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,524
You have fallen into Kim Jong-bae's trap.

224
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,068
I spoke the truth

225
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,572
when I said I would not ascend the throne
should anyone oppose me.

226
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,283
If my sincerity fails to move them,

227
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,413
it will be pointless to claim the throne
even with my mother's help.

228
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,879
How did you win Court Lady Dong over?

229
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,599
Court Lady Dong.

230
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,684
Court Lady Dong.

231
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,980
Help me.

232
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,946
What…

233
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,117
can I do for you?

234
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,540
If it had not been for you,

235
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,336
this nation would have fallen into crisis.

236
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,629
You praise me greatly,

237
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,924
but I have done nothing.

238
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,675
Is that so?

239
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,930
As the Grand Prince
has not ascended to the throne yet,

240
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,432
your apprehension is understandable.

241
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,958
Your Royal Highness, this is…

242
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,377
That norigae is awarded
to concubines only.

243
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,799
It is a token of appreciation
that I will not forget your contribution.

244
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,931
I am very grateful, Your Royal Highness.

245
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,644
I have looked into the herbal medicine

246
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,146
and the medicine pots of the Royal Clinic,

247
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,773
but I found no poison.

248
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,566
You better speak the truth.

249
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,568
Are you certain?

250
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,071
This concerns His Majesty!

251
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,365
How could I lie?

252
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,243
That is enough. You may leave.

253
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,093
It is clear that His Majesty
passed from his illness.

254
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,054
How naive.

255
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,598
Do you really believe him?

256
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,101
He is either bought off
by the Grand Prince

257
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,353
or siding with him
merely based on his words

258
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,898
that he received the King's last words
and voluntarily offering lies.

259
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,779
Do you also believe the Grand Prince
murdered the late king, Father?

260
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,491
The late king passed
as soon as I tried to uncover

261
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,327
the Grand Prince's crimes.

262
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,537
Do you not find that odd?

263
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,665
We cannot accuse the Grand Prince
of crimes solely based on assumptions.

264
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,668
Why do you look so concerned?

265
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,379
He proclaimed himself

266
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,382
that he would not ascend the throne
should anyone oppose him.

267
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,675
We can simply oppose,

268
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,512
and that will prevent the Grand Prince
from taking the throne.

269
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,432
How foolish.

270
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,605
The Grand Prince
is more treacherous than a snake.

271
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,066
He would not have made such a promise
without a plan.

272
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,363
Shall I travel to Uiju
and meet with Jung Je-pyo?

273
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,448
To do what, exactly?

274
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,450
I would report to him

275
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,662
that Grand Prince Jinhan
is the one behind the King's death.

276
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,165
Do not tell me

277
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,668
you want to publicize
the murder of the King.

278
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,171
What if the Qing's court
uses it as a pretext

279
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,882
to deny the Prince Royal's
ascension to the throne?

280
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,467
In that case,

281
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,761
even if the Grand Prince keeps his word

282
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,138
and the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne,

283
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,767
chaos will follow

284
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,269
for quite some time.

285
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,732
Forgive me for saying this,

286
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:17,946
but we may end up losing everything
trying to protect what is not yet ours.

287
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,365
That is simply what I was concerned about.

288
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,159
Leave such concerns to me.

289
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,869
As for you,

290
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,747
just carry out the tasks I give you.

291
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,752
Of course, my lord.

292
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,837
I shall do that.

293
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,305
I do not understand why you continue

294
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,684
to work with an untrustworthy
and despicable man like Yoo Hyun-bo.

295
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,352
Yoo Hyun-bo is a hound.

296
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,064
A hound that can bite off a tiger's neck.

297
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,276
When it has served its purpose
after the tiger hunt,

298
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,990
I could just boil it and be done with it.

299
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,312
Minister Kim.

300
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,855
What is with these soldiers?

301
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,442
Per the mourning protocol,

302
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,569
these men will guard
the Royal Coffin Hall.

303
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,656
It is to prevent any uprising or revolt

304
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,826
that may happen.

305
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,415
It seems like you do not believe my words

306
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,002
that the King left his last words to me.

307
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,882
What kind of fool

308
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,260
would believe in such rubbish?

309
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,771
I need a subject
with clear insight, determination,

310
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,730
and…

311
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,776
a spirit of justice.

312
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,071
Could you not confer your trust in me

313
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,283
for this nation and its people?

314
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,790
I would rather hang myself

315
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,961
than serve a wicked traitor.

316
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,257
You have willfully blinded
and deafened yourself

317
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,261
that you can neither see
nor hear anything.

318
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,971
That may be true.

319
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:30,930
However,

320
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,309
I have clearly seen and heard

321
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,561
your promise to the court officials.

322
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,814
You said even a single dissent

323
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,609
would be enough to renounce
your ascension to the throne.

324
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,861
I hope

325
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,196
you have not forgotten already.

326
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,531
I have not.

327
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,869
I will keep my word.

328
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,708
You will have no choice but to do so.

329
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,260
Mobilize troops immediately

330
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,638
to oppose Kim Jong-bae!

331
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,599
The soldiers that guard
the palace and the capital

332
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,977
only take orders from the Minister of War
and the Border Defense Council.

333
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,812
To oppose Kim Jong-bae,

334
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,565
we must bring troops from the borders.

335
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,025
Why is that a problem?

336
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,153
I will send my command
to the commanders at the borders.

337
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,363
That will not do.

338
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,991
Why do you say so?

339
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,451
The security of the borders

340
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,287
maintains the safety
of this nation and the people.

341
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,707
We should not mobilize them
without a good reason.

342
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,125
If we do,

343
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,046
it will allow for an opening
for the Qing to strike us.

344
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,007
If our troops collide in the capital,

345
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,843
only innocent people will shed blood.

346
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,804
We cannot let that happen.

347
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,014
How can you be so frustrating?

348
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,227
Would you rather let them
stampede over you?

349
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,354
I have a plan,

350
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,440
so please wait.

351
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,192
But before that,

352
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,819
I have

353
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,530
a favor to ask of you.

354
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,407
Of course.

355
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,867
You may ask me anything.

356
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,703
It is your eldest son

357
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,873
and the king of this nation
who has passed away.

358
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,960
Even if you do not mourn his loss,

359
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,170
please at least pretend

360
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,965
to express your sorrow.

361
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,688
All right.

362
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,859
I shall express my sorrow.

363
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,485
In turn,

364
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,739
please respect my wishes.

365
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,139
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

366
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,277
The Prince Royal seems gaunt.

367
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,781
He is a precious asset
to this royal family.

368
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,616
Though he may be the chief mourner,

369
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,786
take care of him so he does not fall ill.

370
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,206
I will keep that in mind,

371
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,291
Your Royal Highness.

372
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,055
I kept my promise.

373
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,015
It is your turn now.

374
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,441
I heard you have a task for me.

375
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,365
What might this be?

376
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:22,036
It is a letter the Grand Prince
is sending to the troops at the border.

377
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,080
You must return before seongbok.

378
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,331
SEONGBOK: WEARING A MOURNING DRESS.
ASCENSION FOLLOWS AFTER SEONGBOK.

379
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,624
Can you manage it?

380
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,959
Do not worry.

381
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,129
I will return with the troops

382
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,548
even if it costs me my life.

383
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,948
Min Ji-hwan is trying to
mobilize the troops

384
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,450
from the northwestern border
under the Grand Prince's order?

385
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,077
Are you certain of it?

386
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,453
Yes, my lord.

387
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:09,000
I saw Min Ji-hwan riding north on a horse
with my own two eyes.

388
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,880
After all that song and dance
about his love for the people,

389
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,758
he wants to shed blood in the capital?

390
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,136
Before the Grand Prince takes action,

391
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,513
we should tighten the screw
on that baduk gambler

392
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,974
to force a confession out of him.

393
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,769
Do you think you can get him to confess?

394
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,981
Of course, consider it done.

395
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,860
We must strike the Grand Prince
before Min Ji-hwan returns with troops,

396
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,237
so get his confession promptly.

397
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,531
Yes, my lord.

398
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,168
Father.

399
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,879
Did you not hear
what that baduk gambler said?

400
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,215
It is evident Yoo Hyun-bo
lied out of sheer spite

401
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,634
to frame the Grand Prince
as the man behind Chu Dal-ha.

402
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,053
It does not matter.

403
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,682
We just need Grand Prince Jinhan's name
mentioned in the confession.

404
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,767
That baduk gambler

405
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,395
will not give you the confession you want.

406
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,648
When all his limbs are broken,

407
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,733
and blood rises like bile,

408
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,152
he will sing like a canary.

409
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,784
Father.

410
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
Then please

411
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,333
let me handle his interrogation.

412
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,628
How odd of you.

413
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,879
Why do you care so much

414
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,507
about a mere baduk gambler?

415
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,595
I cannot trust Yoo Hyun-bo.

416
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,638
I will do it instead.

417
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,766
I will get his confession no matter what.

418
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,685
So please leave this to me.

419
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,964
That is enough. You may leave.

420
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,274
Are you breaking your promise
to Grand Prince Jinhan?

421
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,237
That promise is meaningless now.

422
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,991
His Majesty has passed away.

423
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,203
When the warden returns,

424
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,872
the interrogation will begin.

425
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,956
Before that happens,

426
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,584
I will give you the chance to attest.

427
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,501
If you do,

428
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,464
you and Hongjang
will both leave this place alive.

429
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,718
And what am I supposed to attest to?

430
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,475
Name Grand Prince Jinhan, Yi In,

431
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,811
as the real man
behind the spy, Chu Dal-ha.

432
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,231
Say so when the warden is present.

433
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,109
-Then--
-I must have a discerning eye for people.

434
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,076
I have disliked you from the moment
you started frequenting my house.

435
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,245
You started placing stones
on the baduk table

436
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,247
without ever fathoming
your opponent's feelings.

437
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,959
That is when I first knew
that you would not be reliable.

438
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,795
I do not want to take it this far.

439
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,214
But it is not the time
to pick apart right and wrong.

440
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,341
I am not upset because this is wrong.

441
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,428
You prey on my desperation and force me
to perjure myself for personal gain.

442
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,138
That is what disgusts me.

443
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,154
Do you not want to save Hongjang?

444
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,449
Do you want to die in humiliation

445
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,244
after they find out that you are a woman?

446
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,332
I am afraid and scared of dying.

447
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,378
However, committing a crime
that would never wash away to save myself

448
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,005
frightens me a thousandfold and more.

449
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,261
Hongjang would say the same.

450
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,131
My lord, shall I start the interrogation?

451
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,638
Lay a finger on him,

452
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,016
and I will have you dead.

453
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,477
Do you understand me?

454
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,228
Yes, my lord.

455
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,234
Just as expected.

456
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,406
It would be better for me to step in.

457
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,829
Do you think I do not see through
your scheme for your grudge

458
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,082
to have him killed
under the pretense of interrogation?

459
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,632
Do you realize he could hold out
and refuse to attest?

460
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,133
Let me worry about that.

461
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,843
Do not meddle.

462
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,948
It does not matter.

463
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,869
We just need Grand Prince Jinhan's name
mentioned in the confession.

464
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,220
Father. It is Min Ji-hwan
of the Ministry of War.

465
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,556
What could have happened?

466
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,432
He could not be back
from the borders already.

467
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,020
Something is not right, Father.

468
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,356
No need to be scared.

469
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,441
We have the confession.

470
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,611
Grand Prince Jinhan
will be dragged out as a criminal

471
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,364
charged with high treason

472
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,658
with all the officials watching.

473
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:24,977
Soldiers!

474
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,815
Arrest Yi In
for treason against the crown!

475
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,941
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

476
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,879
Do you have evidence
that I have committed treason?

477
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,091
This is a confession

478
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,053
that names Grand Prince Jinhan, Yi In,

479
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,679
as the man behind Chu Dal-ha!

480
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,598
Let me see that.

481
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,440
"The baduk gambler attested

482
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,067
that the spy, Chu Dal-ha,

483
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,905
received an order from Grand Prince Jinhan
to travel to the Ming."

484
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,325
"He also attested
that it was to inform the Ming

485
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,495
that the Qing would strike them soon."

486
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,705
-Goodness.
-A spy?

487
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,084
-Did he truly commit such an act?
-Is this true?

488
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,836
So he was the real spy?

489
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,755
We cannot have a traitor

490
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,133
ascend to the throne!

491
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,803
Do you not agree?

492
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,017
You have created a crime
that I have not committed

493
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,646
solely to prevent my ascension.

494
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,730
It is truly…

495
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,067
impressive.

496
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,985
So you will play innocent, I see.

497
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,572
There is someone who can attest
that the confession was forged.

498
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,869
Tell me.

499
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,913
Who might that be?

500
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,333
It is me,

501
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,001
my lord.

502
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,179
I was ordered by Kim Jong-bae,
the Minister of War,

503
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:29,268
to falsify a confession
about Grand Prince Jinhan.

504
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,312
He said that would allow him
to eliminate the Grand Prince

505
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,648
by framing him as a spy.

506
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,109
When I refused to do so,

507
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:41,238
his son, Kim Myung-ha,
conspired with the baduk gambler

508
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,699
and got a fake confession out of him!

509
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:45,951
Father.

510
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,744
That man is lying.

511
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,205
Yoo Hyun-bo's words are all lies!

512
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,208
Shall we go to the baduk gambler

513
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,128
and check if I am speaking the truth?

514
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,006
That is…

515
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,300
How dare you try to defame His Highness

516
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,427
with a forged attestation?

517
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,929
This is treason!

518
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,766
Immediately arrest
Kim Jong-bae for treason!

519
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,107
You bastard!

520
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,319
Since when were you

521
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,322
in league with the Grand Prince?

522
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,292
I warned you, did I not?

523
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,213
I told you that you may end up
losing everything

524
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:43,091
trying to protect what is yet to be yours.

525
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,761
Drag the traitor out!

526
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,363
Father.

527
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,073
I am fine.

528
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,214
If you admit to treason

529
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,216
and beg for forgiveness,

530
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,762
I will not execute you.

531
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,436
You said you would not take the throne
if even one person from the Royal Family

532
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,481
or any of the civil
and military officials opposed it.

533
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,071
No wonder.

534
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,490
I knew you had something up your sleeve.

535
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,288
You made such a promise
knowing this would happen.

536
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,876
You are truly a wicked and treacherous--

537
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,846
Father.

538
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,186
Father.

539
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,070
-Father…
-Drag the traitor out.

540
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,822
-Yes, my lord!
-Father.

541
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,118
Father!

542
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,912
Father!

543
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,166
Father!

544
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,629
Father!

545
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,603
Is there anyone else
who opposes my ascension…

546
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,316
to the throne?

547
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,777
I, Oh Wook-hwan,
Third Minister of Taxation…

548
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,863
dare plead with you, Your Highness!

549
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,240
Please ascend to the throne,

550
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,534
preserve the Royal Family and the nation,

551
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,955
and protect the land and its people!

552
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,376
I, Min Ji-hwan, Assistant Section Chief
of the Ministry of War,

553
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:26,463
also beg that you uphold
the last words of the late king!

554
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,717
Please uphold
the last words of the late king!

555
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,179
-Please uphold his last words!
-Please uphold his last words!

556
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,035
Hail the King!

557
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,913
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

558
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,792
Hail the King!

559
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,587
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

560
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,631
All hail our King!

561
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,843
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

562
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,056
As His Majesty inherits the throne,

563
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,185
the Royal Family
and the nation are at peace!

564
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,021
May you be blessed with great happiness

565
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:09,816
of the nation prospering under your reign!

566
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,070
-May you be blessed with great happiness!
-May you be blessed with great happiness!

567
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,746
His Majesty declined our offer back then

568
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,332
not out of fear but to test us.

569
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,334
Have you realized that just now?

570
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,962
Mock me all you want.

571
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:35,342
However, even you could not have foreseen
that His Majesty would win over

572
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,677
Yoo Hyun-bo
who was Minister Kim's underling.

573
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,387
Am I wrong?

574
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,784
Make your request to His Highness.

575
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,371
I only have one wish.

576
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,834
It pertains to the baduk gambler
and his gang in league with the traitor.

577
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,711
Please punish them severely.

578
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,134
Mother!

579
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,762
-Mother!
-Mother!

580
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,723
-Mother!
-Jangryeong!

581
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,226
-Mother!
-You must stay at Prince Royal's side!

582
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,187
Jangryeong!

583
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,606
Jangryeong…

584
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,874
You killed my brother

585
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,419
and brought ruin to my family.

586
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,213
Do you intend
to kill the Prince Royal as well?

587
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,426
No one

588
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,805
will dispose of or seek to punish
the Prince Royal without my permission.

589
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,352
What do you want?

590
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,022
Leave to Jeongeopsa Temple.

591
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,445
Are you telling me
to join the Buddhist order?

592
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,238
Pray for my brother's eternal life

593
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,783
and your children's wellness
for the rest of your life.

594
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,201
That is the way

595
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,661
to ensure that both you

596
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,873
and the Prince Royal survive.

597
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,129
What will you do?

598
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,852
I have a condition.

599
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,524
It is about my nephew, Kim Myung-ha.

600
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,904
Spare him.

601
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,212
"Kim Myung-ha shall serve
as an Executive Assistant in Uiju."

602
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,558
The situation in Uiju seems very dire.

603
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,352
Make your journey without any delays.

604
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,231
Yes, Your Majesty.

605
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,336
Why are you here?

606
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,463
To see you off.

607
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,383
I guess you were going to leave
without seeing me.

608
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,219
Why?

609
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,433
Did your brother tell you to find out
the real intent behind my meek acceptance?

610
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,476
How could you be so…

611
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,396
Gosh, it makes me sad.

612
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,606
Do not scorn our long friendship--

613
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,193
A traitor's son cannot befriend
a meritorious subject's son.

614
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,157
You do not sound like yourself.

615
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,575
You are right.

616
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,037
I am a changed man.

617
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,751
I hear the executive assistant of Uiju

618
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,295
is an extremely demanding position.

619
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,256
Please stay safe.

620
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,551
Do not worry.

621
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,804
I will survive and return.

622
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,676
It felt like the Grand Prince was here.

623
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,305
Was it a dream?

624
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:21,062
Here comes His Majesty!

625
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,945
Here comes His Majesty!

626
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,746
Here comes His Majesty!

627
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,212
Here comes His Majesty!

628
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,620
Pay your respects to His Majesty!

629
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,838
You may raise your heads.

630
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,777
Your Majesty.

631
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,279
Please issue your verdict
on these criminals

632
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,367
who colluded with vile traitors

633
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,286
and attempted to harm you
with false attestations.

634
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,123
A false attestation?

635
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,669
That is not true, Your Majesty.

636
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,964
I have not given any attestations,
be it true or false.

637
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,257
Shut your mouth.

638
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,550
Why are you standing about?

639
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,426
Have the criminal on his knees!

640
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,443
Criminals shall listen.

641
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,197
You colluded with a band of traitors

642
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,825
and threatened the nation and its people
by falsifying attestation.

643
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,494
Such crimes are serious and grievous.

644
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,121
Thus,

645
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,499
though we are still in mourning
for the late king's passing,

646
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,294
I order the judges

647
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,672
to discuss this matter,
agree on a punishment,

648
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,260
and have it carried out
without any delays.

649
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,526
A moment, please.

650
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,194
Your Majesty.

651
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,156
Please spare me a second.

652
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,784
Your Majesty!

653
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,328
Stand back.

654
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,205
Your Majesty.

655
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,916
Please spare Hongjang's life.

656
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,544
Hongjang did not say a word.

657
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,795
So please,

658
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,423
spare her life.

659
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,177
This is the final request
of your manghyeongjiu.

660
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,441
I am no longer an ordinary man.

661
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,777
I am the king of this nation.

662
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,445
A king

663
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,615
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

664
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,369
He keeps no such thing as friends.

665
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,670
Father.

666
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,132
What kind of a person
is Grand Prince Jinhan?

667
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,178
He was born with the talent and authority

668
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,639
to rule and command the world.

669
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,100
And that makes him…

670
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,063
a target and a threat.

671
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:37,068
Not only that,
his life is sad and pitiful.

672
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:42,240
He was fated to ascend to the throne
despite not being able to do so.

673
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,951
Despite his loyal heart,

674
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,955
treacherous men will flock to him
like moths to a flame.

675
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,043
Do not worry, Father.

676
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,546
His Highness

677
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,466
is not someone
who will be swayed by such people.

678
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,356
Move!

679
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,570
-Hurry!
-Move!

680
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,197
-Walk faster!
-Move it!

681
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,246
-Walk faster!
-Hurry!

682
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,751
The criminals who colluded
with treacherous Kim Jong-bae

683
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,836
to give a false attestation

684
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,006
shall be flogged 100 times
and be sentenced to 3 years of hard labor.

685
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,633
The criminals must walk to the border,

686
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,677
so the flogging
shall be carried out later.

687
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,405
Hongjang.

688
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,033
Are you okay?

689
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,602
I am sorry.

690
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,357
This is my fault.

691
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,402
Why would you

692
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,447
say such a thing?

693
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,119
Because it is.

694
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,624
This is all my fault.

695
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,713
I would rather…

696
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,133
you spoke your usual.

697
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:09,846
What?

698
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,140
Say…

699
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,601
bollocks.

700
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:19,730
Come on.

701
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:25,820
Bollocks.

702
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,490
Bollocks, indeed.

703
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,701
Damn it, bollocks.

704
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,704
Bollocks.

705
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,801
It will only take a day and a half more

706
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:50,928
to get to our destination.

707
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,974
I will make sure to get you a physician.

708
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,394
So hang in there until then.

709
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,480
Okay?

710
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,494
-All right. Wake up already!
-Hey!

711
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,871
-We have a long way to go!
-Wake up!

712
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,247
Wake up!

713
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,707
-Get up!
-Wake up!

714
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,709
-Wake up!
-I told you to get up!

715
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,710
Wake up!

716
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,843
Hongjang.

717
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,971
-We still have a long way to go!
-Wake up!

718
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,348
-Get up now.
-Wake up!

719
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,353
Hongjang.

720
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,230
Wake up, Hongjang.

721
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,827
No, this cannot be.

722
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,083
You cannot pass away like this.

723
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,466
No…

724
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,639
Please…

725
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,316
Damn it.

726
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,777
Why are you being such a nuisance?

727
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,202
Get him!

728
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,788
Stop right there!

729
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,501
Stop!

730
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,089
Stop!

731
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,081
Is he dead?

732
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,501
Even if he is not, he will not last long.

733
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:15,794
Let the tigers finish him off.

734
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:52,623
The scent of blood, sweat, and tears
of the innocent people of Joseon…

735
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:54,875
pervades the wind there.

736
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,422
I vowed to myself on the day
I smelled that wind for the first time.

737
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,133
That I would survive and return to Joseon

738
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,387
and serve the people and the nation
until the day I die.

739
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,471
That I will not…

740
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,934
let such tragic events happen ever again.

741
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:24,989
I swear on my father and Hongjang.

742
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,826
I will survive and return

743
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,413
and make him feel

744
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:37,918
the pain of being betrayed
by the person he trusted.

745
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:40,879
He will be made

746
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:44,133
to suffer this indignity.

747
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,721
I will make sure that he never forgets…

748
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,517
the scent of the blood of the innocent.

749
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,620
3 YEARS LATER

750
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,051
What does it say?

751
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,136
Hold on.

752
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:31,221
They are looking for a gidaeryeong

753
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:35,059
who will join His Majesty
at Yeongchwijeong for baduk.

754
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,769
GIDAERYEONG: THE KING'S BADUK INSTRUCTOR

755
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,645
Anyone may apply
regardless of their class.

756
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:39,688
Look at that.

757
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:42,024
Or their age, for that matter.

758
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:44,568
Regardless of class?

759
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,612
The world has gone crazy!

760
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,494
-Keep reading.
-All right.

761
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:59,333
"Anyone who knows how to play baduk
may apply to an examination."

762
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:04,380
"However, public officials
are not qualified to do so."

763
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:09,259
I did not expect
the King to be such a fair man.

764
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,390
Fair, my foot.

765
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,974
He did not mention female applicants.

766
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,144
He spent three years indulging in
drinks and women day and night.

767
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,230
Maybe he has gotten tired of them.

768
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,274
By the way, Yeongchwijeong?

769
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,403
What is that place for?

770
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,639
Any applicants for my gidaeryeong?

771
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,893
Everyone is surprised
at the high number of applicants.

772
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,895
Have them hurry.

773
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,108
I am sick and tired…

774
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,654
of playing alone.

775
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:22,708
State your name.

776
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,501
It is An Gong-hyeop.

777
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,423
-Your name.
-Seo Hyeok-pil.

778
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,428
Name.

779
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,221
Lee Jeong-hyeon.

780
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,015
What is your name?

781
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:42,519
-Kim Nam-su.
-Kim Nam-su. There we go.

782
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:48,775
State your name.

783
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:50,736
Mong-woo.

784
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,322
My name is Kang Mong-woo.

785
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:05,751
"Mong-woo"?

786
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,753
What characters do you use?

787
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:10,756
Mong, meaning "drizzle"

788
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:12,591
and woo, meaning "rain."

789
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:22,893
KANG MONG-WOO

790
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,341
CAPTIVATING THE KING

791
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,885
What will you do now?

792
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,096
Are you ready to risk your life?

793
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:45,225
I have been ready ever since I etched
my vow to my heart three years ago.

794
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,769
Revive the peach tree in the Royal Garden.

795
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,605
If you fail to do so,

796
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,565
you shall be punished severely.

797
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,193
It appears that many people
have long waited for my death.

798
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,738
I would like to appoint a gidaeryeong.

799
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:59,698
What do you think?

800
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,368
What do you mean
by going against the King?

801
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,247
I have returned to bring down the King
who tricked his way onto the throne

802
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,499
by fooling the world
with his wicked wiles.

803
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:15,547
