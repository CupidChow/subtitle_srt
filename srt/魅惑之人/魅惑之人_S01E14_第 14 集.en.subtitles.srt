1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,431
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,685
There must be a criminal
for an interrogation to take place.

4
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,147
Who is this spy you speak of?

5
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,150
Has Chu Dal-ha

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,070
mentioned the spy by their name?

7
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,372
I shall reveal the criminal's name

8
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,666
in the interrogation.

9
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,713
Forgive me for saying this,

10
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,175
but a crude handling of the matter

11
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,137
may place you in a precarious position.

12
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,681
What dares to make you say so?

13
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,732
Should your interrogation
to find and punish the spy

14
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,943
who colluded with the Qing
become known to Prince Rui,

15
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,069
he will become furious.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,073
It may end up disturbing
the peace between the two nations.

17
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,910
Your determination to punish the criminal

18
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,955
may become a detriment

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,416
that endangers your reign.

20
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,508
That would constitute
their interference in our affairs.

21
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,219
The Qing have their hands
on our every affair.

22
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,847
Even the crumbling fortresses
of the borders

23
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,016
are being neglected because of the Qing.

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,478
Are you confessing the failings
of the Border Defense Council?

25
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,773
Then it seems I must abolish the Council.

26
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,067
Is Eunuch Kim outside?

27
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,493
Have you summoned me, Your Majesty?

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,371
The Border Defense Council's involvement
with this interrogation will be barred,

29
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,873
so order all its members to leave.

30
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,626
See if Inspector General Kim Je-nam
has come to the palace

31
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,795
and have him see me
with the Chief Royal Secretary.

32
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,463
Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,888
Principal Director.

34
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,101
You may leave now.

35
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,629
EPISODE 14

36
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,655
When selecting the officials
joining the interrogation,

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,282
exclude all the members
of the Border Defense Council.

38
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:06,537
Mobilize all the royal secretaries,
the clerks, and the runners

39
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,207
to review all records
of the spy case from three years ago

40
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,918
and reports from the borders,
then report back to me.

41
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,337
Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha

42
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,298
shall be excluded
as he was involved in the case.

43
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,217
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,094
I shall follow your command.

45
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,641
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,685
I apologize for asking,

47
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,896
but why have you decided to look into

48
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,275
the report of Chu Dal-ha
when he has tried to assassinate you?

49
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,824
It is because his report
aligns with my wishes.

50
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,577
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,788
Are you suspecting the spy
who colluded with the Qing

52
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,750
to be among the members
of the Border Defense Council?

53
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,839
Do you suspect it to be

54
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,091
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan?

55
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,352
Is that why

56
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,229
you commanded me to find a way

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,275
to abolish the Border Defense Council
and reform the court?

58
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,570
I have wanted to do that since long ago.

59
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,531
But I have yet to discuss it
with the court.

60
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:28,828
Then I shall report to you again
after coming up with a detailed plan.

61
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,706
That is correct.

62
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,377
But I could not abolish it rashly

63
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,713
as the Council's influence
had grown so much.

64
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,631
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,885
I shall carry out your command
as your devoted subject,

66
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,305
but the court will resist ferociously.

67
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,062
I am prepared for it.

68
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,834
The capital traitor
who joined hands with the Qing

69
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,838
and put this nation
and its people in a crisis.

70
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,009
I will find that vile spy

71
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,929
and have them punished for high treason.

72
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,390
I will have their disgraceful name
engraved in the records

73
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,353
so that the people of this nation…

74
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,232
will remember their crime.

75
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,526
My brother

76
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,737
was poisoned to death.

77
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,826
Who would have dared to commit
such an atrocious and treasonous act?

78
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,203
Tell me, who did it?

79
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,421
His Majesty

80
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,882
summoned all members
of the Border Defense Council at night

81
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,010
and then commanded us
to leave all of a sudden.

82
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,096
He should not treat court officials

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,266
in such a coarse manner.

84
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,476
There has been an attempt on his life.

85
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,645
That would explain his mood.

86
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,482
In my opinion,
he has some other designs in mind.

87
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,068
Summoning Kim Je-nam out of the blue

88
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,862
was a sign in itself.

89
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,657
It seems that he does not trust us--

90
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,867
Right State Councilor.

91
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,077
You are crossing the line here.

92
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,206
Are you suggesting that His Majesty
does not trust the Principal Director?

93
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,168
-That is not it.
-Enough.

94
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,422
That is enough.

95
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,383
Why do you think

96
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,388
His Majesty has decided
to look into the report of a traitor?

97
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,100
It is because Chu Dal-ha

98
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,022
will most certainly name another traitor.

99
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,399
And that traitor's name

100
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,862
will clear His Majesty's name
of being Prince Rui's spy.

101
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,281
Whoever is named by that man,

102
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,783
that traitor and their family
shall be destroyed

103
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,329
and all those associated with them
will be arrested

104
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,540
and executed for high treason.

105
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,752
When the interrogation begins,

106
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,922
there will be a bloodbath.

107
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,093
There is only one way
to stop that from happening.

108
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,971
We must prevent this interrogation

109
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:39,060
before it causes such chaos.

110
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,819
Go to the library with the runners
and get the Royal Secretariat's Records

111
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,364
and all the reports from the borders
from three years ago.

112
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
Yes, my lord.

113
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,245
My lord.

114
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,121
What is my duty?

115
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,249
You are to stay away for the time being.

116
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,794
As you were involved
in the spy case three years ago,

117
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,838
His Majesty ordered your exclusion.

118
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,160
Your Majesty.

119
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,746
Are you sure you do not need
a royal physician to tend to you?

120
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,208
Though you may not be seemingly injured,

121
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,502
I suggest that you be examined
just in case.

122
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,255
Morning examinations are enough.

123
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,800
However, Your Majesty…

124
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,801
Your Majesty.

125
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,013
Captain Joo Sang-hwa has a report to make.

126
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,055
Let him in.

127
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,683
With all due respect,

128
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,977
it is past your bedtime.

129
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,812
You can meet him tomorrow.

130
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,480
It is fine. Let him in.

131
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,898
Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,210
How is Mong-woo doing?

133
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,838
She seems to be in shock
from Chu Dal-ha's arrest.

134
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,633
And it seems a man named Se-dong

135
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,718
has frequented
and shared the news with her.

136
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,971
Do not forbid him from visiting,

137
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,266
but report to me immediately
should anything happen to her.

138
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,226
Yes, Your Majesty.

139
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,452
Captain Joo.

140
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,039
Just how poor are you at your job?

141
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,960
I have never been on good terms with you,

142
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,463
but I have trusted you wholly
with His Majesty's safety.

143
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,381
However,

144
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,634
this incident was a bolt out of the blue.

145
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,970
An assassination attempt from a traitor?

146
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,432
You are right.

147
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,018
It is all my fault.

148
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,563
The biggest problem

149
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,943
is his visits to his private residence.

150
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,446
If you cannot stop his travels,

151
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,616
such an incident may end up recurring.

152
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,785
I concur.

153
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,079
However,

154
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,332
that is up to His Majesty to decide.

155
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,460
It is neither up to me nor you.

156
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,506
But Captain Joo…

157
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,809
I am back.

158
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,146
Did the Special Firearms Unit
not tell you off?

159
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,606
Master Choam
must have told them that I would visit,

160
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,733
as they did not stop me from entering.

161
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,610
What about the State Tribunal?

162
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,320
What will happen to Master Chu?

163
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,157
The King will interrogate him himself,

164
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,452
so he will be imprisoned
until he is transferred to the palace.

165
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,538
Then why did they arrest him like
they were going to kill him immediately?

166
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,707
That really scared me.

167
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,210
Please see to it
that he is well taken care of, Se-dong.

168
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,462
Do not worry about that.

169
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,172
Jeomine and I will take care of it.

170
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,383
Thank you.

171
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,093
-You may leave.
-All right.

172
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,678
Get some rest.

173
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,224
You should lie down, my lady.

174
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,686
My lady?

175
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,189
How come His Majesty

176
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,901
returned to the palace
without saying a word to me?

177
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,528
In my opinion,

178
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,823
I think he left in a hurry

179
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,452
in case you were troubled
by Master Chu's affair.

180
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,996
Could that be the only reason?

181
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,726
Your Majesty.

182
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,269
You are in good health today

183
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,687
and show no symptoms.

184
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,231
About that poison.

185
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,152
The poison that killed my brother.

186
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
Have you yet to find it?

187
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,367
Forgive me.

188
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,495
It was not found
in the herbal medicine he used to take

189
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,372
or the bowl that contained it,

190
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,833
but on the royal robe
he coughed up his blood on.

191
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,669
I could only confirm that he took poison,

192
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,130
but could not learn
what kind of poison it was.

193
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,344
I understand the difficulty of the task.

194
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,472
But do not give up and keep working on it.

195
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,182
Yes, Your Majesty.

196
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:25,531
His Majesty ordered me
to greet you on his behalf.

197
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,995
My heart almost stopped at the news
of the assassination attempt.

198
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,998
Why could he not have come himself

199
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,625
for such an easy task
as coming to greet me?

200
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,295
I apologize.

201
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,005
The interrogation preparation is keeping--

202
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,965
How is His Majesty doing?

203
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,595
Like always,
he did not express any discomfort.

204
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,225
I hope his health has not been affected.

205
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,353
Did the royal physician examine him?

206
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,522
He took his pulse early in the morning.

207
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,484
His Majesty is healthy as ever.

208
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,659
Having you by His Majesty's side

209
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,287
does ease my mind.

210
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,541
You may leave.

211
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,184
What on earth is happening in the palace?

212
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,395
Has the Principal Director sent word yet?

213
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,898
I apologize.

214
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,609
I will send word again
to the court conference room.

215
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,652
There is no need.

216
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,030
He will come without my calling
when it is time.

217
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,161
Your Majesty.

218
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,957
Chu Dal-ha attempted to assassinate you.

219
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,044
How could you hold an interrogation
over a report such a man made?

220
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,840
Please retract the order of interrogation.

221
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,426
The report from that traitor

222
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,514
must be a false one he concocted
to avoid punishment.

223
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,350
There is no solid evidence
proving the existence

224
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,102
of a spy who colluded with the Qing.

225
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,439
You must behead the criminal
and hang up his head for display

226
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,984
to show the gravity of his crimes
to the people

227
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,570
and let it serve as a lesson to all.

228
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,781
We implore you

229
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,368
not to dismiss our words of advice

230
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,705
and grant our petition.

231
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,125
-Please grant our petition.
-Please grant our petition.

232
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,762
I have seen you all

233
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,514
for a long time

234
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,183
since the days of the late king.

235
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,021
But every single one of you
remains the same

236
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,356
and eternally unchanging.

237
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,193
You act as if you care
for the nation and its people.

238
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:12,114
But do you truly think I do not realize
that your safety and personal gain

239
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,866
are your sole concern?

240
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,369
It is utterly appalling and disgraceful.

241
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,122
Compared to all of you,

242
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,624
Chu Dal-ha

243
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,378
is a thousandfold more loyal
as he risked his life

244
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,630
to report on the spy
who colluded with the Qing!

245
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,716
Your Majesty.

246
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,260
How could you
compare such a wicked traitor

247
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,055
to us court officials?

248
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,516
It is highly inappropriate!

249
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,893
Heed my words!

250
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,735
If anyone submits another petition
to go against me on this,

251
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,445
no matter who you are,

252
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,657
I shall consider that you are
attempting to hide the spy

253
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,328
and have you punished for high treason.

254
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,428
That was strange.

255
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,056
I felt the same way.

256
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,682
His Majesty

257
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,936
seems to have been
bewitched by Chu Dal-ha.

258
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,688
That is not what I meant.

259
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,316
Then what is it?

260
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,193
I have never seen

261
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,695
the Principal Director stay so silent

262
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,031
when His Majesty was this enraged.

263
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,910
You are right.

264
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,913
Whenever His Majesty was furious,

265
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,416
he would be the first to show deference
and soothe the King's wrath

266
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,168
to mediate the situation.

267
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,003
But he did not step in once today.

268
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,255
Earlier at the hall of governance,

269
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,424
I overheard the Left State Councilor
talking to the Minister of Rites

270
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,553
that His Majesty decided
to look into Chu Dal-ha's report

271
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,141
to clear his name
of being Prince Rui's spy.

272
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,107
It is all bygones now,

273
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,651
but three years ago,

274
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,447
I shared Lord Kim Jong-bae's suspicion

275
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,827
that Grand Prince Jinhan had sent a spy
to both the Ming and the Qing.

276
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,787
But to hear

277
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,249
that Chu Dal-ha had acted upon
the late king's command

278
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,627
and that there was another spy
who communicated with the Qing in secret.

279
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,382
This is pure chaos I cannot fathom.

280
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,887
So, tell us.

281
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,055
For what reason was your father

282
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,851
so convinced that His Majesty
was the spy back then?

283
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,603
Pardon?

284
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,649
Right, the reason was…

285
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,488
Why has His Majesty
summoned the Border Defense Council?

286
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,616
There has been a report
of a breach of the peace treaty

287
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,409
whereby a spy named Chu Dal-ha

288
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,411
was dispatched to the Ming
to communicate with them.

289
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,624
Did you just say Chu Dal-ha?

290
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,584
Do you recognize the name?

291
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,752
Recently,

292
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,922
I have seen him at a courtesan's house
that Grand Prince Jinhan frequents.

293
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,383
Are you saying you saw
the Grand Prince meeting with him?

294
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,886
That is correct.

295
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,014
I saw them clearly with my two eyes.

296
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,273
What is wrong, Myung-ha?

297
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,168
What insolence is this?

298
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,468
You bastard.

299
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,428
Do you have a death wish?

300
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,514
Yes.

301
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,016
I may as well kill you
and take my own life today.

302
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,230
What wrong did I ever do to you
that you would treat me thusly?

303
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,065
You clearly told my father

304
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,318
that you witnessed a meeting between
Grand Prince Jinhan and Chu Dal-ha

305
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,112
at Hongjang's courtesan house.

306
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,658
Did I say those words?

307
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,326
My father believed in your lies

308
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,328
and…

309
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,040
thought that Grand Prince Jinhan
was the spy who colluded with the Qing.

310
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,041
My father…

311
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,836
died because of you.

312
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
Let me go!

313
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,643
You should get your story straight
even in your raging state.

314
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,271
Lord Kim Jong-bae

315
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,565
died at His Majesty's hands.

316
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,359
So how is his death my fault?

317
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,612
All I ever did was tell him

318
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,199
what he had wanted to hear.

319
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,620
Even if it had not been for my lies,

320
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,081
he would have found a way

321
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,710
to accuse His Majesty as the spy.

322
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,839
Do you think His Majesty
would agree with you?

323
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,429
I will have you tied to the rack
along with Chu Dal-ha for interrogation.

324
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,847
Who knows?

325
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,519
He may even attest that you were the spy
who colluded with the Qing.

326
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,158
Please spare my life.

327
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,537
Please forgive me this once.

328
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,831
It is all in the past, is it not?

329
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,338
Does this mean you are forgiving me?

330
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,882
Just you wait.

331
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,052
I shall contemplate
how best to deal with you

332
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,429
to relieve my anger.

333
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,857
Principal Director.

334
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,610
What did you just say?

335
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,029
His Majesty is attempting
to sever his ties to me

336
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,658
despite my significant
contribution to his reign

337
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,870
and our bond bound by the heavens.

338
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:39,793
And why would he wish to do so
when you are his one and only uncle?

339
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,425
Do not tell me…

340
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,930
it is because of the suspicion
regarding the late king's poisoning.

341
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,475
It is for another reason.

342
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,104
But you assured me
there could be no other reason.

343
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,188
Back in the day,

344
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,275
I once told you that I had a plan

345
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,238
I had worked on for a long time
to secure His Majesty's ascension.

346
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,365
I was the one…

347
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,995
who secretly informed Prince Rui

348
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,331
that the late king sent a spy to the Ming.

349
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,752
Why did you do such a thing?

350
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,636
That is exactly it.

351
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,599
You must feign ignorance like so
to the King as well.

352
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,225
Tell him you did not know

353
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,477
and that the Principal Director
is not a spy.

354
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,108
I sincerely did not know.

355
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,193
Did you

356
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,820
truly not notice any oddity?

357
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,031
Did you believe

358
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:56,578
the Qing troops' timely invasion of Uiju
when Grand Prince Jinhan was in trouble

359
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,372
and the late king's sudden passing

360
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,376
were all mere coincidences?

361
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,837
It is highly unseemly

362
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,882
to depreciate my services thusly.

363
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,938
Do not worry.

364
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:28,777
His Majesty cannot dare to cast me away.

365
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,239
If he dares to bring me down,

366
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,992
he will crumble before I do.

367
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,003
I hear Chu Dal-ha's interrogation
is being prepared.

368
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,214
We are currently selecting the judges.

369
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,758
However,

370
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,637
the court is complaining
because the criminal has not been named.

371
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,182
There is no chance
that Chu Dal-ha knows their name.

372
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,936
This must be by His Majesty's design.

373
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,817
I am worried as he seems to be

374
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,111
rushing the case for some reason.

375
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,447
If the court's resistance grows stronger,

376
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,368
his safety will be put at risk.

377
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,755
Bollocks! You cannot!

378
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,057
I must go to the palace today.

379
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,018
I must see His Majesty.

380
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,312
I have to look into Master Chu's case

381
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,565
and inform the Sixth Royal Secretary
about the recent developments as well.

382
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,235
You cannot go to the palace in this state.

383
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,987
I will go instead.

384
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,072
I shall go to the State Tribunal

385
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,532
-and the palace--
-Jageunnyeon.

386
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,872
Jageunnyeon.

387
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,584
Stop calling my name.

388
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,003
If you call me like that,

389
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,132
I cannot dissuade you from going.

390
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,804
Thank you.

391
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:06,559
Why did you come to the palace
when you have not fully recovered yet?

392
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,814
I came as I had something to tell you.

393
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,358
Is it because

394
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,945
I arrested Chu Dal-ha without telling you?

395
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,742
How would I dare
to comment on your decision?

396
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,285
Nevertheless,

397
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,289
if you arrested Chu Dal-ha to protect me

398
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,793
when you knew
it was all my crime and not his,

399
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,879
I must say you still do not know me well.

400
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,423
I decided to take measures first

401
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,843
as I anticipated you would react this way.

402
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,680
Was it because I am a woman?

403
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,391
It is because you are my woman.

404
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,817
This interrogation

405
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,902
is being held

406
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,406
to find the treacherous spy of the Qing
from three years ago.

407
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:06,578
This is a quest I have long striven for
and a duty I must fulfill.

408
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,957
What could I possibly do

409
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,335
if I had you bound in ropes as a traitor?

410
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,716
The fear that you might get hurt
would paralyze and bar me.

411
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,719
I understand how you feel.

412
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,264
I know guilt weighs on your heart.

413
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,516
However,

414
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,644
this is also what Chu Dal-ha wants.

415
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,314
Remember that and return home.

416
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,233
Your Majesty.

417
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,780
Is the spy who communicated with the Qing

418
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,950
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan?

419
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,122
I looked back
upon hearing the news of the abolition

420
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,207
of the Border Defense Council.

421
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,668
Having the Grand Prince
accompany you to the gisinje,

422
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,629
the substitution of the Princess,

423
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,382
and the appointment of the Crown Prince

424
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,513
were all a power struggle
between you and the Principal Director.

425
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,646
Three years ago,

426
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,067
when my father was taken to the Qing,

427
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,402
when Hongjang died,

428
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,698
and when I was at death's door,
I took a vow before the heavens

429
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,410
that I would dethrone the captivated king

430
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,995
and bring justice to the world.

431
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,040
And that I would make you feel the pain

432
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,919
and suffer the indignity of being betrayed
by the person you trusted.

433
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,756
But in hindsight,

434
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,051
the one who was captivated…

435
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,595
was me.

436
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,934
I was blinded by the captivation

437
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,563
and failed to see the man you truly are.

438
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,612
In truth,

439
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,032
I still do not understand, Your Majesty.

440
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,744
Attacking the Principal Director
will only endanger your reign.

441
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,082
For what reason
are you taking such a high risk?

442
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,589
I was ashamed.

443
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,346
Even a powerless commoner…

444
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,101
risks their lives

445
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,061
to carry out their duties.

446
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,771
But I, their king,

447
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,442
have failed to do anything.

448
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,864
Hiding the crimes I have committed…

449
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,995
has been eating me alive.

450
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,042
Are you referring to the crime

451
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,253
that you mentioned to me?

452
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,632
The one that began three years ago

453
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,177
and still continues to this day?

454
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,097
You will turn your back on me
if you learn what it is.

455
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,060
You will spit on my face,

456
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,270
condemn,

457
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,232
and loathe me.

458
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,572
If it is against your wishes,

459
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,407
you do not have to say anything.

460
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,662
What more can I hide from you?

461
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,714
When the late king passed away,
he gave me his last words.

462
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,967
Find…

463
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,512
the one who harmed me

464
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,057
and punish them.

465
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,101
And see to it

466
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,980
that the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne.

467
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,861
I went against my brother's last words
and ascended to the throne.

468
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,745
The man standing before you…

469
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,418
is a criminal who usurped the throne.

470
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,449
Your Majesty.

471
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,579
You ascended to the throne

472
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,331
to keep the late king's last words.

473
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,210
It was to protect
the Grand Prince and the Princess

474
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,006
that you became a criminal.

475
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,181
For the past three years,

476
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,645
I have been wandering,
lost in the Underworld.

477
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,275
However,

478
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,237
you are still in the Underworld.

479
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,959
I will stay by your side every step.

480
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,713
I will endure it all with you…

481
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,259
and be of support to you.

482
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,387
My lord.

483
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,223
His Royal Highness summons you.

484
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,037
Your Royal Highness.

485
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,791
Master Kang is here,
Sixth Royal Secretary.

486
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,555
The King has barred
my involvement in the interrogation.

487
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,101
I was worried when you
disappeared from Banchon Village,

488
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,978
but seeing as you are well,

489
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,525
I strongly suspect that you and the King
may be on the same side.

490
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,572
Even if Chu Dal-ha

491
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,949
names His Royal Highness or me
during his interrogation,

492
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,452
I will not be shocked.

493
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,707
I can assure you that will not happen.

494
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,084
Do not worry.

495
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,211
Then answer me.

496
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,757
How come you are all well
when Chu Dal-ha is at death's door?

497
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,467
Where have you been all this time?

498
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,266
Are you not the one
who proposed to plot treason together?

499
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,356
Perhaps the King

500
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,983
already has full knowledge of our plot.

501
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,114
Answer me.

502
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,292
What on earth has happened?

503
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,380
Chu Dal-ha…

504
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,842
attempted an assassination and failed.

505
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,554
It was because I was captivated

506
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,975
that I failed to see
the King's real intention.

507
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,352
But now,

508
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,146
I am certain of what it is.

509
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,983
The interrogation…

510
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,153
is His Majesty's measure
to protect His Royal Highness.

511
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,784
Can you swear to the heavens
that this is not a lie

512
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,786
to relieve me of my worries?

513
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,289
I swear on my life.

514
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,589
Had you not sworn,

515
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,384
I just might have believed you.

516
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,046
My lord.

517
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,089
Let us…

518
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,233
-He is over there.
-Right.

519
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,862
My goodness, how awful.

520
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,239
Thank you.

521
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,951
-You have half an hour.
-Yes, of course.

522
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:37,875
Master Chu.

523
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,753
We are here.

524
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,716
My lady.

525
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,512
How is your wound?

526
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,431
It is bearable.

527
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,351
How are you doing?

528
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,438
It is bearable for me as well.

529
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,776
Goodness, when did you prepare all this?

530
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,694
He will not be able to finish it all.

531
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,406
It is not even that much.

532
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,116
This is Bun-yeong's regular meal.

533
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,286
It was indeed very pleasing
to see her down a meal, was it not?

534
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,791
Please take good care of Bun-yeong.

535
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,962
I shall try.

536
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,008
Goodbye, my lady.

537
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,845
You.

538
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,472
Have you seen me somewhere?

539
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,433
I am not sure.

540
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,726
It is my first time seeing you.

541
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,146
Is that so?

542
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,067
Wait, Se-dong, do you remember that man?

543
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,446
The Principal Director's servant
we met for Bun-yeong's matter.

544
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,239
Do you mean Mak-dong? What about him?

545
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,367
Do you remember how he recognized me
when I had never seen him?

546
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,369
That is true.

547
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,539
He did ask you
if you had ever seen him somewhere.

548
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,500
What are you talking about?

549
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,378
Do give us an explanation
so we can understand.

550
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,548
Who is Mak-dong?

551
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,549
Three years ago,

552
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,428
there was a man
who told the Qing of all my movements.

553
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,014
Mak-dong,
the Principal Director's servant,

554
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,224
just may be that man.

555
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,109
So it is not that
Chu Dal-ha remembered Mak-dong,

556
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,196
but rather Mak-dong
who recognized him first?

557
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:31,989
But that alone

558
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,784
does not prove that Mak-dong
tailed Chu Dal-ha.

559
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,661
Nevertheless,

560
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,498
his being a servant
of the Principal Director

561
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,833
cannot be a mere coincidence.

562
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,753
Please have him questioned just in case.

563
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,053
Principal Director,
I apologize for coming at this hour.

564
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,347
It is fine.

565
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,390
What brings you here?

566
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,269
I am here to ask your servant,
Mak-dong, a few questions.

567
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,648
It is on His Majesty's order,
so please hand him over to us.

568
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,193
Summon Mak-dong.

569
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,154
My lord.

570
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,575
He left early today
to visit his relatives in his hometown.

571
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,370
He will be back in a few weeks.

572
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,706
Did you hear him?

573
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,418
I understand.

574
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,462
I shall return then.

575
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,114
I apologize, my lord.

576
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,409
I did recognize his face.

577
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,828
But I only saw him so long ago,

578
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,748
so I could not recollect who he was.

579
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,419
At least you remember now.

580
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,231
Mak-dong.

581
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,402
Thank you for your work.

582
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,031
I will not

583
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,409
forget your kindness, my lord.

584
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,211
Stop right there!

585
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,595
Arrest him!

586
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,721
-Yes, Captain!
-Yes, Captain!

587
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,826
Good work.

588
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,335
Take this letter to Uiju.

589
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,546
A month from now,

590
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,506
the Qing's envoy, Jung Je-pyo,

591
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,008
will arrive with a document approving
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

592
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,178
Tell him that I have sent you

593
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,639
and give him this letter.

594
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,307
Yes, my lord.

595
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,274
Your Majesty.

596
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,358
Forgive me.

597
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,986
Mak-dong, Principal Director
Park Jong-hwan's servant,

598
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,655
was found dead with his throat slit.

599
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,700
If his throat was slit,
that means he was murdered.

600
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,785
This was clearly to silence him.

601
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,341
Chief Royal Secretary.

602
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,676
Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,430
Summon Principal Director
Park Jong-hwan this instant!

604
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,514
Yes, Your Majesty.

605
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,475
Your Majesty.

606
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:13,604
I am not sure he will admit
his crimes of murdering Mak-dong.

607
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,647
I am not summoning him to question that.

608
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,941
Then for what, may I ask?

609
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,444
I must…

610
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,241
give my uncle his final warning.

611
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,677
His Majesty requests you inside.

612
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,991
Principal Director.

613
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,410
Confess your crimes and be punished.

614
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,204
I will not interrogate you if you do.

615
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:17,084
I am not sure which crime
you are referring to, Your Majesty.

616
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,127
Do you truly believe

617
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,922
your treasonous collusion with the Qing
can remain a secret?

618
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,927
When the interrogation begins,

619
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,180
all your crimes from murdering Mak-dong
to concealing your liaison with the Qing

620
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,642
to poisoning the late king to death
will be exposed.

621
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:37,854
Your Majesty.

622
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,898
With all due respect,

623
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,319
you cannot punish me
for the late king's death.

624
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:49,658
Even if a poisoning took place
and I gave out the order to do so,

625
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,744
you cannot expose those crimes.

626
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,456
If you punish me for them,

627
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,586
the people will think
that they were your doing.

628
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,006
And this will serve
as a pretext for treason,

629
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:08,135
which will then lead to your dethronement.

630
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,931
A pretext for treason?

631
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,148
A pretext for treason, you say.

632
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,445
The people believe

633
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,199
that I poisoned my brother
and my sister-in-law

634
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,534
to ascend to the throne

635
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,206
and committed depravity
by taking my brother's woman.

636
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,625
The people

637
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,462
condemn and point fingers at me
for being a pathetic king.

638
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:48,133
A king who lets
the Principal Director, his uncle,

639
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,970
take control of the court
and abuse his power as he sees fit

640
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,931
and also indulges himself in baduk

641
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,977
with the gidaeryeong,
a man whom he is attracted to

642
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,730
at Yeongchwijeong.

643
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,152
All my actions so far…

644
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,992
provided ample pretexts for treason.

645
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,921
That is why I am taking action now.

646
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,051
The king…

647
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,596
executing his own kin

648
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,808
who has recklessly wielded his power

649
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,437
will inspire the people more than ever.

650
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,694
Do not be concerned about treason.

651
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,153
All this is to prevent one.

652
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,488
I will give you one final chance.

653
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,451
Confess your crimes and be punished.

654
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:57,953
If you do,

655
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,247
I shall spare you from the humiliation

656
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,582
of being interrogated in the open.

657
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,625
What is your choice?

658
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,258
Allow me some time to think.

659
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,300
You have one day.

660
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,056
You will come here
at this exact hour tomorrow

661
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,684
and confess your crimes.

662
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:09,191
The spy who colluded with the Qing
that His Majesty is looking for.

663
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,319
That spy is you, is it not?

664
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,656
My lord.

665
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,576
Meet Kim Myung-ha.

666
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,039
Why do you suggest
that I meet him out of the blue?

667
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,708
Three years ago,

668
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,211
Minister of War Kim Jong-bae

669
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,380
suspected Grand Prince Jinhan
of being a Qing's spy.

670
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,300
The dispatch of a spy to the Ming

671
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,053
and the secret communications to the Qing

672
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,305
were all considered to be

673
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,643
Grand Prince Jinhan's machinations
to dispose of the late king

674
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,436
and ascend to the throne himself.

675
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,773
Back then,

676
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,069
I was impressed that Grand Prince Jinhan
had accomplished such feats.

677
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,156
That is why I abandoned Kim Jong-bae

678
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,742
and joined hands with him.

679
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,869
How interesting.

680
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,831
Continue.

681
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,419
After observing you closely
for a few days,

682
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,339
I realized that all those feats

683
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,844
were accomplished by you
and not His Majesty.

684
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,013
And it turned out the person
I wanted to serve

685
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,890
was not Grand Prince Jinhan.

686
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,061
It was you, my lord.

687
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,565
Watching His Majesty

688
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,236
state his will to punish the spy
who colluded with the Qing

689
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,324
filled me with fury.

690
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,743
If I were you,

691
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,205
I would have exploded in indignation.

692
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,418
After all your service to His Majesty

693
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,379
whereby you even put up with
the sordid business of being a spy,

694
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,464
His Majesty

695
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,550
fails to see…

696
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,140
Anyway,

697
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:09,227
what I wanted to say is

698
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:17,444
that a king who does not appreciate
a loyal subject is not worth lingering on.

699
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,158
Do you think Kim Myung-ha
would meet with me?

700
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,371
I shall act as your intermediary, my lord.

701
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,392
I told you to wait, did I not?

702
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,938
I came to convey a message
from the Principal Director.

703
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,866
So in other words,
the Principal Director is asking me

704
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,410
to join hands with him in treason.

705
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,704
What do you mean by treason?

706
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:14,000
We will ascend the Crown Prince
to the throne, his rightful place,

707
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:18,922
and liberate your father's soul
from his bitter resentments.

708
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,468
Park Jong-hwan

709
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,804
must be the spy.

710
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,056
Am I wrong?

711
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:36,856
It seemed you had a falling out
with the gidaeryeong.

712
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,235
Is that not right?

713
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,613
When the interrogation begins,

714
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:47,909
my name may roll off
of Chu Dal-ha's tongue,

715
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,203
but he could easily say yours.

716
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,289
He may end up naming both of us.

717
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,251
Therefore,

718
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,005
we must stand on the same side
as Principal Director Park Jong-hwan.

719
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,131
That is the only way

720
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,051
His Royal Highness, you, and I

721
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,679
can survive.

722
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,477
Why do you hesitate?

723
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,856
Do you not want revenge on the King
for your father's death?

724
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,740
Do think about it

725
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,826
and let me know by tomorrow morning.

726
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,727
Kim Myung-ha

727
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,855
wishes to join hands with you.

728
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,233
Words alone are not enough.

729
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,736
I need solid proof

730
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,948
that he will support me in this cause.

731
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,577
What kind of proof do you have in mind?

732
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,750
Convey this message to him.

733
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,765
Welcome, Sixth Royal Secretary.

734
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,396
What is going on here?

735
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,858
Father did not forget my wish
and gave me his approval

736
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,153
to play baduk with my master.

737
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,577
It has been a while
since I have seen you smile.

738
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,749
Do you think this is inappropriate
during my mother's mourning?

739
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,959
No, Your Royal Highness.

740
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,128
I was only happy to see you smile.

741
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,803
Is something the matter?

742
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,432
No, do not mind me.

743
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,665
Your Royal Highness.

744
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,126
Principal Director.

745
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,255
Sixth Royal Secretary.

746
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,800
Principal Director.

747
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,852
Your Royal Highness.

748
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,939
Please forgive me
for my negligence so far.

749
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,525
I shall visit you more often

750
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,778
and make sure to be of service to you.

751
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,991
Thank you.

752
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,423
Your Majesty.

753
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,092
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan is here.

754
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,597
State your crimes, Principal Director.

755
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,103
I apologize, Your Majesty.

756
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,650
But I have none to state.

757
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,820
I have been your loyal subject thus far

758
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,781
and have never been disloyal to you.

759
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,826
I have always been prepared
to give you my life if necessary.

760
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,495
However,

761
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,914
not even a royal command

762
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,833
can force me to falsely confess
crimes I did not commit,

763
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,419
for a smear against my reputation

764
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:13,132
equates to one against the reputation
of you and this nation.

765
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,467
You adamantly…

766
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,096
refuse…

767
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,808
to state your crimes?

768
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,018
Yes, Your Majesty.

769
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,729
As I have no more to say,

770
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,857
I shall excuse myself now.

771
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,884
Chief Royal Secretary.

772
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,470
Yes, Your Majesty.
Please give me your command.

773
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,432
I will summon the criminal
and interrogate him tomorrow,

774
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:03,933
so make sure to prepare.

775
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,644
Yes, Your Majesty.

776
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,899
Your Majesty.

777
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,360
With all due respect,

778
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,612
summoning the Principal Director

779
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,740
to the interrogation
without evidence or witness is risky.

780
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,993
The official's mistrust toward you
will only grow

781
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:24,996
and make it more difficult
to abolish the Border Defense Council.

782
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,874
In truth,

783
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,505
there is a witness and evidence

784
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,841
that I have been saving as a last resort.

785
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,140
Where might they be?

786
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:01,741
My lady.

787
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,785
Senior Court Lady Han is calling for you.

788
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,459
Lead the way.

789
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,153
Principal Director.

790
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,844
Why are you standing about?

791
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,053
Take it already.

792
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,807
Are you telling me to take my own life

793
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,685
now that you have no use for me?

794
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,479
How foolish.

795
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,401
Taking your life is a child's play.

796
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,487
I would not need this to do so.

797
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:25,783
Then what…

798
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,302
What would you do if I refused?

799
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,392
I shall report thusly
when His Majesty holds an interrogation.

800
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,478
"Senior Court Lady Dong

801
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,481
poisoned the late king to death for you,
Your Majesty."

802
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:03,070
His Majesty will not forgive you
for poisoning the late king to death.

803
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,407
If he forgave you,

804
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:10,828
he would become a depraved tyrant
who forsook the bond set by the heavens.

805
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,790
He will have you killed

806
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,584
to clear his name.

807
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,672
Do not be so foolish.

808
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,842
This is all for your sake.

809
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,889
Saving yourself

810
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,850
should always come first.

811
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,407
That is more like it.

812
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,950
Senior Court Lady Dong?

813
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,500
Are you all right?

814
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,927
Please wait.

815
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,433
Take it.

816
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,131
Stop acting generous
with that despicable face of yours.

817
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,718
You are nothing but a fraud

818
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,638
deceiving everyone
with your false appearance.

819
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,438
How you must want to boast
that you are His Majesty's only woman.

820
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,690
You have no chance.

821
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,737
You are neither a man nor a woman.

822
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,032
His Majesty's affection will not last.

823
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,372
I have no intention

824
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,584
to compete against you
for His Majesty's affection.

825
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,925
Of course not.

826
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,178
I do not care.

827
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,305
I am sick of everything.

828
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:17,682
I cannot…

829
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,185
carry on any longer.

830
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,401
Now,

831
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:32,071
I will carry out what tasks I can.

832
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,628
Your Majesty,
Senior Court Lady Dong is here.

833
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,609
You are the evidence
of my brother's murder

834
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,987
and the witness who bears knowledge

835
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,907
of Park Jong-hwan being the spy
who colluded with the Qing.

836
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:43,452
Chief State Councilor.

837
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,496
His Majesty urgently calls for you.

838
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:48,249
Did he also call for a Royal Secretary
and an official historian?

839
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,543
He only asked for you, my lord.

840
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,465
Are you suggesting
we send a spy to the Ming?

841
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:58,843
That is correct.

842
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,931
Last night,

843
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,767
His Majesty gave a secret order
to the Chief State Councilor.

844
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,520
Good work.

845
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:20,906
Senior Court Lady Dong.

846
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,746
Attend the interrogation
and confess your crimes tomorrow.

847
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,250
If you confess your crimes
and those of the Principal Director,

848
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,129
I will make a judgment
in light of your efforts.

849
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:36,964
You will be punished,

850
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,300
but not executed.

851
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:47,683
His Majesty will not forgive you
for poisoning the late king to death.

852
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:49,977
If he forgave you,

853
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,480
he would become a depraved tyrant
who forsook the bond set by the heavens.

854
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:58,027
He will have you killed to clear his name.

855
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:05,910
Your Majesty.

856
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,288
I shall follow your command.

857
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,375
In return,

858
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,758
please grant my request.

859
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,016
This is the final request…

860
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,687
that I will be making.

861
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,075
What is it?

862
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:22,504
CAPTIVATING THE KING

863
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,090
Even if I have to quash
all resistance from the court,

864
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,092
the interrogation will be held.

865
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,345
Bring an end to this case.

866
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,471
Enough!

867
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,431
Do you not see that you will be endangered

868
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,933
if you punish the Principal Director?

869
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,853
Answer my question!

870
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:41,940
You have held on so far
for this day to come, Your Majesty.

871
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,526
Treason? That is ridiculous.

872
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,653
Who informed you of such a lie?

873
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:50,407
The Emperor wishes
to play baduk with the gidaeryeong.

874
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:54,912
The Qing's envoy
must have caused you distress.

875
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:58,290
I do not understand these feelings.

876
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,042
I am afraid.

877
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:06,298
