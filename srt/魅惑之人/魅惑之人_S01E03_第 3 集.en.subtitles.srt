1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,380
Do you two…

3
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,467
know each other?

4
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,552
Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,888
Very well, at that.

6
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,891
Is that not true?

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,441
Your Highness.

8
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,736
Could I ask if you are here
to play baduk against him?

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,862
That is correct.

10
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,865
Are you here for the same reason?

11
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,908
Yes.

12
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,203
Please forgive me,
but you will have to let me play today.

13
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,251
But I came before you did.

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,544
I still have the priority.

15
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,464
We promised to play today long ago.

16
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,427
You tell him.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,609
My apologies.

18
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,199
I would like nothing more

19
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,618
than to insist that our game comes first,

20
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,579
but that would put you
in a difficult spot, Mongwoo.

21
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,165
I will let you off the hook.

22
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,544
Make no excuses next time.
Do you understand?

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,965
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,357
Your Highness.

25
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,156
-Step back.
-You step back, my lady.

26
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,615
Or…

27
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,493
shall I reveal everything to His Highness?

28
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,748
I shall see you again.

29
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,480
EPISODE 3

30
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,613
What is your name?

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,281
It is Hongjang.

32
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,409
We need some privacy. Please excuse us.

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,911
You may speak freely.

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,830
Hongjang is my trusted confidant.

35
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,541
How are you so brazen
when you do not know what I will say?

36
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,380
I will be outside.

37
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,424
Please speak in privacy.

38
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,475
Is the Chief State Councilor

39
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,144
aware of your escapade in such an attire?

40
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:54,943
Let me go.

41
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
Answer me.

42
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,112
Am I being interrogated?

43
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,155
Interrogated?

44
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,783
Do you even know
what happens in interrogation?

45
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,785
If you get reported
dressed as you are now,

46
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,704
Hanseong Magistracy will arrest you
for disturbing public order

47
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,873
with obscene and outrageous behavior.

48
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,834
You will be tortured
until your skin breaks and shows blood.

49
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,127
That is interrogation.

50
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,966
Do you understand

51
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,718
what kind of risk you are taking?

52
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,141
Even the Chief State Councilor
will not be able to cover up your crimes.

53
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,769
Failing to keep
his depraved daughter in order

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,021
will place him in danger too.

55
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,940
Are you threatening me?

56
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,444
If my words of concern

57
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,905
sounded like a threat, then fine.

58
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,242
Let it be a threat
as long as I can stop you from--

59
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,290
My lady!

60
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,711
My lady, what happened?

61
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,923
He seems to be suffering
from a sudden stomachache.

62
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,342
Word will spread if you call a physician,

63
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,095
so have the servants
take him to his house.

64
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,179
Yes, my lady.

65
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,520
Have a safe trip home.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,690
How do you know

67
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,400
Grand Prince Jinhan?

68
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,612
"Mongwoo"?

69
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,741
That was how His Highness addressed you.

70
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,576
You two looked very close.

71
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,123
Is he the reason you refuse to marry me?

72
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,630
I refuse to marry you

73
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,718
because you are an awful baduk player
who does not heed others' words.

74
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,721
On top of that,
you are dull and utterly disrespectful.

75
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,309
Do not blame others for your flaws.

76
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,065
What can I do
to make you understand how I feel?

77
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,944
Do you still consider me
as a potential marriage partner

78
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,947
despite my obscene
and outrageous behavior?

79
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,657
My heart for you remains the same.

80
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,911
No matter how angry you are,
do not belittle

81
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,413
my feelings for you.

82
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,754
I am only saying this out of concern.
Quit this act now.

83
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,674
I have

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,636
a reason for doing this.

85
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,804
Is that reason

86
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,014
more important than your reputation?

87
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,309
Is it more important than your family
and your father's honor?

88
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,769
I do this to save people.

89
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,567
If it is for such a noble cause,

90
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,238
I assume you would not mind me
informing the Chief State Councilor.

91
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,621
My lord, this is Hongjang.

92
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,081
I have brought a servant.

93
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,625
What will you do?

94
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,837
It is up to you.

95
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,535
Never did I imagine
I would be forced to quit like this.

96
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,498
You could not have continued this
for a long time anyway.

97
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,003
You did enough.

98
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,255
Do not be distressed.

99
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,968
Thank you for saying that.

100
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,723
Does His Highness

101
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,267
weigh on your mind?

102
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,401
I will not be able to
keep my promise to him.

103
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,446
There is no helping it.

104
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,950
But…

105
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,457
I do not understand why
my heart feels so painful.

106
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,712
It is only natural.

107
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,925
How could you not be in pain
when you are cutting ties with your love?

108
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,932
My lady.

109
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,640
When I asked him to play baduk with me,

110
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,518
he made all sorts of excuses
to avoid playing.

111
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,686
But with Kim Myung-ha,

112
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,898
he even agreed on a date
in advance, did he?

113
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,531
What he hides from me,
I am sure he shares with Kim Myung-ha.

114
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,865
Does…

115
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,742
Does he know his name too?

116
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,293
That is not important anyway.

117
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,964
Your Highness, this is Sang-hwa.

118
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,178
I have brought tea.

119
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,305
Leave it.

120
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,105
Something must not be going your way.

121
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,231
That is not true.

122
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,862
Do not act like you understand the game
when you have no idea.

123
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,739
Yes, Your Highness.

124
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,993
But…

125
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,370
why are you so upset?

126
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,457
Did something happen
between you and Mongwoo?

127
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,460
Do not tell me

128
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,004
you lost to him again.

129
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,672
Goodness.

130
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,968
I did not even have the chance
to sit in front of the baduk table.

131
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,388
He had a previous engagement,

132
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,682
so I just came home.

133
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,774
What is it?

134
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,527
What are you trying to imply
by that disrespectful noise?

135
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,405
Please forgive me. It was nothing.

136
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,326
Sorry?

137
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,286
How dare you?

138
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,748
Right, so…

139
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,125
You are upset and frustrated

140
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,421
as you did not even get to place a stone
though you went to see him in excitement.

141
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,257
Do you like him that much?

142
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,012
Yes, I do.

143
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,265
I do not simply like him.

144
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,476
I am very fond of him.

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,105
In my eyes, he is just a common gambler.

146
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,107
Why do you like him so much?

147
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,360
He trusted me

148
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,655
when no one else did.

149
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,242
When people turned away from me
and condemned me,

150
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,661
he fought on my behalf.

151
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,414
You have me as well.

152
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,084
You are my right-hand man, Sang-hwa.

153
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,760
Shall I go find him and drag him here?

154
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,761
Leave him be.

155
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,556
We promised to meet again
on the day of mongwoo.

156
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,976
What if he forgets and does not show up?

157
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,729
He will not forget.

158
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,985
I have something he desperately wants.

159
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,627
Your Highness,
are you entering the palace?

160
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,837
Yes.

161
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,131
If you will excuse me.

162
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,383
By the way…

163
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,431
how was baduk that day?

164
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,019
The thing is,

165
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,520
we were not able to play.

166
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,521
He…

167
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,486
Mongwoo had to attend to
an urgent and important matter,

168
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,112
so he had to leave the capital.

169
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,364
We bade each other farewell
soon after you left.

170
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,074
An urgent and important matter?

171
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,328
Did something happen to him?

172
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,915
I do not know,
as he did not share the news.

173
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,250
However,

174
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,546
he mentioned that he would not be able to
return for a long time.

175
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,658
MONGWOO

176
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,618
From now on,

177
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,745
you are Mongwoo.

178
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,372
My manghyeongjiu,

179
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,332
Mongwoo.

180
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,529
Are you happy?

181
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,072
Of course.

182
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,284
My heart feels so light
that I might even start to float.

183
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,962
Please hold onto this.

184
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,089
I will take it back

185
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,425
the next time there is a drizzle.

186
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,971
He mentioned that he would not be able to
return for a long time.

187
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,348
It does not matter.

188
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,810
We made a promise,

189
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,353
so I shall wait.

190
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,116
Open the gates!

191
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,452
I have an urgent report from Uiju!

192
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,357
Your Majesty.

193
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,444
The Nightshift Royal Secretary
urgently requests an audience.

194
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,782
Let him enter.

195
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,605
Summon the officials
of the Border Defense Council immediately!

196
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,773
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,282
Why has His Majesty
summoned the Border Defense Council?

198
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,368
A report arrived from Uiju.

199
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,037
A large group of Qing troops
have been stationed at the border,

200
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,789
with some invading Uiju.

201
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,252
Did the Magistrate of Uiju
bring the report himself?

202
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,586
He sent a messenger.

203
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,548
Magistrate Ko Myeong-tak
was captured first and had his hair cut.

204
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,884
Interpreter Jung is on his way
as the envoy's proxy.

205
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,595
They must have had a justifiable cause
for mobilizing the troops.

206
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,930
What is that cause?

207
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,974
Well…

208
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,436
There has been a report
of a breach of the peace treaty

209
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,354
whereby a spy named Chu Dal-ha

210
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,440
was dispatched to the Ming
to communicate with them.

211
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,235
Did you just say Chu Dal-ha?

212
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,654
Do you recognize the name?

213
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,118
If you will excuse me.

214
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126
How do you know him?

215
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,587
Years ago,

216
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,881
he served as an officer
of the Central Army.

217
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,049
Recently,

218
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,302
I have seen him at a courtesan's house
that Grand Prince Jinhan frequents.

219
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,764
Are you saying you saw
the Grand Prince meeting with him?

220
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,433
That is correct.

221
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,311
I saw them clearly with my two eyes.

222
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,482
Keep this a secret

223
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,484
for the time being.

224
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,402
Do you understand?

225
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,321
Yes, my lord.

226
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,326
Your Majesty.

227
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,953
The Qing's invasion of the border

228
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,581
and forcing the Magistrate of Uiju
to take on their hairstyle

229
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,251
show their utter disregard
for both you and your court.

230
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,296
Please condemn their actions
upon Interpreter Jung's arrival

231
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,467
and order them
to leave our land immediately!

232
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,472
I concur with the Principal Director
of the Privy Council.

233
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:23,060
We cannot stand idly and watch
such atrocities of those brutes!

234
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,686
It is only right

235
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,232
to send our troops
to discipline and drive them out!

236
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,277
I beg for your understanding!

237
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,948
-I beg for your understanding!
-I beg for your understanding!

238
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,416
The disgrace I endured during the last war
has been engraved into my bones,

239
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,795
and the pain from it
makes me tremble to this day!

240
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,340
Yet you still want me
to take action against the Qing?

241
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,429
Minister of War, answer me.

242
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,685
Must I mobilize the troops?

243
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,939
Your Majesty.

244
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,485
We must be prepared for war
when mobilizing the troops.

245
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,779
If we go against them
without a solid plan,

246
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,448
yet another war will be inevitable.

247
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,368
It would be foolish to take such action.

248
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,663
I would rather be a disgraced commoner

249
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,790
than lead the country into a losing battle

250
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,419
and become a nuisance
to you and this nation.

251
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,215
Speak your ideas.

252
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,972
Your Majesty.

253
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,517
Interpreter Jung is making way
as we speak.

254
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,352
I will have a meeting with him

255
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,856
and investigate this incident thoroughly.

256
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:55,485
It will not be too late
to come up with a solution after that.

257
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,325
We shall do that.

258
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,830
Minister Kim, you will accompany
the Chief State Councilor to the meeting.

259
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,917
-We shall carry out your command.
-We shall carry out your command.

260
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
Master.

261
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,219
I will join you too.

262
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,845
I will be of help.

263
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,682
You have given enough help.

264
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,601
However, Master…

265
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,146
This is not your place to interfere,
Your Highness!

266
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,273
Please stay back.

267
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,368
Principal Drafter Kim.

268
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,001
Interpreter Jung likes to flaunt his power

269
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,712
and is overeager for a chance
to distinguish himself.

270
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,674
Thus, he will try to worsen the situation.

271
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,301
Keep that in mind when making decisions.

272
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,015
I will, Your Highness.

273
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,696
Do you have any idea

274
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,449
how great the Emperor's wrath was?

275
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,827
Everyone was trembling

276
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,830
as one outspoken word
could cost their lives.

277
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,958
One must crawl before him
to dare seek his audience!

278
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,044
Things were so bad

279
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,090
that even Prince Rui
ordered us to fend for ourselves!

280
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:44,136
This is a bolt out of the blue
for Joseon's court as well.

281
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,890
You know better than anyone
the amount of effort we have put in

282
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,601
to maintain the peace between the nations.

283
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,937
That very knowledge is what bothers me.

284
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,815
You may grovel and flatter
before the Qing's presence,

285
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,359
but you continue to fraternize
with the Ming in secret.

286
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,821
I am more than well aware
of your discourteous nature.

287
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,949
Did Chu Dal-ha

288
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,202
confess that he received an order

289
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,122
from His Majesty and the court?

290
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,165
That rogue

291
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,876
is a madman.

292
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,962
He must have nerves of steel.

293
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,422
We poked and prodded him

294
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,133
and even threatened
to have both his eyes plucked.

295
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,260
In the end,
we did pluck out one of his eyes,

296
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,263
but he stayed silent.

297
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,976
Is there a way

298
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,189
to soothe the Emperor's wrath?

299
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,192
This incident

300
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,153
is a direct violation of a clause
in the peace treaty

301
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,448
and a clear act of betrayal.

302
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,532
Therefore,

303
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,410
would you not agree
that the price needs to be paid?

304
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,746
And what would that be?

305
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,417
Find the man

306
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,211
behind this spy.

307
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,630
I do not care who it is.

308
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,132
If we take that criminal to Shenyang

309
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,385
and make them confess their sins
and be punished before the Emperor,

310
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,597
it just might appease his ire.

311
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,647
The man behind the spy?

312
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,235
How dare a mere interpreter
belittle His Majesty with such vile words?

313
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,654
What if Chu Dal-ha
was dispatched to the Ming

314
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,406
by someone else's order?

315
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,450
That is ridiculous.

316
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,995
Who else would dare dispatch a spy
other than His Majesty?

317
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,331
You are right.

318
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,458
If someone else acted thusly,

319
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,003
they must be treacherous indeed.

320
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,840
-Treacherous?
-What is he implying?

321
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,384
Who could have dared to harbor
such heinous thoughts?

322
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,177
Do you have someone you suspect?

323
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,638
Chu Dal-ha.

324
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,100
That man frequented
a certain courtesan house…

325
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,939
and Grand Prince Jinhan
was seen visiting the place.

326
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,234
-The Grand Prince?
-What?

327
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,485
Minister Kim.

328
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,864
It is wise to avoid saying things
you cannot take responsibility for.

329
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,533
Unless you have a life to spare, that is.

330
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,453
It slipped my mind

331
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,707
that you were his uncle,
Principal Director.

332
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,624
However,

333
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,210
it seems like
you are forgetting something as well.

334
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,379
The principal director

335
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,257
is a mere honorary position

336
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,343
with nothing but a name.

337
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,181
You are His Majesty's subject.

338
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,059
Your eagerness to get the Prince Royal
to be named the heir is understandable.

339
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,437
But being so easily swayed

340
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,522
by a mere hound of the outlanders

341
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,025
is distasteful, is it not?

342
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,203
I should have listened to you

343
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,955
when you advised me against sending a spy.

344
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,583
Do you not agree?

345
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,837
They say the Qing's might is on the rise,

346
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,758
but the Ming is just as powerful as them.

347
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,012
Sending a spy was your last resort
in these difficult times

348
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,556
to protect this nation and its people

349
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,017
and to avoid suffering from war.

350
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,977
I carried out your command

351
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,897
as I understood your intention.

352
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,487
Continue speaking.

353
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,283
Though their troops have invaded our land,

354
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,118
their chief envoy was not sent forth.

355
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,205
Seeing as Interpreter Jung was dispatched,

356
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,915
their goal seems to be

357
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,754
ensuring that we sever ties with the Ming
rather than going to war.

358
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,924
Then…

359
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,760
what do you propose I do?

360
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,348
I will kneel before the Emperor of Qing

361
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,685
and confess my crimes.

362
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,279
I cannot allow that.

363
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,076
Your Majesty.

364
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,455
No official will volunteer aside from me,

365
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,667
and the Emperor
will not accept anyone else either.

366
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,713
Please give me your approval

367
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,465
for my request, Your Majesty.

368
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,774
It seems like

369
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,778
the Chief State Councilor
will be taking all the blame.

370
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,990
The matter should not be let to rest

371
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,200
with a treasonous criminal out and about.

372
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,494
A treasonous criminal?

373
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,913
Are you suspecting Grand Prince Jinhan?

374
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,665
It is not a mere suspicion.

375
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,875
I am convinced.

376
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,753
Is there anyone

377
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,298
who can bear witness
that the Grand Prince is behind Chu Dal-ha

378
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,466
other than yourself?

379
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,259
A courtesan named Hongjang

380
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,263
and her patron, a baduk gambler,
are in league with the Grand Prince.

381
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,390
If we bring them in for interrogation,

382
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,642
I think we can get them to confess.

383
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,064
Listen to my order carefully
and carry it out,

384
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,691
Assistant Section Chief Yoo.

385
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
Yes, my lord.

386
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,616
Father.

387
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:43,745
What do you mean
by saying that you must travel afar?

388
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,289
Are you going to the Qing as an envoy?

389
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,335
It is something of the sort.

390
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,297
When will you be leaving?

391
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,883
I will need to prepare
clothes and other provisions,

392
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,469
but I fear I might not be able to
within a short time.

393
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,929
There is no need for that.

394
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,847
I will take care of it.

395
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,476
Father.

396
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,603
Are you really

397
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,939
going as an envoy?

398
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:15,985
Hee-soo.

399
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,074
My lord.

400
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,660
What is it?

401
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,625
You have a guest, my lord.

402
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,085
Did they mention their name?

403
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,337
It is Grand Prince Jinhan.

404
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,132
It is late today.

405
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,884
Tell him I will go see him tomorrow.

406
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,098
Why are you standing there?

407
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,183
Well…

408
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,020
He said he would not leave
until he could speak to you.

409
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,774
All right then.

410
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,713
Your Highness.

411
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,631
-Master.
-Good grief.

412
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,092
Please forgive me
for intruding at this hour.

413
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,556
Is she your daughter?

414
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,266
Yes.

415
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,393
She is my only daughter.

416
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,023
Dear, come greet His Highness.

417
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,651
What are you doing, my lady?

418
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,612
Hurry up and greet His Highness.

419
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,620
Please forgive her.

420
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,831
She must be bewildered
to be in your presence so suddenly

421
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,000
and must be feeling shy.

422
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,168
It is all right.

423
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,087
I have no time for greetings.

424
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,382
I came in a rush as I must speak to you
on an urgent matter.

425
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,676
Please come in.

426
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,359
My lady.

427
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,488
The world must be bigger
than what I had imagined.

428
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,991
I never thought I would see someone
more handsome than Lord Kim.

429
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,785
Who is he?

430
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,579
He is Grand Prince Jinhan.

431
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,624
You mean

432
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,418
the King's younger brother
who recently returned from the Qing?

433
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,296
I wonder what brought him here
at this late hour.

434
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,507
Are you curious?

435
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,133
Shall I look into it?

436
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,053
How would you manage that?

437
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,013
Master.

438
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,266
Please send me in your stead.

439
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,268
I will go forth

440
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,144
and persuade Prince Rui.

441
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
As long as Prince Rui is convinced,

442
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,774
the Emperor's wrath
will be subsided in no time.

443
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,025
I cannot do that.

444
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,488
What is the reason?

445
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,033
Chu Dal-ha is my man.

446
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,662
I carried it out on His Majesty's orders,

447
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,956
so it is only right that I go.

448
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,375
I already feel terrible
about the rumor of you being a spy.

449
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,253
I cannot burden you with another concern.

450
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,089
Is that why

451
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,301
you told me to stay back

452
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,679
when you were
going to meet Interpreter Jung?

453
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,850
When the rumor about you
spread across the capital,

454
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,478
I was going to counsel His Majesty
that should you be called a spy,

455
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,857
it was only right to call you
His Majesty's spy of my choosing

456
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,026
and not a spy of Prince Rui.

457
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,320
However, it has been some time

458
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,699
since His Majesty did not heed me
on matters regarding you.

459
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,118
It is because of that clause
in the peace treaty.

460
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,787
"If an unexpected event befalls you,

461
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,083
the hostage that I have taken
will inherit the throne."

462
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,793
I was informed

463
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,796
Prince Rui asked the Emperor
to add such a clause.

464
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,256
He is a terrifying man.

465
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,344
He kept me close as if I was his favorite,
listening to my requests.

466
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,721
Taking me to his battle,

467
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,348
approving my sudden repatriation,

468
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,142
and releasing our people so benevolently.

469
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,311
All that must be
a part of his devious trick

470
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,022
to control me and my brother
and breed enmity between us.

471
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,152
Did his devious trick
affect you in any way?

472
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,279
Yes.

473
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,615
It did, indeed.

474
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,284
While watching innocent people

475
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,455
being stomped to death
by the hooves of the Qing cavalry,

476
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,709
I thought that such a tragic war
should never happen again.

477
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,752
And if…

478
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,213
such a war is inevitable,

479
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,592
I would fight to win at all costs.

480
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,972
Your Highness.

481
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,056
Master.

482
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,184
I know Prince Rui.

483
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,019
I know the tricks up his sleeves.

484
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,938
Please send me instead.

485
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,316
I can fight against him.

486
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,172
Leaving to confess my crimes
to the Emperor of Qing

487
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,259
is my duty as His Majesty's subject

488
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,844
and the head of the court.

489
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,846
I cannot burden you

490
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,724
with such an important task.

491
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,479
You must be faithful to your duties,
Your Highness.

492
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,981
Stay by His Majesty's side.

493
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:49,193
Do you think he will
keep me by his side with you gone?

494
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,989
Do you remember the words
of the wise scholars that I read

495
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,450
on the first day of our class?

496
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,998
To wish for life when you love them…

497
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,376
and death when you hate them.

498
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,796
Wishing them to live
while wishing them to die.

499
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,884
That is what it means to be captivated.

500
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,344
Those words

501
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,223
have been His Majesty's favorite
since his days at the Royal Institute.

502
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,976
His Majesty is trying his utmost

503
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,354
to be freed from being captivated.

504
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:30,359
You must also be careful
not to be captivated, Your Highness.

505
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,448
As long as both of you try your best
to escape captivation,

506
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,952
the good old days
of the two loving brothers

507
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,370
shall return one day.

508
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,582
Master.

509
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,211
I might continue lecturing you
if I stay any longer.

510
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,921
Please excuse me.

511
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,631
Please…

512
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,841
return home safely.

513
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,384
Hee-soo.

514
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,012
Father.

515
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,976
I mulled over what you told me earlier

516
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,353
about the long-distance trip.

517
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,898
I simply must follow you this time.

518
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,863
My dear Hee-soo.

519
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,947
Do not try to stop me.

520
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,576
No matter what you say,

521
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,328
I will not listen.

522
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,960
I am traveling under a royal command.

523
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,963
As a criminal.

524
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,346
I will return safely

525
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,433
like I always have.

526
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,740
Father…

527
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,660
My dear.

528
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,166
You must also

529
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,919
stay safe and sound.

530
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,005
Do you understand?

531
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,566
Please do not be distressed.

532
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,903
The matter is something
beyond your control.

533
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,154
I wish to be left alone.

534
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,406
Please leave me be.

535
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,098
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

536
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,392
I am here to see Interpreter Jung.

537
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,018
Please report to him.

538
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,946
The Minister of War
told me to show you a letter

539
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,115
and to get an answer from you.

540
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,535
I brought ten such chests.

541
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,872
You girls may leave.

542
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,640
What…

543
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,642
What is this?

544
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,061
Grand Prince Jinhan

545
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,148
is the one who had Chu Dal-ha's back?

546
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,607
It is as you read.

547
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,778
Grand Prince Jinhan, Yi In,
is Chu Dal-ha's backer,

548
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,033
and the mastermind
who sent him to the Ming as a spy.

549
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,285
So?

550
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,412
Do you have evidence or witnesses?

551
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,080
Of course.

552
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,083
There is a witness
who is willing to attest to it.

553
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,502
If it is not an effective
witness or evidence,

554
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,755
you can forget this.

555
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,341
If this falls through,

556
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,260
the Grand Prince
will rush forward to have my head.

557
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,779
I cannot delay the trip to Uiju

558
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,115
as a Qing commander with a greatsword
is waiting for me.

559
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,909
But what I can do

560
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,994
is to travel slowly.

561
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,663
That means…

562
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,916
I can attempt to buy a few days

563
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,793
after we arrive at Uiju.

564
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,545
If Grand Prince Jinhan is brought by then,

565
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,675
I will give you my word
to transfer him to the Qing.

566
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,181
I shall convey your message.

567
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,002
Your Majesty.

568
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,547
Please be healthy and well

569
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,716
until the day we meet again.

570
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,540
My lord.

571
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,251
Do not worry about Lady Hee-soo.

572
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,587
I will look after her.

573
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,423
Thank you.

574
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,588
Step back!

575
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,772
My lord.

576
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,607
Step back.

577
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,275
My lord!

578
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,612
Excuse me.

579
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,447
Step back.

580
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,408
These are padded clothes
to help him withstand the North's cold!

581
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,702
Is it so wrong to bring him some clothes?

582
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,121
-I told you to step back!
-Goodness.

583
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,624
-Jageunnyeon…
-You should be careful.

584
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,459
Thank you.

585
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,964
Excuse me.

586
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,758
-I said--
-Thank you for all your work.

587
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,010
Thank you.

588
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,138
My lord.

589
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,897
My lady.

590
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,034
Your Highness.

591
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,453
I am afraid you must go back.

592
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,540
Will he not take herbal medicine today?

593
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,501
That is not it.

594
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,045
He is distressed
about the Chief State Councilor

595
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,464
and ordered me
to forbid anyone from coming in.

596
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,009
I understand.

597
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,470
Please look after His Majesty.

598
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,098
Yes, Your Highness.

599
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,369
My lady, look.

600
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,510
What brings you here?

601
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,485
I brought the Chief State Councilor's
court robe.

602
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,585
I promised him
that I would look after you.

603
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,380
Send me word
if there is anything I can help you with.

604
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,881
I will come to you immediately.

605
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,053
Thank you for your words,

606
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,723
but I will not be needing your help.

607
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,573
I have the horse ready.

608
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,909
Where shall we go?

609
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,954
Take me wherever it may be,

610
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,872
where I can ride with the wind.

611
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,871
I am lonely.

612
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,293
I feel so lonely.

613
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,717
Comfort me, will you?

614
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,279
Your Majesty.

615
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,242
The Minister of War, Kim Jong-bae,
requests an audience.

616
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,832
Not today.

617
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,334
Tell him to come back again.

618
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:18,961
Your Majesty.

619
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,589
It is an urgent matter
that must be dealt with immediately.

620
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:28,971
Let him in.

621
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,066
What is this very urgent matter
that must be dealt with immediately?

622
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,027
Your Majesty.

623
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:48,782
We have a witness
willing to attest to the spy incident.

624
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,831
That matter has long been dealt with.

625
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,502
Tell me, who are they attesting against?

626
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,672
Grand Prince Jinhan,

627
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,674
Yi In, Your Majesty.

628
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,390
Nonsense.

629
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,309
It is not nonsense.

630
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,770
Someone witnessed Grand Prince Jinhan
meeting the spy, Chu Dal-ha,

631
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,856
and came forward to report it.

632
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,024
Enough!

633
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,780
The Chief State Councilor
has sacrificed himself for all the crimes!

634
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,491
So why are you still on this case?

635
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,955
Your Majesty.

636
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,209
Kang Hang-soon only sacrificed himself
in order to deceive you and the court

637
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,671
and to hide Grand Prince Jinhan's crimes.

638
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,051
He would never deceive me.

639
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,970
Do not speak ill of him.

640
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,140
Kang Hang-soon had exchanged letters

641
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,351
with the Grand Prince
while he was in Shenyang.

642
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,354
What if he has an ulterior motive
other than seeking punishment?

643
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,147
What if it is to seek
the Emperor's approval

644
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:07,277
to have Grand Prince Jinhan
ascend to the throne?

645
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,783
Are you saying…

646
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,079
that Kang Hang-soon

647
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,667
plotted treason with my brother
and deceived me?

648
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:25,754
I am convinced

649
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,048
that is the case.

650
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,015
Can you swear this on your life?

651
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,149
If it is to continue your reign

652
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,194
and to punish the traitors,

653
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,238
then yes,

654
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,324
I can swear my life

655
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,827
a thousand times over.

656
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,175
His Majesty has given his approval.

657
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,302
Arrest anyone who may attest

658
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,805
that the Grand Prince
is behind Chu Dal-ha, the spy,

659
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,267
as well as everyone with connections
to the Grand Prince.

660
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,268
Yes, my lord.

661
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,646
-Goodness, what is going on?
-What is happening?

662
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,982
-Goodness me.
-Oh, my.

663
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,696
Why do you look so surprised?

664
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,865
Kill me or spare me.

665
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,575
Do as you please.

666
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,828
You foolish thing.

667
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,831
Do you think I am doing this
just to arrest you?

668
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,545
Do expect the worst.

669
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:53,675
Grand Prince Jinhan and that baduk gambler

670
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,887
shall both accompany you
to the underworld.

671
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,182
Take her.

672
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,516
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

673
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,059
My lady!

674
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,233
Out of the way!

675
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,278
Arrest all baduk gamblers you see!

676
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,362
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

677
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,997
No! That table is mine!

678
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,457
Get him!

679
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,043
Let me go!

680
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,255
Oh, my. My lady!

681
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,972
Goodness, she is home.

682
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,447
My lady!

683
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,699
My lady!

684
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,622
Please stop!

685
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,584
Stop the torture!

686
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,590
Speak the name of the baduk gambler.

687
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,135
I do not know.

688
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,471
I really do not know.

689
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,932
How many times do I have to tell you?

690
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,475
It is true.

691
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,769
We had to win to learn his name,

692
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,021
but none of us did.

693
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,287
You know his name, do you not?

694
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,874
If you speak his name,

695
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,376
I will spare your life.

696
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,313
Do not stop the torture
until they speak of the name.

697
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,689
That is enough!

698
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,404
My lord.

699
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,906
What shall I do?

700
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,748
Do not stop and continue.

701
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,486
Did you hear the news?

702
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,821
Kim Jong-bae has taken over
the State Tribunal

703
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,325
and is arresting anyone
acquainted with the Grand Prince.

704
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,618
For what reason?

705
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,580
He seems to suspect
that His Highness is behind the spy.

706
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,916
Where is His Highness?

707
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,751
He is neither in his residence
nor the palace.

708
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,419
He must have left the capital.

709
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,007
Did you not say

710
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,345
you had a plan for the Grand Prince?

711
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,931
But look what happened.

712
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,266
How could he be the man behind the spy?

713
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,519
Please calm down, Your Royal Highness.

714
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,106
His Majesty knows that cannot be true
better than anyone.

715
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,441
The Qing knows this as well,

716
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,693
so if you wait a little--

717
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,986
Shut that mouth of yours!

718
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,949
Stop blabbering

719
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,995
and go find a way
to save the Grand Prince.

720
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,288
Immediately.

721
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,047
The capital has been turned upside down.

722
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:06,219
I hear the King has ordered
the arrest of all baduk gamblers.

723
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,137
And they say

724
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,349
it is because of the dashing Grand Prince
who came to visit your father last time.

725
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,393
Because of Grand Prince Jinhan?

726
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,437
For what reason?

727
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,024
The leader of the patrol said something,
but I could not understand.

728
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,067
Anyway,

729
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,071
even Hongjang got dragged away
by the patrolmen right before my eyes.

730
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,552
My lord.

731
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,512
Someone is here to see you.

732
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,488
Are you the one looking for me?

733
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,203
Are you insane? How could you come here?

734
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,581
I heard you were torturing
innocent people to find me.

735
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,749
So I came.

736
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,126
Do not be a fool and go home.

737
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,339
-Stop.
-Let me go.

738
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,218
Look who is here.

739
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,972
Are you not Hongjang's patron?

740
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,102
Arrest him immediately.

741
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,019
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

742
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,365
I see you have come on your own will.

743
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,827
Are you here to turn yourself in?

744
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,538
Forgive my boldness,

745
00:56:56,621 --> 00:57:00,125
but I only came to prove the innocence
of these people and the Grand Prince.

746
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,382
What an interesting man.

747
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,050
Fine.

748
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,469
Let us hear what you have to say.

749
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,721
As far as I know,

750
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,849
Grand Prince Jinhan
does not know Chu Dal-ha.

751
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,394
And Chu Dal-ha
has never met the Grand Prince.

752
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,854
I do not know who attested

753
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,939
that the Grand Prince
is behind Chu Dal-ha,

754
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,442
but I am certain that they are lying.

755
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,820
My lord.

756
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,573
His words are not to be trusted.

757
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,659
Why would a baduk gambler
who gambles around with the Grand Prince

758
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,786
tell the truth?

759
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,788
You are the one
who should speak the truth.

760
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:40,999
Why are you

761
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,751
defaming the innocent Grand Prince
in the sacred State Tribunal?

762
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,421
If you are doing this

763
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,007
out of a grudge against him
for helping out your sister,

764
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,510
I advise you to confess
and right the wrongs.

765
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,595
Shut your mouth.

766
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:58,391
Who do you think you are
to run your mouth about me?

767
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,019
Is persecuting and agonizing
your sister not enough?

768
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,314
Why are you trying to have her killed
with false charges?

769
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,733
-You bastard--
-Enough.

770
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,159
That is enough.

771
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,372
Do you have more to say?

772
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,042
My lord.

773
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,213
I know it is against the law
to arrest people without evidence

774
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,049
and interrogate them
while inflicting torture

775
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,967
just because they are acquainted
with a suspect.

776
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,262
Please be generous

777
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,724
so that innocent people
may not suffer further.

778
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,143
I beg for a lenient treatment.

779
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,564
Every word you have spoken is right.

780
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,524
However,

781
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,528
in such a turbulent time
with war looming over the nation,

782
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,489
generosity and leniency from officials

783
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,534
are poisons that crumble the nation.

784
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,790
-Sorry?
-Before you prove others of innocence,

785
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,292
you must prove your innocence first.

786
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,461
What are you waiting for?

787
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,089
Arrest him at once
and submit him to interrogation!

788
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,090
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

789
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,134
My lord.

790
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,053
Let me go!

791
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,767
Stop right this moment!

792
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,873
Let go of him.

793
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,133
I said, let go.

794
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:04,934
Are you all right?

795
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,396
Your Highness.

796
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,190
Your Highness.

797
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,613
You have intruded and interfered
with the questioning

798
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,740
that was being carried out
under a royal command.

799
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,576
What insolent behavior is this?

800
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,704
I would like to
return that question to you.

801
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,166
Did you forget that His Majesty
decreed against senseless torture?

802
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,835
This is under His Majesty's approval.

803
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,387
His Majesty could not have told you
to go against the law.

804
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,515
He clearly ordered me
to torture the criminals

805
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,559
until they confessed.

806
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,280
Stop torturing innocent people

807
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,408
and question me directly.

808
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,292
A tiny blade fit for a rabbit

809
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,754
would be ill-suited for a tiger hunt.

810
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,300
I shall question you

811
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,720
once I have gathered
proper evidence and witnesses.

812
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,807
So please be patient.

813
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,231
I will meet His Majesty
and speak to him myself.

814
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,982
Stop the interrogation until then.

815
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,860
If you lay a finger on them,

816
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,572
I will not sit back.

817
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,244
Understood.

818
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,256
I will return to save you.

819
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,426
Do not worry and wait. Do you understand?

820
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,203
Your Majesty.

821
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,540
Grand Prince Jinhan requests an audience.

822
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,338
Let him in.

823
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,408
When the outlanders let you go unscathed,

824
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,952
I should have killed you then.

825
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,747
Then Kang Hang-soon

826
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,042
would not have joined you
and plotted to overthrow me.

827
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,251
Do you not agree?

828
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,299
What you say is utterly unjust.

829
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,760
How could Master Kang…

830
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,014
have joined me for such unthinkable deeds?

831
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:34,101
He has always considered your talents
to be greater than mine.

832
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,729
Now that I am in this state,

833
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,275
he must have gotten tired
of serving me as his king.

834
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:46,656
Therefore, he plotted a treason
to replace me with you, is that not true?

835
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,993
You are the one who ordered him
to send a spy to the Ming, Your Majesty!

836
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,872
How could you

837
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,501
defame your loyal subject
who took all the blame,

838
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,878
when he only carried out
your royal command?

839
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,589
You are finally confessing the truth.

840
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,258
Go on.

841
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,052
What else did he say?

842
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:12,181
Did he say he would take the blame

843
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,683
and urge you to oust me

844
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,435
and take my throne
while my guard was down?

845
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,480
Brother.

846
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,318
Please.

847
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,363
Please come to your senses.

848
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,447
Shut your mouth!

849
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,535
I am not your brother!

850
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,954
I am the king of this nation!

851
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,415
How dare you?

852
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,961
Who are you to tell me what to do
and order me around?

853
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,965
-Brother!
-I will not sit back anymore.

854
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,926
I will kill you

855
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:53,222
and eliminate the future turmoil
you may bring to this nation!

856
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,107
Die!

857
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,320
Die!

858
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,405
Die!

859
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,123
CAPTIVATING THE KING

860
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,750
Bring the royal physician immediately!

861
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,752
Now that the tiger is gone,

862
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,213
packs of hyenas will run wild.

863
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,799
Do you remember
what you told me last time?

864
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,425
You told me that ascending to the throne,

865
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,888
having the world at my command,
and governing this nation as its king

866
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,975
is my fate and to not deny it.

867
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,186
His Highness will save us no matter what.

868
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,606
A king only has his subjects
and political enemies.

869
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,817
He keeps no such thing as friends.

870
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,445
He will be made to suffer this indignity.

871
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:38,911
