1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,302
You dislike me.

3
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,099
No, Your Majesty.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,563
Do you like me then?

5
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,701
I do.

6
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,916
I…

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,671
like you, Mong-woo.

8
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,808
Do not look so startled.

9
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,850
I am just…

10
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,564
expressing how I feel.

11
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,458
Have you heard?

12
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,376
About what?

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,044
His Majesty…

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,463
What? Attracted to men?

15
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,048
Are you certain?

16
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,242
What has you so deep in thought?

17
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,789
Measures to win, Your Majesty.

18
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,919
You cannot win against me.

19
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,214
In my humble opinion,

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,051
the victor has not yet been decided.

21
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,724
Shall I take back a move?

22
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,935
Simply make a request,
and I will take one back.

23
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,357
I shall not adhere to

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,818
such an unreasonable order.

25
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,748
Defense alone
will not lead you to victory.

26
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,000
You must play on the offensive.

27
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,509
Like so, Your Majesty?

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,693
If I ask you to take back a move,
would you allow it?

29
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,197
Respectfully,

30
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,491
I cannot allow that.

31
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,953
I cannot miss the golden opportunity

32
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,955
that may not ever come again.

33
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,214
You win, Mong-woo.

34
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,800
To speak the truth,

35
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,427
this is not my victory

36
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,720
but your loss.

37
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,224
You lost focus and were caught off guard.

38
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,495
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

39
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,372
You may come in.

40
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,972
That is yours.

41
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,516
Pardon?

42
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,394
A herbal medicine for me?

43
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,397
I have almost recovered, Your Majesty.

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,898
The royal physician gave me an ointment--

45
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,608
The medicine is not for your sake

46
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,943
but mine.

47
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,864
I can only play baduk with an easy heart
when you are well.

48
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,581
Must I feed it to you?

49
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,094
How does it taste?

50
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,095
Is it bitter?

51
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,474
It tastes fine.

52
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,652
Since when has such a rumor
started going around?

53
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,530
It started spreading after the gisinje.

54
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,242
The gossip started among the servants
who traveled with His Majesty,

55
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,163
and it now seems to have spread
among the commoners as well.

56
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,249
His Majesty included Kang Mong-woo
in his retinue for the gisinje,

57
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,087
had the royal physician tend to him
when he got injured during a sword fight,

58
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,090
and ordered the Royal Clinic

59
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,842
to prepare herbal medicine
for Kang Mong-woo upon returning.

60
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,262
With so many episodes
seemingly confirming the rumor,

61
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,099
it has spread like wildfire.

62
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,767
Kang Mong-woo.

63
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,520
What a mysterious man.

64
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,314
He was expelled for high treason
three years ago

65
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,776
after forging a false attestation
in service of Kim Jong-bae.

66
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,488
But now, nestled at Yeongchwijeong
as the gidaeryeong,

67
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,449
he is hogging His Majesty's attention.

68
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,118
A false attestation?

69
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,120
Kang Mong-woo did that?

70
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,955
Were you not aware?

71
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,500
I was not.

72
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,170
Is there a way to stop the rumors?

73
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,714
The most certain way

74
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,008
is to expel the gidaeryeong.

75
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,762
That would also be the most difficult way.

76
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,640
I do not think His Majesty will approve.

77
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,476
I shall try to secure the support
of other court officials.

78
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,395
Do so.

79
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,016
I need to have a word with you.

80
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,273
What is going on?

81
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,527
Are you asking me
if the rumor is true or not?

82
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,070
I know that it cannot be true.

83
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,238
What I want to ask is…

84
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,539
The court will be filing a petition
to His Majesty shortly.

85
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,291
What is your plan?

86
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,002
I will not do anything.

87
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,840
Rumors only grow rampant
when one tries to silence them.

88
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,553
But it is true
that you are the King's favorite.

89
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,889
There is no truth to his favoritism.

90
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,517
He pretends to be fond of me,

91
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,520
intoxicated in his own joy.

92
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,772
It is a pretense?

93
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,150
I cannot forget the King's words to me

94
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,903
even now.

95
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,657
I am no longer an ordinary man.

96
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,992
I am the king of this nation.

97
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,619
A king

98
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,830
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

99
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,417
He keeps no such thing as friends.

100
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,641
I was not aware

101
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,894
that he had spoken so harshly.

102
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,563
Now that you know,

103
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,316
please do not suspect me
simply because I am his favorite.

104
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,151
The King

105
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,778
is my sworn enemy.

106
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,657
Nothing will change that fact.

107
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,953
That may be what your mind is telling you,

108
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,664
but does your heart follow it?

109
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,172
What is this?

110
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,258
Do you not fear the Special Firearms Unit?

111
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,977
I would like to

112
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,814
befriend the gidaeryeong.

113
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,775
Please arrange a meeting for us.

114
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,569
And why would I do that?

115
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,363
You two are close.

116
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,535
Though the rumor of Kang Mong-woo
being attracted to men is unsavory,

117
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,037
that matters not.

118
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,747
He is His Majesty's favorite, after all.

119
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,624
I would have done the same.

120
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,088
Shut your mouth

121
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,632
and move while I am being civil.

122
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,936
My lord.

123
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,688
Do you think the rumor is true?

124
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,528
It is a misunderstanding, Your Majesty.

125
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,364
I have never attempted
to harm the gidaeryeong.

126
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,829
If you lay a finger
on Kang Mong-woo again,

127
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,207
I will behead you myself.

128
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,166
Do you understand?

129
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,043
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,097
Whether it is true or not
is of no importance.

131
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,854
What matters is
whether it is beneficial to me or not.

132
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,503
Just say it.

133
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,799
What could I have to say?

134
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,385
The rumor is spread everywhere,

135
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,845
and you are aware of it.

136
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,723
Speaking about it
will only make each other upset.

137
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,017
At least you know.

138
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,395
The thing is,

139
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,149
while Jeomine was out peddling hair oil

140
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,527
to the First Senior Consort's family,
she heard this story about--

141
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,488
Do I have to know this?

142
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,825
No, my lady.

143
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,671
According to their housemaid,

144
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,716
when the First Senior Consort
went home last year on a retreat,

145
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,844
she apparently let it all out
while crying a river.

146
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,806
Her Royal Highness kept persecuting her
for failing to bear a child,

147
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,433
which ended up making her ill.

148
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,143
But the fact is,

149
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,314
how was she supposed to bear one
when she has never bedded His Majesty?

150
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,321
What with the raging rumor
about His Majesty being attracted to men,

151
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,949
the consorts' quarters
were all turned upside down.

152
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,786
Why so?

153
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,123
The First Senior Consort thought
she was the only one who was turned down,

154
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,416
but in truth,

155
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,420
all the consorts, as well as Her Majesty,

156
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,383
have never consummated their union
with His Majesty.

157
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,300
But how…

158
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,927
How is that possible?

159
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,763
To my knowledge,
that would not be so easy to pull off

160
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,598
what with all the prying eyes on them.

161
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,560
Apparently, spending the night
with His Majesty

162
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,729
is quite tricky in many ways.

163
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,647
I see.

164
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,608
There are more things
he disallows than he allows.

165
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,526
I see.

166
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,323
Women are not allowed to move
until His Majesty touches them.

167
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,117
My goodness.

168
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,204
They cannot fall asleep
before His Majesty does.

169
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,330
Gosh, that is hot.

170
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,293
He is unmoved
by women of incomparable beauty

171
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,212
as if they were
just some rocks like these.

172
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,048
If your tales are indeed all true,

173
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,925
then he truly is impressive.

174
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,136
How does he manage to hold it in like so?

175
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,262
Goodness.

176
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,056
This is obviously a sign
that he is attracted to men, is it not?

177
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,855
I just cannot be sure
whether to believe it or not.

178
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,985
Goodness.

179
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,822
The most pitiable person
is the expelled First Senior Consort

180
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,449
who even held secret rituals

181
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,285
under Her Royal Highness's orders
to bear the King a son.

182
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,494
Poor thing.

183
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,288
Do you see the implication as well?

184
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,998
What implication?

185
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,458
About Senior Court Lady Dong.

186
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,004
That saucy court lady,
who is said to be adored by His Majesty,

187
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,047
also…

188
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,758
has not found success

189
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,968
-in bedding His Majesty.
-I see.

190
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,262
My gosh.

191
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,145
-Let us head to Yeongchwijeong.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,454
The Principal Director has summoned you.

193
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,096
Have you summoned me, Lord Park?

194
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,432
You should have been truthful with me.

195
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,601
Do not tell me

196
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,855
you expected
your deception to hold forever.

197
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,376
I have not taken your life

198
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,004
solely because of His Majesty.

199
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,424
I spared your life despite the risk

200
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,051
as it seemed he was very fond of you.

201
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,680
Forgive me, Lord Park.

202
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,100
Please spare my life.

203
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,519
But why should I?

204
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,524
It is most beneficial for me
to take your life.

205
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,178
You may leave.

206
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,974
Your Majesty.

207
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,311
I have a matter
I wish to speak to you about.

208
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,106
What is it?

209
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,609
Please…

210
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,654
dismiss me from my current post.

211
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,745
What is the reason?

212
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,707
Everyone now knows

213
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,919
that I have never received your affection.

214
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,216
I cannot bear to see others out of shame.

215
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,176
-Therefore--
-I disapprove!

216
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,762
Your Majesty.

217
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,390
I am afraid I cannot aid you
properly any longer.

218
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,518
Please dismiss me from your quarters.

219
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,435
No.

220
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,395
Please expel me from the palace.

221
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,772
I entreat you, Your Majesty.

222
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,108
Your entreaty is nothing but coercion!

223
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,953
What is it that you want?

224
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,707
I would like to become your woman.

225
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,878
Please allow me to spend a night with you.

226
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,867
I…

227
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,998
will not bed you…

228
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,669
nor dismiss you from my quarters.

229
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,757
Your Majesty.

230
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,302
You cannot be crueler than this.

231
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,388
How could you ask me
to endure such indignity?

232
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,265
I, too, am enduring one.

233
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,311
You must endure as well.

234
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,069
That is a royal command.

235
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,825
Your Royal Highness.

236
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,911
Senior Court Lady Dong seeks an audience.

237
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,414
Let her in.

238
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,716
What did you say?

239
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,719
You want me to help you
spend the night with the King?

240
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,805
Did I hear that correctly?

241
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,393
Yes, that is what I have said.

242
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,477
You cunning wench!

243
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,774
You must have a death wish.

244
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,235
I apologize,

245
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,569
but if you take my life,

246
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,659
you will lose all means to put an end
to His Majesty's attraction to men.

247
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,543
Are you saying that the rumor is true?

248
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,674
That also means that His Majesty

249
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,634
never bestowed you
any affection, does it not?

250
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,639
There are different types of affection.

251
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,808
More like the recompense for your sins.

252
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,783
I am glad you remember.

253
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,952
Please fulfill the promise

254
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,413
that you made me back then.

255
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,463
Even if you end up bearing his child,

256
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,799
you will not be appointed a consort.

257
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,970
I only wish for one thing.

258
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,847
It is to serve His Majesty in proximity

259
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,725
until I take my last breath.

260
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,228
That is all.

261
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,915
What is this?

262
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,667
It is a petition from court officials

263
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,045
seeking the dismissal
of Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

264
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,758
For what reason?

265
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,594
As you are well aware,

266
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,972
we seek to eradicate
the ill rumors going around.

267
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,434
If I dismiss the gidaeryeong,

268
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,646
do the rumors magically disappear?

269
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,732
At least the misconception about you
will disappear, Your Majesty.

270
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,025
What misconception?

271
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,320
It is true that I am fond of
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

272
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,156
Forgive me,

273
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,577
but we only filed a petition
to maintain your peaceful reign

274
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,664
and soothe the people's uneasy hearts.

275
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,708
Please grant us your approval.

276
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,169
-Please grant us your approval.
-Please grant us your approval.

277
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,555
Goodness.

278
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,813
The petition regarding the gidaeryeong
will not be granted.

279
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,648
I apologize,

280
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,152
but if you do not,
they will file another petition.

281
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,737
When that happens,
a clause will only be added

282
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,533
seeking his punishment
for harming you and the court.

283
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,703
What harm did Kang Mong-woo inflict on me?

284
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,831
A controversy was sparked

285
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,793
by your decision to bring Kang Mong-woo
and Grand Prince Munseong to the gisinje.

286
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,963
Some even seem to be
eyeing the Grand Prince.

287
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,383
As they may use the rumor
as an excuse to plot treason,

288
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,968
I advise you to expel

289
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,471
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
and let this serve as a warning.

290
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,519
A hint of vulnerability
becomes a reason for them to get ideas.

291
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,273
But then again,

292
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,195
you also proposed that we plot a treason

293
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,198
when my brother fell ill.

294
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,536
I have always been
and still am ready to sacrifice anything

295
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,539
in service of you, Your Majesty.

296
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,416
As long as it benefits you,

297
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,294
I would even gladly take on
a false charge of being a traitor.

298
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,462
I beg you…

299
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,299
not to underrate my loyalty.

300
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,508
Kang Mong-woo…

301
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,471
will not be expelled.

302
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,307
Search for another way.

303
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,685
Please take this.

304
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,572
What is this date for?

305
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,909
Upon Her Royal Highness's command,

306
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,410
the Royal Astronomical Observatory

307
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,997
chose a date for you to bed
Senior Court Lady Dong.

308
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,170
If she produces your heir,

309
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,672
all rumors will dissipate

310
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,133
as well as the court's uneasiness.

311
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,761
If you accept the set date,

312
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,389
I will take responsibility

313
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,809
and withdraw the petition
regarding the gidaeryeong.

314
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,048
How is Her Majesty?

315
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,467
Both her body and soul
seem to have weakened.

316
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,470
I shall quickly brew herbal medicine
to strengthen her condition.

317
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,389
That will take too long.

318
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,058
Is there no other way to break her fever?

319
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,728
I apologize,
but if we force her temperature down,

320
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,731
the chill may worsen her illness.

321
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,485
I see.

322
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,445
You may leave.

323
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,624
My dearest, Her Majesty…

324
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,129
must have been suffering torment.

325
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,348
Your Majesty.

326
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,894
Your decision has given me much joy.

327
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,857
Seeing you so pleased

328
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,942
gladdens my heart as well.

329
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,699
It is the queen's duty to manage
the affairs of the king's bedchamber.

330
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,244
See to it that everything
is prepared to perfection.

331
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,582
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

332
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,434
What are you looking at?

333
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,273
I was looking at the fish in the pond.

334
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,867
I do not see any.

335
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,496
I clearly saw one earlier.

336
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,040
You have keen eyes

337
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,420
to find fish in the pond from this bridge.

338
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,427
Your Majesty.

339
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,763
You must go to the hall of governance.

340
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,056
All right.

341
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,311
I shall return after the assembly,

342
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,106
so be prepared to tell me your wish.

343
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,650
Your Majesty.

344
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,110
I apologize,

345
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,278
but may I please

346
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,239
let you know at a later time?

347
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,369
So as to use it
when you are desperately in need?

348
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,665
All right, you may do so.

349
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,508
Gidaeryeong Kang.

350
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,013
Her Majesty summons you.

351
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,119
Your Majesty.

352
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,704
Did you summon me?

353
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,041
You may lift your head, Gidaeryeong.

354
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,257
-Your Majesty.
-What is the matter?

355
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,427
Did you think I would be angry at you?

356
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,889
I am not.

357
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,851
My fury is for someone else.

358
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,856
Senior Court Lady Dong.

359
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,694
As she was His Majesty's favorite,

360
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,323
she has carried out my duties
as the queen until now.

361
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,533
It is shameful,

362
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,911
but my only choice
was to sit back and watch.

363
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,205
She may carry out your duties,

364
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,416
but she could never match your grace.

365
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,046
I appreciate your words,
but they do not console me.

366
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,552
With the approval from Her Royal Highness,

367
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,513
she is officially spending the night
with His Majesty.

368
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,560
I cannot hold this vexation any longer.

369
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,688
However indecent,

370
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,109
I would much rather the rumor
between you and His Majesty were true.

371
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,284
Your Majesty.

372
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,452
Grand Prince Munseong
requests an audience.

373
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,787
What shall I do?

374
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,790
Let him in.

375
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,339
Welcome, Grand Prince.

376
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,397
I apologize for my belated greetings.

377
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,652
I have only heard the news
of your ill health today.

378
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,741
How do you feel, Your Majesty?

379
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,852
Thank you.

380
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,023
I feel much better seeing you.

381
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,252
With the approval from Her Royal Highness,

382
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,797
she is officially spending the night
with His Majesty.

383
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,244
What happens if Senior Court Lady Dong
bears his child?

384
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,372
If the King begets an heir,

385
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,083
all our plans will go into shambles.

386
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,423
It will not matter
even if she bears him a son.

387
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,010
That will only make him a tyrant
who had a son with the late king's woman.

388
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,304
With such evidence
of his depravity and indecency,

389
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,599
our case for dethronement
will only be strengthened.

390
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,523
I am glad.

391
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,236
I was concerned that the news
might bring you distress.

392
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,532
Why would I be distressed?

393
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,285
Hongjang told me

394
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,414
that you fell in love
with Grand Prince Jinhan.

395
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,835
Hongjang said that?

396
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,921
When?

397
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,675
I asked her to marry me upon my return,

398
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,721
but she insisted
that your marriage should come first.

399
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,434
That must have been her excuse

400
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,145
to prevent me
from paying for her ransom again

401
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,897
as she was a courtesan.

402
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,152
You should have just run away with her.

403
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,572
That is my greatest regret.

404
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,080
Do not worry.

405
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,792
I will not be swayed no matter what.

406
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,191
Do you not mind the rumors going around?

407
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,570
What if the people believe the rumor,
form misconceptions of you,

408
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,572
and end up disliking you?

409
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,785
It does not matter.

410
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,664
Facing criticism from the people
is one of the king's responsibilities.

411
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,501
How could a child
fathom their father's heart?

412
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,963
It is the father's duty
to understand his child.

413
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,802
A single word of valid condemnation
from the people

414
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,972
holds far more value to a king

415
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,474
than the chatters
from his treacherous subjects.

416
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,024
You may say so now,

417
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,903
but should you hear
such condemnations yourself,

418
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,281
you would find it unbearable.

419
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,620
Would you like to bet?

420
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,960
Even if anyone dares to
condemn me for being attracted to men

421
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,171
and laugh at me to my face,

422
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,965
I, too, will laugh aloud with them.

423
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,054
If you fail to laugh, I win the bet.

424
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,643
I accept the terms.

425
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,860
I understand your faith
in Captain Joo's skills,

426
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,987
but should you not bring more guards?

427
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,198
Sang-hwa.

428
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,575
Mong-woo is worried about me.

429
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,536
They are there, just not noticeable.

430
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,746
Look closely.

431
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,664
Ten steps away.

432
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,375
Now, 50 steps away.

433
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,961
Now, 100 steps away.

434
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,214
My men are on duty
while keeping their distance.

435
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,307
It appears my concern was meaningless.

436
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,936
How is a subject's concern
for his king meaningless?

437
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,024
All right then, let us go find someone

438
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,985
who will call me out
for being attracted to men.

439
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,671
Choose a table if any takes your fancy.

440
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,547
I shall buy you one.

441
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,927
I do not need one, Your Majesty.

442
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,472
Were you not passionate
about baduk tables?

443
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,891
I used to be at one point.

444
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,184
But I am indifferent now.

445
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,063
It would be wise to exploit my generosity
when you have the chance.

446
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,232
At the end of the day,

447
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,359
I am your only patron.

448
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,574
Then…

449
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,827
I would like that, Your Majesty.

450
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,957
That?

451
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,053
Move!

452
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,982
Here, take it.

453
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,128
Is it good?

454
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,099
We should visit other areas, Your Majesty.

455
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,519
You are currently losing.

456
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,396
Yes, the bet.

457
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,024
Let us see.

458
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,275
Where must I go

459
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,403
to hear people call me out
for being attracted to men?

460
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,989
Stop eating and take the lead.

461
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,040
It seems I will lose at this rate.

462
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,048
I will place the stone here.

463
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,175
This move should do it.

464
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,597
You are quite good.
I will place my next stone here.

465
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,233
My next move is here.

466
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,323
Then I shall…

467
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,658
Stop.

468
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,076
Not there. Try here.

469
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,206
Yes.

470
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,126
There you go.

471
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,795
No.

472
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,381
Well done.

473
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,634
That is your play?

474
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,928
Hold on.

475
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,847
There.

476
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,023
There you go.

477
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
In that case…

478
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,719
Grandfather.

479
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,054
Look here.

480
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,640
What are you doing right now?

481
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,602
My apologies.

482
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,356
I am sorry. I got rather carried away.

483
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,860
-Let me help.
-No.

484
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,903
Forget it.

485
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,197
Goodness.

486
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,286
I do not need it.

487
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,370
On your feet.

488
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,707
Goodness.

489
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,129
Good grief.

490
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,381
Such annoying meddlers.

491
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,230
Your Majesty.

492
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,773
It is time for you to return.

493
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,233
How could this be?

494
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:08,984
Pardon?

495
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,111
I was told the rumor was everywhere.

496
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,531
But I cannot seem to
find anyone gossiping about it!

497
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,991
How come I am to be blamed for it?

498
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,826
I am not the one behind it.

499
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,203
I will lose to him again.

500
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,121
It is your fault if I lose this time!

501
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,790
Pardon?

502
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,709
Stop standing around like a pole

503
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,878
and go fetch me a rumor!

504
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:33,842
Yes, Your Majesty.

505
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,053
Please wait here.

506
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,519
Follow me!

507
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,151
Was I

508
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,028
too harsh?

509
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,574
I just ordered him
to fetch me an intangible notion.

510
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,538
Even if you ask Captain Joo
to pluck the moon from the sky,

511
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,664
he will see to it.

512
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,833
Looking back,

513
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,961
Sang-hwa has never
refused to carry out an order.

514
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,881
I am sure he is complaining in silence.

515
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,427
It would be a miracle
if he was not cursing me out.

516
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,782
If you were a woman,

517
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,035
I would have certainly married you.

518
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,427
By the way, have you heard the rumor?

519
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,220
Listen.

520
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,556
Apparently, the King is attracted to men.

521
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,933
Truly?

522
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,645
My goodness, how indecent.

523
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,522
If that were indeed true,
the world must be coming to an end.

524
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,608
Even with so many beautiful ladies
lining up for him?

525
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,734
Tell me about it.

526
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,402
Yet he favors men? Goodness.

527
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,412
Let us stop here for today.

528
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,916
Yes, Your Majesty.

529
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,628
Look…

530
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,807
Never mind.

531
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,171
My apologies.

532
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,862
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

533
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,656
I knew it.

534
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,159
I knew I was not.

535
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,785
Pardon?

536
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,246
Do not be so alarmed.

537
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,206
I was just testing something.

538
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,958
Testing?

539
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,170
Testing what, Your Majesty?

540
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,091
It is nothing.

541
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,940
Do not use me
to test such a thing ever again!

542
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,113
Let us speak in private.

543
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,992
Can you lose the Special Firearms Unit?

544
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,662
Do not worry.

545
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,039
I have a plan.

546
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,556
Goodness. Are you okay, my lord?

547
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,515
Move!

548
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,045
When you told me
to sever my emotional ties to you,

549
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,506
I felt deeply resentful.

550
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,176
However,

551
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,804
I now see that it was inevitable.

552
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,098
What is more,

553
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,976
it was not as painful as I thought.

554
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,980
What are you trying to say?

555
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,732
I have severed my emotional ties.

556
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,400
Now,

557
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,861
it is your turn.

558
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,228
I am Jaunyeong, the head courtesan here.

559
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,982
Allow me to pour you a drink.

560
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,208
Why are you looking at me
with such sadness in your eyes?

561
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,213
I am sorry.

562
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,177
You remind me of a friend I treasured.

563
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,181
She must be a happy woman.

564
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,143
It is rare to find someone
who befriends a courtesan.

565
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,190
Can I ask you a question?

566
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,277
I am not sure if I will have the answer.

567
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,323
How do you…

568
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,869
sever your feelings for another?

569
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,923
At times, some have trouble letting go

570
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,300
and severing their feelings for another

571
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,261
even after their training is over

572
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,931
and they have become a courtesan.

573
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,476
I offer a line of advice
whenever I encounter one.

574
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,813
And what is that?

575
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,274
"Go where your heart takes you

576
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,819
until the very end of the road."

577
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,662
Once they reach the end of the road,

578
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,915
they understand…

579
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,545
the futility of love.

580
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,220
Has my answer been helpful?

581
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,766
Thank you.

582
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,105
I would like to be alone.

583
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,195
Captain Joo.

584
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,113
I have an urgent report.

585
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,698
-What is wrong?
-Captain Joo!

586
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,036
Captain Joo, there is trouble!

587
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,331
Yoo Hyun-bo has disappeared.

588
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,959
Has Kang Mong-woo disappeared as well?

589
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,049
Do not inform His Majesty.

590
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,467
I will tell him myself.

591
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,805
Tell me what?

592
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:31,977
Your Majesty.

593
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,363
What is the matter?

594
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,910
Spit it out now.

595
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,453
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty!

596
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,580
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo has disappeared.

597
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,624
We lost Yoo Hyun-bo as well.

598
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,186
What brings you outside, Your Majesty?

599
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,822
Your Majesty.

600
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,200
Senior Court Lady Dong is here.

601
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:30,952
You must go inside.

602
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,380
Your Majesty.

603
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,170
If you were a woman,

604
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,506
I would have certainly married you.

605
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,016
Why does it hurt so much?

606
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,148
Did the rice cake from earlier
upset my insides?

607
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,609
Sleep will help me get over it.

608
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,364
I will let it all go.

609
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,237
I cannot bring myself to do this.

610
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,614
Your Majesty!

611
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,248
Your Majesty!

612
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,030
Comb through the capital

613
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,157
and find Kang Mong-woo.

614
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,576
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

615
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,414
Your Majesty.

616
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,208
Her Royal Highness
will be infuriated if she finds out.

617
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,502
I promise to find the gidaeryeong.

618
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,422
-Please return to your quarters.
-You speak of promise

619
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,674
when you have already lost him?

620
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,676
I apologize, Your Majesty.

621
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,761
-However, Your Majesty--
-Quiet!

622
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,722
I will find him myself.

623
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,974
Where did you lose him?

624
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,100
Lead the way.

625
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,435
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

626
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,450
Where on earth is he?

627
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,079
He does not seem to be here.

628
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,128
He must be there.

629
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,130
Your Majesty!

630
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,816
Is this not the place?

631
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:58,905
Mong-woo.

632
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,506
Goodness.

633
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,640
Your Majesty!

634
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,523
He will catch a cold out here.

635
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,359
Is there someplace he can stay nearby?

636
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,112
One place comes to mind.

637
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,113
Where is it?

638
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,115
Lord Kang Hang-soon's house.

639
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,744
Shall I find another place?

640
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,040
No need. Let us head there.

641
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,251
Go and check the place.

642
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,003
Please let me.

643
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,256
Just help me get him on my back.

644
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,215
Yes, Your Majesty.

645
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,599
He must not be eating properly.

646
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,101
He is light as a feather.

647
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,610
Here.

648
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,371
Lights from the parlor
might catch prying eyes,

649
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,165
so I lit up the candles here.

650
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,459
You may leave.

651
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,295
Yes, Your Majesty.

652
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:14,540
No one may find out
that His Majesty is here.

653
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,335
Guard the vicinity in secret.

654
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,711
-Yes, Captain.
-Yes, Captain.

655
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,260
You rascal.

656
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,515
How come you drank so much
when you cannot hold your liquor?

657
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,570
It must be uncomfortable
to sleep with the hat on.

658
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,450
There.

659
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,495
Lie down comfortably.

660
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,255
You cannot have a good sleep
on your side, you fool.

661
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,715
Here.

662
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,135
There you go.

663
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,849
Let me untie your robe.

664
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,445
Are you awake?

665
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,530
Do not be surprised.

666
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,698
No!

667
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,504
What do you mean by…

668
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,104
Your Majesty.

669
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,277
Do not tell me…

670
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,244
You cannot be.

671
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,038
Tell me you are not.

672
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,025
I warned you

673
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,696
that I would take your life
the moment I find any deceit.

674
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:53,866
Your Majesty.

675
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,503
I have a wish.

676
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,384
You assured me
you would not beg me to spare your life.

677
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,059
It is my final wish

678
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,020
before death.

679
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,316
Speak your wish!

680
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,047
What in the world…

681
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,830
CAPTIVATING THE KING

682
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,584
You have deceived me on all counts.

683
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,629
You are not to come to the palace
for the time being

684
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,548
and to await my orders
while confined to your lodgings.

685
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,885
The King has found out that I am a woman.

686
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,848
I hope you have not forgotten
the promise you made

687
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,266
to dismiss and expel the gidaeryeong.

688
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,559
I have not.

689
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,438
The King has set up a trap
that the Principal Director cannot avoid.

690
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,899
Immediately arrest
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

691
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,651
and bring him to the State Tribunal.

692
