"Can I not say it?"

491
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,517
Must I filter my words?

(We'll introduce you to a coin karaoke with a study room.)

Are we going to sing today?

496
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:32,197
It's pretty big for a coin karaoke.

497
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:33,267
Are all coin karaokes like this?

498

(The inside is filled with karaoke rooms.)

499
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,467
(When you look inside a room, )

500

this is just a karaoke, not a study room.

How can you study here? It's so dark.

503
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:45,549
They sing and study here?

504

- No way. - No way.

505

This is real.

This is real.

- I think it is a karaoke. - Right? It's definitely a karaoke.

513
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,338
The production crew cannot fake this.

- The karaoke might be real, - They sing and study together?

But the study room might be fake, right?

Of course. This place might be fake.

This place is just a karaoke.

519

This place is just a karaoke,

520

- not a study room. - This is...

(It might be a fake spot where they set up a study room...)

(in an actual karaoke.)

523

(Na Ra enters a room to find a study room.)

526

I like this kind of vibe.

527
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:41,467
This is perfect for singing blues.

Wait. This is the place.

535
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,399
They study in a karaoke?

536

Wait. This is the place.

They carry this inside to study?

539
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:16,941
So the study room and karaoke are combined.

- Guys, I figured it out. - Figured out what?

Before COVID-19, the karaoke was filled with people...

because it was near a university.

- For seven hours? - Yes.

661
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:29,961
You still need to insert coins to sing in those seven hours, right?

662
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:34,160
No. If you pay ten dollars, you can sing for free.

Hello.

1286
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:11,910
We are in Ogeum-dong, Seoul.

1287
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:14,311
We sell fruit and fruit noodles...

1288
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:16,451
here at "Mon House". I'm the owner, Jae Hyeong.

1289
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:19,120
Originally, after graduating college,

1290
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:21,251
I wanted to enter into the restaurant business.

1291
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:25,062
But my aunt who operates an apple orchard...

1292
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,962
suggested being a fruit vendor in Seoul.

1293
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,131
So I thought about using fruit...

1294
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:32,761
to make and sell food.

1295
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:36,901
Our fruit noodles were developed to fit the theme of the store.

1296
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:39,641
We currently use seasonal fruit...

1297
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:42,111
in our sauces, garnishes,

1298
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,982
and broth.

1299
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:45,581
That's the kind of food we make.

1302
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:53,021
We change around our toppings using seasonal fruit.

1303
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:56,422
I've made bibimguksu using strawberries before.

1304
00:49:56,922 --> 00:49:59,462
Children really enjoyed that bibimguksu.

1305
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:03,061
These days, food delivery apps are a great source of publicity.

1306
00:50:03,062 --> 00:50:04,731
Our delivery sales have been high.

1307
00:50:04,732 --> 00:50:06,871
So we make between 40,000 and 50,000 dollars each month.

In terms of noodle ingredients...

1330
00:51:04,891 --> 00:51:08,132
There's bound to be produce that gets slightly damaged in transit.

They're still perfectly fine to eat.

But they may appear damaged or oddly shaped.

1333

We use those pieces of fruit that are unsellable.

For the owners who come with their pets,

1948
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:35,919
we are a restaurant that has delicious coffee...

who is my family and is most precious to me.

I can go with her,

but there aren't any places that have food for the pets.

01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:54,169
So I wanted to make a course menu...

of the food they eat,

1968

so I used eight different types of meat to create a variety.

1969
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,768
It's 80 percent meat,

1970

In order to serve the owners something delicious too,

I'll mix it for you.

It's good, but it's salty.

2256

It shouldn't be salty.

2257

You don't use salt for dog food.

Right. Dogs get sick when they eat salty food.

Mother. Let me go.

Sang Yeob's playing an important role.

He's dubbing his friends.

I've met Chewie before many times.

But it's my first time touching him.

- Me too. - I can never get close to him.

You should take him now.

- Will Chewie be okay with it? - Yes.

Can't touch Chewie.

Doesn't this place look real?

2294

I've never been to a place like this before.

2295

So I'm not sure.

2296
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:06,540
Based on the dog food, it's real.

(The high quality food proves it's real?)

2298

But this place barely has any dog items.

But this can't be fake.

2307
