00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,539
- Should I remove her? - Then is Hui Yeol your CEO?

490
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,638
Yes, he is.

491
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,669
Oh my gosh.

492
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,269
You didn't know?

493
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,279
You didn't know?

494
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,080
I thought Jae Seok was the figurehead.

495
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,750
(She bursts out laughing.)

496
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,978
- He's not the figurehead. - He can't be one.

497
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:15,189
Under him...

498
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:16,789
I'm not.

499
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,959
(She's the only one who's confused.)

500
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,719
What a fancy word.

501
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,090
Where is the owner?

502
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,629
(Did you call me?)

503
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,260
(Surprised)

504
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,100
The owner is here!

505
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:31,240
- Hello. - Hello.

506
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,639
(A young owner of a retro barbecue place?)

507
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:38,208
Hello. I'm Won Bin, who is running Evergreen,

508
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:41,449
a retro barbecue restaurant in Yongsan.

509
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,379
Evergreen was opened in July, 2020.

510
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,819
I wanted to make a restaurant that people saw at least once...

511
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,020
but is hard to find in downtown.

512
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:56,458
What I considered for marketing was...

513
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,499
that this place cannot be seen at all from outside.

514
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,868
I had to use the restaurant in the alley as it is,

515
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,399
and I made it look retro to match the alley.

516
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:08,739
Nowadays, Generation MZ go crazy over retro,

517
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,638
and retro became a hype on its own.

518
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,978
So I searched for the props and other details myself...

519
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:18,079
and placed a lot of things that looks nice...

520
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
when photos are taken using smartphones.

521
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,188
We sell pork jowl or hwangjisal, which is a special part...

522
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:24,459
of pork.

523
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,359
"Hwangjisal" is a dialect of pork jowl...

524
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,789
in Chungcheong Province.

525
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,759
I wondered how to display pork jowl more interestingly,

526
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,699
and I made it into a round shape.

527
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,099
Thanks to a lot of people's support,

528
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,169
I'm nearing 100,000 dollars revenue per month.

529
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,369
Sixth Sense. Is this place real?

530
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,139
Please introduce yourself.

531
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,448
Hello. I'm the owner of Evergreen,

532
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,918
a retro barbecue restaurant. I'm Won Bin.

533
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,719
You're Won Bin.

534
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,020
He's fake. His name is Won Bin. That's strange.

535
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:59,458
- He's fake because he's Won Bin? - Yes, Won Bin.

536
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,289
- He's so unreasonable. - His name is fake?

537
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,259
You've never watched our show, have you?

538
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,360
You have no clue at all.

539
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,958
You've never watched it.

540
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,999
This is how you investigate?

541
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,099
- You're not Conan. - He's unreasonable.

542
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,468
He's trying to be Conan.

543
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:12,569
I only watched the games.

544
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,999
(He quickly confesses.)

545
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,468
- It only has been one year? - That's right.

546
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:19,580
I think you felt everything that I intended.

547
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,879
Everything in this place is fake except the roof.

548
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,080
- It's fake? - Yes.

549
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,349
(Is this the first fake spot to end with a confession?)

550
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,888
I mean some of the aspects are purposely intended.

551
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:35,089
(This is a new place that is made to look old.)

552
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,458
Those dust and spider webs too?

553
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,559
I purposely put them.

554
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,969
I put up everything on purpose except the roof.

555
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,799
I came up with a retro universe.

556
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,669
(A universe?)

557
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,168
"What if a lady from the countryside comes to Seoul..."

558
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,109
"and opens a barbecue restaurant?" I imagined that...

559
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,409
and started this restaurant.

560
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,010
"So..."

561
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,779
"she'll probably not have much money,"

562
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,388
"so she'll open a restaurant in an alley."

563
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:03,049
I decorated this restaurant imagining that.

564
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,789
You imagined yourself as the lady...

565
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,289
who cooks well.

566
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,859
"What would she do if she were to open a restaurant?"

567
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,929
That's right.

568
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,499
You made an approach like an actor.

569
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,369
He made this restaurant with his own universe.

570
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,770
That's a great idea.

571
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,868
(Is this restaurant real which is decorated thoroughly...)

572
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:23,139
(with the owner's universe?)

573
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,239
- How funny. - But the menus are unique.

574
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,579
"Pork jowl", "crunchy pork rib", and "pepper pork cheek".

575
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,708
I've never heard of them before.

576
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,149
"Diced pork shoulder blade". What are these?

577
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,118
It's my job to come up with menus...

578
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,290
that the customers don't expect.

579
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,419
- I really want to try bibim sujebi. - Me too.

580
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,229
What is pepper pork cheek?

581
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
(Laughing)

582
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,398
- Crunchy pork rib? - That the customers don't expect.

583
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:46,429
(Repeating it)

584
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,898
The names...

585
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,530
(I'm against it.)

586
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,070
(Holding back his laughter)

587
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,239
Jong Min, if you want to say something, speak loudly.

588
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,009
Why are you mumbling?

589
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,938
- Jae Seok, Jong Min keeps... - What is he doing?

590
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,309
Repeating after you.

591
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,979
If you say "Crunchy", he'll say, "Crunchy?"

592
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,810
"Crunchy?"

593
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,849
(Laughing)

594
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,979
- "Pork jowl?" - He's a pro.

595
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,320
He's saying it automatically without realizing it.

596
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,188
Sae Ho was like that too.

597
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:11,719
Even before eating, he said, "It's so delicious."

598
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,628
(Even this laughter is just a reaction.)

599
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:17,158
- Can we eat first? - Yes, I'll prepare it well.

600
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,458
- Thank you. - Thank you.

601
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,529
It must be delicious!

602
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,629
(Please make it deliciously.)

603
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:23,600
The owner looks real.

604
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:25,539
- I don't know. - He doesn't suit this place.

605
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,270
- The owner. - I think so too.

606
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,178
If he's someone who is that serious about the concept,

607
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,979
I think he should've worn old loose pants.

608
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,109
(He made his own universe, but his outfit is modern.)

609

(Is this owner fake?)

- Hello. - Hello.

614
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,859
This is seasoned beansprouts!

615
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,259
I love beansprouts like this!

616
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,958
This is so amazing.

617
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:51,198
- Last time, if you took... - Thank you.

618

Those beansprouts with you to school,

619

everyone would go crazy.

620

- If you mix this with rice... - That's incredible.

621

And sesame oil...

622

- I... - I like the washed kimchi.

- Washed kimchi. - That's nice.

624
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,169
It looks so good.

625
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,179
Washed kimchi looks so good.

626
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:06,780
Here is pork jowl.

627

- Is this pork jowl? - It looks so unique.

628

- This is pork jowl. - Pork jowl.

629

- Which part is this? - It's pork jowl but with less fat.

We made it our way.

It looks so good.

633

- Shall I put it on the grill? - Should I put it on the grill?

(Shall we start grilling?)

635
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,999
Put it to high heat then change to middle heat. I'll do it.

636

Put it to high heat then middle heat?

It's good to be suspicious, but you're suspecting everything.

It's rather unique to make pork jowl round.

- To look pretty. - It's a big hassle.

- It's a hassle? - Yes, to make it round.

Because they have to remove it one by one?

That's right.

On the other hand, the owner said...

they came up with the idea...

713
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,389
to differentiate their pork jowl from other restaurants.

714

They can prepare it beforehand.

(It's something they must do even if they're busy.)

I'm so curious.

1125
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:13,139
Ma'am.

1126
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,398
- Hello. - Hello.

1127
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,308
- Hello. - Hello.

1128
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:17,309
She's a woman.

1129
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,110
- Hello. - She's so cute.

1130
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,708
Hello.

1131
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,749
Toppings according to my taste.

1132
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,549
I am Shin Hye, the owner of this restaurant.

1133
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,578
I've loved ramen ever since I was young,

1134
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:30,918
which is why I started this restaurant.

1135
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:34,320
That is why I have a few foreign ramens.

1136
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,759
We heard you make 70,000 dollars a month. Is that true?

1137
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,159
Yes, last month...

1138
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,628
I hit 70,000 dollars, and I am very thankful.

1139
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:43,529
(Happy)

1140
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,769
There's something special about this restaurant.

1141
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,909
The trend these days is to...

1142
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,909
create your own recipe...

1143
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,809
and share it with others.

1144
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,609
To go along with that trend,

1145
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,949
I researched various toppings that Koreans would like.

1146
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,719
(Numerous toppings)

1147
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,389
This ramen restaurant allows you to add...

1148
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,950
whatever toppings you like.

1149
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:08,058
(You can create your own recipe.)

1150
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:10,458
Interior-wise,

1151
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:12,089
I wanted an open kitchen.

1152
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,559
That way, the customers could be pleased with the taste

1153
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,930
but also the sight.

1154
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:21,598
Due to the marketing of being able to eat however I like,

1155
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,509
the restaurant slowly started gaining recognition,

1156
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,049
and now, the sales have doubled.

1157
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,009
So I've had many inquiries about chain stores.

1158
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,978
By the end of this year, I am planning on opening

1159
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:35,550
my second location in a department store in Gangnam.

1160
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:39,458
Sixth Sense. Is this place real?

1161
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,620
(Could this ramen restaurant be real?)

1162
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,228
- You can come over here. - Okay.

1163
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:45,389
- She's so cute. - I'm so in the center.

1164
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,128
- What's that on her head? - Hello.

1165
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,159
(Peculiar)

1166
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,598
- Your clothes... - May I ask what you're wearing?

1167
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,029
I'm wearing this...

1168
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,739
because I'm coming out on TV.

1169
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,839
- What about... - It's pretty.

1170
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
(So she dressed up?)

1171
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:58,809
- What about this? - This is because...

1172
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,438
- I got Covid last month. - Yes.

1173
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:04,109
And I started losing hair, but I didn't want it to get in the food.

1174
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,079
- That's why you covered everything. - That's why.

1175
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:07,848
That made me sad all of a sudden.

1176
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,389
- Then this is real. - I keep losing hair, too.

1177
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,719
- I lose hair too. - You too?

1178
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,159
- I lost hair too. - Yes. She's telling the truth.

1179
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,390
- Really? - Then she must be real.

1180
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,058
(There was a reason for her unique attire. Is this place real?)

1181
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,629
How long has it been since you started this business?

1182
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,898
It's been a little over a month.

1183
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:29,369
We had a soft opening in July of 2020.

1184
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,639
So you started it

1185
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,609
when the coronavirus was at its peak?

1186
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,308
Before, I never even thought I would start a business like this.

1187
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,379
- But? - I was just a normal office worker.

1188
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:41,549
I just worked at a company,

1189
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,719
but due to the coronavirus, the company went under.

1190
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,918
(The company went under due to COVID-19.)

1191
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:49,289
So I became jobless.

1192
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,288
After leaving the company,

1193
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:53,699
I was always in my room, feeling depressed.

1194
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,058
(Sudden depression after losing her job)

1195
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:56,869
That's when I thought of starting a business...

1196
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,199
that has to do with what I like.

1197
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,168
(How cool)

1198
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:03,039
I love ramen the most in this world.

1199
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,538
I love ramen too.

1200
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:07,339
When I was little, I would eat ramen four times a day,

1201
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,509
instead of three regular meals a day.

1202
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,780
So my mom hid the ramen from me and threw it all away.

1203
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,009
She's the same as me.

1204
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,849
Oh, my gosh.

1205
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,688
- I'm sorry. Don't mind him. - What?

1206
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:17,788
Why can't you talk?

1207
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:19,720
(I was just pleasantly surprised.)

1208
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,089
Because I like ramen so much,

1209
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,429
I look for good ramen places to eat.

1210
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,828
Once, I went to Phuket,

1211
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:26,829
(Went to Phuket for her summer vacation)

1212
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,429
and there was a ramen store...

1213
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,870
with various seafood toppings.

1214
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:34,569
That place was memorable,

1215
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,509
so I thought maybe I could...

1216
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,708
do something similar by having various toppings...

1217
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:42,110
to follow the trend these days.

1218
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,010
That's right. People these days are into food combinations.

1219
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:46,950
Wasn't that too much information?

1220
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:50,719
(Her story included so many details...)

1221
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,188
(including her childhood and her becoming jobless.)

1222
00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:55,989
But because she told us everything, it seems more real.

1223
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,990
It's her real story.

1224
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:59,628
It does sound like she made up a story.

1225
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:02,199
- We have to be suspicious. - The longer her story becomes,

1226
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,828
the weirder it seems.

1227
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:05,938
- She's so good at talking. - Yes.

1228
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:07,498
She sounded like she was reading...

1229
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:09,069
- off a script. - That was so smooth.

1230
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,370
(Did she just memorize a script?)

1231
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:11,768
(She's strange.)

1232
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:14,340
How are your sales?

1233
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,348
I didn't earn a lot from the beginning.

1234
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,449
It slowly increased, and last month,

1235
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,280
- we hit 70,000 dollars. - In one month?

1236
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:24,519
- In one month? - In one month?

1237
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:26,589
How much is it per bowl?

1238
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,459
The answer to your question is written right here.

1239
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:32,089
Okay. If we say that they're three dollars each,

1240
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,859
how many do you need to sell to make 70,000 dollars?

1241
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,969
(Are you asking me?)

1242
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:37,970
It's...

1243
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:42,870
He looked at Mi Joo to do the calculation.

1244
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:44,510
Did you want Mi Joo to calculate it for you?

1245
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,938
- It's 1,000. - Sorry?

1246
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:48,208
- It's 1,000 bowls. - Are you sure it's 1,000?

1247
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:49,248
Yes, 1,000.

1248
00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:50,309
It's 1,000?

1249
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:53,518
(Let's just leave them alone.)

1250
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,749
- We will try the ramen now. - Sure.

1251
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:59,289
It may seem somewhat complicated.

1252
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:02,828
First of all, you choose a ramen.

1253
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:05,259
And then you take a pot,

1254
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,529
and add any meat or seafood that you'd like to have.

1255
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,729
(Calculating the cost of selected meat and seafood first)

1256
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,570
We charge for meat and seafood by the gram.

1257
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,809
(Step 3 - add any other basic toppings to that pot)

1258
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,549
We have various vegetables and hams available as basic toppings,

1259
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,848
for an extra dollar.

1260
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:27,878
Things like octopus and webfoot octopus can be bought per item.

1261
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:29,019
(Octopus)

1262
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,559
(They are caught live on the spot.)

1263
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:35,559
(The method of ordering is more detailed than expected.)

1264
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,159
So it's similar to how a malatang restaurant operates.

1265
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,029
There are various options, like whether you want beef or lamb.

1266
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,998
So they're doing it the same way here.

1267
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:46,669
The crew has said that they will pay.

1268
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:49,739
- Put all the toppings in the pots. - We can choose.

1269
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,869
- Sounds like fun. - If you choose and bring them over,

1270
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,378
we will cook the ramen and you can even watch through the open kitchen.

1271
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:55,780
- All right, then. - Sounds great.

1272
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,779
Are there any ramens here that you would recommend?

1273
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,378
The kalguksu over there looks good too.

1274
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:04,188
My mom really likes kalguksu, so we discussed with our chef...

1275
00:46:04,189 --> 00:46:07,160
and started making that dish.

1276
00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:11,188
It's kalguksu ramen with pen shell, scallops,

1277
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:13,699
various clams, Cheongyang chilis and scallions.

1278
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,470
(Preparing the pen shell first)

1279
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:20,999

It's like a bustier.

Jong Min, don't you feel well?

To be completely honest,

I was going to have some more but he was glaring at me.

They were all staring. Everyone was glaring at me.

Are you seriously going to treat him like this?

We paid a lot of attention to that.

In butcher restaurants,

customers can choose the amount and cut of meat they want to eat.

We took that concept and applied it to cakes.

If the customer tells us the amount they'd like,

2023
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,349
we scoop the cake and measure it on the scale.

01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,789
Then we plate the cake and serve it.

We keep the cake in here,

2027

so it has less exposure to oxygen.

2028
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:26,859
That is why it stays moist for a long time.

- and we found that interesting. - Right.

2045
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:10,769
Is there a reason why you chose a minimum of 100g?

(They saw this on the menu on their way in.)

2047

We need to make a profit too.

2048
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:18,749
- A profit. - So if our customers come...

2049
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,548
- and ask for 20g... - Right.

2050
01:14:20,549 --> 01:14:21,749
Is that why it's 100g?

2051
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,279
- A minimum. - A minimum of 100g...

but we ate a lot before we came.

2054
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,959
When I heard it was by grams, I was planning on having 10g.

2055
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,360
- But 100g is the minimum. - Right.

2056

How do your customers like your gram cake?

2057
01:14:36,759 --> 01:14:39,629
At first, people wondered why it looked like this.

2058
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,339
They thought it was odd.

2059
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:43,898
But since we scoop up the cake you want...

2060
01:14:43,899 --> 01:14:46,169
in the amount you want it,

2061
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,739
people thought it was special, so it's no longer a weird cake.

2062

Instead it became a special cake, and people like it.
