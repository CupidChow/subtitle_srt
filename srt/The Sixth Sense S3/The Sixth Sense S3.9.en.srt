of Korean and western food.

651
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:03,156
If there's a recipe to base it on,

652
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:04,596
it's easy to make a new menu.

653
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:08,095
But I didn't have anything to refer to, not even images.

654
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,365
So I worked to make a new menu for two hours every day...

655
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:12,065
for almost a year,

656
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,835
and I made about 1,000 menus.

657
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:16,635
The most popular menus...

658
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:19,506
are Jeonju bibim and soft tofu.

659
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:21,345
Jeonju bibim looks like bibimbap...

660
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,177
with seasoned raw beef that people like.

661
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,045
For soft tofu boiled-down doenjang,

662
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:27,546
I based it on Chodang soft tofu.

663
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:31,886
For soft tofu boiled-down doenjang, I changed the recipe about 50 times.

664
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:34,855
For Jeonju bibim, I couldn't get the taste right,

665
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:36,456
so I changed the recipe 100 times.

666
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,855
I completed the recipe for Jeonju bibim...

667
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,226
just before the test opening.

Ciao.

The overall vibe...

682
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:06,815
feels like retro.

683
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:08,726
Did you design like this on purpose?

684
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,526
Yes, I did it on purpose.

(He did it on purpose?)

686
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:15,326
When I went on a trip to Italy,

687
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:19,365
I found a really good restaurant in a back alley.

688
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,267
I really liked that experience.

689
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:23,335
That's right.

690
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,635
To give off the vibe of olden Europe,

691
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:29,575
I used fabric wallpaper.

692
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,276
(Fabric wallpaper that gives off an olden European restaurant vibe)

693
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:33,216
I thought, "Why not combine it..."

694
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:36,517
"with Korean cuisine instead of just cooking western cuisines?"

695
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,855
So I tried to give it a driver's restaurant vibe...

696
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,826
and put up the phrase "kindness, hygiene, and service".

697
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:44,426
I chose the fonts for the menu in front of the restaurant...

698
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:46,257
for the same reason.

699

701
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,236
Exactly.

(I think adding pork cutlet would make it too greasy.)

1441
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:32,057
Because we're adding a port cutlet to the broth,

1442
00:52:32,226 --> 00:52:34,355
it started off as greasy.

1443
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:36,427
(Dongamtang was a little oily at first.)

1444
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:39,995
So in addition, we added kimchi and water parsley

1445
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:41,967
We made quite a spicy sauce too.

1446

We were testing out how to balance the greasy taste.

1447

Which is how we reached the spicy broth we have today.

When the pork cutlet becomes undone,

1449
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:51,406
it also has a nutty taste.

1450
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,145
I think that led to better reviews from customers.
