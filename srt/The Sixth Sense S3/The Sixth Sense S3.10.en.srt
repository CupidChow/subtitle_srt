00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,022
From the consultation upstairs,

648
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:48,663
we discuss what kind of bicycles the clients want.

649
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,364
- It's customized? - Yes, it's customized.

650
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,193
You make customized bicycles.

651
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,332
- That's what a frame builder does. - Then...

652
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,433
Really?

653
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:58,174
Out of all your works, which is the most unique frame?

654
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,174
They're all unique.

655
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,002
They're unique in different ways.

656
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:04,812
I heard there was a three-story tall bicycle.

657
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,474
This is a three-level bicycle.

658
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:09,643
- Three-level? - Three-level. It's made of bamboos.

659
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,352
- I see. - They're really bamboos.

660
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:15,123
Bamboos are empty inside, just like frames.

661
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:17,592
So it's the best material to use as frames.

662
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:19,693
There are a lot of fascinating bicycles here.

663
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:20,763
- There are a lot. - Yes.

664
00:24:20,864 --> 00:24:22,022
That's so fascinating.

665
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,763
It looks like it's from "The Terminator".

666
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:25,093
It looks like Batman's bicycle.

667
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,593
It looks so cool.

668
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:28,833
It's called Harley-Davidson bicycle.

669
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,204
- They're car tires. - Yes.

670
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,602
- Did you make that yourself too? - Yes.

671
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,242
- You made it. - You made it?

672
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:38,714
Yes. I brought the bamboos from Damyang myself.

673
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,984
Over there, you can see a treadmill bicycle.

674
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,683
That's unique too.

675
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,483
(Unique bicycles we're seeing for the first time!)

676
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,453
(Are they real bicycles made by the owner?)

677
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:50,322
Then sir, that bicycle that goes round and round.

678
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,522
Why did you make that?

679
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,864
- That's for little kids. - I see.

680
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:55,363
It's for kids.

681
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,562
- You can ride it with your kids. - Sorry?

682
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,492
Buy that for you and your kids.

683
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:02,763
My kids will have fun with it only for five minutes.

684
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,404
- That's right. - It's easy to get tired of.

685
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,473
It just goes round and round.

686
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:08,602
- It just goes round and round. - It needs to move forward.

687
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:11,313
The boss glared at me slightly.

688
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,283
He glared at me slightly.

689
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:16,283
- It looks real. - I think this place is real.

690
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:19,053
I can feel so much pride in his eyes.

691
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:23,753
(Is he a real owner who is serious about his bicycles?)

692
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:26,924
- This place is real. - This is...

693
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,992
Nucksal knows well about bicycles.

694
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:32,262
- I do. - But I don't.

695
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:33,663
We went upstairs just now,

696
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,563
and he said there weren't any expensive bicycles.

697
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,002
There weren't any expensive frames.

698
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,403
- Yes. - What kind of expensive bicycles?

699
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,703
- Upstairs... - You know, Specialized and such.

700
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,403
I didn't bring in that brand.

701
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:43,974
I mainly have Wiawis bicycles.

702
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:47,082
- There are Wiawis bicycles... - Is that so?

703
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,614
that cost between 15,000 dollars to 20,000 dollars.

704
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,883
There are those upstairs?

705
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:51,684
Yes, it was a collaboration with Hyundai.

706
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,522
(This is the expensive bicycle.)

707
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:58,022
- What is this? - You don't know much, Nucksal.

708
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,092
You spoke as if you knew about bicycles really well,

709
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:00,762
but you're backing off now.

710
00:26:00,763 --> 00:26:03,163
He looks like a motorcycle gang on social media.

711
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:04,164
Really?

712
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:06,194
(Laughing)

713
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:10,003
(Bicycle gang, MC Nucksal)

714
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:13,403
- Can we try the bicycles? - You can.

715
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,302
Good. Please guide us through it.

716
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,312
This is a swan bicycle which you have to stand and ride.

717
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:18,572
It's quite hard to ride.

718
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:19,944
(You have to stand and ride it because it has no seat.)

719
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,413
Next, this is a bamboo bicycle.

720
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,012
It's quite tall, so you need to use a ladder to go up.

721
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,083
- That's why there's a ladder here. - I see.

722
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:29,852
I tried to ride it just now, but I couldn't go up.

723
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:31,923
It doesn't look like it,

724
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,724
but it's unexpectedly quite tall.

725
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,863
- I'll try riding it. - It's as tall as a horse.

726
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:37,333
(I'll try riding it.)

727
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,332
- Jae Seok! - It's dangerous.

728
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,333
- Jae Seok! - This is fine.

729
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,802
You have fear of heights!

730
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,633
- Jae Seok, it's dangerous! - Be careful.

731
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,802
- Jae Seok! - This is fine.

732
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:50,973
- Be careful. - What's wrong?

733
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,543
(He is suddenly getting scared.)

734
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:55,143
- Why is this so tall? - Your bottom!

735
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:56,383
- This... - Why?

736
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,052
- Why is this so tall? - Your bottom, gosh.

737
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:01,883
- Jae Seok. Gosh. - Okay.

738
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,483
Your bottom is... Amazing.

739
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:05,493
You really have a small bottom.

740
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:09,724
(It fits nicely in one hand.)

741
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,262
Don't look at my bottom!

742
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,332
He's the one looking.

743
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,703
It's small but firm.

744
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:14,704
(Shocking)

745
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:18,434
- Let go! - Gosh.

746
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:20,803
(He's honoured.)

747
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,302
- It's amazing, Jae Seok! - It's small but firm.

748
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:24,312
Is it pretty good?

749
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:26,272
Can you make an appearance in our music video next time?

750
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:27,582
- Okay. - Your bottom in our music video.

751
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,983
Your back.

752
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:31,082
- Your back. - But this will be fine, right?

753
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,383
- I won't let go. - Sir, is there no protective gear?

754
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,953
- Wait. - I won't let go.

755
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,993
- Let go! - Jae Seok, move your legs.

756
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,792
(Nucksal is having fun watching.)

757
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:41,193
- It's so tall. - I can't.

758
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,562
- Move your legs. - Why is this so funny?

759
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:44,864
- Do you need protective gears? - Protective gears.

760
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:47,262
- Wait. Move aside. - I'll act as your protective gear.

761
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:49,233
- Jessi, you need to let go. - Move aside.

762
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,772
- Jessi, you'll get hurt. - Jessi, you need to let go.

763
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,602
- Move aside, Jessi. - Jessi, you need to let go.

764
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:53,802
- Put it here. - Let go.

765
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,474
- Jessi, let go. - I'll get hurt because of you!

He's good.

(Mi Joo runs screaming with the ladder.)

- Jae Seok. - It has training wheels anyway.

- Mi Joo, move aside. - No?

770

(Okay then.)

00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:11,852
Okay.

(He starts riding again with their reliable support.)

775

- It's moving! - Nice!

776

- It's moving! - Hey.

777
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,292
- Look at that. - He's good.

778
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:22,032
- It's moving. - Move aside.

779
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,904
- Move aside where? - Move aside where?

780
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:25,602
Move aside.

- What is this? - Set up the ladder.

- What happened? - What are you doing?

796

It was scarier than I thought.

797

It's quite scary.

798

- Who wants to ride this? - CODE KUNST.

799

- Try it. - Won't it be difficult...

800
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,312
- if I can't change the direction? - You need to lean back.

801
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,812
- Like this? - Yes. Lean back and ride it.

802

- Okay. - He's not scared at all.

It's just in Korean.

1281
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:15,203
(Incredibly specific and varied descriptions)

1282
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:20,844
(Is it a real restaurant that sells this alcohol?)

1283
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,413
Isn't this scary?

1284
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:32,853
(An unidentified piece of cloth hangs lonely on a bare wall.)

1285
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:35,823
Isn't this scary?

1286
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:37,792
It's spooky to look at.

1287
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:38,793
(Exclaiming)

1288
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:40,663
I'm so scared.

1289
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,533
- Why is this hung here? - There must be a ghost.

1290
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,673
- What is this? - The lighting here is so...

1291
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:48,404
This place feels so spooky.

1292
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:49,873
Stop that.

1293
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:51,403
Seriously.

1294
00:46:51,404 --> 00:46:52,473
(Tends to seek scolding)

1295
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:55,582
(Is this just part of the real restaurant's concept?)

1296
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:56,943
(Or is it part of the crew's plan?)

1297
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:58,583
Let's all sit down to start.

1298
00:47:00,054 --> 00:47:03,122
I think the owner here...

1299
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,953
will have very long hair...

1300
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:06,653
and be super hip.

1301
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:07,952
I think it's a man.

1302
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:10,792
A young and hip man.

1303
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:13,293
I think he doesn't have hair and is just bald.

1304
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:17,404
I think his height would be 190cm and his weight 110kg.

1305
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,602
- That kind of vibe? - Yes.

1306
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,102
- Me too. - With an oversized apron.

1307
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:24,142
- You think he's tall? - The apron...

1308
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:26,614
would be like Choi Moo Sung's in "I Saw the Devil".

1309
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:29,542
You know the people who wear vests with no shirt underneath.

1310
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:30,944
- With a giant knife. - That's right.

1311
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,082
- It's strange. - I'm so curious about this place.

1312
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,353
- Shall we invite the owner? - Yes.

1313
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:36,884
Excuse me?

1314
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,923
I'm so curious. That door is open.

1315
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:39,953
It opens.

1316
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,522
I told you so!

1317
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:43,893
- Hello. - I told you so! I guessed right.

1318
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:45,634
- I got it right. - Hello.

1319
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:47,292
- Hello. - I guessed right.

1320
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:49,203
- Hello. - I got it right.

1321
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:51,363
(Do you have one?)

1322
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:53,102
(No, I don't.)

1323
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,673
(I don't.)

1324
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:56,403
(No, I just don't.)

1325
00:47:56,404 --> 00:47:59,372
(I just don't have one.)

1326
00:47:59,373 --> 00:48:00,872
(Lacking)

1327
00:48:00,873 --> 00:48:03,514
(There really is nothing here.)

1328
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:05,054
Hello.

1329
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:09,083
My name is Ju Hwan and I operate Je Il in Seongsu-dong.

1330
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:15,223
Je Il is a restaurant that has food and alcohol.

1331
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,263
At first, it was a factory,

1332
00:48:18,264 --> 00:48:20,594
then it was a workshop,

1333
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:22,563
and now I have taken it on.

1334
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:26,134
I'm sure people have expectations of what a restaurant should be.

1335
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:28,873
I wanted to break from the mould.

1336
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:32,573
I didn't want to follow a concept or certain ideas.

1337
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:35,412
It just formed organically around the guests...

1338
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,583
that visit us.

1339
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:39,453
The features of the interior are in the lines.

1340
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,352
There are only horizontal or vertical lines...

1341
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,994
which have become a feature of the space.

1342
00:48:46,094 --> 00:48:49,824
And the second feature is that there are many uncomfortable aspects.

1343
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,433
We hadn't considered anything to do with efficiency.

1344
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,563
But it's okay.

1345
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:58,573
If you're hoping for fun things to be made,

1346
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:00,674
that's not too big an ask.

1347
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:05,574
(This restaurant is based on the owner's philosophy.)

1348
00:49:05,674 --> 00:49:08,844
Sixth Sense. Is this place real?

1349
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,682
First of all, a bare restaurant is quite unique.

1350
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:15,784
Can you tell us about the concept?

1351
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:18,892
The concept is not quite as you mentioned.

1352
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:21,352
- It's not quite completely bare. - Is it bare?

1353
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:24,493
- It's not. - I actually thought a lot.

1354
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,763
But when we were making this space,

1355
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,202
certain people shared their stories with us.

1356
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:33,432
So I thought, "Should I make it based on those stories?"

1357
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:34,944
and that was the start.

1358
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:37,674
May I ask what that skirt is?

1359
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:40,014
What is it? Is there a story behind it?

1360
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,383
- I think there's a story there. - It's so scary.

1361
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:43,412
There's a story.

1362
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,753
- I will be making lunch soon. - Yes?

1363
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:47,653
And it's what I'll be wearing to make lunch.

1364
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:48,783
Sorry?

1365
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:50,784
Do you wear that to make lunch?

1366
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:54,154
- Why did you hang that up there? - Why is it hung there?

1367
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:57,522
I usually have objects...

1368
00:49:57,523 --> 00:49:59,932
in these spare spaces.

1369
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:04,264
And those objects add depth to the space.

1370
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,804
(Come to think of it, there are small props here and there.)

1371
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,702
(But he's hung up a skirt?)

1372
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,873
(And one that he wears, at that?)

1373
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:14,412
(Is this just part of the owner's artistic sense?)

1374
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:17,714
(Or is it the crew taking things a step too far?)

1375
00:50:18,353 --> 00:50:22,122
I heard we were sampling three dishes today. What are they?

1376
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:23,824
First of all, black pork.

1377
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,292
- Black pork? - Yes, then beef brisket.

1378
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,722
- And I heard you love noodles. - I do.

1379
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:31,522
- He's making something you like. - It's fake.

1380
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:33,693
Jae Seok doesn't like it when there are no noodles.

1381
00:50:33,694 --> 00:50:35,502
People usually perk up when they hear about the meat.

1382
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:37,733
I wasn't very perky when I heard the black pork or beef brisket.

1383
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,002
Jae Seok doesn't respond unless there are noodles.

1384
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,872
But you know, we have to be suspicious of places with dishes...

1385
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,503
- that Jae Seok likes. - Definitely.

1386
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:47,213
- I'm sorry, but we must suspect... - I really enjoy eating noodles.

1387
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:49,142
Yes, I heard you really like noodles...

1388
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:50,244
You made it deliberately, didn't you?

1389
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,653
I'm not sure if I made it especially for you...

1390
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,412
or if it was always on the menu.

1391
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:57,452
But you said you like noodles, so I'll be making them too.

1392
00:50:57,453 --> 00:50:58,553
All right, then.

1393
00:50:58,554 --> 00:50:59,554
(Is it a real restaurant that always had noodles on the menu?)

1394
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,222
Excuse me, sir. I'm very curious...

1395
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:04,323
about what happened to the sink in the bathroom.

1396
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:06,233
- Did you break it on purpose? - Was it done on purpose?

1397
00:51:06,234 --> 00:51:07,864
- The sink... - Not at all.

1398
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:11,263
The bathroom was completely fine. I wasn't the one who broke it.

1399
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:13,832
Someone happened to sit on the edge of it.

1400
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,002
- I see. - That's what happened.

1401
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,944
They must have broken it while looking for the cash register.

1402
00:51:17,203 --> 00:51:20,413
I was thinking of repairing it.

1403
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:23,014
But then I happened to wash my hands there,

1404
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:25,484
and realized that I was being very careful.

1405
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,453
Because I could see the broken edge.

1406
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,324
So the act of washing my hands very carefully...

1407
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,323
felt quite well aligned...

1408
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:36,363
to the story that was being told in this place.

1409
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:39,233
That's why I've left it that way.

1410
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,764
(He decided to keep it in its broken state.)

1411
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,162
Is it like modern dance?

1412
00:51:43,163 --> 00:51:44,932
Like we're participating in performance art?

1413
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:47,533
- Yes, it's something like that. - Like performance art?

1414
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:51,602
Your eyes look like those of a master who has reached nirvana.

1415
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:52,873
That's right. A lot of people say that.

1416
00:51:54,014 --> 00:51:56,514
If that person is fake,

1417
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:58,983
I think he could be a monk.

1418
00:51:58,984 --> 00:52:00,912
- Why would a monk be here? - That's too extreme.

1419
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:02,823
- Hey! Is it the hair? - Just because he's bald.

1420
00:52:02,824 --> 00:52:04,153
Hey, Sang Yeob, come on.

1421
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,522
That's the first thing I've said.

1422
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:06,823
- Sang Yeob... - Why are you all attacking me?

1423
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,122
Because you misspoke.

1424
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:09,923
- His hair... - Would a monk serve us black pork?

1425
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:13,033
- Right? - That makes no sense.

1426
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:14,792
That's just ridiculous.

1427
00:52:14,793 --> 00:52:16,734
(Nonsense)

1428
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,472
May I ask how much revenue...

1429
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:20,303
- you generate in a day? - I'm curious about that too.

1430
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,502
As you can see, half the store is empty.

1431
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:23,844
Indeed, this side is bare.

1432
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:26,943
I've left it bare so that I can be intentional...

1433
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:29,913
about using the space.

1434
00:52:30,344 --> 00:52:34,153
At most, I serve around eight tables a day,

1435
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,323
and it's around five tables on average.

1436
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:38,383
That's how inefficient the space is.

1437
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:41,863
But that's the choice I made to use this space exactly how I want.

1438
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:44,792
You still need to be operational, and eight tables a day...

1439
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:46,593
- seems like it wouldn't be enough. - Right?

1440
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:49,102
It's not easy. Definitely not.

1441
00:52:49,103 --> 00:52:52,433
But I'm persisting to put my own spin on everything.

1442
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:54,273
(A restaurant needs to generate revenue but it's wasting space.)

(Is this place fake?)

1444

I don't think you can define this place as just a restaurant.

1445
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:01,472
That's right. I don't want it to be labelled as anything.

1446
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,213
From what you're saying, you're not just making food here.

1447
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,752
- There's a certain atmosphere here. - That's right.

1448
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:08,452
- And an artistic element. - You must be the spy.

1449
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,324
Points of comparison too.

00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,293
What's with those lips?

1455
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,702
You're being so obvious, Nucksal.

1456
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:25,673
Jeez. The food tastes good, right?

1457
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:26,903
Yes, it tastes good.

1458
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,332
I'm getting a little hungry.

1459

May we request a meal, then?

1460
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:32,472
I'll start preparing it right away.

1461

- Continue chatting in the meantime. - Thank you.

"You must be the spy."

1463
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:39,513
No. Not at all.

1464

(Nucksal is especially polite to the owner. Is he today's spy?)

1465
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:42,824
- We'll play the game first. - Sure.

1466
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,753
The game we're playing here is called "Action Word Chain".

- "Action"? - "Action Word Chain"?

It's played the same way as Kung Kung Ta.

1471
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:57,703
We start by saying, "Action Word Chain starts now."

1472
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,272
If you say "monkey" then you also make a relevant action.

00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:02,373
(Saying a word then performing a relevant action)

1474
00:54:02,904 --> 00:54:04,803
- "Dog". - It's Jae Seok.

1475
00:54:04,804 --> 00:54:06,142
- "Woof woof." - And then, next would be...

1476
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:07,214
"Earth".

(Action relevant to "Earth")

1478
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,252
You lose if you miss the beat or can't think of one.

1479
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:13,253
Okay.

1480

- It's so difficult. - This is a hard one.

1481

Very difficult.

(The team with fewer losses will obtain the hint.)

1483
00:54:19,353 --> 00:54:22,923
We'll sit in alternating teams for this one. Who is first?

1484
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:24,162
- Jae Seok is first. - I'll start.

1485
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:25,163
All right, then.

1486

It won't make it this far.

We won't get a chance to play over here.

1488

Don't worry about it. Just watch how I do it.

You always say we should watch you.

- You always play the worst. - Just watch and learn.

- Okay, then. - Just watch me.

- Mildew too? - Everyone, here is...

2068
01:16:32,584 --> 01:16:35,593
(Are oil spatters made by the production crew or real?)

2069
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:39,093

2070

01:16:40,694 --> 01:16:42,562

(covers the meat...)

2076
01:16:51,103 --> 01:16:54,244
(and it's sold at a barbecue place?)

2077
01:16:54,813 --> 01:16:59,013
Hello, I sell the meat fermented and aged by mucor.

2078
01:16:59,484 --> 01:17:02,713
I'm the owner of a barbecue place that sells time.

2079
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:04,983
When you go to the countryside,

2080
01:17:04,984 --> 01:17:08,022
you might see white fungus on doenjang.

2081
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:11,463
I heard that adds a rich taste.

2082
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:16,293
So if you ferment the meat by applying it,

2083
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:20,403
it would create a deeper and richer taste, I thought.

2084
01:17:20,404 --> 01:17:22,004
That's why I began the fermenting and ageing method.

2085
01:17:23,273 --> 01:17:26,203
We age the meat for about 20 days.

2086
01:17:26,204 --> 01:17:30,114
We've aged the meat for six months maximum.

2087
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:33,182
But then, the taste becomes very different...

2088
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:34,483
from the taste of the meat we know.

2089
01:17:34,484 --> 01:17:36,382
The unique flavour of the aged meat...

2090
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,783
shouldn't be repulsed, and the proper period...

2091
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,993
was 20 days as we decided.

2092
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:44,664
So we sell the meat aged for 20 days.

2093
01:17:45,124 --> 01:17:48,533
In the case of the aged meat, temperature, humidity, and wind,

2094
01:17:48,534 --> 01:17:50,504
these three elements are very important.

2095
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:54,003
When just one of these elements doesn't go right,

2096
01:17:54,004 --> 01:17:58,443
the meat goes bad or loses a commercial value.

2097
01:17:58,444 --> 01:18:02,443
So we made an ageing storage outside and manage it in a special way.

2098
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,613
The meat fermented and aged by mucor...

2099
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,483
has all the advantages of dry-ageing,

2100
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:11,883
and mucor retains the moisture of the meat from outside.

2101
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:14,453
It makes the meat juicier...

2102
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:17,923
and taste much better.

2103
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:22,034
Sixth Senser, is this place real?

2104
01:18:24,563 --> 01:18:28,203
We came here thinking the meat here has hair on it.

2105
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,273
Isn't that right?

2106
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,272
- It's a fungus. - Yes, it's mucor.

2107
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:35,312
To put it simply, domestic pork...

2108
01:18:35,313 --> 01:18:38,284
is dry-aged and we spray mucor on it.

2109
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:42,483
Then the taste and flavour of the meat...

2110
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,723
get more condensed.

2111
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,793
I'm glad to hear that.

2112
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:48,693
It's not hair, but mucor.

2113
01:18:48,694 --> 01:18:50,562
I was surprised at first.

2114
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:51,663
I was surprised too.

2115
01:18:51,664 --> 01:18:53,163
I'm going to eat a lot of meat then.

2116
01:18:53,164 --> 01:18:55,793
- We thought the meat has hair. - I thought of hair on the meat.

2117
01:18:55,794 --> 01:18:58,462
We thought you'd serve the meat with a lot of hair.

2118
01:18:58,463 --> 01:19:00,573
We age the meat by making mucor grow on it.

2119
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:01,602
The meat is fermented and aged.

2120
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,903
- Then this place is real. - Right.

2121
01:19:03,904 --> 01:19:07,772
- It's dry-ageing. - Then the meat has mucor on it?

2122
01:19:07,773 --> 01:19:10,142
Yes.

2123
01:19:10,143 --> 01:19:11,143
(Mucor on the meat?)

2124
01:19:11,144 --> 01:19:14,552
Is it there when served to us?

2125
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:16,484
(The meat with mucor is more shocking.)

2126
01:19:16,923 --> 01:19:18,783
It can be surprising. Can we see it too?

2127
01:19:18,784 --> 01:19:20,093
- Can we see it? - Yes.

2128
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:22,352
- It would feel weird. - Yes, it would.

2129
01:19:22,353 --> 01:19:25,623
- The meat is served with mucor. - It seems that he brought it now.

2130
01:19:25,624 --> 01:19:27,932
I'll show it to you.

2131

Sir, I've never seen something like that before.

2158
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,733
Usually, when there's a fungus on a fruit,

2159
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:40,403
you can see the hair on the fungus.

- Is it different from that? - It's different from that fungus.

We used this ageing method...

2162

for the first time in Korea.

2163

The outside of the meat...

2164
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:51,783
We dry age it...

2165
01:20:51,784 --> 01:20:55,182
and spray the special hair mould we made.

(2. Spray the special hair mould.)

2167
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:01,624
After 15 days, the mould grows.

01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:05,892
Then it becomes fermented and dry-aged.
