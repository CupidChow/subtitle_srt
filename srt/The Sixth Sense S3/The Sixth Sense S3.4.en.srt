I was like, "Really?"

I said, "What do I tell the producer?"

218

He said, "The producer will understand."

Since this is nearby a university, I decided to run an internet cafe.

I used to run a sashimi restaurant,

00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,259
- But the sashimi is really good. - It is delicious.

799
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,700
The sashimi is chewy.

800
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,470
(Such high-quality sashimi in an internet cafe? Is this fake?)

801
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:12,809
Eating this while playing games is nice.

802
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,139
I think it'll be fine.

803
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,710
I got it right away as soon as I ate the ramyeon.

804
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,679
- Why? Is this place fake? - This place is fake.

805
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,709
- No. - Then is this place real?

806
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,920
- This place is real. - Why?

807
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,618
The ramyeon is unique to this cafe,

808
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,819
and the recipe brings out a distinctive flavor.

809

811

Can I say one more thing?

812
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,259
Jae Seok! He wants you to listen!

813
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,798
I feel like you're trying to disturb me from playing an active role,

814
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,169
but I'm done analyzing.

815
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,170
- Why? - Because...

816
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:45,569
shouldn't the bowls have the name of the internet cafe?

817

(There's no name imprinted on the bowls?)

818
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,308
We have to put the keyboard up to eat this.

819
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:53,309
I know.

820
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,148
If you put it like this, you can't play games.

821

(The food can only be eaten if the keyboard is cleared away.)

I found something huge.

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,190
Okay, what is it?

824
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:03,960
If this is a real internet cafe, the games should be updated.

825
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,430
Gosh, Choi Tae Joon. He's so rowdy.

826
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,259
I usually don't say this to guests.

827
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,199
Let me check this one thing.

828
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,599
Tae Joon is so talkative. Seriously.

829
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:20,138
I'm 100 percent sure Jae Seok is the spy today.

830
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:22,838
Wait, it's because he's the spy.

831
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,048
- You're right. - That's why he's acting like this.

832
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,848
- It's not because you're talkative. - That's right.

833
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,449
- I'll just call you oppa, okay? - Sure.

834
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,780
(I'll just call you oppa.)

835
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:32,548
- You're not... - Is Tae Joon older than you?

836
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,848
- No. - No.

837
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,058
No, but he's married.

838
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,388
Why would you call him older when he's younger than you?

839
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:41,029
It's because he's married.

840
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,298
- What are you talking about? - He's an old man now.

841
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,098
- I am an old man. - He is,

842
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:47,328
- but still, he's not your oppa. - Let me just call him that.

843
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:48,869
Okay, it's up to you.

844
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,368
You guys are making me confused.

(I'm happy even though I'm an old man.)

846
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,009
This place does seem a little off,

847
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,108
but I still think it's real.

848
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:58,679
This one's hard to tell.

849
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,349
It seems fake but real at the same time.

850
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,420
But that's what Sixth Sense is like.

851
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:05,618
Right.

852
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:07,588
Now that I think about it, I just stated the obvious.

853

(It's like saying you're full after eating.)

(Is this really an internet cafe that slices sashimi?)

855
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,828
Okay, everyone. We will now play the game for the hint.

856
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:17,699
We will play in the sashimi restaurant next door.

857
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,769
Okay.

859

Oh, it's a sashimi restaurant.

860
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,308
What?

861
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:28,710
Hello.

862
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,980
Oh, he owns both places?

863
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,148
Isn't the internet cafe too big?

864
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:35,919
The internet cafe is so big...

865
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,379
compared to the sashimi restaurant.

866
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,519

How much was the crab ramyeon at the internet cafe?

- It was six dollars, right? - Yes.

(The price of the same menu is different?)

877

If they sell it for 6 dollars over there, would you eat it here for 15?

878

The quality of the ramyeon could be different.

Don't you think this is too much?

886

I mean, the best production crew made the game, so it has to be fun.

It sounds so fun just hearing the name.

There's a famous meme of Sae Ho.

00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,579
Indeed. It would have been too expensive.

1272
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,550
(They enter the restaurant.)

1273
00:43:57,619 --> 00:43:58,650
(Exclaiming)

1274
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,819
It seems...

1275
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,349
It seems too nice.

1276
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:06,360
(Along the long corridor, passed the vacant store)

1277
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,759
- This is... - Gosh.

1278
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:13,599
It's too clean and neat.

1279
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,070
(This is what setting the mood is all about.)

1280
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,138
(The restaurant shows clear signs of being visually focused.)

1281
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:21,369
It's like a jungle.

1282
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,880
(Has this place really become famous for its employee's looks?)

1283
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:33,388
This place looks like a bar where people hook up.

1284
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:35,989
- "A bar where people hook up." - It could be exactly that.

1285
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,419
- If you lift these up... - These?

1286
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,428
- you're open to hooking up. - Send that table...

1287
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:42,058
- a plate of tteokbokki. - Do these light up?

1288
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,428
- Yes. - That's right.

1289
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:45,658
This is just...

1290
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:46,799
(Are these fake props that the crew set up?)

1291
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,130
It's so hard today.

1292
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,099
Could they really make 50,000 dollars in sales here?

1293
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,569
- That wouldn't be easy. - Yes. That's right. The sales.

1294
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,610
- Because it's 50,000 dollars. - That's the key here.

1295
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,808
It's really hard today...

1296
00:44:57,809 --> 00:44:59,879
because they all seem fake, not real.

1297
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,949
(The space looks too small to generate 50,000 dollars in sales.)

1298
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:04,379
Speaking as a professional...

1299
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,020
Sorry? Who is the professional?

1300
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,919
- Sorry? - Are you the professional?

1301
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,988
I'm a professional deducer.

1302
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:11,058
- Doesn't that look like Mi Joo? - What?

1303
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:12,420
(Doesn't that look like Mi Joo?)

1304
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:13,659
What does?

1305
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:15,089
(They actually look similar.)

1306
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,158
Just how they look right now.

1307
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,829
I think of So Min every time I see a monkey.

1308
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,129
That's right.

1309
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,368
So Min! Come on down.

1310
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:25,599
(We miss you, Monkey So Min.)

1311
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,169
First of all, when you go to a bar,

1312
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,909
the tables are never this small.

1313
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,009
(The circular tables are smaller than other bars.)

1314
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,808
I'm 100 percent certain of this.

1315
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:37,319
And, if they made that much money,

1316
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,250
they would have installed a chandelier.

1317
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:42,449
(She said "chandelier".)

1318
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,389
I thought you were cursing.

1319
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,189
- Chandelier. - They don't open during the day.

1320
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,658
They open at 7pm and use that projector on that wall.

1321
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:51,459
That would give it a hip vibe.

1322
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,598
That's what they're going for.

1323
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,569
You don't know what it would be like at night with the projector on.

1324
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,198
It could create a good mood in the evenings.

1325
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,610
That's right. A lot of bars use projectors at night.

1326
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,278
I think it would set a nice mood at night.

1327
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:05,440
And with each of these lights too.

1328
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,709
I think there would also be quite unique staff members too.

1329
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,919
I've been considering this for a while, and I'm not sure...

1330
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,920
- if I should mention it. - Yes?

1331
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:14,388
- May I say it? - Yes, please do.

1332
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:16,219
Your shirt keeps riding up above your navel.

1333
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,360
My shirt?

1334
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,019
Your shirt keeps riding up above your navel.

1335
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,290
(My shirt?)

1336
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,028
I'm sorry.

1337
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,698
This guy keeps wearing clothes that are too small for him.

1338
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,529
I'm sorry to say this, but are you...

1339
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:30,339
a retired thug from this area?

1340
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,369
No, I'm not.

1341
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,539
- A retired thug. - I'm not a thug.

1342
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,379
- A former thug from this area. - No, I'm not a thug.

1343
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,409
- You're not? - No.

1344
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,539
That's so funny.

1345
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,849
You're somewhat dressed that way.

1346
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,749
We will now introduce the owners who make 50,000 dollars in sales...

1347
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,678
with their good-looking staff.

1348
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,119
- I'm really curious about them. - Wait just a moment.

1349
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,219
What kind of men are they?

1350
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,329
(Wait. Why are you flipping your hair?)

1351
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:54,689
They could be women!

1352
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,929
We're not introducing them specifically to you.

1353
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,328
There are a lot of chairs. There must be five owners.

1354
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:00,399
(Are there 5 owners?)

1355
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,939
- It's five people? - Wait. I don't want to sit here.

1356
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,138
- Why not? - Mi Joo, do you want to sit here?

1357
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:05,300
No, I'm too shy.

1358
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,369
(Another person who is nervous right now)

1359
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,880
- Should I go there? - I'm sitting too close.

1360
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,009
Jae Seok, switch places with me.

1361
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,449
- I'll sit on the end. - Come over here.

1362
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,118
- I'll sit there. - That's not it.

1363
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:18,779
How pretty and handsome are they?

1364
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,218
- What did you say? - "Pretty and handsome".

1365
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:21,249
"Pretty and handsome".

1366
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,690
- Tequila! - You haven't slept, have you?

1367
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,589
What are you talking about?

1368
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,059
The view from here is great.

1369
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,329
I want to meet them as soon as possible.

1370
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,859
I'm really curious to see who they are.

1371
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,130
Are they coming out?

1372
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,529
Hello, there.

1373
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,800
Hello, there.

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,009
(The good-looking owners are entering.)

1375

(These handsome men do the cooking.)

1376
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:49,279
(And these gorgeous women do the serving.)

1377
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:55,650
(This restaurant increased sales 8-fold with good-looking staff.)

1378
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,290
(Are you all models?)

1379
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:04,098
(Lines form on the 6th floor for this bar and its gorgeous staff.)

1380
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:06,299
We have a relaxed mood,

1381
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,039
where you can enjoy good music and delicious food.

1382
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,469
We are "Concrete Jungle".

1383
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,839
At first, we promoted the restaurant...

1384
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,309
by taking to the streets...

1385
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:19,340
and handing out vouchers.

1386
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,379
Then we became known as the bar with good-looking staff.

1387
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,319
And word got around.

1388
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,649
We filmed material on a different platform,

1389
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,520
and it went quite viral.

1390

(Looks that couldn't avoid going viral)

1391

at this store.

1395
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,609
I think they wait for an average of two hours.

(Proud)

1397

Sixth Sensers.

1399

Is this place real...

1400
00:48:57,849 --> 00:48:59,250
or fake?

1401
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:03,888
Can you please introduce this place?

1402

These two and I are friends from high school.

1407
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,969
And we opened a bar together. Say hello.

1408
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,710
Hello.

- Are there five owners? - Who is the owner?

- The three of us. - You're the owners?

- The men here. - You're in business together?

You're all so handsome.

What are your names?

1418
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,359
I think you're overstepping.

1419
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,559
Why would you ask such a thing?

1420
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,258
- I think you're being rude. - Sae Ho wants their numbers.

1421
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:46,999
You're being too forward by asking them their names.

- I see. - Not at all.

No, it's Han Ju.

1426
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:56,379
Would her name be "An Ju"?

1427
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,239
- Was that intentional? - Gosh.

1428
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:00,079
- She's sitting right there. - I'm sorry.

1429
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:01,578
My apologies, Han Ju.

1430
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:03,278
Not at all.

1431
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:06,919
Aside from everything, we heard your monthly intake is 50,000 dollars.

1432
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,988
Yes. Our sales figures at 1st, in our 1st month of trading,

1433
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:11,559
were around 7,000 dollars.

1434
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,158
We were operating like that when a certain platform...

1435
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:16,959
decided to film us.

1436
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,199
And since then, we've made around eight times more.

1439
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,468
(Yes, I do.)

1442

(is this video with 1.7 million views on YouTube.)

1443
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:38,420
(Is this bar with good-looking staff and 50,000-dollar sales real?)

1444
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:40,489

1445
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:44,119
(Or is it all a ruse fabricated by the crew?)

1446
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:45,790
Can I ask a pointed question?

1447
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:47,528
- Okay. - Yes.

1448
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:50,198
- So trade is restricted right now. - Yes.

1449
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:51,960
Hasn't it affected your sales at all?

1450
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,629
We haven't actually traded normally yet.

1451
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,369
So it's difficult to judge.

1452
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:59,569
What do you mean, you haven't traded normally?

1453
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,369
We opened in December 2020.

1454
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:03,609
So we're in our second year.

1455
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,839
It's been 20 years?

1456
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,508
- No, since 2020. - We opened in 2020.

1457
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,448
- In 2020. - I can't hear you very well here.

1458
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:12,020
Put your hair behind your ear. That's it.

1459
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:13,420
(I want to hear their voices.)

1460
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,649
It's been one year and three months.

1461
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,718
One year and three months?

1462
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:17,118
There were always restrictions...

1463
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,459
And you're still making 50,000 dollars per month?

1464
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,489
- Yes. - Even now?

1465
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,758
- Yes. - Still?

1466
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:23,729
So if the restrictions lift, then...

1467
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,558
You're still making 50,000 dollars per month?

1468
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:26,769
- Really? - Yes.

1469
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,900
(Their sales figures are unbelievable. Are they real?)

1470
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:29,868
May I ask a question?

1471
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:30,968
Of course you can.

1472
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:33,969
The 3 male owners, on the count of 3,

1473
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,138
could you name your high school?

1474
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:37,480
I think that's a little rude.

1475
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:40,278
- It's too simple. - That's personal information.

1476
00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:41,550
The question is too easy.

1477
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,348
They would have rehearsed that.

1478
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:44,419
You went to the same high school, right?

1479
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,348
We should be requesting that they sing their school song.

1480
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:47,750
- Their school song? - Yes.

1481
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:51,359
I discovered something here earlier, Jae Seok.

1482
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,859
- Which? - Is there a Don Seong among you?

1483
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,928
- That's me. - Are you Don Seong?

1484
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:58,159
It says, "Don Seong, how many languages can you speak?"

1485
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,099
You know about it.

1486
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:02,428
It says, "Don Seong, how many languages can you speak?"

1487
00:52:02,429 --> 00:52:05,539
And then it says, "Japanese, Korean, tasty, and good-looking."

1488
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,610
Oh, my gosh.

1489
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,540
What is that?

1490
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,880
That was her playing a prank.

1491
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:13,349
Are you two dating?

1492
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:14,650
- No. - Not at all.

1493
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:18,778
There are others. When did you give that to me?

1494
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:20,848
- It was on Pepero Day. - Yes, Pepero Day.

1495
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,848
- No, it was at Christmas. - Yes, Christmas.

1496
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:24,089
- Is that so? - Yes, on Christmas eve.

1497
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,888
Just a moment. This looks like they're acting.

1498
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:28,258
It seems like acting.

1499
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,429
They're a little out of sync.

1500
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:31,799
I've figured it out.

1501
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,170
- I know what it is. - We've caught them out.

1502
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,469
These people are all members of the same college club.

1503
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,739
- Which college club? - I'm not sure about that.

1504
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,040
Sand art.

1505
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,149
"Sand art?" Randomly?

1506
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,609
Yes. Shadows.

1507
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,419
- People who do sand art... - Yes, a shadows college club.

1508
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,480
- tend to wear black. - The way I see it,

1509
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:54,218
they're members of the same college club.

1510
00:52:54,219 --> 00:52:55,919
- They definitely seem like a team. - Right?

1511
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
(Are they all members of a sand art college club?)

1512
00:52:56,921 --> 00:52:58,920
May we request some food?

1513
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,488
- Yes. - All right.

1514
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:03,259
(A requisite factor for judging famous restaurants is the food.)

1515
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,730
I'm so confused.

1516
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,528
I don't think they could make as much as 50,000 dollars in sales.

1517
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:11,439
- It's impossible to make that much. - Impossible.

1518
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,468
I think this place is fake. Right?

1519
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:16,439
That's right. This place is fake. What kind of alcohol do you sell?

1520
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,308
We have Terra and Cass.

1521
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:21,149
You make 50,000 dollars selling beer?

1522
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,519
We also sell spirits, but I don't know the names of them.

1523
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,249
Why don't you know the names? Don't you take the orders?

1524
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,920
- I take the orders for spirits. - That's right.

1525
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,859
- Why? - I have a bad memory.

1526
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,258
So what are you in charge of, ma'am?

1527
00:53:33,259 --> 00:53:34,959
Ma'am is the manager.

1528
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,829
"Ma'am is..."

1529
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,698
I mean, me. I'm the manager.

1530
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,429
I manage the floor.

1531
00:53:40,529 --> 00:53:42,670
- I think you're quite flustered. - Yes.

1532
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,469
Why don't you take a break?

1533
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,669
(Leaving with a trail of suspicion behind her)

1534
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,569
- Jae Seok, I can't do this. - Why?

1535
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,940
He keeps saying, "Ask where they live."

1536
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,649
He keeps doing it.

1537
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,249
If we know where they live,

1538
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,118
we can figure out if it's a plausible place.

1539
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,778
You just keep making errors.

1540
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:02,649
Just a moment. This is important. She doesn't know the alcohol?

1541
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,819
She doesn't know the drinks,

1542
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,790
and she's also brought out far too many plates.

1543
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,029
Nothing really fits into place.

1544
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,269
Han Ju came over here and made huge mistakes.

1545
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:16,070
She brought around 20 plates out to us.

1546
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,368
(The staff don't seem to know anything about serving.)

1547
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:20,270
Aren't there around 20 plates here?

1548
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:21,509
Is she nervous?

1549
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,679
This is quite...

1550
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,479
Shall we play a game before the food arrives?

1551
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,480
- Yes. - Sure.

1552
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:31,218
The game we're playing here is the Category Relay Initials Game.

1553
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:33,250
- Relay Initials Game? - Isn't that what we played earlier?

1554
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,848
- It's a little different. - Sounds fun.

1555
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:39,319
They would come to this restaurant if they're standing there like that.

1556
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,360
Those two people.

1557
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,129
- Your eyes are drawn to them. - Right?

1558
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,158
- My eyes really are drawn to them. - They are, indeed.

1559
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,299
They're all standing in a line.

1560
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,698
- Those two people are real. - They look so cool.

1561
00:54:46,699 --> 00:54:48,000
They look like a group.

1562
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:49,799
They're so cool.

1563
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,570
Are the turtlenecks part of their uniform?

1564
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,409
The guy standing next to Don Seong, what's your name?

1565
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:59,210
- My name is Jeon Yun Cheol. - All right, Yun Cheol.

1566
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:01,979
Na Ra is really enjoying herself.

1567
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,178
She has a boyfriend too.

1568
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:05,020
I think the Relay Initials Game will be fun.

(Laughing)

1570
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,049
- Just a moment. - Are you here for the games?

1571
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,888
- It's so fun. - I'm here for the games too.

1572

- It sounds fun. - Me too.

1573
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,029
What's the game again?

1574
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,658
It's a Relay Initials Game.

1575
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:16,928
How many times are you saying that?

1576
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:18,729
How many times has he said "Relay Initials Game"?

1577
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,070
How do we play it?

Right?

Do they eat the ice cream and then go in here?

- This is just a barbecue place. - It is.

It smells like barbecue. It smells good.

Let's say this place is real.

Can that gelato place be fake?

Jessi, it's like this. If it's fake,

2076
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,909
the gelato place out front can be fake.

2077

- Right! - The barbecue place is real.

2078

Right.

2079

- That makes sense. - But what's important...

2080
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:51,720
is that I received a coffee truck run by that company.

2081

From my friend.

2082

- The gelato place? - Yes.

2084

- It was the same brand? - Yes.

2085
01:12:57,859 --> 01:12:59,259
Did they have rib gelato then?

2086
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,818
They had rib gelato then.

2087
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:01,890

He did a terrible job as a spy on the first episode,

three years ago with my two sons.

Recently, people heard about our gelato,

2120

so our sales went up ten percent,

and it's about 100,000 dollars.

01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,129
My father runs a barbecue restaurant,

2123
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,639
so he suggested I come up with some recipes to enjoy as dessert.

2124
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,608
That's how I made the sujeonggwa and sikhye flavors.

Then we wanted to try something unique,
