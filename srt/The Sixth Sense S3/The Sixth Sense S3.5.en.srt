(But...)

493
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:57,603
Isn't this a kalguksu restaurant?

(They came to the correct address, but it's a kalguksu restaurant?)

495
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,542
It really is a kalguksu restaurant.

- But this is... - This...

501
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,508
(As they check the rather suspicious exterior...)

502
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:16,077
They have abalone kimchi bossam.

503
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:19,248
- They have chives jeon too. - My goodness.

504
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,017
They sell ten servings only for that menu, right?

505
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,018
That's right.

506
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,018
(Is that the main dish of today among many other dishes?)

507
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:24,187
This doesn't look like an idea...

508
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,548
that the production crew came up with.

509
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:27,817
Then it makes sense.

510
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,727
I understand why they only sell ten servings.

511
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,626
They don't only sell kimchi.

512
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:35,926
- I can't suspect this. - This...

513
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,227
- Look at how worn out they look. - Exactly.

514

(Faded banner and the signboard with the 90s vibe)

515

- I can't suspect this. - This place is real.

(Is Spot 1, which is naturally worn out, real?)

517

It's a pass for now.

518
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,278
But it looks a bit like a Chinese restaurant.

519
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:50,247
It does look like a Chinese restaurant.

520
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,248
(It looks like a Chinese restaurant, which doesn't suit kimchi.)

(Spot 1 that sells abalone kimchi bossam)

- Shall we go in? - Okay.

523
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:58,617
But how...

524
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,657
did the production crew choose exactly what I like?

525

(Excuse me, you're here for abalone kimchi.)

(Simple interior that can be seen at once)

This place feels like... Was it Izakaya?

528

It feels like Izakaya.

(The interior design doesn't really match the food.)

531
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,277
They kept the vibe of the olden times well.

(Do they really sell abalone kimchi bossam here?)

Gosh, this is...

- Gosh, the design... - It's so pretty here.

535
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,646
The cats look real.

(They appreciate the cats on the roof first.)

(Cute character items are placed in various places.)

540

The owner must like small figures.

It's so pretty here.

542
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,836
It has the Huam-dong vibe.

It's a bit...

549
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:01,617
It smells like the place is actually used.

550
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,187
I can smell that this place has been used for quite a long time.

- It smells old. - It really feels like it's used.

You know what? I honestly thought this was your house.

Jessi.

- Isn't this place real? - This place is real.

This place is... The structure itself...

562

- looks very familiar. - Things like these are real.

- They turned it off for now. - Is that so?

Your hairstyle is the fakest thing today.

(Lee Yi Kyung has a bad hairstyle.)

570

Isn't it a bit strange to have those hanging there?

571
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:53,468
Only three of them are put up there. Don't they look too deliberate?

572
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,697
But they did paste the menu...

573
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:56,867
on other places too.

574
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:59,906
The place looks real, but pasting these things...

575
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,038
look strange.

576
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,008
But look at it overall.

577
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:07,176
You guys are...

578
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:08,448
beginners, so you can't catch the details.

579

You guys are beginners, so you can't catch the details.

You're a spy, right?

581

- You're the worst here. - Listen.

- I'll teach you. Look. - Have you been to a pub before?

584
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:20,198
- Have you been to a pub before? - They're at it again.

585
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:23,498
- You don't even drink. - I went to one since the 90s.

586
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:25,566
You don't even drink, so how do you know Izakaya?

587
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,137
- Exactly. - Guys, I'm saying this...

588
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:29,836
because you don't know this.

589
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:33,468
The roof's tiles, flowers, and cats.

590
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,508
What can you feel?

591
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,606
- They're just cats. - No.

592
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,076
She smirked.

593
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,518
They're fake.

594
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,846
- Don't you get it, Na Ra? - What about it?

595
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,616
- It's random, right? - It is.

596
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,487
- Exactly. That's exactly why... - It looks deliberate.

597
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,287
- But the owner... - this is what the owner likes.

598
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:50,458
- He... - That's right.

599
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,057
Because the interior design...

600
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,626
I'm sorry to the owner,

601
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,198
but the owner just decorated however he liked.

602
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:57,866
Do you know what I mean?

603
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,468
(If it were fake, the decorations would've been unified!)

604
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,666
To give you a hint about the fake place,

605
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,666
focus on the detail today.

606
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,738
The detail?

607
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:06,767
(She's confused from the random hint.)

608
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:07,978
- Let's sit. - Okay.

609
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:09,978
- Jessi. - Jessi.

610
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,478
Jessi.

611
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:14,417
- This place is fake! - Why?

612
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:16,988
The flower's touching my head.

613
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,688
- This place is fake. - Sit down.

614
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:23,688
(They would've put "Watch Out" sign if it were a real place.)

615
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:27,528
(But "Watch Out" sign is nowhere to be seen.)

616
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:31,867
(Is the lowly set up decoration the production crew's mistake?)

617
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,798
Mi Joo, putting the flower on your head...

618
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:35,937
- makes you look crazy. - It's in English.

619
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,906
(It makes you look crazy.)

620
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:40,907
(It suits Crazy Me Joo naturally.)

621
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:43,037
- So... - Yes.

622
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:44,846
At first,

623
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,277
I thought this place was fake when I just saw the phrase,

624
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:48,576
but there are other dishes.

625
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,076
So there's a reason why they only sell ten dishes...

626
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,146
of abalone kimchi.

627
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:52,916
That's right. Since it's expensive,

628
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,387
not many people would order it.

629
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:57,356
And steaming abalone...

630
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:59,157
and kimchi takes a long time.

631
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,327
Then shall we meet the owner first?

632
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:04,166
I'll reel in my talk.

633
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,228
(I'll stop talking.)

634
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:09,198
- He needs the food quickly. - As expected, you're so fast.

635
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,938
Since they're being very suspicious about me, I'll reel in my talk...

636
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,307
and put it in my pocket.

637
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,337
(See you later, talk.)

638
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,737
Should I call the owner?

639
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,048
Excuse me.

640
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,676
This is the first time I'm curious about the owner.

641
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,346
- He's coming. - Where is he?

642
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:22,376
Hello.

643
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,377
(He appears quietly from behind.)

644
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:24,688
- Hello. - Hello.

645
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:28,187
Hello. I sell live abalone kimchi bossam.

646
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:30,387
I'm the manager of the kalguksu restaurant, Seung Jae.

647
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,356
This place was opened in March last year.

648
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:35,596
We sell meals in the afternoon and alcohol at night.

649
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:37,396
It's a new restaurant which opened a year ago.

650
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:38,567
(A new, good restaurant which opened a year ago)

651
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:42,967
The restaurant sells bossam, kalguksu,

652
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:45,967
fish-flavored gimmari, Mapo tofu, and various fusion cuisines.

653
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:46,978
(They sell various fusion cuisines aside from abalone kimchi.)

654
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:48,876
Among them, the most popular dishes are...

655
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:51,677
clam kalguksu and live abalone kimchi bossam.

656
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,978
(What's the secret behind live abalone kimchi bossam?)

657
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:56,747
I think people have strong stereotype...

658
00:23:56,748 --> 00:23:58,587
toward kimchi.

659
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:01,687
For most kimchi in Korea, it is salted for a long time...

660
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:03,727
and is mixed with sauce after the water's drained out.

661
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:05,557
But we strayed from that method...

662
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:07,197
and salted the cabbages just a bit...

663
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:08,927
so that they were crunchy.

664
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,527
Unlike previous kimchi,

665
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:12,326
we made salad-like kimchi.

666
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,367
(They made kimchi with a unique texture.)

667
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,997
And our kimchi is special...

668
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:17,907
because it uses live abalone.

669
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:21,376
Live abalone is all about its freshness.

670
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,748
So we buy just enough for one day.

671
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,146
And we clean it using a specially-made brush.

672
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:30,916
A lot of people think...

673
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,257
abalone is invigorating food.

674
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:36,117
(Abalone feels a lot like it's invigorating food.)

675
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,557
As we cooked bossam and abalone together,

676
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,797
we focused on the fact that bossam can also become...

677
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:42,357
invigorating food.

678
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,727
Sixth Sensers. Is this place real?

679
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:48,438
(New kind of bossam that sells only 10 dishes a day)

680
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:52,268
- Hello. - Hello.

681
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,778
- He's younger than I thought. - He's very...

682
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,646
His vibe goes well with the restaurant.

683
00:24:57,647 --> 00:24:59,477
- Does he? I think he's a student. - He looks like...

684
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:02,076
- he studies Korean literature. - He looks like a student.

685
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:05,387
(Is he real with unique taste? Or is he fake hired by the crew?)

686
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:07,057
How long has it been since you opened this restaurant?

687
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,958
I opened it in March last year.

688
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,558
- It hasn't been long. - It just became one year ago.

689
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:13,326
- One year? That's quite new. - This much in just a year...

690
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:14,457
- It's quite new, - It's small.

691
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:15,596
But the place looks old.

692
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,856
The place looks pretty old.

693
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:19,698
(Can the place look this used in just 1 year?)

694
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:21,768
- How used it looks and so on. - Was this...

695
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:24,837
I wanted to make this place feel like an old place...

696
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:27,007
because instead of the vibe of a new place,

697
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:30,847
I wanted the comfortable vibe that an old place gives off.

698
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,777
So I opened a pub which went under,

699
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:35,147
and I changed it to a traditional restaurant which went under too.

700
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:39,586
I overlapped layers of such vibes to form this.

701
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:40,656
(He did it on purpose.)

702
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:41,718
(He purposely layered the artificial sense of time.)

703
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,717
I think it used to be a barbecue restaurant.

704
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,086
I don't think so.

705
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,827
It's too small to have been a barbecue restaurant.

706
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,597
- You guessed wrong. - I see. Sorry.

707
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:53,268
(Mi Joo is so fun to tease.)

708
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,197
- Do you make kimchi every time? - Is it expensive?

709
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:57,967
I make the sauce and kimchi myself.

710
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:00,008
(You make it yourself?)

711
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:03,237
People come to a pub mainly for alcohol and drinking snacks.

712
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:04,547
Do you have time to make kimchi?

713
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,176
The restaurant opens at 5pm,

714
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:09,747
but we come to work at 11am to prepare.

715
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:10,748
- That's so early. - It's hard to make.

716
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,018
You make it just beforehand.

717
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:14,057
He can only make ten servings because it's hard to make.

718
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:15,316
It must be hard.

719
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:16,317
(It's suspicious.)

720
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:19,987
First of all, for the food, chabalone kimchi...

721
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:21,857
- He must be really hungry. - "Chabalone kimchi"?

722
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:23,728
What's "chabalone"?

723
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:26,096
- Slow down. What was that? - This...

724
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,997
If I say 1 wrong thing here, 3 people come at me.

725
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:31,308
Don't be nervous.

726
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:32,538
He's with "Charlie's Angels",

727
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,278
- so imagine how nervous he must be. - That's for indigestion.

728
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,508
Why would you rub here for nervousness?

729
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,207
It's for indigestion.

730
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,278
(Her kindness was a bit lacking.)

731
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:43,047
Is that the signature menu of the restaurant?

732
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:44,416
The restaurant name says "kalguksu".

733
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,417
Exactly.

734
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:49,317
We sell kalguksu and bossam during lunch as a set menu.

735
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:50,758
Didn't you say you open...

736
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,427
- Didn't you say you open at 5pm? - in the evening?

737
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:57,897
(Just now, he said the restaurant opens at 5pm.)

738
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:01,367
(He's too suspicious.)

739
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:04,538
We have a different menu for lunch and dinner.

740
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,708
- You do open for lunch. - That's right.

741
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:09,537
(Is it a lie of an actor who said it wrongly from memorizing quickly?)

742
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:11,778
(Or is it a mistake of a real owner who is nervous?)

743
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,808
Okay. Can we taste the food now?

744
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,677
- I'll get it ready right away. - Yes, please.

745
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:17,146
You're really quick.

746
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:18,147
(Looking carefully)

747
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:19,488
The owner...

748
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,616
The owner feels like he's fake.

749
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:23,926
- Right? He's fake. - Right? Doesn't he feel fake?

750
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,627
- Suddenly? - Because...

751
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,257
You said it was real until now, but are you saying...

752
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:30,397
- the owner's fake? - The owner looks fake.

753
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:32,298
But this restaurant is real.

754
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,667
Jae Seok. This isn't how you confuse others as a spy.

755
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,407
(Jae Seok is a spy again.)

756
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:41,277
You shouldn't confuse people like this. You failed.

757
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:42,377
- This is driving me crazy. - That's it.

758
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,576
The food will take about ten minutes,

759
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:45,577
so let's play the game first.

760
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:47,346
- Jae Seok. - Why?

761
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:49,548
- You must be very shy today. - Why?

762
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:51,187
Because you're on the same team as "Charlie's Angels".

763
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:52,717
(Look to your right.)

764
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:53,718
(Laughing)

765
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:56,717
You're right. Well said.

766
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,057
It's been a while since I last heard that.

767
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,187
Why? What's wrong with angels?

768
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:00,826
When else can you ever enjoy this?

769
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:02,396
Wherever you look, there are pretty ladies.

770
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:03,397
You must have nowhere to look.

771
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:05,198
I'm only thinking about kalguksu.

772
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:08,538
I was so shocked at her saying "Charlie's Angels".

773
00:28:09,198 --> 00:28:11,308
The game you'll play to get a hint is...

774
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,636
Picture Relay Story.

775
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:15,376
"Picture Relay Story"?

776
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,478
I guess we have to draw.

777
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:19,577
It's simple and easy. To put it simply...

778
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:22,577
(The game will be a team match.)

779
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,416
- I'll present you a genre. - A genre.

780
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:25,417
For example?

781
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:26,616
Take one each.

782
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:27,617
(The keyword will be chosen from the picture books!)

783
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:30,927
Open a random page, and when a picture is shown,

784
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:34,097
you need to continue the story using that picture.

785
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:35,728
Romantic comedy.

786

798
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,787
- Just one. - This sounds fun.

799

- I like it. - Gosh.

Let's go with horror.

802

- Horror. - Horror. Should I go first?

803

- Sure. - Okay.

804
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:08,797
- Watch how I do it. Horror. - I don't think you can do it.

My son must not know because it's not his money.

1565

It's more than 100,000 dollars?

1566
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,367
It's more than that?

1567
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:31,797
The cost of chili powder alone is around 40 or 50,000 dollars.

1568
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:35,937
Our chili powder is from Cheongsong, North Gyeongsang Province.

1569
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,037
It's the highest quality.

1570
00:56:37,038 --> 00:56:39,708
Our napa cabbage comes from Gangwon Province.

1571

We always have at least five types of over-fermented kimchi.

(It's over 100,000 dollars including the over-fermented kimchi)

1577
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:57,057
I give it out.

1578
00:56:57,058 --> 00:56:59,366
For example, if it's a table of seven,

1579
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:03,367
I choose a variety of kimchi and ensure it's enough for seven people.

1580
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:05,768
And I tell them...

1581
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:09,237
to only take more after they finish eating the first portion.

1582
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:12,378
Because it all goes to waste if they take more beforehand.

1583

I can't let it go to waste.

1584

I won't ever sell it. I just hand it out.

She definitely seems like the maker of the kimchi.

That doesn't seem rehearsed.

2238
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:38,447
We were told earlier...

2239
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:41,347
that the kimchi you use is made by kimchi masters.

2240
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:42,917
Right.

2241
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:46,256
When we use kimchi as an ingredient for pizza,

2242
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:48,926
we thought the most important thing...

2243
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,927
was choosing a kimchi that went well with pizza.

2244
01:20:51,358 --> 01:20:53,228
So we visited kimchi masters around the country,

2245
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:56,496
and we received advice about which kimchi...

2246
01:20:56,497 --> 01:20:59,368
would go well with pizza and learned how to make them.

2247
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:03,067
They said it was refreshing, and it was a flavor...

2248
01:21:03,068 --> 01:21:04,477
that many people liked.

2249
01:21:04,478 --> 01:21:07,808
So we used Seoul-style aged kimchi without the seasoning.

2250
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:11,747
Then we added kimchi juice to our soy sauce bulgogi sauce...

2251
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:14,017
and added more umami to it.

2252
01:21:14,018 --> 01:21:15,347
(The pizza has umami.)

2253
01:21:15,988 --> 01:21:17,916
It sounds real.

2254
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:20,318
I think it's real. I feel like it might exist.

2256
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:27,996
You said you release new pizzas every season.

2257
01:21:27,997 --> 01:21:30,466
- Yes. - What did you release before this?

2258
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:33,136
Before this... The most recent one...

2259
01:21:33,137 --> 01:21:34,938
is the shrimp pizza that was just released the other day.

2260
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:37,877
- I saw that pizza before. - Where?

2261
01:21:37,908 --> 01:21:39,978
There was a poster of it.

2262
01:21:40,177 --> 01:21:42,547
Before that, it was pineapple tteokgalbi pizza.

2263
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:44,177
Pineapple tteokgalbi?

2264
01:21:44,278 --> 01:21:47,188
And before that was the kimchi pizza.

2265
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:51,386
We've been making other pizzas since before then.

2266
01:21:51,387 --> 01:21:53,757
You try new things with pizza.

He seems real.

2269

You can tell he works in R and D

2270
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,296
- He doesn't hesitate. - He doesn't.

2271
01:22:03,297 --> 01:22:05,438
I think he'd be really good at giving presentations.

2272

- He's got no flaws. - Team leaders sure are different.

2273
01:22:07,608 --> 01:22:09,367
- He's definitely in R and D. - I know.

2274
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:10,707
There's no doubt about it.

- I'll treat you guys. - Okay.

2278

Should I order 1 or 2?

2279

- Two? - Just order one.

2280

We can all just have a slice.
