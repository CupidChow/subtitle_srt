She resets every week.

It happens every week, I see.

At first, she went to the hospital and took pills.

- We even changed the mattress. - And the pillows.

We tried a foot bath too.

833

But they weren't very effective.

834

- It was for your wife. - What a beautiful story.

835
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,486
I thought there might be something I can do for her with music.

836
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,557
Through studying and researching, I started composing sleep music.

And you're really cool because for us,

- if our wives have insomnia, - Excuse me, I'm not done talking.

Okay.

- He really is. - Because...

for us, if our wives say that they can't sleep,

- You're so mean. - Run in the afternoon.

- You must feel bad about it. - Not at all.

so that by the time you're done eating, you're ready to sleep.

1585
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,346
Why are you guys fighting?

1586
00:57:35,347 --> 00:57:36,817
Her voice is so hoarse.

1587
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:39,216
I can't stand your voice.

1588
00:57:39,217 --> 00:57:40,217
(Jessi doesn't back down.)

1589
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:42,285
Jae Seok, that's what I think too.

1590
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:43,286
(Jae Lim is still adjusting.)

1591
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:46,387
We're all about to fight each other. Where is the owner?

1592
00:57:46,726 --> 00:57:47,895
You can come this way.

1593
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:49,526
- Hello. - Hello.

1594
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:50,527
- Hello. - Hello.

1595
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,766
(The owner enters shyly.)

1596
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,265
Hello, I am the owner of this sleep restaurant in the city.

1597
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,036
My name is Song Eun.

1598
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:02,736
Our restaurant provides food that is easy to digest...

1599
00:58:02,737 --> 00:58:04,646
and food that helps you go to sleep.

1600
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:08,516
We also provide an area to sleep. This is a rest area within the city.

1601
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:13,186
I was originally a teaching assistant at a university,

1602
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,386
and whenever I wanted some rest during lunch,

1603
00:58:16,387 --> 00:58:19,657
I used the rest area at the school.

1604
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:22,796
But I felt uncomfortable using the area...

1605
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:24,967
because a lot of people used the area together.

1606
00:58:24,996 --> 00:58:28,536
In 2018, healing cafes started to trend,

1607
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:30,136
so I visited one,

1608
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:34,237
but the drawback of the cafe was that you weren't allowed to eat.

1609
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:38,105
I thought it would be nice to have a place where you could...

1610
00:58:38,106 --> 00:58:39,746
eat and rest at the same time.

1611
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:42,947
An opportunity arose, and I started managing this sleep restaurant.

1612
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:47,056
The sleep capsule is what I invested in the most for this restaurant.

1613
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:48,915
For the sleep capsule,

1614
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,586
there is a machine inside that keeps the oxygen concentration...

1615
00:58:51,587 --> 00:58:53,596
above at least 21 percent.

1616
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:56,355
It allows enough oxygen to be supplied to the brain...

1617
00:58:56,356 --> 00:58:57,926
to allow mental and physical comfort,

1618
00:58:57,927 --> 00:59:00,967
and it also helps you regain energy.

1619
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:05,106
Sixth Sensers. Is this place real?

1620
00:59:07,306 --> 00:59:10,136
How long has it been since you started this restaurant?

1621
00:59:10,137 --> 00:59:13,006
I started in 2019, so it's been about three years.

1622
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,677
- It's been a while. - Yes, it has.

1623
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:18,347
There's something that a lot of us have been questioning.

1624
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:21,415
Please understand because we need to raise doubts for this show.

1625
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:22,416
Yes, of course.

1626
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:25,856
The lighting is a bit too bright for a sleep restaurant.

1627
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:31,326
(The bright interior and lights don't match with the restaurant.)

1628
00:59:31,766 --> 00:59:35,296
We received a relief fund due to COVID,

1629
00:59:35,297 --> 00:59:38,506
so before, the color was dark grey,

1630
00:59:38,507 --> 00:59:40,605
but in hopes of the virus coming to an end,

1631
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:42,736
we repainted the place.

1632
00:59:42,737 --> 00:59:44,347
(Remodeled the whole place with the relief fund)

1633
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:48,347
(Did it smell new because it was recently remodeled?)

1634
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:52,317
(Or is it just a lie made up by the production crew?)

1635
00:59:52,786 --> 00:59:55,515
- So we used a bright color. - It's eco-friendly paint.

1636
00:59:55,516 --> 00:59:57,056
(Okay, but apart from that)

1637
00:59:57,157 --> 00:59:59,486
I feel like the colors will make...

1638
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:01,395
men a little reluctant to come here on their own.

1639
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:04,995
You're right, but a lot of our customers are women.

1640
01:00:04,996 --> 01:00:06,026
A lot of women come?

1641
01:00:06,027 --> 01:00:09,496
Our regular customers come from the banks around here.

1642
01:00:11,206 --> 01:00:13,907
(She knows her customers well. Is this sleeping restaurant real?)

1643
01:00:14,337 --> 01:00:17,546
If it costs 12 dollars for an hour, is it okay? Do you make a profit?

1644
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:20,745
When we set the price... It's not 12 dollars.

1645
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:21,875
- It's 10 dollars. - For 30 minutes...

1646
01:00:21,876 --> 01:00:23,217
(It's 10 dollars.)

1647
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:25,015
- It's 10 dollars per hour. - Yes, 10 dollars.

1648
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:26,185
I saw that it was 6 dollars for 30 minutes.

1649
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:28,487
- Look before you speak. - It's just that...

1650
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:30,826
(He was in the wrong.)

1651
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,356
This place is quite detailed.

1652
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:33,956
That's only for using that.

1653
01:00:34,326 --> 01:00:38,967
(Is this clear-cut owner real or fake?)

1654
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:42,367
For me, personally, this place was the most suspicious,

1655
01:00:42,837 --> 01:00:45,907
judging by the panel earlier.

1656
01:00:46,337 --> 01:00:48,306
After I paid for that massage chair.

1657
01:00:48,706 --> 01:00:51,475
(He could be a massage chair promoter.)

1658
01:00:51,476 --> 01:00:53,205
- You mentioned that payment... - This place...

1659
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:54,946
- around 20 times already. - But I think...

1660
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:57,786
(Someone send him a massage chair, please.)

1661
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:00,086
Can you explain the menu for us, please?

1662
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:01,586
Our meal plan...

1663
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:04,426
includes foods that are easy to digest...

1664
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:07,395
and ingredients with nutrients that help promote sleep.

1665
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:09,096
That's the basis of our menu.

1666
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:10,725
(You're curious, right? We'll reveal it later.)

1667
01:01:10,726 --> 01:01:14,066
The most popular dishes are the spinach and mushroom risotto,

1668
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:15,535
the clam pasta,

1669
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:17,867
and the salmon and sea trumpet chazuke.

1670
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:22,475
(Foods that promote sleep that have captivated workers in Yeouido)

1671
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:25,606
(Is it real or fake?)

1672
01:01:25,706 --> 01:01:27,245
In that case, ma'am,

1673
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:29,776
would we be able to sample those menu items?

1674
01:01:29,777 --> 01:01:32,116
- Yes. I'll prepare that for you. - Please do.

1675
01:01:32,117 --> 01:01:33,316
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1676
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:34,317
Thank you!

1677
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:37,426
It takes a while to make the food so we'll play a game first.

1678
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,556
- All right. - Okay.

1679
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:40,427
The games are hard, aren't they?

1680
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:42,855
The game we'll play for this hint is "Don't Laugh Hide and Seek",

1681
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:45,765
and will make use of the sleeping capsules.

1682
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:46,825
- What? - Sorry?

1683

(This game is also played in teams.)

1686
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:56,777
- There are six capsules. - Yes.

1687
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,907
The hiding team could hide in numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6.

1688
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,876
Or they could all hide in number 6.

1689
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:04,415
The seeking team chooses three capsules.

1690
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,546
They choose numbers 1, 3, and 6, say.

1691
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:07,587
But...

1692
01:02:08,186 --> 01:02:10,426
the hiding team will go in with whistles on their lips.

I'll read you another story.

1739
01:03:51,657 --> 01:03:54,455
"I was urinating in a cafe bathroom when I also passed wind."

1740
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,796
"A child must have accompanied their mother into the next cubicle."

(Caught)

1742

"I was busting, so as soon as I sat down,"

1743
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:04,906
"I passed gas and then peed."

1744
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,375
So she passed wind while she was urinating.

1745
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,376
(Think sad thoughts.)

1746
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,646
"The child in the next cubicle said to their mother,"

1747
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,346
"'Mom, there's an elephant next door.'"

1748
01:04:13,347 --> 01:04:15,246
(Mom, there's an elephant next door.)

(We're in trouble.)

We're going to get caught no matter what.

1752
01:04:23,717 --> 01:04:25,185
- Yes, 100 percent! - We'll get caught!

1753
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:27,026
This is so hard!

1754
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:28,426
- Hey! - Let's do another one.

1755
01:04:28,427 --> 01:04:30,196
- This is so much fun. - All right.

1756
01:04:30,197 --> 01:04:32,526
- One more time. - This one is funny too.

1757
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:33,867
- Listen up. - Let's try this.

1758
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:37,665
"Someone got on a full bus so had no choice but to stand."

1759
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,337
"But they were tired, so they said to themselves,"

1760
01:04:39,936 --> 01:04:41,306
"'Gosh, I want to sit down.'"

1761
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:42,606
"'I want to sit down.'"

1762
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:46,106
They were mumbling this to themselves.

1763
01:04:46,777 --> 01:04:48,446
(Please, let me stop smiling.)

1764
01:04:48,447 --> 01:04:50,547
"The bus stopped abruptly."

(She's not crying.)

1770
01:05:03,297 --> 01:05:05,866
This is how it is.

1771
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:06,867
(The practice game attacker is proud.)

1772
01:05:06,868 --> 01:05:09,696
But you know, this is quite easy for me.

1773
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,035
Because I don't understand some of them.

1774
01:05:12,036 --> 01:05:14,136
I didn't get this one.

1775
01:05:14,137 --> 01:05:15,407
I don't understand some of them.

1776
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:17,745
Right. You don't understand them.

1777
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:18,776
You're so...

1778
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:20,776
This game is great for you then.

1779
01:05:20,777 --> 01:05:22,875
- Jessi. Use this to your favor. - It's not funny at all to me.

1780
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:24,286
She's on our team!

1781
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,185
This one wasn't funny to me.

1782
01:05:26,186 --> 01:05:28,086
I'll do just one more for you.

1783
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:29,586
You can't take all the good ones now!

1784
01:05:29,587 --> 01:05:31,055
This is the last one.

1785
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,056
Now...

1786
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:35,496
"A while ago, I was parking my car with my girlfriend."

1787
01:05:35,927 --> 01:05:39,226
He asked her to spot them while he was reversing the car.

1788
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:42,666
The girlfriend said, "You haven't hit it yet."

1789
01:05:43,097 --> 01:05:45,306
"There's still space."

1790
01:05:46,036 --> 01:05:48,536
"Not yet. You just hit it."

1791
01:05:51,306 --> 01:05:52,475
"You just hit it."

1792
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:55,177
(She was proving live commentary for the fender bender.)

(Struggling to breathe)

(The reader is satisfied.)

1795
01:06:01,686 --> 01:06:05,055
There was a story like this about one of our senior comedians.

1796
01:06:05,056 --> 01:06:07,756
"Okay! Reverse back."

1797
01:06:07,757 --> 01:06:09,256
They were saying, "Okay."

1798
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,226
There was a slam. "Stop."

1799
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:14,435
- It happened. - It was a true story.

1800
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:15,467
This one was funny.

1801
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:17,195
Let's decide which team hides and which seeks.

1802
01:06:17,196 --> 01:06:18,866
We'll decide and then play the game.

1803
01:06:19,107 --> 01:06:20,436
- How should we decide? - These are funny.

1804
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:21,607
We also have to choose...

1805
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:24,306
which capsule and how many in each capsule.

1806
01:06:24,307 --> 01:06:25,976
- We have to decide that too. - Then we might...

1807
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:27,415
end up leaving...

1808
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,615
Hey. This one is short and incredibly funny.

1809
01:06:29,616 --> 01:06:31,846
- Stop it! - You can't read them all here!

1810
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:33,586
- You can't read them all! - Stop reading them!

1811
01:06:33,587 --> 01:06:34,856
Why are you still reading them?

1812
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,356
- Stop reading them. - We'll use it when we attack.

1813
01:06:36,357 --> 01:06:38,226
- Just listen to this last one. - Stop it.

1814
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,886
- You're wasting them. - Listen to this.

1815
01:06:39,887 --> 01:06:41,426
- See here. - Hey!

1816
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:44,025
We should listen with our eyes shut. That's how we'll know.

1817
01:06:44,026 --> 01:06:46,065
- Eyes shut, everyone. - This is a simulation.

1818
01:06:46,066 --> 01:06:47,797
- The last one. - I'd prefer to watch.

1819

"I called my younger brother."

1820

"He answered in a whisper,"

1821

I can't do this.

the 600,000 dollar bed today.

2456
01:29:59,887 --> 01:30:03,796
This company is known as Swedish royal family's bed.

2457
01:30:03,797 --> 01:30:06,927
At first, this family made the saddle.

2458
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:09,937
It was 1st established in 1852.

2459
01:30:10,036 --> 01:30:13,806
At the time, the company that made saddles...

2460
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:17,506
also made mattresses.

2461
01:30:17,507 --> 01:30:18,846
Over time,

2462
01:30:18,847 --> 01:30:21,647
as fewer people ride horses,

2463
01:30:22,147 --> 01:30:26,286
they improved their mattress technique...

2464
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:28,716
and started producing...

2465
01:30:28,717 --> 01:30:30,115
comfortable and durable beds.

2466
01:30:30,116 --> 01:30:33,256
This bed was created after collaborating with...

2467
01:30:33,257 --> 01:30:35,655
the world-famous building designer, Ferris Rafauli.

2468
01:30:35,656 --> 01:30:38,125
Only six experienced masters...

2469
01:30:38,126 --> 01:30:41,266
can participate in the bed production.

2470
01:30:41,267 --> 01:30:44,995
It takes six months for production.

2471
01:30:44,996 --> 01:30:48,405
Only six beds are produced in a year.

2472
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:51,807
Sixth Sensers. Is this place real?

2473
01:30:52,876 --> 01:30:54,776
Nice to meet you.

2474
01:30:55,177 --> 01:30:57,915
I'll be straightforward.

2475
01:30:57,916 --> 01:31:00,586
Can you tell me why this is 650,000 dollars?

2476
01:31:00,587 --> 01:31:02,556
Do they really produce only six in a year?

2477
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,856
- Is it six in the whole world? - Correct.

2478
01:31:04,857 --> 01:31:07,455
We have a unique spring technique.

2479
01:31:07,456 --> 01:31:11,056
The masters place each spring...

2480
01:31:11,057 --> 01:31:12,466
by hand.

2481
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,666
It's 100 percent handmade.

2482
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:18,266
(650,000 dollars because it's all handmade?)

2483
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:21,735
I get that only six beds are produced in a year...

2484
01:31:21,736 --> 01:31:25,075
- by masters. - That's amazing.

2485
01:31:25,076 --> 01:31:27,375
Is there anything unique about it?

2486
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:28,575
This bed...

2487
01:31:28,576 --> 01:31:31,216

(I see.)

2489
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:36,116
The signature material is the horsehair.

(I was right?)

2491

He mentioned it before.

2492
01:31:40,057 --> 01:31:42,495
Yes. Wool, cotton...

2493
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:45,565
and flax.

2494
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:48,426
Wool is flexible.

2495
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:50,296
It keeps you cool in summer...

2496
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:52,966
and warm in winter.

2497
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:55,436
The flax prevents...

2498
01:31:55,437 --> 01:31:57,406
static from the springs.

2499
01:31:58,036 --> 01:32:01,646
The horsehair has outstanding permeability.

2500
01:32:01,647 --> 01:32:04,745
It can absorb and release...

2501
01:32:04,746 --> 01:32:07,886
sweats produced while sleeping.

2502
01:32:07,887 --> 01:32:08,916
Really?

2503
01:32:09,717 --> 01:32:12,726
Since it only consists of natural materials,

2504
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:15,025
it was set...

2505
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,557
at a high price.

2506
01:32:17,956 --> 01:32:19,426
(That makes sense.)

2507
01:32:19,427 --> 01:32:21,966
I thought it was decorated with gold...

2508
01:32:21,967 --> 01:32:23,695
- or something. - Or has a diamond.

2509
01:32:23,696 --> 01:32:26,035
I thought that's why it costs 650,000 dollars. Isn't that it?

2510
01:32:26,036 --> 01:32:27,036
No.

2511
01:32:27,037 --> 01:32:29,075
When I saw the handles,

2512
01:32:29,076 --> 01:32:32,246
I thought you had a technique to fold it in half...

2513
01:32:32,576 --> 01:32:34,147
- and carry it. - That's a good idea.

2514
01:32:34,307 --> 01:32:35,716
I tried to open it.

2515
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,346
- That's so old. - I thought it opens.

2516
01:32:37,347 --> 01:32:38,745
- With wheels. - This isn't a folder.

2517
01:32:38,746 --> 01:32:40,115
I thought it looked like a suitcase.

2518

- I thought it comes out. - Me too.

2519
01:32:42,387 --> 01:32:44,615
So you can take it with you on your trip.
