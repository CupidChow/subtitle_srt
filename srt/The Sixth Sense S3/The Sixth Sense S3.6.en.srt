- That's right. - They gain a lot of experience,

They recognize who feeds them,

They don't cost as much as 100,000 dollars.

The normal original species range from few dozens to thousand dollars.

They're innately born with colour mutation.

Those ones get extra an zero behind their price.

To make a profit, we need to have a lot of platinum fishes.

688
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:10,244
They are born with very low probabilities...

689

like 1 out of 10,000 or 1,000,000.

(Platinum refers to mutated ornamental fishes that are white.)

Because they're shiny, white, and pretty,

a lot of people seek them,

693

(It's worth investing.)

701

Normal tropical fish don't mutate when they're born.

702

But prehistoric fish has a lot more mutations.

703
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:46,346
They give birth to 360,000 eggs at once.

(Countless fishes are born from the eggs.)

If you're unlucky, you can get 1 or 2 platinum fish.

If you're lucky, you can get up to 50 fish at once.

So flawless.

1288
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:27,645
Actually for me...

1289
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:30,915
I need to promote it while I'm on the show.

1290

As I studied the mushrooms...

1305
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:04,686
I saw on the news that...

1306
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:07,885
there are people who try poisonous mushrooms without knowing them.

1307
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,485
- Yes, they get hurt real bad. - Yes, there are so many of them.

1308
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,555
So as a person cultivating them...

1309
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,195
I thought of making awareness...

1310
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:17,865
so I make the specimens and supply them to schools and such.

1311
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:19,295
And I also do Youtube.

1312

- Ask away. - You can ask the question.

1328
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:54,865
You sound so polite.

1329
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:57,065
Mushrooms are actually fungi...

1330
00:48:57,206 --> 00:48:59,805
so if you just cover it well...

1331
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:02,075
and if you keep the heat well...

1332

they spread so well.

1333
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:07,175
So my friends told me I should sell them since there were so many.

1334
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:08,714
And that's why I think I started this.

1335

2069
01:16:35,356 --> 01:16:38,095
They're from Kaws.

2070
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:39,295
- Kaws? - Yes.

2071
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,135
Who made that?

2072
01:16:41,136 --> 01:16:42,795
The artist's name is Kaws.

2073

(The artist's name is Kaws.)

2074
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:50,205
Mi Joo. The artist's name is Kaws.

2075
01:16:50,846 --> 01:16:53,545
The character is called BFF.

2076
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:57,516
When it came out, it was raffled for 20,000.

2077
01:16:58,085 --> 01:16:59,745
- I see. - So it was a lucky draw.

2078
01:16:59,946 --> 01:17:01,754
- It's like a game of chance. - Right.

(To the elderly, a raffle is like a game of chance.)

2080

So it went up that much?

2081
01:17:05,226 --> 01:17:07,395
- Right. - Of course that would go up.

2082
01:17:07,396 --> 01:17:08,824
It went up to 100,000 dollars?

That toy from Kaws...

is a limited edition with only 150 of them.

Limited.

Yes. There are only 150 of them in the world.

Jae Seok, buy that one!

2097
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:40,454
- Which one? - The most expensive one.

2098
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,925
Why would I get that?

2099
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:44,124
(It's fun to see in person.)

2100

Your daughter would love it.

- Na Eun doesn't like that. - No.

2102
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:50,606
She likes "Miniforce".

2103
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:52,335
Miniforce

2104
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:53,565
How cute.

2105
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:54,636
(Na Eun's so cute.)

2106
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,174
Na Eun likes "Miniforce".

2107

(Yu Na Eun, the 5-year-old, knows what she likes.)

2108
01:17:57,245 --> 01:18:00,545
Is there a toy here that you would like to introduce to us?

2109
01:18:01,545 --> 01:18:05,245
The works behind us are from a Japanese artist named Hanai Yusuke.

2110
01:18:05,816 --> 01:18:09,815
I intuitively thought it was pretty, and I liked the vibe it had.

2111
01:18:09,816 --> 01:18:12,454
Even up until two years ago,

2112
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:14,896
I would recommend it to my friends, but none of them bought his work.

2113
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,795
At the time I purchased this one for about 12,000 dollars.

2114
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:20,765
That's how much I paid for it.

2115
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:22,164
how much would 12,000 dollars be in Korean won?

2116
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,406
- About 15 million won. - It's about 13 to 15 million won.

2117
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:26,065
Right.

2118
01:18:26,066 --> 01:18:27,575
It was expensive back then too.

2119
01:18:28,505 --> 01:18:32,574
It's because this was a limited edition with only 15.

2120
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:34,345
- This was a limited edition too? - Yes.

2121
01:18:34,346 --> 01:18:35,975
Since you're a collector,

2122
01:18:35,976 --> 01:18:38,015
you only care about the limited editions.

2123
01:18:38,016 --> 01:18:40,655
There's a small version too.

2124
01:18:40,656 --> 01:18:42,114
- If you look over there. - Right.

2125
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:44,124
It's the same design, but there are 15 of these...

2126
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:45,825
and 250 of those.

2127
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,055
They sold the smaller ones...

2128
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:51,294
for about 1,000 to 1,200 dollars.

2129
01:18:51,295 --> 01:18:54,695
In an auction in Japan last month,

2130
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,436
it was auctioned off for 900,000 yen.

2131
01:18:56,495 --> 01:18:59,664
- For 900,000 yen? That's... - Right.

2132
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:01,335
It's about 10,000 dollars.

2133
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:03,905
So I purchased it for 1,000 dollars,

2134
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,074
- but if I were to sell it... - That's about nine times its price.

2135
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,945
That's how much the smaller one was auctioned off for,

2136
01:19:07,946 --> 01:19:10,486
so I figured that the bigger one is even more expensive.

2137
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,185
That's the assumption you can make.

2138
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:13,585
It's eight times its original price.

2139
01:19:14,156 --> 01:19:15,815
It really can be an investment.

2140
01:19:15,816 --> 01:19:17,955
(It's 8 times its original price. Is art toy investing real?)

2141
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:20,386
- Isn't it impeccable? - It is.

2142
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:25,964
- He doesn't even hesitate. - Right.

2143
01:19:25,965 --> 01:19:27,736
(He answers without hesitation, so they're confused.)

2144
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:31,364
Don't you feel anxious about keeping all of them...

2145
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:32,464
in one place like this?

2146
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:34,636
That's why I hired a security company.

2147
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:37,906
What is this place? Is it an exhibit?

2148
01:19:38,245 --> 01:19:41,445
It's a place people can come to see the toys.

2149
01:19:41,446 --> 01:19:44,285
I wanted people to come and enjoy it.

2150
01:19:44,486 --> 01:19:47,045
- What if someone steals it? - What if they steal it?

2151
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:50,316
- I could fit one in here. - A small one.

- It does. - I see.

2155

isn't it the second one?

I think the second one is the most likely.

The mushrooms were exhibited,

2177

If our crew were to set something up,

they wouldn't just add some mushrooms to someone's home.
