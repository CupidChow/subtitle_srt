Sang Yeob, how can you zoom in on the monitor?

639

- But... - Sang Yeob.

644
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:18,105
When I look at this, it looks like she really is a trader.

645
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,635
Really? Why?

646
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:20,975
Because the room...

647
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,543
doesn't look fake.

648
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:24,544
(The coin trading is ongoing on the monitor.)

649
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,013
She has a lot of these.

650
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,944
- Energy drinks. - Because...

651
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:31,944
- coin trading happens 24 hours. - It happens 24 hours.

652
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,215
So I heard a lot of people do it without sleeping.

- This is her villa. - It's like...

661
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,573
she bought the place beside a golf course...

662
00:23:58,574 --> 00:23:59,914
so she can go back and forth.

663

People do this a lot recently.

664
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:04,083

One of them will be aired.

673
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:27,405
I'll say it six more times.

674

(It got aired just as you said.)

675
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,604
- Did she say the same thing? - This is the fourth time.

676
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:33,715
That's why I can understand why this traveling bag is here.

677
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,914
Are you saying this is real or fake?

678

- I think it's real. - But...

679
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,854
But she doesn't live here every day.

680
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,283
- But CEO Song, - She doesn't live here.

681

I'm saying these look fake.

- Me too. - They purposely put shabby clothes.

683

They're set up to show...

684

that she lives here.

685
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,394
Do you understand? Did you hear what I said?

686
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:54,635
(We don't know.)

Guys, Chan Young is going to share his thought.

Look, Chan Young is speaking.

690
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:01,875
What is it, Chan Young?

691
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,043
(He's very pressured.)

692
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,644
Maybe she cleaned up the things...

693
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:09,884
that were already here...

694
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,115

Hello. I've been working as a coin trader for four years.

I'm Ba Da, 25 years old.

I started my 1st investment in early 2018.

720
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,553
A university friend of mine...

721
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:23,322
earned quite a lot from doing coins.

722
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:26,723
I decided to earn money that way too...

723
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:28,393
and started my investment.

724
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:32,433
I started with a small amount which is 300 dollars,

725
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,433
and I lost all 300 dollars.

726
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:39,633
I got scared and studied a lot.

727
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,973
About the end of 2018,

728
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,803
I invested 3,000 dollars.

729
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:47,113
And it became 100,000 dollars.

(Now she made 30 million dollars.)

Thankfully, I kept earning money...

732
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,813
and bought one bag after another.

733
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:56,822
I posted stuff on my Instagram too.

My friends found out,

737

How did you start investing?

744

That was around 2017,

746
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:32,723
and he started coin investment that time.

747
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:33,793
- He's a close friend of mine. - I see.

748
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:38,323
And he earned quite a lot.

749
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:42,503
At the end of 2018, I got 3,000 dollars...

750
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:43,563
and invested again.

751

Look. When she talks, everyone becomes quiet.

that I bought the coin when it was the cheapest...

768

and sold it when it was the most expensive.

What she's saying is right.

771

From four years ago, the coin became really expensive.

772
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,494
As I listen to her, I should be thinking, "Is she real?"

773
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,524
But I keep thinking, "What was I doing back then?"

For stocks, the market opens at a specific time.

But for coins, it's opened 24 hours.

(You can make or lose money beyond your imagination.)

798

Did you make a profit just from the coin,

799
00:29:45,224 --> 00:29:46,724
or did you do any other investment?

800

(The secret to the high profit of the coin trader in her 20s)

802
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,963
The reason I was able to make a big profit...

803
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:55,133
is by using leverage.

804
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:58,803
At first, you can't take too much leverage.

805
00:29:58,804 --> 00:30:00,932
- That's right. - When I did it last time,

806
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,543
I could take leverage up to 100 times.

807
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:05,943
So if I have 100 dollars,

808
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:08,873
I could take leverage up to 10,000 dollars.

809
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:11,183
If I make a 10 percent profit,

810
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,954
it's 10 percent of 10,000, so I make 1,000 dollars profit.

00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:17,922
(With the principal of 100 dollars, you can make 1,000 dollars...)

814
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,122
and 1,000,000 dollars became a few 10 million dollars.

815
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:27,332
In the end, I could make 30 million dollars.

819
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:37,303
does show that she did study economics.

820
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:38,743
- Terms like leverage and so on. - Right.

821
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:41,672
She throws in the jargon here and there.

822
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,413
But did she study this suddenly?

823
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:45,852
Or does she know the terms...

824
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:46,953
- because she actually invests? - Exactly.

825
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,053
To find out if she studied this suddenly or not,

826
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:52,224
one of us must be an expert to ask her the right questions.

How do you control the risk now?

833
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,303
A lot of people think I became rich overnight,

834
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,103
but that's not the case.

835
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,443
I'm totally against investing in a coin...

without knowing anything about it.

The coins are not the same.

838

There are good and bad coins.

839
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:25,622
So I'm still studying a lot...

840
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:27,823
about which coins are good.

841
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,162
If you look at my room, I have a lot of books...

842
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,663
and also four monitors.

Four monitors are quite a lot.

851

As you saw just now,

852
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:52,882
one is for overseas exchange...

853
00:31:52,883 --> 00:31:55,413
and one is for Korean exchange.

854
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,723
And another one is for Telegram and such,

855

where you can get a lot of information.

856

For stocks, it takes about 30 minutes...

to few hours for news or information...

858

to be reflected in the market.

859
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,363
But for coins, it's reflected in the market...

860
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:13,074
in ten minutes, which is very fast.

861
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:15,133

all the alarms...

863

and constantly check my phone.

00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:20,742
- You had it on just now. - Yes. There's a lot of information,

You normally can't remember which floor it was on.

The stock market has a fixed time,

898

but the coin market is open 24 hours.

I feel anxious to even use the restroom.

902

When I'm sleeping, I have an alarm set up to go off...

if the price drops under a certain amount.

904
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:55,004
The alarm would go off constantly in the middle of the night,

905
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:57,242
so I have a habit of checking my phone...

906

even when I hear a faint noise.

907

I don't think I've ever slept well after I started trading.

There is a room that is locked...

915

- We didn't go in. - Do you know about it?

Are you talking about the room that was off limits?

917
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:30,202
The reason I moved here was because...

918
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:33,973
I wanted to fill up a whole room with items that I bought.

919
00:34:34,143 --> 00:34:37,512
So I started buying designer bags.

My gosh.

Does anyone become your boss if they're rich?

I can even call you my older sister.

I already consider her my older sister in my heart.

Yes, because I wanted to.

Is it possible for the production crew to have created this...

Just like "Young Hee" and "Young Sook" sound similar.

We try to exclude those notions in the dishes we serve.

Excuse me, I have another question.

- So you made a dish with ants. - Yes.

1475

Did you make the dish...

1476
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:19,162
because you tried ants elsewhere and they tasted good?

1477

Yes, of course. When I worked in Scandinavia.

they try too hard to show themselves being affectionate.

1522

- Like at the French restaurant. - That's right.

1523
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:00,762
They were a fake couple.

1524

They were trying too hard to be affectionate.

1525

These two are not like that at all.

1526
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:06,564
Don't get offended, but to put it simply, they're apathetic.

1527
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:09,472
That sense of loathing I told you about earlier.

1528

- It's there! - That odd feeling of indifference.

1529
00:56:11,473 --> 00:56:13,302
We only found out they were married because we asked.

1530

- We thought she was an interpreter. - That's right.

1531

That's why I'm saying, we can tell...

that they are a married couple.

1533

Then can you answer at the same time,

1534
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:24,883
whether you live in an apartment, house, or villa?

Can you introduce the dishes we will be eating today?

1553
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:07,634
The first dish is a fermented soybean donut.

- Fermented soybean donut? - Yes, a fermented soybean donut.

There's such thing as a fermented soybean donut?

1556

- It must be savory. - Really?

Are you showing us how it's made here?

You're doing it yourself here?

They're actually donuts.

And then we let it dry.

For us, we want it completely dry so we can make the powder.

vinegar, a little bit of sugar,

1586

What is that on top?

1588
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:35,314
It's kind of like an anchovy dalgona.

The first course is a fermented soybean donut.

Do we get a whole block of fermented soybean each?

1595
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:56,202

Yes. Eat it in one bite.

- I want to try the anchovy crisp. - Sure.

1614
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:39,782
- So these are made with anchovies? - Yes, anchovies.

1615
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:41,413
It's an anchovy crisp.

And the sticky rice donut really amplifies the flavor.

I've never tasted anything like it, but it's so delicious.

She's not one to keep her honest feelings to herself.

(A dish plated in the shape of a gat)

This dish is silky chicken.

Also in with the silky chicken is pinecone.

1670

The base sauce is made with makgeolli.

We made the sauce with makgeolli from a brewery.

1673
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,383
So if you look at, say, France with their coq au vin,

1674
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:57,353
it's a chicken and red wine.

I was thinking about Korean chicken, and mixing it with...

the Korean alcohol that we have here.

1677
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:05,622
I think just with the creaminess,

1678
01:02:05,623 --> 01:02:09,032
it has that feeling of when you're eating samgyetang.

Also, it's just a little bit creamy...

at the bottom and a little bit viscous.

1681
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:15,302
So that's why I chose that combination.

not just for the color, but it has a very good salty flavor.

why would they say the membership fee is 330,000 dollars?

2205
01:20:11,944 --> 01:20:14,882
They could've just said it was 100,000 dollars.

2206
01:20:14,883 --> 01:20:16,882
- That might sound too small. - Right.

2207
01:20:16,883 --> 01:20:18,154
- So they said 330,000? - Yes.

2208
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,922
Is it the price including ten percent tax?

2209
01:20:19,923 --> 01:20:21,953
(Is there a 10 percent tax to the 300,000 dollars?)

2210
01:20:21,954 --> 01:20:24,352
Maybe they made everything 3 since the 1st episode airs in March.

2211
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:26,093
- Is it tax? - You're a genius.

2212
01:20:26,664 --> 01:20:28,393
- You're right. - Is that why it's 330,000 dollars?

2213
01:20:28,463 --> 01:20:29,963
That makes sense.

2214
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:32,904
I think they would've laughed while they made it up.

2215
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:37,274
But as a whole,

2216
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,744
it's all about who you know.

2217
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:41,943
- This field. - Right.

2218
01:20:41,944 --> 01:20:44,013
- It's all about who you know. - Right.

2219
01:20:44,314 --> 01:20:45,914
The space doesn't matter?

2220
01:20:45,944 --> 01:20:46,944
Right.

2221
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:48,983
I thought that it could be fake...

2222
01:20:48,984 --> 01:20:50,784
because of this space,

2223
01:20:50,954 --> 01:20:53,683
but then I had the thought that this might not be important.

2224
01:20:54,124 --> 01:20:55,454
I really have no idea.

2225
01:20:55,654 --> 01:20:57,222
I think we need to hear from them.

2226
01:20:57,223 --> 01:20:59,163
- Looking at it like this... - I agree.

2227
01:20:59,164 --> 01:21:01,293
- Should we bring in the CEO? - Yes.

2228
01:21:02,133 --> 01:21:04,163
- Hello. - Hello.

01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:20,583
Hello. I arrange noblesse marriages...

2234

for the top 1 percent of Korea.

2235
01:21:22,383 --> 01:21:25,284
I'm the CEO of a marriage agency.

2236
01:21:25,853 --> 01:21:28,423
I started in 2004,

2237
01:21:28,793 --> 01:21:31,593
and I have over 20,000 members.

2238
01:21:32,494 --> 01:21:35,694
You can sign up after you've been vetted by our internal legal team.

2239
01:21:36,534 --> 01:21:40,234
The membership fee differs according to matching difficulty.

2240
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:44,002
Your membership class goes up according to how specific you are...

2241
01:21:44,003 --> 01:21:45,033
about what you want...

2242
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:47,303
in terms of profession, education, appearance, and financials.

2243
01:21:48,173 --> 01:21:50,744
Our rankings start with Emerald, which costs 4,000 dollars...

2244
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:53,114
and are handled by our regular managers.

2245
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:58,213
We also have Sapphire, Ruby, Diamond, and Secret.

2246
01:21:58,753 --> 01:22:02,494
The Royal Club members, whom I handle 1-on-1,

2247
01:22:03,093 --> 01:22:05,563
are made up of the children of political and business figures...

2248
01:22:05,564 --> 01:22:07,494
with over 100 million dollars in assets.

2249
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:10,863
The membership fee is 330,000 dollars.

(The membership fee for Royal Club is 330,000 dollars.)

2251
01:22:12,204 --> 01:22:14,364
In order to provide a comfortable meeting...

2252
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:17,274
for the small number of Royal Club members,

2253
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,342
we started this project.

2254

(They even have a special program.)

2255
01:22:20,673 --> 01:22:23,914
Sixth Sensers. Is this place real?

You look like real CEO.

2260
01:22:38,393 --> 01:22:39,792
Upon meeting you,

2261
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,722
it looks like you decorated the interior to your liking.

2262
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,293
This is my personal preference.

2263
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,033
- After meeting you in person... - Really?

2264
01:22:46,034 --> 01:22:47,462
- After meeting her... - This place suits you.

2265
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:48,632
- It does. - Right.

2266
01:22:48,633 --> 01:22:50,632
- I heard gold brings in... - Right.

2267
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,074
- a lot of money. - Right.

2268
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,873
(Is this place filled with the CEO's favorite color, gold, real?)

2269
01:22:54,874 --> 01:22:57,943
- Is that room for consultations? - Yes, it is.

2270
01:22:57,944 --> 01:23:01,012
What we'd like to ask you...

2271
01:23:01,013 --> 01:23:03,553
is if the membership fee...

2272
01:23:03,954 --> 01:23:05,954
of 330,000 dollars real?

2273
01:23:06,784 --> 01:23:08,324
Yes, of course it is.

2274
01:23:08,954 --> 01:23:11,124
(It's that expensive?)

2275
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:12,823
Not all of your members pay that much. Right?

2276
01:23:12,824 --> 01:23:15,063
- Of course not. - There are different levels?

2277
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:18,493
Yes. We have a variety of programs.

2278
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:22,972
That one is the Royal Club which is handled by me.

2279
01:23:22,973 --> 01:23:24,833
(The Royal Club, handled by the CEO, is 330,000 dollars.)

2280
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,043
What kind of people sign up for that?

2281
01:23:27,543 --> 01:23:29,813
The members of Royal Club...

2282
01:23:29,814 --> 01:23:33,512
are usually in the top 500 rankings in the financial world.

2283
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:34,843
(This is a relatively strong reaction for him.)

(Oh Na Ra's level of surprise is a 5.)

2285
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,954
We're curious as to why it's 330,000 dollars.

In order to ensure they meet in comfortable surroundings,

It's called the docking project.

- Docking? - Yes.

2289
01:23:46,893 --> 01:23:50,833
In short, it's a made-up coincidence.

(In short, it's a made-up coincidence.)

2291

A made-up coincidence.

2292
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:58,703
Parents nowadays want their children to meet their destiny.

2293
01:23:58,704 --> 01:23:59,843
Do you get it?

2294
01:24:00,143 --> 01:24:02,273
The parents make a request.

2295
01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:04,012
- Their children don't know. - Their children don't know.

- They don't know. - Their children don't know.

They meet...

2298
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,113
through a made-up coincidence.

(It was done by their parents.)

2306
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:32,073
That'd cost a lot.

2307
01:24:32,074 --> 01:24:34,773
- To do that. - You have to get the venue.

2308
01:24:34,774 --> 01:24:36,273
Because you have to get a lot of things prepared.

2309
01:24:36,274 --> 01:24:38,443
That's a reality show.

2310
01:24:38,444 --> 01:24:39,444
Yes.

2311
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:41,882
Do their children have no idea?

2312
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:45,413
Of course. They still think they were meant to be.

- Like a movie. - It's like a movie.

(Does this place create a love story like a movie?)

(Or is this made up by the production crew?)

2317
01:24:55,793 --> 01:24:58,462
But what if...

2318
01:24:58,463 --> 01:24:59,763
they don't fall for each other?

2319
01:24:59,864 --> 01:25:01,932
Then we'll have to find someone else.

2320
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:03,472
It's not over at once.

2321
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:06,143
- Is it limited? - For three years.

2322
01:25:06,244 --> 01:25:07,573
- Three years? - For three years.

2323
01:25:07,574 --> 01:25:10,043
- It's 330,000 dollars for 3 years? - You take care of them for 3 years?

2324
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:12,583
And you can meet as many partners as you want...

2325
01:25:12,584 --> 01:25:14,444
within that period.

2326
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:18,414
If you don't mind me asking, do a lot of people join?

2327

Not a lot. There's less than ten people in the royal club.

Most people in the royal club get married in the end.

Good job.

It's the real top secret.

I kept getting a call from a famous matchmaker in Banpo.

01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,252
- That's not really surprising. - If we get into details.

01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:32,423
- If she's done for a long time. - It's not that surprising.

2388
01:27:34,024 --> 01:27:38,092
Now that we met her, it sounds real.

2389
01:27:38,093 --> 01:27:40,963
I'm surprised that she knows Mr. Cha.

2390

I thought she was fake until now.

He was born in 1997. He's 26.

He's younger than me.

He went to a prestigious school in the US.

He started a start-up business in the US.

Does Mi Joo have to reveal her income since he revealed his?

She doesn't have to.

Mi Joo's doing well lately.

She gets paid more than that for one commercial.

She's young and rich these days.

But this member has a bright future ahead of him.

He could make a few million dollars easily.
