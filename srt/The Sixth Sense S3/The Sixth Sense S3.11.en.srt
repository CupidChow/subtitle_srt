It feels awkward to be with this many people.

We're all disciplined now.

The dish made of cod.

I've never tried Mediterranean cuisine. I'm curious.

No one here knows about Portuguese cuisine,

so no one can recognize even if they cook just anything.

No, it can be real.

Then am I not filming?

646
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:55,988
- So... - Am I doing something else?

647
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:00,627
But if I were to be suspicious,

648
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,227
it's very rare to find Portuguese restaurants in Korea.

649
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,797
There are not many restaurants in Korea.

650
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:09,968
If this really were a Portuguese restaurant,

651
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,208
wouldn't they have designed it differently?

652
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:15,507
I'm saying this place looks too vintage.

653
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,947
- Because it looks too vintage? - Yes.

654
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:19,877
Those flowers above...

655
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,717
and the photo frames were set up in a rush for the set.

656
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:24,817
(I see...)

657
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:26,717
Sa Yeon, you're talking too much.

658
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,688
(Stop now.)

659
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:31,526
(Jae Seok's funny.)

660
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:33,627
You look like you're rushing because they think you're a spy.

661
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,626
She's nervous.

662
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:37,627
(Sa Yeon is nervous.)

663
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:38,937
Okay.

664
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:40,268
(Is Sa Yeon the spy who is becoming nervous?)

665
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:44,168
Let's look up what the name of the restaurant means in Portuguese.

666
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:47,036
Sa Yeon, we can't use our phones here.

667
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,908
We can't? I see.

668
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:51,807
She wanted to look up the name of this place.

669
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:53,718
(If that's the case, just look up for the answer.)

670
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,688
- You can't do that. - You can't.

671
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,586
I can't? I don't really know the rules.

672
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,587
(Is this another mistake made by the spy who's anxious?)

673
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:01,556
- Let's invite the owner. - Let's invite the owner.

674
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:02,728
(Let's invite the owner now.)

675
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:04,387
Sir.

676
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:06,826
He's really handsome.

677
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:09,228
- Where? - He's young.

678
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:11,697
- Really? - Really?

679
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:12,698
(A sudden good news)

680
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:13,898
He's coming out from there.

681
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:16,737
(He parts the white curtain and appears shyly.)

682
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:17,768
Hello.

683
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:21,077
(Nudging)

684
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,407
- Hello. - Hello.

685
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:23,408
(He's handsome.)

686
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:25,647
- Mi Joo, what's wrong with you? - Gosh, hello.

687
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:26,648
(They're excited at the appearance of a handsome man.)

688
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,286
- Mi Joo. - Sir, gosh.

689
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:30,387
Hello.

690
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:31,717
Jeon So Min.

691
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:33,357
You look a bit like Son Heung Min.

692
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,917
- Hello. - Hello.

693
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:35,928
(Who is he that appeared shyly?)

694
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,826
(Placed in the corner of Western Europe, )

695
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:43,198
(it is a place with colourful charms.)

696
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,837
(It's the home country of various soccer stars.)

697
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:52,077
(It's the rising country of gourmet, Portugal.)

698
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:54,036
(There's a restaurant that replicates...)

699
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:55,908
(the taste of a local Portuguese restaurant?)

700
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:58,747
Hello. The first Portuguese restaurant...

701
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,577
that landed in Korea.

702
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:03,918
I'm Sung Eun, 30 years old, the manager of this restaurant.

703
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:08,117
The local restaurant located in Porto,

704
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,287
a port city in the north of Portugal,

705
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:13,326
is a famous local restaurant with the history of 150 years...

706
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:16,127
which has been opened since the 1800s.

707
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:20,238
Soccer players Ronaldo, Beckham,

708
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,366
and a lot of other celebrities visited the restaurant.

709
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,837
(Countless celebrities including Ronaldo and Beckham visited.)

710
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:29,277
(It got on The Michelin Guide continuously as well.)

711
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,806
The owner of this place worked in the local restaurant...

712
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,877
for about five years.

713
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:37,347
The owner wanted to promote the cuisine in Korea too,

714
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:39,586
so with the local owner's permission,

715
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:41,718
without paying a lot for opening a franchise,

716
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,187
the owner used the name and the recipe...

717
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,458
of the local restaurant...

718
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,857
and opened this restaurant in Korea.

719
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:51,398
Because my owner worked for a long time in Portugal,

720
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,668
he knows where to get the supplies.

721
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:56,968
So we buy our ingredients from import traders.

722
00:25:57,768 --> 00:26:00,938
Our restaurant has three signature menus.

723
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:03,077
The first is Arroz de Polvo.

724
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:05,918
It's like spicy octopus rice.

725
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,687
Next is the Portuguese version of the French dish croque Monsieur,

726
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:11,417
which is well known as an intestines-destroying burger.

727
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:13,117
It's francesinha.

728
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:17,458
And made with ingredients that cannot be found easily...

729
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:19,958
in Korea and are specially imported from Portugal,

730
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:23,398
there is Portuguese cold noodles,

731
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,998
the signature menu of the restaurant.

732
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:28,767
Because we reproduced...

733
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:30,438
Mediterranean-style Portuguese dishes exactly,

734
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:34,438
a lot of our regular customers are Portuguese.

735
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,846
There are a lot of customers who come to our restaurant...

736
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,847
to taste Portuguese cuisine that they had while travelling.

737
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:44,148
Sixth Sense. Is this place real?

738
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,688
- Hello. - Please introduce yourself.

739
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,458
(She can't stop smiling.)

740
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:56,627
Hello. I'm Sung Eun, the manager of this restaurant.

741
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:59,768
- You're the manager. - You're the manager.

742
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,806
I thought a mother bird came to a nest...

743
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,807
to feed her baby birds.

744
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,248
Their necks were twisted so much.

745
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:14,478
(Like baby birds looking at their mother bird)

746
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:16,517
Your necks are getting twisted.

747
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:17,787
(They're happy even if their necks get twisted.)

748
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:19,287
He's really handsome.

749
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:23,286
(Is he really the manager of the 1st local Portuguese restaurant..)

750
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:24,857
(in Korea?)

751
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:28,498
Is there no Portuguese restaurant in Seoul?

752
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:31,198
Why is there none? There ought to be one.

753
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,268
Isn't there Portuguese cuisine in hotel buffets?

754
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:36,307
This is the first restaurant to bring over the local restaurant.

755
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:38,437
So there are Portuguese cuisines.

756
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:39,607
(She finally understands.)

757
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:42,077
Portugal is famous for their egg tarts.

758
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,178
So there are a lot of dessert shops that sell egg tarts.

759
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:48,376
But from what I know, this is the first restaurant...

760
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,846
which brought over the local Portuguese restaurant.

761
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:52,157
(This is the first restaurant in Korea...)

762
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:53,418
(that brought over a local Portuguese restaurant.)

763
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,087
How long has this restaurant been?

764
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:58,228
This restaurant has been about three years.

765
00:27:58,627 --> 00:27:59,728
This restaurant?

766
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:03,668
The original restaurant is a famous restaurant...

767
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:07,168
in Porto with 150 years of history.

768
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:09,537
What does the name mean?

769
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,407
It's the name of a town in Porto.

770
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:15,607
A town. You mean like Anyang or Suwon?

771
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:18,547
More like Seongsan-dong or Mangwon-dong.

772
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:23,418
(So Min suddenly stands up.)

773
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:25,148
(What is it?)

774
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:26,817
(Did she notice something?)

775
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:29,158
(Flicking)

776
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:32,157
- I couldn't see his face. - I couldn't see it.

777
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:34,728
You don't have to be so sensitive about it.

778
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:36,797
This seat is just nice.

779
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,337
(She's very content after securing her vision.)

780
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,668
Manager, have you been to Portugal?

781
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:45,407
Yes. I went to Portugal for a year for a working holiday.

782
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:46,408
(He lived in Portugal for 1 year.)

783
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:50,208
I found out about this place when I worked part-time there.

784
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:53,346
Did you work in that local restaurant before?

785
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:55,448
Yes, I worked part-time there.

786
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:58,488
Then can you say something in Portuguese?

787
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:00,317
"This place has delicious food"...

788
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:02,116
or "Mi Joo is pretty".

789
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,287
(She's looking forward to it.)

790
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:05,557
Hello. Nice to meet you.

791
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:07,297
Ola.

792
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:09,928
I'm Gu Sung Eun.

793
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:14,067
(He doesn't get flustered and speaks in Portuguese.)

794
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,807
- Wait. This is Spanish. - The menu...

795
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,708
Spanish has the "Te" sound at the back.

796
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:22,607
Is that so?

797
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:23,708
(She accepts his explanation quickly.)

798
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,846
I don't know how to speak Portuguese, but overall,

799
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:29,448
it looks like he was taught by the production crew.

800
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:31,988
You don't sound very fluent.

801
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,886
(Is he a fake manager who hurriedly learned Portuguese...)

802
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,728
(right before the filming?)

803
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:40,258
Sir, then how old are you?

804
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,697
Is it related to finding out...

805

And I watch all the shows he features in.

1444
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:06,297
I watched "Sixth Sense" and thought I needed to keep creating.

1445
00:53:06,298 --> 00:53:08,736
That's how the 50cm sushi came about.

1446
00:53:08,737 --> 00:53:10,168
(The 50cm sushi was introduced 3 months ago)

1447
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:13,736
It's cut from a live fish so we want patrons to eat it straight away.

1448
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:17,378
But they spend time taking pictures which made us wary initially.

1449
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,176
But once they're posted on social media,

1450
00:53:19,177 --> 00:53:20,917
the pictures draw in more customers.

1451
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:24,687
Thanks to that, we're making 600,000 dollars in annual sales.

1452
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:27,657
And we have actually opened our second location.

1453

Sixth Sense. Is this place real?

1454
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,267
We heard you started making 50cm long sushi recently.

1455
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:40,366
Yes. We started out making 20cm long sushi.

1456
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,767
We decided to apply for a patent for it.

1457
00:53:43,768 --> 00:53:45,068
So we received a patent,

1458
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:46,907
and registered the trademark.

1459
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:50,676
I'm also a huge fan of "Sixth Sense" and you, Jae Seok.

- Thank you. - It's truly an honour to meet you.

1461
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:56,778
I tried to make it as long as possible and reached 50cm.

1462
00:53:57,048 --> 00:53:59,648
It's really long if it's 50cm. Around this long.

1463

We are the first to make it.

How did they think of that?

1599
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:07,228
We would never have guessed that.

1600
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,097
This child is a genius.

1601
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:11,667
- This is ridiculous. - It was too difficult.

1602
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:14,096
- Daniel is pure. - He really is.

1603
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:15,797
- He's so pure. - He's either pure or the spy.

1604
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:17,137
- No. - No, he's not the spy.

1605
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:18,338
It's coming.

1606
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:20,107
It's on its way!

1607
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:21,207
It looks delicious.

1608
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,737
They all seem hefty though.

1609
00:59:25,878 --> 00:59:26,878
It's really...

1610
00:59:28,717 --> 00:59:30,346
(The sushi looks unbelievable.)

1611
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:32,386
- Is this how it's served? - This is how it's served.

1612
00:59:32,387 --> 00:59:33,748
Then I get it.

1613
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:36,358

(Salmon)

1616
00:59:40,157 --> 00:59:43,897
Standard sushi is raw fish on top of rice.

1617
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:44,898
(Normal sushi has a 1 to 1 ratio of rice and raw fish.)

1618
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,597
The moment you bite into this, you don't immediately taste the rice,

1619
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:52,636
you get a feel for the raw fish first.

1620
00:59:52,637 --> 00:59:55,108
And then the rice bursts out later.

1621
00:59:56,537 --> 00:59:59,006
Eating it like that allows for the intense depth of flavour...

1622
00:59:59,007 --> 01:00:00,947
of the raw fish to come through.

1623
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:04,987
That also makes it very smooth to swallow.

1624
01:00:05,117 --> 01:00:07,756
Think of it as the most depth of flavour you can get from sushi.

1625
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:11,528
(Another tip, you can fill up on raw fish and not rice.)

- How do we eat it? - I'll try.

1643

- You need to roll this up. - How?

1644
01:00:50,657 --> 01:00:51,866
- Daniel. - Do we roll it all the way?

1645
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:53,227
This really is difficult.

1646
01:00:53,228 --> 01:00:54,467
It's definitely not easy.

1647
01:00:55,237 --> 01:00:57,466
I think we should roll it all up.

1648

- You're not filling up on rice, - It's all about the fish.

You're filling up on raw fish.

What?

1724
01:04:00,188 --> 01:04:02,557
I believe that when you cut fish, you cut it into long fillets first.

01:04:03,018 --> 01:04:05,886
You cut it into a long fillet and cut it into smaller pieces.

Right, but you're just cutting it from that long piece.

I don't understand why you would need a patent for that.

You're right.

1729

When you get a patent,

1730

shouldn't it be for something unique and special?

Because it's for something that doesn't exist.

01:10:48,028 --> 01:10:50,228
I think this place is real.

1910
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:52,097
Doesn't this place seem real?

1911
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:54,568
- Do you think it's real? - You don't?

1912
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:57,438
Why would they feed us nipples?

1913
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:00,938
(It's actually the meat behind the nipples.)

1914
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:03,336
Doesn't it feel like they're making it extreme...

1915
01:11:03,337 --> 01:11:05,307
so that we get scared?

1916
01:11:06,408 --> 01:11:08,517
But the menu looks real.

1917
01:11:08,518 --> 01:11:09,647
Right?

1918
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:10,777
(Are they really the names of the special parts?)

1919
01:11:10,778 --> 01:11:11,887
(Or were they created by the crew to scare them?)

1920
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:15,158
Who's Woong?

1921
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:17,216
Who's Woong?

1922
01:11:17,217 --> 01:11:18,228
(He sees an autograph.)

1923
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:21,456
- Woong's dad. - Woong's dad.

1924
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:22,927
Hong Yun Hwa?

1925
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:24,426
- Yun Hwa? - She came here too?

1926
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,497
- I saw her autograph earlier too. - She came here too?

1927
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,836
Yun Hwa keeps...

1928
01:11:28,837 --> 01:11:29,837
(Hong Yun Hwa is like Hong Gil Dong.)

1929
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:31,137
Yun Hwa's autograph was in Spot Two...

1930
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:32,706
and in Spot Three.

1931
01:11:32,707 --> 01:11:33,707
(Yun Hwa appeared in Spot 2 and 3.)

1932
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:34,876
One of them must be fake.

(Is the autograph here real?)

1934
01:11:38,948 --> 01:11:40,306
This place is fake.

1935
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:42,046
- I think this place is real. - Ms. Spy.

1936

(You must be the spy.)

1937
01:11:43,078 --> 01:11:44,147
I'm not the spy.

1938
01:11:44,148 --> 01:11:45,716
- Mi Joo... - Daniel's the spy.

1939
01:11:45,717 --> 01:11:47,886
- Why do you keep saying that? - Kang Daniel is the spy.

1940
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,318
Like I said,

1941
01:11:49,658 --> 01:11:51,087
if they want to create a fake,

1942
01:11:51,828 --> 01:11:55,358
there's no reason to go into so much detail.

1943
01:11:55,557 --> 01:11:57,256
(Menu 1, TV appearance, autographs, menu 2)

1944
01:11:57,257 --> 01:11:59,068
(banner, tableware, hand sanitizer, fan)

1945
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:01,296
- That's true. That makes sense. - Right?

1946
01:12:01,297 --> 01:12:03,738
- It's reasonable doubt. - But if you get twisted...

If you get twisted...

1948
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:08,006
- Get twisted? - You mean you twist it around?

1949
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:09,007
You twist it around.

1950
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:10,237
If you get twisted...

1951
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:11,376
If you think about it in a different way.

1952
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:12,947
If you think about it in a different way...

1953
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:14,447
That would be upsetting.

1954
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:16,376
Taking a new perspective.

01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:17,547
(He's being sarcastic.)

1956

(Stop being sarcastic.)

1957

Today, you'll be tasting the pork blood vessel...

01:12:23,518 --> 01:12:25,327
and the nipple meat.

I can't eat that.

Even when I'm eating pork rinds,

1964
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:36,397
- I know what you mean. - if I see the nipple,

1965
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:39,166
- I can't eat it. - I put it off to the side too.

1966
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,978
- I can't look at it. - I stopped eating it after that.

1967
01:12:42,278 --> 01:12:43,806
- Should we bring in the owner? - Yes.

1968
01:12:43,807 --> 01:12:44,907
Can you come in?

1969
01:12:44,908 --> 01:12:45,908
It's very...

01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:46,908
(The owner comes in.)

He looks like the real owner.

1973
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:52,046
- Come here. - Okay. Hello.

1974
01:12:52,047 --> 01:12:53,648
(He has a nice hairstyle.)

1975
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:55,416
Hello.

1976
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,487
I'm Cho, the owner of A Barbecue, the only place in Seoul...

1977
01:12:58,488 --> 01:13:01,228
that sells pork blood vessels and nipple meat.

1978
01:13:02,057 --> 01:13:03,197
A Barbecue...

1979
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:05,897
sells special parts of pork in Chungcheong Province-style.

1980
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:08,897
We sell special parts that are only eaten in Chungcheong Province...

1981
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:11,038
and sell them here in Seoul.

1982
01:13:11,837 --> 01:13:15,238
The blood vessel is the cut next to the pig's heart.

1983
01:13:15,377 --> 01:13:18,507
Simply put, it's the pig's aorta.

1984
01:13:18,707 --> 01:13:21,916
Since it's the aorta, there are a lot of small vessels.

1985
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:24,916
So I have to remove each one of them with a scissor.

1986
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:28,517
Then I season it before I sell it.

1987
01:13:28,518 --> 01:13:30,487
As for the nipple meat,

1988
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:33,227
it's the meat that's behind the nipples.

1989
01:13:33,228 --> 01:13:35,197
You get about 80g per pig.

1990
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:40,466
When you grill it, it tastes like beef thin skirt.

1991
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:42,697
If you cook it well done, it tastes like jerky.

1992
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:43,698
(It's a delicacy that tastes like jerky when it's well done.)

1993
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:46,636
A lot of women refuse to eat it.

1994
01:13:46,637 --> 01:13:50,077
If I give them a small piece, they try it,

1995
01:13:50,078 --> 01:13:52,448
and they order another serving and eat it.

1996
01:13:53,177 --> 01:13:56,717
(It's a special part that you can't just try once.)

1997
01:13:57,078 --> 01:13:58,447
Sixth Sense.

1998
01:13:58,448 --> 01:14:00,247
Is this place real?

1999
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:05,287
- Hello. - Hello.

2000
01:14:05,288 --> 01:14:06,757
- Hello. - Can you introduce yourself?

2001
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:09,626
Hello. I'm Cho, the only person in Seoul...

2002
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:13,198
that sells special parts of pork in Chungcheong Province-style.

2003
01:14:13,268 --> 01:14:14,727
Where in Chungcheong Province are you from?

2004
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:15,997
I'm from Chungju.

2005
01:14:16,068 --> 01:14:17,997
You're from North Chungcheong Province!

2006
01:14:19,268 --> 01:14:20,738
They don't sell this in Okcheon though.

2007
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:23,037
- Right. We don't have this. - Yes, you don't.

2008
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:24,978
(They don't have pork blood vessel and nipple meat in Okcheon?)

2009
01:14:25,108 --> 01:14:27,346
(It's a Chungcheong Province specialty, )

2010
01:14:27,347 --> 01:14:29,547
(but they don't have it in Okcheon?)

2011
01:14:30,648 --> 01:14:33,647
I feel like I've seen pork blood vessels...

2012
01:14:33,648 --> 01:14:36,717
being eaten on a TV show once, but...

2013
01:14:36,957 --> 01:14:38,387
What exactly is it?

2014
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:40,126
This vessel.

2015
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:41,857
Right. Your heart vessel.

2016
01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:43,996
We eat beef vessel too.

2017
01:14:43,997 --> 01:14:46,466
They sell it in Daegu.

2018
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:48,996
In Chungcheong Province, they sell pork blood vessels...

2019
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:51,466
- in Chungju, Cheongju, and Goesan. - Really?

2020
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:54,437
Yes. I tried it for the 1st time when I was 20,

2021
01:14:54,438 --> 01:14:57,136
so it's been about 20 years. That's when I started eating it.

2022
01:14:57,137 --> 01:14:59,247
- I see. - When I came to Seoul,

2023
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:00,877
- you don't have it here. - We don't.

2024
01:15:01,108 --> 01:15:04,847
I found out that it's hard to come by.

2025
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:08,857
There are a lot of slaughterhouses in Chungcheong Province.

2026
01:15:08,858 --> 01:15:12,126
Since there are a lot there,

2027
01:15:12,127 --> 01:15:13,886
we were able to try a lot of other parts.

2028
01:15:13,887 --> 01:15:15,756
This is detailed. This is...

2029
01:15:15,757 --> 01:15:17,597
- He's really detailed. - Right.

(He's able to give detailed answers easily. Is he the real owner?)

Is the nipple meat really the nipple?

2033
01:15:27,108 --> 01:15:28,438
It's the meat behind the nipples.

(The meat behind the nipples?)

2035

So there are no nipples?

2037
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:34,577
No, of course not.

2038
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:35,647
- Thank goodness. - It's the meat behind it.

2039
01:15:35,648 --> 01:15:37,916
It could be really tender.
