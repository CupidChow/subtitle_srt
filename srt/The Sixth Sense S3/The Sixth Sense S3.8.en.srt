I recommend trying it with your eyes closed.

- It must be the color. - I think it will taste good.

No, I think I know.

- This place is real. - Right? I think so too.

I think this place is real.

Everything seems fake today.

1762
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:07,895
- That's true. It is. - This place is real.

1763
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:10,394
- Is this house in the dog's name? - That's possible.

1764
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:11,663
I doubt that.

1765
01:06:11,664 --> 01:06:13,894
- Isn't that impossible, legally? - Do you think?

1766
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:15,864
- Isn't it impossible? - Couldn't it be possible?

1767
01:06:16,034 --> 01:06:17,034
I'm not sure.

1768
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:18,933
- But... We need... - Could it be in the dog's name?

to meet the owner.

01:06:20,074 --> 01:06:22,033
Let's bring him in and listen to his story.

(Ji Yeon fosters Charlie as his owner passed away.)

1792
01:07:13,554 --> 01:07:16,053
Charlie's owner...

1793
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:18,594
had suffered a stroke.

1794

to protect Charlie after his death.

1796

Then can your dog inherit your assets?

1797
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:30,344
The bottom line is it's impossible in Korea.

1798
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:32,173
Article Three of the Civil Law,

1799
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:35,513
says that people are the main agents of rights and obligations.

1800
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:38,343
Pets do not have the capacity to exercise their rights,

1801
01:07:38,344 --> 01:07:40,084
and cannot become main agents.

1802
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:44,124
Article 1,000 of the Civil Law regarding the order of inheritance,

1803
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:47,194
it's direct descendants, lineal ascendants, siblings,

1804
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:48,593
cousins and relatives.

1805
01:07:48,594 --> 01:07:51,293
Pets aren't listed anywhere,

1806
01:07:51,294 --> 01:07:52,565
so it's impossible.

1807
01:07:52,964 --> 01:07:56,495
In Korea, there's a system called pet trusts.

1808
01:07:57,105 --> 01:07:59,734
Let me explain what a trust is before explaining pet trusts.

1809
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:02,734
A truster leaves their assets to their trustee.

1810
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:06,504
Then the trustee gives the assets to the beneficiary.

1811
01:08:07,044 --> 01:08:09,373
The pet owner would be the truster,

1812
01:08:09,374 --> 01:08:11,444
and the financial institution would be the trustee.

1813
01:08:11,445 --> 01:08:14,454
Then they will appoint a person or an organization...

1814
01:08:14,455 --> 01:08:15,714
as the beneficiary.

1815
01:08:15,985 --> 01:08:18,083
The goal is to spend the money...

1816
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:20,195
to care for the pet well.

1817
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:23,394
Charlie's trust includes 200,000 dollars in cash,

1818
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,995
and 600,000 dollars in real estate.

1819
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:31,035
(Is Charlie's story of inheriting 800,000 dollars true?)

1820
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:34,334
Sixth Sense, is this place real?

1821
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:38,873
- Charlie. - Charlie.

1822
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:40,374
Charlie. Did he belong to a foreigner?

1823
01:08:40,514 --> 01:08:41,514
No.

1824
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:42,843
- Gosh. Charlie. - He's so cute.

1825
01:08:42,844 --> 01:08:44,314
- He sat in front of you. - He did.

1826
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:46,444
- Good boy. - Good boy.

1827
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:47,584
How cute.

1828
01:08:47,884 --> 01:08:50,383
Overall, and perhaps it's because we heard his story,

1829
01:08:50,384 --> 01:08:53,383
but he looks very wealthy.

1830
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:55,354
- You're right. - He looks rich.

1831
01:08:55,355 --> 01:08:56,394
He does.

1832
01:08:56,395 --> 01:08:57,564
- He's very... - He's surprised.

1833
01:08:57,565 --> 01:08:59,525
(He even looks wealthy from behind.)

1834
01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:01,833
We heard that Charlie received an inheritance.

1835
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:03,464
Can you tell us the specifics?

1836
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:06,564
Yes, that's correct. Charlie's owner,

1837
01:09:06,565 --> 01:09:08,474
an old man, was my client.

1838
01:09:08,605 --> 01:09:11,244
The old man lived abroad for many years with his wife...

1839
01:09:11,245 --> 01:09:13,814
before returning to Korea.

1840
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:16,213
- He lived abroad. - After coming back,

1841
01:09:16,214 --> 01:09:18,144
his wife passed away before him.

1842
01:09:18,145 --> 01:09:19,914
They didn't have any children,

1843
01:09:19,915 --> 01:09:21,654
and he felt lonely,

1844
01:09:21,655 --> 01:09:23,923
so he adopted Charlie and raised him.

1845
01:09:23,924 --> 01:09:25,954
As you can tell by looking around,

1846
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:29,053
he raised Charlie as though he was his son.

1847
01:09:29,054 --> 01:09:31,923
The man in the photographs...

1848
01:09:31,924 --> 01:09:33,093
- Yes, that's him. - is his late owner?

1849
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:34,134
Yes, that's correct.

1850
01:09:34,865 --> 01:09:37,104
I've never heard about this before, so I'm curious.

1851
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:41,303
Do pet trusts happen often in Korea?

1852
01:09:41,304 --> 01:09:43,543
Yes, since there are many single person households,

1853
01:09:43,544 --> 01:09:45,205
and it's becoming an aging society,

1854
01:09:45,405 --> 01:09:48,244
many people worry about their pets being left alone.

1855
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:50,415
So they want to leave their assets to them.

1856
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,984
It started in 2016...

1857
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:54,954
at K Bank for the first time.

1858
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:57,284
After K Bank, other banks like H Bank...

1859
01:09:57,285 --> 01:10:00,753
came up with their own products for pet trusts.

1860
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:04,924
Charlie is still that...

1861
01:10:05,195 --> 01:10:06,423
I'm sorry.

1862
01:10:06,424 --> 01:10:08,833
- No, what I meant is... - What?

1863
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:11,633
- Charlie isn't neutered. - No, he's not.

1864
01:10:11,634 --> 01:10:13,004
Were you looking...

1865
01:10:13,205 --> 01:10:14,374
Oh, that?

1866
01:10:14,974 --> 01:10:16,574
You could've just said neutered.

1867
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,605
- You made it sound weirder... - I...

1868
01:10:18,745 --> 01:10:20,714
- than necessary. - I'm sorry.

1869
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,444
Don't look.

1870
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:23,584
No, so...

1871
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:27,414
He can still get married.

1872
01:10:27,415 --> 01:10:29,284
- Married? - Married?

1873
01:10:29,285 --> 01:10:32,284
- I guess you're right. - If he gets married and has kids,

1874
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:34,824
can they split up his inheritance?

1875
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:38,694
I discussed this issue with his owner in the past.

1876
01:10:38,695 --> 01:10:41,833
Since Charlie is here alone, he didn't add any provisions...

1877
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:45,003
regarding what to do after Charlie.

1878
01:10:45,004 --> 01:10:46,763
- I'm curious about his. - Then...

1879
01:10:46,764 --> 01:10:49,333
I don't know if this is okay to ask,

1880
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:51,705
but what happens when Charlie gets old?

1881
01:10:51,804 --> 01:10:53,614
If that happens,

1882
01:10:53,615 --> 01:10:56,244
his owner said that if Charlie...

1883
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:58,043
- ends up passing away, - Right.

1884
01:10:58,044 --> 01:11:00,814
the remaining money will be donated to an animal welfare foundation...

1885
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:02,554
under the owner's name.

1886
01:11:02,714 --> 01:11:04,285
That makes sense then.

1887
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:07,553
I would like to know if you, as the caretaker,

1888
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:10,763
do you live here with him...

1889
01:11:10,764 --> 01:11:12,124
or go back and forth?

1890
01:11:12,924 --> 01:11:16,263
You could say I live here, but you could also say I go back and forth.

1891
01:11:16,264 --> 01:11:17,963
- I live near here. - I see.

1892
01:11:17,964 --> 01:11:20,803
I go back and forth,

1893
01:11:20,804 --> 01:11:22,003
but I also sleep here with him sometimes.

1894
01:11:22,004 --> 01:11:23,333
(She became his caretaker because she knew his owner.)

1895
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:25,843
If it's okay to ask,

1896
01:11:25,844 --> 01:11:27,314
do you receive your salary from Charlie?

1897
01:11:27,315 --> 01:11:28,414
(Mr. Charlie)

1898
01:11:28,415 --> 01:11:30,744
What I can tell you about that...

1899
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,484
out of the inheritance his owner has left,

1900
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:35,083
there's a way the money is to be spent.

1901
01:11:35,084 --> 01:11:37,824
His caretaker receives 1,500 dollars a month,

1902
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:39,753
300 dollars is spent regularly on Charlie.

1903
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,854
and 700 to 1,000 dollars...

1904
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:44,793
is spent monthly on maintaining the real estate.

1905
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:47,833
So about 30,000 dollars of the inheritance...

1906
01:11:47,834 --> 01:11:50,263
is spent annually.

1907
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:54,933
- I guess he's close to you too. - He must be close to you too.

1908
01:11:54,934 --> 01:11:57,904
I need to care for Charlie too,

1909
01:11:57,905 --> 01:12:00,815
so I come every two weeks to check up on him.

1910
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:05,684
(He goes up to Mi Joo whom he's seeing for the first time.)

1911
01:12:06,044 --> 01:12:09,114
She sends me his health records,

1912
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:10,924
so I see Charlie occasionally.

1913
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:13,124
He just likes being around people.

1914
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:15,995
Is his name really Charlie?

1915
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:17,293
Why?

1916
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:19,025
We keep saying "Charlie", but he doesn't react.

1917
01:12:20,464 --> 01:12:21,833
- Right. Chewie... - It's...

1918
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:23,593
- as if he doesn't know his name. - Charlie.

1919
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:26,463
- Charlie. He looked at me. See? - Did he?

1920
01:12:26,464 --> 01:12:28,034

1922

He looks.

1923
01:12:30,504 --> 01:12:32,105
Charlie likes pretty girls.

1924
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:34,915
- Charlie. Hi! - He likes me.

1925
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:37,244
Hi!

1926
01:12:37,245 --> 01:12:38,415
He moved after you said that.

1927
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:40,553
Why did he do that?

1928
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:41,984
He knows how to play hard to get.

1929
01:12:41,985 --> 01:12:43,383
He knows how to play hard to get?

1930
01:12:43,384 --> 01:12:44,724
- Does he? - He does.

1931
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:48,423
- What does he do at this hour? - Take a nap?

1932
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:52,164
After I feed him,

1933
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:53,195
he takes a nap.

1934
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:57,235
(It seems like a simple answer for a caretaker.)

1935
01:12:57,365 --> 01:12:59,564
What else would a dog do?

1936
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:02,974
They poop, eat, and sleep.

1937

(There's a reaction error.)

1938

No.

I thought we were playing the initial game.

- You didn't do anything wrong. - Right.

If this was fake, why would he follow her?

1974
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:25,053
Maybe she's just the dog owner.
