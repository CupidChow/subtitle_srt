I'm actually a lot quieter.

487
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,238
- You're quiet, right? - Then someone who talks a lot...

488
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,468
beside you must be your ideal type, right?

489
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:04,039
- That's not the case. - Is that so?

490
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,439
I'm very quiet.

491
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,238
- Really? - Yes, I'm very quiet.

498
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,688
- I'm like that. - Me too.

499
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:21,790
You know me, right?

500
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,330
- You talk a lot. - I...

501
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,800
You talk so much!

502
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,698
- You even call when we're resting. - Seriously...

503
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,529
They think I'm a scholar at home.

504
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,898
Don't call me on the days that I rest.

505
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:34,299
What about you, Hye Yoon? Do you talk a lot or not?

506
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,739
I talk a lot.

507
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,069
- Really? - I even talk to myself...

508
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,168
when I'm alone at home.

509
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,109
- About what? - You should go see a doctor then.

510
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,110
That's scary.

511
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,908
You're scolding her again.

512
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:45,918
- Talking to herself is strange. - You're scolding her again, Na Ra.

513
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,050
You know Na Ra is very strict with female juniors, right?

514
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,589
I'm not strict.

515
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,219
She treats male juniors warmly,

516
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,760
but she's very strict with female juniors.

517
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:58,958
She always scolds So Min.

518
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,929
"Your hair is oily."

519
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,669
On the other hand, since So Min isn't here,

520
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,339
Mi Joo can take everything to herself.

521
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,439
- I love that there's no competitor. - Exactly.

522
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,770
So Min tends to get on your nerves...

523
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,010
when you wear the same style of clothes.

524
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:14,238
- You're right. - But in the end,

525
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,750
Na Ra gets their numbers.

526
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,519
So Min and I compete,

527
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,079
but Na Ra wins in the end.

528
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,119
That's the most important.

529
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,319
I didn't get their numbers,

530
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,119
but they messaged me first on my social media.

531
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,689
- Really? - Yes.

532
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,819
They messaged you first?

533
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,158
They must've found me comfortable.

534
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,530
- They messaged you? - You got the messages? Me too.

535
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,029
- You did? Why not me? - Exactly. You...

536
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,698
I'm not joking, every single one of them messaged me.

537
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,169
- Really? - Hold on.

538

- Why didn't they message me? - You also...

539
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,398
Do you know what Mi Joo must think?

540
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:39,840
She doesn't accept that as it is.

541
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:42,738
Because they have feelings for her,

542
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,269
- they find it hard to contact her. - They find it hard to talk to me.

543
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,080
Because I'm too perfect,

544
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:47,779
- they feel pressured. - They feel pressured.

545
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,849
They will think, "Will she actually like me?"

546
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,749
- That's why they can't contact me. - I'm easy to talk to.

547
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,148
- Yoon Su, don't worry. - Okay, I won't worry.

548
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,388
- You don't have a phone, right? - My phone disappeared.

549
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,958
- That's good. - What do you mean? I just saw it.

550
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,030
- It disappeared. - You!

551
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:03,889
I like you.

552
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,898
He doesn't want to get related to her in any way in this lifetime.

553
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:10,198
That's great. Yoon Su is really smart.

554
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,138
- No, I saw it just now. - He understood it right away.

- I borrowed it. - No.

802

If it's 60 side dishes,

803
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:21,703
- it means 60 dishes will be served. - Yes.

804
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:23,715
What dishes do you serve that there are 60 side dishes?

805
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:25,943
I serve seasonal sashimi,

806
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:29,214
lobster, mulhoe, octopus stick,

807
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:31,515
live octopus, abalone sashimi...

808
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,853
(Well-cooked lobster...)

809
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:36,525
(and fresh seasonal sashimi)

810
00:28:36,954 --> 00:28:39,025
(And various delicious seafood dishes...)

(that decorate the table)

812
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:45,804
They're all seafood.

(It's a seafood party.)

814
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,133
For those who can't eat sashimi,

815
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:51,275
I serve samgyetang and bulgogi.

816
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:52,404
Samgyetang?

817
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:54,174
- You serve bulgogi? - Yes.

818
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,943
But if they come to a sashimi restaurant,

819
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,715
most of them must be able to eat sashimi.

820
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,284
Why do you cook bulgogi and samgyetang...

821
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:04,215
for those who can't eat sashimi?

822
00:29:04,914 --> 00:29:08,485
Some customers don't like sashimi,

823
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,194
and there are children too.

824
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:13,163
The whole family should enjoy their meal.

825
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:14,764
So I tried to suit their needs.

826
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:15,994
That's very convincing.

827
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:18,933
When you come in a group, there definitely are people...

828
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,904
- who can't eat sashimi. - Some can't eat sashimi.

829
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:22,674
That's you.

830

(Unlike his protruding mouth, Jae Seok is picky.)

831
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:26,775
How did you know?

832
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:30,843
That's why he became wide-eyed when she mentioned bulgogi.

833
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:32,374
- I... Hold on. - He doesn't like sashimi.

834
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:35,015
(He loves bulgogi.)

835
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:37,515
- He has a cheap mouth. - They really...

836
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,224
They really know me well.

837
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:41,055
- His taste is that of a baby's. - I'm correct, right?

838
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,225
(Is it the owner's consideration for those who can't eat sashimi?)

839
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:48,025
(Or is it a fake dish to fill up 60 side dishes?)

840
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:50,163
- Shall I go and prepare? - Yes, please.

841
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,835
- I'll start preparing. - Thank you.

842
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:56,735
Whenever the owner talked, Yoon Su was...

(Laughing)

844
00:29:58,134 --> 00:30:00,574
- Why? Because you think she's fake? - Why did you do that?

845
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:02,143
- You think she's fake? - I think she's making things up.

846
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:05,015
And when I saw her apron,

847
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,344
it had the sharp fold you can see from a new apron.

848
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:09,285
She ironed it.

849
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:11,914
(The sharp fold that looks new. Is this a fake place built hastily?)

850
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:16,594
But last week, the person who talked really well was fake.

851
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:20,064
Just like that, she might be real,

852
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:21,693
but she was too nervous...

853
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,534
to talk smoothly.

854
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:25,065
It's you.

855
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:29,203
- You're the spy. - That's right.

856
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:32,374
She's confusing me from here.

857
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:34,174
It must be you since you're trying to frame me.

858
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,843
- It's you. - It must be him...

859
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:37,374
- since he's trying to frame me. - This is a spy hat, right?

860
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:40,244
If you take off the hat, "spy" might be written on your head.

861
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,383
Mi Joo normally doesn't wear a hat.

862
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,624
I'm going with a cute concept nowadays, so I wore it.

That's not something to be jealous of.

Just a moment.

This side is the overly affectionate and this side is not affectionate.

1274
00:45:10,155 --> 00:45:11,155
- Really? - Gosh, what do we do?

1275
00:45:11,156 --> 00:45:12,554
- Hye Yoon, state your argument. - Yes.

1276
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:14,453
(Somehow becoming the first to argue)

1277
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:18,254
A person needs to have a lot of love to be able to love other people.

00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:19,993
- That's right. - I think that also means...

they have plenty to share with people around...

1280

But you know, I think...

1281
00:45:24,695 --> 00:45:26,394
You're strange too.

(Laughing)

1283
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:31,073
- She's on our side. - Wait.

1284
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:32,634
Hye Yoon is on our side.

1285
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:35,004
- I know. But it makes no sense. - Are you sure...

1286
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:37,214
you know that Hye Yoon is on our side?

1287
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:38,373
But she's making no sense.

1288
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:40,414
Sang Yeob, you should say something too.

1289
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:43,715
It's sad.

1290
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:46,854
How is that funny?

1291
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:49,683
See? It just works for some people.

1292
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:52,824
The panel just sighed deeply.

1293
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:54,924
The panel...

1294
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:56,763
I just heard a groan from the panel.

1295
00:45:56,764 --> 00:46:00,134
- Sang Yeob, go for it. Argue. - It's only love if they express it.

1296
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,864
It's not love if it's not expressed.

1297
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:04,174
But the way I see it, if they express their love...

1298
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:05,803
- to everyone... - Yes?

1299
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,044
Say that I have a boyfriend,

1300
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,803
and he says he loves my best friend in front of me.

1301
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:12,274
Well, then, think about it this way.

1302
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:15,084
How proud and happy would I be if the person I love...

1303
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:18,554
expressed their love for my family, not only my close friends.

1304
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:23,453
A girlfriend that says she loves her boyfriend's family?

1305
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:26,194
They could also be husband and wife.

1306
00:46:26,195 --> 00:46:28,123
They're going to tell their in-laws that they love them?

1307
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:30,095
(That's all lies.)

1308
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:31,295
That's all lies.

1309
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:32,364
(That love is a lie.)

1310
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:33,434
What is this?

1311
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,803
- What are you talking about? - It's a dangerous opinion to hold.

1312
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:38,104
- What is Na Ra talking about? - It's too dangerous.

1313
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:40,474
- Too dangerous. - What did Na Ra say?

1314
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:42,904
- You'd have to break up. - So I think you should say it.

1315
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:45,544
I know that there are people who don't really express their feelings.

1316
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:49,214
But not expressing them at all makes you wonder if they really love you.

1317
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:51,214
Someone who knows how to show restraint is truly desirable.

1318
00:46:51,215 --> 00:46:53,183
If they're too flippant with their expressions of love,

1319
00:46:53,184 --> 00:46:55,183
- you'd lose trust in them. - You can't take them seriously.

1320
00:46:55,184 --> 00:46:57,353
If they love this person and that...

1321
00:46:57,354 --> 00:46:59,925
If you know so much about love, why did you do that?

1322

(This person would confess her love on every episode)

Indeed. That's what I mean. Do you see?

1328
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:16,913
That's the end of the game.

1329
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:19,473

It could be a restaurant that only serves crab. We've only seen crab.

It's only showing crab.

There's a few of us including Haha, Sang Yeob, and me.

The committee would have to get together...

In that case, Jae Seok, what do you think of Yoon Su?

There's no way, he's just too shy.

She really doesn't know anything about men.

You were really thin back then.

He said that we appeared on "Radio Star" together.

1418
00:50:18,925 --> 00:50:20,564
So I asked when it was, and it was then.

Yoon Su.

1420

Yoon Su was sitting right next to you.

1421
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:25,263
- But apparently, I said... - With Kwang Hee too.

1422
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:27,103
That he wasn't my type.

1423
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:28,303
Really?

1424

If we plate it too far ahead of time, the meat changes color.

1579
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,314
It also loses its freshness so that's how we currently operate.

1580
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:14,013
A positive factor that can only be found here...

1581
00:56:14,014 --> 00:56:16,914
Each person takes a plate of the cut that they want to eat,

1582
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:19,585
one by one, which makes it very cost-effective.

1583
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:22,954
We receive the meat as raw materials for a low price.

1584
00:56:23,085 --> 00:56:27,255
We use the fish tank to water age the raw materials.

1585
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:31,065
Water aging helps reduce the evaporation of liquids.

1586
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:34,534
It makes the meat juicier and intensifies the flavors.

1587
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:37,873
People see meat on the rotating belt...

1588
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:40,873
and think, "This is fun." So it's become a fun venue.

1589
00:56:40,874 --> 00:56:42,844
And I think people come for the interesting experience.

If the meat is continually looping around,

doesn't it get tougher or anything like that?

Not really.

1608

It could dry if it's out in the open for too long.

The color could turn slightly.

1610

It actually tastes better after it dries out.

1611

00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:01,755
When we grill meat to eat,

1621
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:04,183
we should keep grilling the next cut as soon as the first is done.

1622
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:06,494
But it would take a while for it to loop around.

I don't think we would be able to wait for it to loop around.

(These precious bags...)

(are at a cafe?)

2203
01:19:14,595 --> 01:19:17,193
Hello, I'm Ji Yeon, the 31-year-old owner of Coco,

2204
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:19,534
a cafe where you can eat designer bag cakes.

2205
01:19:19,694 --> 01:19:23,304
We're a cafe that sells cakes with miniatures...

2206
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:25,904
of luxury bags.

2207
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:30,004
Our cakes are all whipped cream based.

2208
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:33,244
(On top of a variety of handmade cakes...)

2209
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:36,544
We place miniatures of bags using sugarcraft...

2210
01:19:36,545 --> 01:19:39,214
on top of our cakes.

2211
01:19:39,215 --> 01:19:40,355
(You can't take your eyes off of these desserts.)

2212
01:19:40,385 --> 01:19:42,884
The miniature cakes that we sell...

2213
01:19:42,885 --> 01:19:45,323
are all edibles.

2214
01:19:45,324 --> 01:19:47,823
We have strawberry, blueberry, chocolate, green tea,

2215
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:48,964
and grapefruit earl grey cakes.

2216
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:50,895
We have these five flavors.

2217
01:19:51,095 --> 01:19:53,733
At first, one of my guy friends...

2218
01:19:53,734 --> 01:19:57,434
wanted to propose to his girlfriend,

2219
01:19:57,435 --> 01:20:01,474
so he asked me if I could make a sugar bag in the shape...

2220
01:20:01,475 --> 01:20:04,704
of that design. He asked me for the favor, so I tried it.

2221
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,844
It received a lot of interest.

2222
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:09,015
(Word of mouth spread, and the designer bag cake got famous.)

2223
01:20:09,244 --> 01:20:14,154
It costs anywhere between 150 to 180 dollars.

2224
01:20:14,715 --> 01:20:16,024
Sixth Sensers.

2225
01:20:16,284 --> 01:20:18,895
Is this place real?

2226
01:20:21,494 --> 01:20:23,924
How long have you been open?

2227
01:20:23,925 --> 01:20:27,594
- We opened about 3, 4 months ago. - It hasn't been long.

2228
01:20:27,595 --> 01:20:28,863
We're a brand new dessert cafe.

2229
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:31,733
One of the biggest questions we have...

2230
01:20:31,734 --> 01:20:33,734
is the issue with licensing.

2231
01:20:34,105 --> 01:20:37,004
Right. Honestly, the biggest worry I had...

2232
01:20:37,005 --> 01:20:39,373
when opening this cafe was just that.

2233
01:20:39,374 --> 01:20:42,214
So I spoke with lawyers and patent lawyers...

2234
01:20:42,215 --> 01:20:44,184
to receive legal consultation.

2235
01:20:44,185 --> 01:20:46,983
- And? - And according to them,

2236
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:48,684
These cakes do not violate...

2237
01:20:48,685 --> 01:20:51,354
Trademarks Law or Unfair Competition Act.

2238
01:20:51,355 --> 01:20:53,993
Nor does it lead to confusion of the source.

2239
01:20:53,994 --> 01:20:56,794
Furthermore, what I do is considered an homage...

2240
01:20:56,795 --> 01:20:59,734
to portray the respect I have for that brand.

2241
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:03,233
(The designer bag cakes were born from active legal consultation.)

2242
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:05,534
- So there are no legal issues... - Are you a lawyer?

2243
01:21:06,605 --> 01:21:08,404
You have no difficulty with the legal terminology.

2244
01:21:08,635 --> 01:21:11,444
- She speaks so well. - Like she prepared it.

2245
01:21:11,545 --> 01:21:12,573
(She's practically an expert on legal knowledge.)

2246
01:21:12,574 --> 01:21:13,614
(She's suspicious.)

2247
01:21:13,814 --> 01:21:15,443
Have you heard from them yet?

2248
01:21:15,444 --> 01:21:17,014
- The brands. - No, not yet.

2249
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:18,483
(Is she a fake owner who works in law?)

2250
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:19,984
(Or a real owner who did a lot of research?)

2251
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:23,254
So is that a cake, not sugar?

2252
01:21:23,255 --> 01:21:26,894
There are two types of desserts that we sell at our cafe.

2253
01:21:26,895 --> 01:21:30,395
If you look in the showcase, there are whipped cream cakes.

2254
01:21:30,425 --> 01:21:32,094
They're regular whipped cream cakes...

2255
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:34,894
with miniature bags on top of them.

2256
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:36,935
(She bakes the cakes and fills them with whipped cream and ingredients.)

2257
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:40,835
(Then she makes the miniature luxury bags with the special molds.)

2258
01:21:41,175 --> 01:21:46,545
(Then she colors each one of them with care...)

2259
01:21:46,744 --> 01:21:48,243
(and puts them on top of the cake.)

2260
01:21:48,244 --> 01:21:50,813
If you taste it,

2261
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:52,884
it'll just taste like a piece of candy.

2262
01:21:52,885 --> 01:21:53,913
(The cake is ready.)

2263
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:58,324
(It's hard to learn how to make the flavor and design quickly.)

2264
01:21:58,425 --> 01:22:00,823
(Is the miniature designer bag cake for 8 dollars real or fake?)

2265
01:22:00,824 --> 01:22:03,364
This is really cute.

2266
01:22:03,494 --> 01:22:04,895
It's so pretty.

2267
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:09,134
The ones on top can only be purchased...

2268
01:22:09,135 --> 01:22:10,533
if you make an advanced order.

2269
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:11,703
(The designer bag cakes are made upon order.)

2270
01:22:11,704 --> 01:22:14,273
I'm sure all of you have received a model cake before.

2271
01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:17,674
- We know what that is. - You've all received one before.

2272
01:22:17,675 --> 01:22:19,845
(Our Sixth Sensers are all popular.)

2273
01:22:19,914 --> 01:22:23,944
There are more people who order it advance and pick it up.

2274
01:22:24,185 --> 01:22:27,555
(She cuts the cake into the shape of a bag.)

2275
01:22:27,784 --> 01:22:30,024
(Then she spreads the sugar dough out in the shape of the leather.)

2276
01:22:30,255 --> 01:22:36,464
(Cut it into the right size and put it on the cake.)

2277

(Then add the details of the actual bag to finish it.)

01:22:40,465 --> 01:22:45,265
(What does the designer bag cake look like?)

2279
01:22:45,305 --> 01:22:48,204
- Can we try it today? - Yes, you can taste it.

2280
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:51,305
I'm going to take off the bag and eat it.

2281
01:22:52,975 --> 01:22:55,014
She's such an eloquent speaker.

2282
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:56,714
(They're confused because of how well she speaks.)

2283

Isn't she a great speaker?

2284
01:22:58,885 --> 01:23:00,015
It's as if she prepared it.

2285
01:23:02,114 --> 01:23:03,354
There are a couple of people.

(Are they real part-timers or actors who practiced?)

Is this place fake?

2288
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:10,795
The interior design is too simple.

- Here? - It's easy.

If we think this place is fake,

01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:15,863
the interior is the easiest to do.

2292
01:23:15,864 --> 01:23:16,934
- Right. - For the staff to make.
