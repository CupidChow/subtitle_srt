Where's Jessi?

- She's not here yet. - Jessi.

19

But I came here with her.

20

No.

He might not know.

Then...

25

- Tell him to look for me. - If you do that too...

26

I'm a flower. Tell him to find me.

27
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:26,785
Yes, she's a flower. The Korean pasque flower.

Yes. Two weeks.

Why is everyone...

65

Let's be honest. It's not a bad deal.

Look. I can sing, rap,

Senks?

142

It's not Sixth Senks.

Since Season One,

144
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:44,333
I asked...

- Really? - to be on the show.

146

So Min has no power here.

- What took you so long? - Why?

153
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,694
Every time we called you,

154

your agency said you were too busy.

155

- I knew it. - You shouldn't be mad at them.

You can't say that.

157
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:10,234
Why is he getting mad at us here?

158
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,903
I waited for two years. I'm serious.

Are you having menopause? You're hot-tempered.

He's short-tempered.

161
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:22,314
He was venting.

162
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,643
You...

163
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,884
He's a short-tempered guy.

Hello.

556
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,130
I used to work as a middle school principal...

557
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,459
and became a folk dance teacher as my second life.

558
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,329
I'm Young Kwan, 66 years old.

559
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,439
I was the principal of Songwoo Middle School in Suwon.

560
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,699
I was the principal of Yuljeon Middle School...

561
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,939
for two and a half years.

562
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,308
After I retired, I joined a program called Life Lesson...

563
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,179
as a student.

564
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,508
But after the lesson was over,

565
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,179
the students all went back home.

566
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,379
So I suggested to them,

567
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,848
"Everyone, we're in the same class,"

568
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,548
"but we don't know each other."

569
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,119
"I can teach folk dancing,"

570
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,230
"so let's do it after the lesson instead of going back home."

571
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,129
Since then, I became...

572
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,970
a folk dance teacher in earnest.

573
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:09,700
I was a teacher for 39 years.

574
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,839
For 39 years, I lived only facing forward.

575
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,609
But after I retired,

576
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,338
it became my goal to live relaxed...

577
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,180
and smiling.

578
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,048
Sixth Sense.

579
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,549
Am I real?

580
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:31,788
What is a folk dance in simple terms?

581
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,028
Folk dance is a dance of folklore.

582
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,430
It's a dance of regional people.

583
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,599
It's a traditional dance...

584
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,470
passed down from different regions all around the world.

585
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,439
We call it folk dance.

586
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,509
(Nowadays, recreational dance is referred to as folk dance too.)

587
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:51,838
What do you think is the charm of folk dancing?

588
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,108
- Why did you fall for it? - Yes.

589
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,509
That's a very good question.

590
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,079
He's really like a teacher.

591
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,048
The first characteristic of folk dancing is...

592
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,690
that anyone can do it, regardless of their gender and age.

593
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,129
And the movements are easy and simple,

594
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,229
So it's fun.

595
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,890
So you can learn it quickly.

596
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,829
And it serves as a form of exercise.

597
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,199
It improves your social skills,

598
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,538
and you can also study about various countries' cultures.

599
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:17,669
It's done in a big group,

600
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,538
so you won't have time to feel bored.

601
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,838
And you can feel the sense of achievement.

602
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,409
Furthermore, you can improve...

603
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,038
your self-esteem. It's really good.

604
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,609
(They're losing their focus slowly.)

605
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,779
(It feels like it's 8am.)

606
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,489
When I counted,

607
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,318
there are more than ten benefits.

608
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,518
Whenever I look at him, it feels like I'm looking at my dad.

609
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,519
- Really? - Yes.

610
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,558
He really likes explaining.

611
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,029
"That's a very good question."

612
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,629
He's really like a teacher.

613
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,630
(He speaks exactly like a principal in a morning meeting.)

614
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,470
(He feels like a teacher when he explains. Is he real?)

615
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,439
Okay, then can you dance folk dance...

616
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,969
for us to see?

617
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,008
- Of course. - Please clap for him.

618
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,009
(Sang Yeob responds especially well.)

619
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,009
It's an honor.

620
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,980
The first dance I'm going to show you...

621
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,579
is kinder polka.

622
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,318
"Kinder" means kids in German.

623
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,919
It means "kids' polka". So...

624
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,319
That's why the chocolate is named Kinder Joy.

625
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,229
So those who learn folk dance for the first time...

626
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,498
learn kinder polka first because it's the easiest.

627
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:18,159
- Kinder polka. - Kinder polka.

628

Please show us how to dance kinder polka.

You know, Jessi... I was here,

649
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,608
but she wanted to partner with Sang Yeob.

650
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,649
(Pushing him away)

651
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,019
I can't believe this.

652
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,119
Our fans need something to watch.

653
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
What...

654
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:16,659
It's just for polka!

655
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,319
Hurry up and pair up with Mi Joo.

656
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,989
Let's dance to the song. Get the music ready!

657
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,258
- The music. - Okay.

658
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,699
- I'm ready! - Play the music.

659
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
(The teachers are handling the problematic students.)

660
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,199
(Getting excited)

661
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,669
Wait, you're too much.

662
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,298
- It hasn't started yet. - Be quiet!

663
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,469
- She's too much for me. - Play the music louder!

664
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,308
(Stepping)

665
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,709
He's weird!

666
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,348
(Dizzy)

667
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:41,349
- Good job. - Once more.

668
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,518
(Ignoring the beat)

669
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,719
Jae Seok, keep your mouth shut!

670
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,788
- Stop! - Be quiet.

671
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:49,518
- Stop! - Stop!

672
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,660
They need to follow the music, but they're following your count.

673
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,029
- Stop counting. - Okay.

674
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,858
Follow the music.

675
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,528
- Don't follow his count. - Because he keeps counting,

676
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,199
I end up following his count.

677
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,229
Sir, when I get excited...

678
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,568
You need to follow the music. Keep quiet for a while.

679
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,140
You need to keep your mouth still?

680
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,869
Only speak when you shout "cool".

681
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,709
- We can still say "cool"? - Only speak when you say "cool".

682
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,609
Folk dancing has too many restrictions.

683
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,979
- Start with a bow. - Everyone, start with a bow.

684
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
- A bow? - Very good.

685
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,849
This... What are you doing?

686
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,389
Why did you step on my foot?

687
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,759
Did I? I was making a deep bow.

688
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,460
Be quiet.

689
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,498
Keep your mouth shut, Jae Seok.

690
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:34,329
(They hurriedly close their lips tight to hide their teeth.)

691
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,370
You're so cute.

692
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,839
(She makes a sound...)

693
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,039
(and quickly closes her mouth.)

694
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,409
(I'm watching you.)

695
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,579
One more time.

696
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,048
(Keeping their mouths shut is harder than dancing.)

697
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:48,380
You're good.

698
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,150
I want to move my mouth so bad.

699
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,819
Can I do this?

700
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,849
(If they endure it a bit longer, )

701
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,588
(the only moment they're allowed to speak will come.)

702
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:57,619
You're good.

703
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,759
(the only moment they're allowed to speak will come.)

704
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,159
You are cool.

705
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,829
- You're cool. - You're cool.

706
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:06,329
- You are cool. - You are cool.

707
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,768
- Bye. - Bye.

708
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,739
- Hello. - One more time.

709
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,639
(One thing she overlooked when pairing up with Sang Yeob)

710
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,009
Follow the rhythm.

711
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,210
One and two.

712
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,940
Don't move your legs like that! Move softly!

713
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,549
Softly!

714
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,348
(His dancing is worse than she thought.)

715
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,818
- No! - This is...

716
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:24,819
No.

717
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,519
(There are peaceful partners. On the other hand...)

718
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,359
You're too much!

719
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,660
(The back of her head is too much.)

720
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,329
- You are cool. - You are cool.

721
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:39,670
See you next time, get lost

722
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,098
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

723
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,568
- Did you tell me to get lost? - It's charming.

724
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,569
See you next time, get lost

725
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,880
Sang Yeob's such a bad dancer.

726
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,609
He's really bad at dancing.

727
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,078
(Shoveling dance)

728
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,410
He dances like this.

729
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,249
(He might get a call from "Anybody Can Dance".)

730
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,549
When I danced with Mi Joo,

731
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:03,690
I realized that she sure is a part of my family.

732
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,858
Her mouth...

733
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:07,859
It was because I was excited.

734
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,959
How is your mouth so similar...

735
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,028
- with mine? - No, it was because I was excited.

736
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,459
Seriously, her mouth...

737
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,470
(Mi Joo needs to check if any of her ancestors has the surname "Yu".)

738
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,199
This time, you'll learn the second dance.

739
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,470
- Okay. - The next dance.

740
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,539
It's called good night waltz.

741
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,538
- Good night waltz. - Good night waltz.

742
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,808
You dance this when you say goodbye...

743
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,939
- in a meeting. - I see.

744
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,909
- Bye. - Because it's a waltz,

745
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,248
- the song is in three-quarter time. - Okay.

746
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,490
Men, move your left foot first. Women, move your right foot first.

747
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,859
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

748
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,358
But look at my eyes.

749
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,629
Some look in front and some look down,

750
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,730
but check where I'm looking.

(He looks up when he steps forward.)

752

You look up when you step forward.

753
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,098
Move your chest up.

754
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,969
- Ready! - That's not it.

755

(Knock it off.)

- That's not it. - Ready!

That's not it.

758
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,479
Mi Joo, that's not it.

759
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,649
You're too much.

760
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,749
No?

(He demonstrates again with music.)

762
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,720
Increase the volume.

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,328
Four times like this.

My goodness. My mom sings like this at home.

768
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:23,400
She's like that when she sings a hymn.

769
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,470
She sings hymns every day.

770
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,939
Is this a hymn?

After four times, men turn right and women turn left.

In, out, in, in.

782

This is quite dangerous.

Since we demonstrated it for you, you can do it, right?

784

Don't worry.

789

You're right.

Are you sure this is his second life?

798
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,889
He's really like a teacher. Instead of a second life,

799
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,828
It looks like an extension of his first life.

800
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:22,160
It's an extension of his first.

801

- But now, - Yes.

802

I think he really was a principal.

We just need to find who's fake and who's real.

I'm sorry, but it feels like I'm his student.

You need to greet her.

Hello, nice to meet you,

Let's have lunch later...

812
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,059
His hat has slid back.

813
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,460
(It slid back as much as the students' level.)

814
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,159
You must be very tired.

815
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,169
(He's tearing up.)

816
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,139
- Think of what you want to say. - Goodbye.

817
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,268
What do you want to say?

818
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:06,139
- I love you. - That's good.

819

- Next. Me too. Next. - Me too.

820
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,169
- Your expression. - I love you.

821
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,440
- Yes. - I love you.

822
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,940
This is the last one, right?

823
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,049
- What do you want to say? - This place is fake.

824
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,619
It's not. What do you want to say?

825
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,220
I think it's fake too.

826
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,890
- From what I observed, - Yes.

827
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,518
You have a very clear sense of purpose.

828
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,758
Is he really a teacher? This is strange.

829
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,429
- He's a teacher, right? - He's a teacher.

830
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,159
- He's a teacher. - I do think he's a teacher.

831
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,429
- He's a teacher. - He's definitely a teacher.

832
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,430
- He's a teacher. - Now.

833
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:34,729
Let's dance to the music.

834
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,730
I'm tired.

835

- It's tangled here. - Let's dance to the music.

836

- Keep your mouths shut. - That's not it.

837
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,308
- Keep our mouths shut... - "Keep your mouths shut."

838
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:43,108
He said, "Keep your mouths shut." He really is a teacher.

839
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,139
I said "teacher" without realizing it.

840
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,839
"Keep your mouths shut!"

841
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,308
He's a teacher. "Keep your mouths shut"...

842
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,548
This is what real teachers say.

843
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,518
- "Keep your mouths shut!" - He's really a teacher.

844
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,849
- "Keep your mouths shut." - He's like my dad.

845
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,258
Mi Joo's dad is a teacher too,

846
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,659
- and she says he's like her dad. - Play the music!

847
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,329
- He's like my dad. - Good night waltz music.

848
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,430
- Speak only when you say goodbye. - Okay.

849
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,669
- You're so strict. It's hard. - But...

850
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,069
you said we'll feel happy when we do this.

851
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,268
He doesn't want us to speak.

852
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,139
- Don't speak and only say goodbye. - It's hard.

853
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,879
- It's so tough. - It's really tough. I'm tired.

- Get ready! - Let's go.

- This is the last time. - Sure.

I believe that he used to be a principal...

I think he is.

914

Seeing how he teaches,

915
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:12,889
he systematized everything like an actual dance teacher.

- But he used to be a principal. - Right.

Everyone's here. We're in the middle of shooting for Sixth Sense.

970
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,219
- Hello. - Sae Ho, what's up?

971
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,349
- Hello. - Hello.

972
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,989
Mi Joo and Ji Suk are here.

973
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,318
Ji Suk and I are acquainted.

974
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,020
- We are. - You can talk about that later.

975
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,059
- He just cut him off. - Hey.

976
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,390
We don't care.

977
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,028
Sae Ho, listen carefully.

978
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:33,059
Okay.

979
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,069
There's something that we want to eat.

980
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,438
Right now?

981
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:40,470
There's something that we want to eat, but we can't eat it.

982
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,310
What do you call that?

983
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,479
There's something you want to eat, but you can't have it?

984
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:48,680
But why are you asking me that?

985
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:53,080
Hey! Come on.

986
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:55,350
There's something you want to eat.

987
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,719
At times like that, we say something.

988
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,458
There's something you want, but you can't eat it.

989
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:00,990
"Hey, buy me some."

990
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,129
No.

991
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,759
Listen, Sae Ho.

992
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,369
What are you doing after waking me up in the morning?

993
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,700
(What are you doing after waking me up in the morning?)

994
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,569
He's clueless.

995
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,568
Sae Ho, just go back to sleep.

996
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,080
- Good night. - Go back to sleep.

997
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:18,639
All right. Good luck with filming.

998
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,048
- Bye. - All right. I'll call you later.

999
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:22,109
- Bye. - Okay, good luck with filming.

1000
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,548
- I'll try. - Okay.

1001
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:28,220
(Who could Na Ra be calling?)

1002
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,858
- Cutie. - Oh, my gosh. Do Hoon.

1003
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:33,929
- Cutie. - Wait.

1004
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,989
Who is that?

1005
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,359
- What did he say? - A Ram?

1006
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:39,798
- Is it Do Hoon? - Is it Do Hoon?

1007
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,298
- It's Do Hoon? - You're talking too much.

1008
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:43,338
I am?

1009
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:44,838
- Yes, Do Hoon. - Yes.

1010
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,369
This is the first time your voice is airing on TV.

1011
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,838
- My voice? - You know I'm filming Sixth Sense.

1012
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,739
My voice is being filmed right now?

1013
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,878
What? Yes, it is.

1014
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:55,779
- My voice is? - Yes.

1015
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,319
How do you feel?

1016
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,089
Me? Well, really? Hello, everyone.

1017
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:04,089
(He sounds shy but you can tell he's sociable.)

1018
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,520
What's with him?

1019
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:08,359
Sixth Sense viewers, am I fake?

1020
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,628
- Fake. - Did he wait for you to call?

1021
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:13,769
Did you guys plan this?

1022
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,869
- He was waiting for your call. - Did you guys plan it or what?

1023
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:20,469
(Sixth Sense viewers, I am real.)

1024
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,810
- You should speak with Jae Seok. - Really?

1025
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,139
Do Hoon, I'm so sorry.

1026
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,438
It's okay.

1027
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,008
I thought you were younger than me.

1028
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:30,349
I was so happy that you even called my name.

1029
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,119
I was really happy.

1030
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,589
What are you up to?

1031
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,219
I was on my way to the academy for my lessons.

1032
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,489
Oh, really?

1033
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,258
- So... - I finished washing the dishes.

1034
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:42,528
Why is he telling us that?

1035
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,528
Hold on. You talk too much.

1036
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,628
(Starting the game before he reveals other things)

1037
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:48,399
- Okay, Do Hoon. - Yes.

1038
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:51,369
You know how I'm good at singing and dancing?

1039
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,370
- I like being on stage. - Yes.

1040
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,438
- You do musicals. - Yes.

1041
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:57,309
Acting foolish and putting stuff on your head.

1042
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,739
No, you know how I'm good at singing, dancing,

1043
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,950
and acting, right?

1044
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,120
- Of course. - Yes, so what do you call that?

1045
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,349
- This is... - What is it to me?

1046
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,688
- What is it to me? - Something crazy.

1047
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:08,689
Something crazy?

1048
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,719
(Trying to look calm)

1049
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,789
Not something crazy.

1050
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,358
Singing and dancing on stage...

1051
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,559
is this to me.

1052
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,429
It's natural to you.

1053
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,898
- That's good. - Yes.

1054
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:19,159
That's a good approach.

1055
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,228
- A good approach. - Nice.

1056
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:24,199
But if you say that in a more educated way...

1057
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,668
- "In a more educated way." - Yes, in a more educated way.

1058
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,809
In an old-fashioned and educated way.

1059
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,778
That's this. That's this to Na Ra.

1060
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,278
It's too easy.

1061
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:34,548
- Yes, that's right. - In an educated way.

1062
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:36,249
- Yes, it is. - Yes, but...

1063
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,119
- Okay, you're getting closer. - How is he going to get it?

1064
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,220
Say it in an educated way and make it longer.

1065
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,019
- Being on stage is... - Yes.

1066
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,688
- a part of my daily life? - Yes.

1067
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:49,128
- "A part of my daily life." - A saying. It's a saying.

1068
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:51,059
- A saying. - A saying?

1069
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,870
- I... This is... - Yes.

1070
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:55,830
A piece of cake!

1071

- Hang up! - She told him off.

1072

Hang up!

1073
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,008
- Gosh, Do Hoon. - Hang up.

1074
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,878
I can tell what kind of a life he lives.

1075

"A piece of cake!"

(I hope you guys make up with each other.)

Should I call my mom?

1078
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,989
- Yes, call your mom. - But wait. My mom...

1079
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,818
speaks carelessly.

1080

- It's okay. - Then it will be fun.

1081
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:19,589
Okay.

(The smaller the chili, the hotter it is.)

1083

"The smaller the chili, the hotter it is." How do I explain this?

But why did you have to choose this one?

1085

- I know. - I know, right?

1086
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:29,970
Gosh.

1087
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:31,899
- Hello? - Mom.

1088

Yes, what's the matter?

Mom, I'm filming Sixth Sense right now.

Jae Seok is next to me. I'll hand him the phone.

- Hello. - Oh, my. Hello.

1092
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,619
Goodness, I should say hi to you in person,

1093
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,349
but I'm calling you.

1094

No, it's okay. It's nice to call you too.

1095
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,418
I should be the one going to you.

1096
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:52,220
- No, it's... - What do you mean? He's busy.

(What do you mean? He's busy.)

1098

00:40:57,029 --> 00:40:58,200
I mean...

(Doesn't give him the chance to say hello)

1101

00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,239
- Of course. I understand. - Mom.

1103

If you get this... You just need to guess this, okay?

1104
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,640
I eat this every morning.

1105
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,979
- Really? - Yes.

1106
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:13,979
It's green.

1107
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:16,509
- It's green? - And there are many sizes.

1108
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:18,220
Wait.

1109
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:20,189
Hold on.

1110

- That's not it. - What?

1111
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,918
She's making me feel anxious.

1112
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,919
Gosh, this is making me sweat.

1113
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:27,429
But you know this...

1114
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,798
because I dip this in gochujang every morning.

1115
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:33,569
- It's chili pepper. - Yes, that's right.

1116
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,898
- But... - But I tell you not to eat it...

1117
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:37,798
because it hurts your stomach.

1118
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,008
But there's a saying.

1119

There's something I say.

1120

Yes, chili pepper.

00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,809
(She's right but this situation is funny.)

1122
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,149
Why don't you try a different proverb?

1123
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:52,349
- Try a different one. - Okay.

1124
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,818
Okay, then.

1125

00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,890
Excuse me!

1283
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:02,989
That voice by Mi Joo is so cute.

1284
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,290
You're clearing the air.

1285
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,589
Where are they?

1286
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,059
She's so pretty.

1287
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,989
- Where is she? - She looks really young.

1288
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,528
- Hello. - Hello.

1289
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:13,829
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

1290
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,330
She does seem somewhat familiar.

1291
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,770
(Anchors relay the news with perfect pronunciation.)

1292
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,080
(This anchor has dropped her mic.)

1293
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,379
(She now operates a jokbal restaurant.)

1294
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:31,949
Hello.

1295
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,418
I was working as a freelance anchor,

1296
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:36,789
and currently operate a jokbal restaurant.

1297
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,560
My name is Gui Hwa and I will be living my second life.

1298
00:48:39,819 --> 00:48:43,358
In 2014, I started working at a station...

1299
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,330
called the Korean Regional Broadcast and worked freelance for 5 years.

1300
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,599
(Why did you quit being an anchor?)

1301
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,969
The reason I wanted to leave reporting...

1302
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,338
was because I didn't have a steady income,

1303
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,409
And I think I was experiencing burnout.

1304
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,739
So that's why I quit working as an anchor...

1305
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,180
and chose this role instead.

1306
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:02,949
I can't say I have no regrets.

1307
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,679
But there is the occasional patron...

1308
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,389
who compliments what I'm doing.

1309
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:10,489
When they say things like, "The food tastes great."

1310
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,688
That boosts my confidence,

1311
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:14,330
and leads to immense satisfaction.

1312
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,188
Right. In terms of sales figures,

1313
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:20,930
the monthly average is around the 60,000 dollar mark.

1314
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,540
(Know-how from a popular restaurant applying it to a quiet neighborhood)

1315
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,438
Sixth Sense,

1316
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:30,439
is this place real?

1317
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:37,209
She does give off anchor vibes.

1318
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,619
(Dazed)

1319
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,819
She's definitely first

1320
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,250
It's perfect.

1321
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,918
You've been roped in!

1322
00:49:43,919 --> 00:49:45,319
(She has the perfect image for an anchor.)

1323
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:50,329
If you're not particularly interested in jokbal,

1324
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,929
- it's a difficult food to choose. - It feels a little detached.

1325
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,659
It's also very hands-on.

1326
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,568
That's right. I didn't decide at first glance.

1327
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:58,838
While working for the regional broadcast,

1328
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:01,568
one of these friends introduced me to a jokbal restaurant owner.

1329
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:03,539
I befriend the owner of the jokbal restaurant...

1330
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,079
I started with their recommendation.

1331
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,179
I was a little hesitant at first but gained confidence later.

1332
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,080
Which led me to operate this store.

1333
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:13,049
"Hesitant."

1334
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,918
Her pronunciation is perfect.

1335
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,289
(She seems increasingly like an anchor.)

1336
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,160
- She has a great voice. - She's so calm.

1337
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,330
(Was she really an anchor in a past life?)

1338
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,159
So people talk about front foot or back foot when ordering jokbal.

1339
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,599
- That's right. - What's the difference?

1340
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,899
(What is the difference between front and back feet?)

1341
00:50:30,129 --> 00:50:32,568
That was a good question.

1342
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:34,839
(Let's see how well you answer.)

1343
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:37,008
A lot of people are curious about this.

1344
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:40,609
Front feet and back feet are a little different in size.

1345
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:43,750
There is more meat on the back foot.

1346
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:47,378
The back foot, simply put, is quite lean.

1347
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,188
It has almost no fat.

1348
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:50,619
(The lean back foot has the texture of chicken breast.)

1349
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,989
The front foot has an even spread of fat.

1350
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,499
It has that chewy texture that everyone loves.

1351
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,859
So that's the more common order.

1352
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,999
Ma'am, do you think we could sample the jokbal?

1353
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,568
- Yes. - All right. Please prepare it.

1354
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:06,600
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1355
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,668
It seems real.

1356
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:08,938
She's fearless.

1357
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:10,609
She's such a great speaker.

1358
00:51:10,709 --> 00:51:12,208
What do you think? Does she seem like an anchor?

1359
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:14,180
I'm not sure.

1360
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,648
She seems a little like a home shopping host.

1361
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:19,779
I thought about that too.

1362
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:23,719
They're so well-prepared nowadays.

1363
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,319
- That's right. - It makes it so hard to choose...

1364
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,689
after meeting the owners.

1365
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:29,989
I accidentally touched Jae Seok's bottom...

1366
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,299
because I thought it was a phone.

1367
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,128
So you touched his bottom?

1368
00:51:34,129 --> 00:51:35,398
She touched Jae Seok's bottom?

1369
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:36,798
I thought this was sticking out.

1370
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,270
She just poked it slightly.

1371
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:42,409
I thought it was my phone.

1372
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,008
It would be ridiculous to poke even if it was the phone.

1373
00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:46,679
It's not a bad feeling, right?

1374
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,679
We're basically brothers.

1375
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,319
We're not brothers. You view me as a woman.

1376
00:51:51,379 --> 00:51:53,378
(What is that punk Hyun Ju saying?)

1377
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:54,990
If we were brothers...

1378
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,119
She thought it was her cellphone.

1379
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,490
It was sticking out.

1380
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,490
(Peeking)

1381
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:03,990
There's someone else working in the kitchen.

1382
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,858
(There's someone else in the kitchen with the owner.)

1383
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:07,099
- But... - I don't know.

1384
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,600
I'm suspicious about there being more kitchen staff.

1385
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,669
She can't do it all alone.

1386
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,470
(The restaurant is too large to handle alone.)

1387
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,978
Even so.

1388
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:19,979
(I'm still suspicious)

1389

(Does she play another role to support the owner's ruse?)

1390
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:26,950
The game we'll play here...

1391
00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:28,619
is the color relay.

1392
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,059
- Color? - A color

1393
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,588
Color.

1394
00:52:32,589 --> 00:52:34,958
Yes, colors.

1395
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:37,129
Do you know all the colors of the rainbow?

1396
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:40,429
Yes.

1397
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,129
Why aren't you answering her?

1398
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,739
You're the one who started it. Why aren't you responding?

1399
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,939
Yes.

1400
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,439
- How cute. - Are you a dolphin?

1401
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:50,739
This is how to play.

1402
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,309
"Color relay starts now."

1403
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,779
Green, blue, purple.

1404
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,648
- Horse. - Sky.

1405
00:52:57,649 --> 00:52:58,649
Banana.

1406
00:52:58,650 --> 00:52:59,950
Red, yellow, yellow.

- Chili. - Gingko.

Gingko.

1409
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,588
- This is hard. - You can't double up on words.

1410
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:07,589
This is hard.

1411
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,229
(1 point for each successful run, the team with more points wins)

1412
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,899
- Okay. - Oh, my gosh.

1413
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:14,028
We can do this.

1414
00:53:14,029 --> 00:53:15,369
But don't go too fast.

1415
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,399
- It's fine. - What's fine?

1416
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,470
- Okay! - Here we go.

Red, yellow, yellow.

00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,778
- Tteokbokki. - Banana.

Pickled radish.

1421
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,049
This is how you do it.

1422
00:53:29,149 --> 00:53:30,549
They've passed.

1423
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,580
Yellow, blue, yellow.

1424
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,990
The color yellow. Forsythia.

1425
00:53:37,149 --> 00:53:40,319
Jae Seok, just exempt yourself from the game.

1426
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,390
He said "the color yellow" for yellow.

1427
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,229
- We did really well just then. - Yes, really well.

1428
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:48,369
I'm not good at these kinds of games.

1429
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,939
You're just not good at games, Jae Seok.

1430
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,869
"He can't play this game."

1431
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,769
You're the worst, Jae Seok.

1432
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,208
- I'll do it this time. - He'll improve.

1433
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:57,679
- It's too late now. - They're so noisy.

1434
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,709
Let's go.

1435
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,009
Color relay starts now

1436
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:04,580
Red, yellow, purple

1437

Jjamppong.

1438
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:07,749
- Forsythia. - Grapes.

1439
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,390
It's too slow!

1440

Yoo.

for SBS mobile contents.

1969

Then I got a call from TV Chosun,

1970
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:35,848
and I worked there for about two years.

1971
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:38,959
I worked on "Mr. Trot", "Miss Trot 2",

"Romantic Call Center", and "PPONG School".

I was in charge of online promotions.

1974
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:48,259
Ever since I was young, I'd have precognitive dreams,

1975
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,999
and I was very intuitive.

While I was working as a producer,

I kept messing things up at some point.

but I came here about three years ago for a shoot.

I moved here.

Back in January.

(Did the owner really change or is it still used for shoots?)

1993
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:35,549
So did you get possessed all of a sudden?

1994
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,580
Yes.

1995
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,580
Did you have that quality before?

1996
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,879
I had the quality since I was young.

1997
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,050
My grandmother was a shaman.

1998
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:48,489
After she passed away,

1999
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:50,460
it influenced me a lot more.

2000
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:53,059
I don't know much about the topic,

2001
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,999
but I was told that shamans who recently got possessed...

2002
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,799
are a lot stronger.

2003
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,039
- That's what I heard too. - Right?

2004
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,768
Aren't you the strongest now?

2005
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:02,138
We don't really know about this.

2006
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:04,808
It's because when you're a baby shaman,

2007
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:06,978
you don't know if it's a ghost or a deity telling you something,

2008
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:08,949
so you just say everything you see.

2009
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,678
So from a regular person's perspective,

2010
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:12,379
they think they're very accurate.

2011
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:15,590
There are pros and cons since you might say something you shouldn't.

2012
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,619
What's the difference between what ghosts say and what deities say?

2013
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,159
- All of a sudden? - All of a sudden?

2014
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,619
(She suddenly gets polite.)

2015
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,159
My gosh. I thought you were running out at her.

2016
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,159
Real divination is called ancestral divination.

2017
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,499
That means...

2018
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,098
that I can see the ancestors...

2019
01:15:31,099 --> 01:15:32,968
of the person who came to see me.

2020

(She doesn't understand.)

2021
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,239
Most people think...

2022
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,568
that the deity I serve is the one who gives me information.

2023
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:40,808
But in actuality, like the name ancestral divination suggests,

2024
01:15:40,809 --> 01:15:43,278
the guest's ancestor comes to me...

2025
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,579
and tells me about their family.

2026
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,549
Then do you see our ancestors?

2027
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:50,219
If I focus I probably can.

2028
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:55,889
- I'm not sure about this. - They think it's the deity I serve.

2029
01:15:57,229 --> 01:15:59,559
What kind of deity do you serve?

2030
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,898
My great-grandmother...

2031
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:04,369
is my immortal grandmother.

2032
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,468
What does that mean?

2033
01:16:05,469 --> 01:16:07,639
Immortal grandmother means she's the biggest one.

(When an ancestor who served the deities becomes one.)

2035

01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,858
we look at what kind of house you came out of on what type of rope.

2071
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:43,200
(I see.)

2072
01:17:44,569 --> 01:17:48,269
(This isn't scientifically proven. It's a matter of personal opinion.)

2073
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:53,339
(As they watch her focus, )

2074
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,409
(the Sixth Sensers are also entranced and immersed.)

2075
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,249
I'm not sure if it's your grandfather.

2076
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,478
But I keep seeing an old man...

2077
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:02,888
who used to stand in front of people...

2078
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:05,318
and teach them things or give lectures.

2079
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:08,188
If it were the old days, he might've had a village school...

2080
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:09,728
where he taught people.

2081
01:18:09,729 --> 01:18:12,858
There's someone who likes to stand in front of others and talk.

2082
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:14,558
In some ways this means...

2083
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:17,669
that you would have a prosperous career at a company...

2084
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:20,369
and keep moving up the ranks.

2085
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:23,469
But it's mixed with your mother's side.

2086
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,039
- Really? - Yes.

2087
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,138
You wanted to talk to more people...

2088
01:18:27,139 --> 01:18:29,148
and see more people.

2089
01:18:29,149 --> 01:18:31,710
That combination is what lead you to this profession.

2090
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:36,120
It seems real.

2091
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,920
(What is this? Is it real?)

2092
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,058
- I'll let you in on something. - Okay.

2093
01:18:42,059 --> 01:18:43,490
Your family will never go bankrupt.

2094
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:45,359
- My family? - Yes.

2095
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,460
Your son is just like you.

2096
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,029
- Ji Ho? - Yes.

2097
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:54,669
He's just like his dad. So whenever you look at him,

2098
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:57,808
you think, "He's exactly like me. What am I going to do with him?"

2099
01:18:57,809 --> 01:18:58,969
That's true.

2100
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,308
Make sure you push him to study.

2101
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:02,580
- Study? - Yes.

2102
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:04,149
He doesn't do his homework.

2103
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:06,679
(Laughing)

2104
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,549
(She fails to hold in her laughter, and she shakes her bells.)

2105
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,648
What is this?

2106
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:12,819
What?

2107
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,688
Maybe she's embarrassed...

2108
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,058
- because this was all planned. - That must be it.

2109
01:19:16,059 --> 01:19:18,830
Right? It's because she's faking it.

2110
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,960
What's interesting is that your second child is just like her mom.

2111
01:19:22,059 --> 01:19:23,728
- She is. - She's the same.

2112
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:25,699
When I say she's the same,

2113
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,068
I mean she has her mother's blood.

2114
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:29,768
- The blood of her mother's side. - Really?

2115
01:19:29,769 --> 01:19:31,468
Yes, so with that in mind,

2116
01:19:31,469 --> 01:19:34,438
let her mom raise her how she wants and don't get involved.

2117
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:37,579
If you leave her, she'll grow up well.

2118
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,848
Ji Ho takes after me a lot,

2119
01:19:39,849 --> 01:19:42,619
and Na Eun takes after Kyung Eun.

2120
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,550
Just based on their behaviors.

2121
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:47,219
Isn't she a good actress if this is all fake?

2122
01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:50,229
(Is she real?)

2123
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,290
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

2124
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:53,699
Right. Thank you.

2125
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,759
(Jae Seok's done.)

2126
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,829
This is...

2127
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,029
How was it?

2128
01:19:57,269 --> 01:20:00,568
There was a slight change to how she was...

2129
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:02,399
when we talked earlier.

2130
01:20:02,609 --> 01:20:04,539
(Before, she giggled like a girl.)

2131
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,479
(When she was doing the divination, she was very serious.)

2132
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:11,880
(Is she really a former producer turned shaman?)

2133
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,549
- Ji Suk. - Right.

2134
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,579
Ji Suk.

2135
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,920
He wanted to do it.

2136
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:22,359
(He's excited about this.)

2137
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,899
(He might be a bit scared too.)

2138
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,039
I'll tell you something.

2139
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,839
You keep coming up in the middle.

2140
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,879
If I were to compare it to gender,

2141
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,950
you have both feminine and masculine qualities.

2142
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:47,479
- What? Wait. - Hold on...

2143
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:48,848
I have masculine and feminine qualities?

2144
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:50,149
Yes.

2145
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:51,789
I think I know what she means.

2146
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:54,619
He seems like a manly man, but it's an act.

2147
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,388
Inside, he's like a little boy.

2148
01:20:57,389 --> 01:20:59,058
No, I'm not like that!

2149
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:00,398
- I'm not like that. - A little.

2150
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:01,428
No.

2151
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:04,199
- He's very feminine inside. - He's sensitive.

2152
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,499
He pretends to be tough.

2153
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,040
He pretends to be tough on the outside.

2154
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:09,039
The reason I told you this...

2155
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,268
is because you're at an important crossroads...

2156
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:14,938
and you must decide which roles to play and what to do.

2157
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:17,050
But you keep coming up in the middle.

2158
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,149
Does that mean I have a lot of options?

2159
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:22,649
Don't play any characters that are too impactful.

2160
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,819
Something that has a clear color.

2161
01:21:25,689 --> 01:21:29,159
You keep coming up as not this nor this.

2162
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,228
That's why I told you you keep coming up in the middle.

2163
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:35,699
I've always wanted to play a character with a strong impact.

2164
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,700
- Really? - Yes.

2165
01:21:36,701 --> 01:21:38,899
She said you shouldn't play those roles.

2166
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:42,539
You have to go with others to succeed.

2167
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,568
If you try to stand out alone...

2168
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:47,409
or you try to hard to succeed on your own,

2169
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:49,278
you'll have a hard time.

2170
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,179
But that's true.

2171
01:21:51,349 --> 01:21:53,379
All the projects where I was part of a group did well.

2172
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,749
Like "The Slave Hunters" and "Take Off."

2173
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:58,119
All the ones that I was a part of a group...

2174
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,419
did well with viewership.

2175
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,259
- Also... - You won't fail with that.

2176
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,859
Who's the cross?

2177
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,389
- The cross? - Yes.

2178
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,899
My entire family is Christian.

2179
01:22:07,929 --> 01:22:09,728
- You have a cross on your forehead. - I do?

2180
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:11,500
- Yes. - That's true.

2181
01:22:12,269 --> 01:22:14,239
You have a cross on your forehead?

2182
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,210
- No, I don't. - Of course he doesn't.

2183
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:18,269
I don't. It's clean.

2184
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,779
Right.

2185
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,848
- But your father was... - Yes.

2186
01:22:23,849 --> 01:22:26,379
My father was a pastor.

2187
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,718
Really?

2188
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:28,880
Can she see it?

2189
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,619
(Did she see Ji Suk's religion with her ability?)

2190
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,260
(Or did the production crew tell us?)

2191
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:36,359
(Is this place real?)

2192
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:38,959
Ma'am. Jessi's contract...

2193
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,398
is over soon too.

2194
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:42,728
She has two weeks left. Can you take a look?

2195
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:44,200
If she'll move to a new company?

2196
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:45,969
Have you received any calls?

2197
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:47,438
I'm getting many calls.

2198
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:49,438
- You haven't chosen one yet? - No.

2199
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:50,769
- Not yet? - No.

2200
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,109
Does she always talk casually and politely?

2201
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:55,608
(No, Jessi.)

2202
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:58,010
It depends on the deity.

2203
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,678
I didn't know.

2204
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,519
(She almost had a fight with a shaman.)

2205
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:04,950
(Laughing)

2206
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:06,260
That was cute.

2207
01:23:07,819 --> 01:23:09,760
That was a new approach.

2208
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,490
You need to listen to what your friends say.

2209
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,528
I do.

2210
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:18,129
When you mentioned moving to a new agency,

2211
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:20,769
I was told, "Whatever. Just go."

2212
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,039
(When you're making an important decision, )

(Embarrassed)

2217
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,849
Antenna has so many applicants.

Everyone. No.

- It won't work. - I knew it.

2223
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,598
"I knew it."

2224

If she joins us, will there be a fight?

2225

You need to go somewhere...

2226

free and gives you freedom.

2227
