Ah! The weather is so lovely!

5
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,491
Yes, it's a good day to go hiking.

6
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,618
Take off your sunglasses
before you fall on your face.

7
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,535
Okay.

8
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,120
-Hey, In-sook.
-Yeah?

9
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,706
Your skin looks flawless today.

10
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,458
-You think so? Oh!
-Yes.

11
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,627
I guess my Botox injections
are finally working their magic.

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,253
Wait, you had Botox? Where?

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,547
-On my frown lines, my smile lines...
-And?

14
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,299
and pretty much everywhere.

15
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,468
-I don't approve of it.
-Why not?

16
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,929
-It just seems too artificial to me.
-[In-sook chuckles]

17
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,015
What's most beautiful
is getting old naturally.

-I'm just respecting my skin.

20
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,772

is all about respect.

-[Jae-sook] Yes?

23
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,153
Did you do something to your face too?
You're glowing.

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,698
I did a prune juice cleanse yesterday.

[shouting]

26
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,120
I guess it was effective, though.

27
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,205
-It was.
-My goodness.

28
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,832
I can't control my sphincter.

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,292
What did you eat yesterday?

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,877
-Prune juice.
-Prune juice!

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,295
I can relate.

32
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,839
I was looking at myself in the mirror

33
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,924
and saw that my buttocks
looked like squashed tofu.

34
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,717
They used to look like peaches, you know?

35
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,219
-They were.
-I'm so upset.

36
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,012
That's why we have to work out at our age.

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,515
That's why we're going hiking, right?

38
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,225
[In-sook] I'm not talking about hiking.

39
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,269
-What then?
-Squeeze and release.

40
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,354
-I can't do it well.
-What are you doing?

41
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,314

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,108
-I'm off.
-[In-sook] Kegel exercises.

Hey!

47
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,408
That smells!

{\an8}My goodness. I can't believe you.

54
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,467
{\an8}Oh my, Mi-sook.
Did you buy a new hiking outfit?

55
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,887
{\an8}-Wow.
-The color is so pretty!

56
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,723
{\an8}Yes, I guess my taste changed with age.

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,099
{\an8}I love red clothes now.

58
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,518
{\an8}It's not a matter of taste but science.

59
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,354
{\an8}As we age,
changes in the retinal microvasculature

60
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,399
{\an8}make it harder for us to perceive
colors with short wavelengths like blue,

61
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:15,153
{\an8}as opposed to colors with long wavelengths
such as the color red.

62
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,364
{\an8}It must be nice to be so knowledgeable.

63
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,075
This is made out of functional fabric.
You know "Core-Tex"?

64
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,871
You mean "Gore-Tex," right?
Not "Core-Tex."

65
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,082
That's right.
It was just a slip of the tongue.

66
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,252
My daughter sent it to me from the U.S.
It's really expensive.

67
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,421
-It looks expensive.
-It really does.

68
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,048
Seok-ryu is a wonderful daughter.

69
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,382
She's right.

70
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,550
Mm-hm.

71
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,845
I don't feel comfortable
receiving gifts that my son bought

72
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,971
with his hard-earned money.

73
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,307
As if he ever gave you anything.

74
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,436
I don't place much value
on such material things.

75
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,316
The fact that my son, Seung-hyo, exists
is a gift in itself.

76
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,985
[chuckles]
Are you saying my daughter isn't?

77
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,238
I didn't want to mention it
to avoid bragging,

78
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,783
but Seung-hyo
recently met with the president.

79
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,911
He designed a library that won an award
at an architecture competition,

80
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,454
so the president personally came to visit

81
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,624
and praised it as a superb model
of a public facility.

82
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,209
Seung-hyo is so impressive.

83
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,710
[Hye-sook] Of course. [chuckles]

84
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,462
Listen, guys.

85
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,173
Do you know who the second richest person
in the world is?

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,217
-I do. It's Jaden Becker.
-[In-sook] Right.

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,677
The CEO of Greip?

88
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,930
Not everyone in the world will know
who the president of South Korea is,

89
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,308
but everyone knows Jaden Becker.
Every Friday night,

he and Seok-ryu
shoot the breeze over some beer.

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,606
It's all because she works in
the most prestigious company in the world

92
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,733
after graduating from a top university
in the U.S.

93

of his class at Hanguk University.

that Seung-hyo</i>

<i>but my son does exactly that.</i>

109

Hey, Seok-ryu is a gift from heaven.

110
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,073
You know what I dreamed about
when I became pregnant with her?

111
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,951
-I was...
-You were in a rainbow-colored paradise

112
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,578
-and found a huge tree there.
-Yes.

113
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,414
You were entranced by it
and saw a juicy pomegranate.

114
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,416
So you picked it
and got pregnant with Seok-ryu.

115
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,501
-I memorized it all.
-Thanks.

116
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,837
That sounds like some fairytale.
As for Seung-hyo...

117
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,590
As for Seung-hyo,
you got assigned to work in France

118
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,550
without knowing you were pregnant.

119
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,595
And you dreamed about a blue dragon
rising out of the Seine.

120
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,221
-You remember all that?
-[In-sook laughs]

121
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,808
That's some extravagant founding myth
you have there.

122
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,393
-Let me tell you...
-Unbelievable.

123
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,980
Those two won't stop
talking about the same things.

124
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,107
It's driving me crazy.

125
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,319
They just want to brag
about their successful children.

126
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,238
Who do you think will win today?

127
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
-Hye-sook.
-Why her?

128
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,826
Because she's a diplomat
and can be persuasive?

129
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,496
No, because Seung-hyo
is receiving another award today.

CHOI SEUNG-HYO
CEO, REGISTERED ARCHITECT

143
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,097
You want to design a memorial park?

144
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,682
Yes.

145
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,475
But why did you ask me to see me?

146
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,562
I have visited
many funeral homes for research,

147
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,148
but I don't think I've interviewed
any of the workers.

148
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,026
I heard that you've worked
as a funeral director for 20 years.

149
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,278
Has it been that long?

150
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,448
In all my years doing this job,

151
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,367
I've never had anyone
ask to interview me before.

152
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,869
I see.

153
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,539
I want to do a good job.

154
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,207
A proper job

155
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
with sincerity.

156
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,506
I don't know how much help I'd be.

157
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
Just tell me what you honestly felt

158
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,428
while working on this job.

159
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,434
To tell you the truth,
my mother passed away not long ago.

160
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm sorry for your loss.

161
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,357
Everyone has to go through it
sooner or later.

162
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,069
But it was a comfort to me

163
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,031
that I could send her off beautifully
with my own two hands.

164
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm sure your mother was glad to know

165
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,577
that her daughter
was there to see her off.

166
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,578
I agree.

167
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,456
That is why

168
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,251
I want people to visit
with a sense of gladness as well.

169
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,472
Memorial parks don't always have to be
so solemn and sad.

170
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,183
The people resting here were once alive.

171
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,228
They are all beloved friends
and family members.

172
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,280
What if we build
a Shelter for Memories in the lobby?

173
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,535
It would look like
a small library or a café.

174
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,705
We'd fill it up with things
that the departed used to love,

175
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,249
like books and music.

176
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,460
So the people who are visiting
their loved ones can reminisce.

177
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,587
Of course they'd be sad,

178
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,550
but I want their tears to be
interspersed with warm smiles too.

179
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,801
I love it.

180
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,681
-How did you come up with such an idea?
-[cell phone buzzing]

181
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:17,932
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,268
I have to take this.

183
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,689
Hello.

184
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,401
I can't really talk right now, Myung-woo.

185
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,654
[Myung-woo] <i>Where the heck are you?
The awards ceremony is starting soon!</i>

186
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
I'll be right there.

00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,826
[crowd applauding]

188
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,036
Through a design that harmonizes
with the environment...

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,664
Aw, it's almost Seung-hyo's turn
to go up on stage.

190
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,166
Did he say he'll make it in time?

191
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,044
What are you doing?

192
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,048
I mean, I'm the co-CEO
of Architectural Firm Atelier In,

193
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,134
so I should accept the award in his stead.

194
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,596
[man] Next, we will announce
the winner of the Creative Award.

195
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,763
Oh, no.

196
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,933
The Creative Award
for the 2024 Magazine Awards

197
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,727

Choi Seung-hyo.

200
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,693
-I'll be back.
-Wait, no.

201
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,445
-What?
-What?

202
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,196
-Hey, Myung-woo.
-Seung-hyo!

203
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,990
-I'm not late, right?
-Right.

204
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,826
Ah, look who's finally here.

205
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,494
The star got here just in time.

206
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,205
[Na-yoon] With a face like that,
he has to be a star.

[cameras clicking]

210
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,597
Thank you.

211
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,311
I told him to prepare
an acceptance speech beforehand.

212
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,979
He should've spoken longer

213
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,106
for the cameras to capture his beauty
from all angles.

214
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,318
Hey! Our name!
You forgot to mention our name!

215
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,823
I'm from the architectural firm,
Atelier In.

216
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,784

00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:14,131
[Hye-sook] Yelling "yahoo" at the top
of a mountain is so old-fashioned.

220
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,384
Who cares if it's old-fashioned?

221
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm respecting the mountain.

222
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,512
You'll get reported to the police.

223
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,098
Who's going to report me? You?

224
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,059
[Jae-sook]
Those two are still going at it.

225
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,145
They're wasting energy
fighting and making up all the time.

226
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,271
I know, right?

227
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,356
Hey.

228
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,109
I have something for you guys.

229
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,111
-[In-sook] What?
-[Jae-sook] What is it?

230
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,487
Seok-ryu's wedding invitation?

231
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,948
Wow, look at this.

232
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
I held off giving them to you

233
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,994
because I wanted to present them
in a special place.

234
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,705
Why did you print the invitations
when the wedding will be held in the U.S.?

235
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
I didn't want to miss out on anything.

236
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,627
Look at this. It's so beautiful.

237
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,756
You must be so happy
that your daughter's getting married.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,300
You now have a weight off your shoulders!

239
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,468
That's right.

240
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,890
When will I get my loser daughter
out of my house?

241
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,393
-[Mi-sook] Mo-eum will find someone soon.
-She will.

242
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,813
Oh, right. Is Seung-hyo
going out with anyone these days?

243
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,065
-No, he's way too busy.
-[In-sook] I see.

244
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,402
That's just an excuse.
Even busy people can find time to date.

245
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,530
Seok-ryu managed to find someone
even though she was so busy.

246
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,575
I told you that my son-in-law
is an international lawyer, right?

247
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,868
-Hey.
-[Mi-sook] It's so pretty.

248
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,911
Women are lining up to meet my son.

249
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,455
Is that so?

250
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,207
The minister and the director
of my husband's hospital

251
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,544
both keep begging me
to introduce their daughters to him.

252
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,714
Say that again when you have
your own wedding invitations to give out.

253

[In-sook & Jae-sook chuckling]

254
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,218
Gosh. My legs fell asleep.

255
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,179
And victory goes to Na Mi-sook.

256
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,099
The wedding is only a month away.

257
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,434

We're about to land, ma'am.

Could you open your window shade
and straighten your seat, please?

263
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,328
Excuse me.

Oh, I'm sorry.

266
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,509
I should be the one to apologize.
I startled you.

267
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,930
No, it's just that I was dreaming
about getting beaten up.

268
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,557
My goodness. What a nightmare.

269
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,518
Or it could be an omen.

Wow.

277
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,359
Seeing your face makes me feel like
I'm really back, Mo-eum.

278
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,277
You.

279
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,530
Do you know how startled I was
when you said you were at the airport?

280
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,198
I didn't even get to wash up!

281
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,533
I can see that.

282
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,911
Did you miss me so much
to rush over with soot on your face?

283
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
Good grief.

284
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,832
You've become so slimy
after all those years in the U.S.

285

I know.

286
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,211
I felt it was over the top
even as I was saying it.

287
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,839
Still, it's been years
since we've seen each other.

288
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,799
Don't pretend you're not happy to see me.

I almost hurt myself.

298
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,674
I'm teaching you
to be cautious at all times.

299
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,260
Sticking your head out like that
is dangerous.

300
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,555
Aw. You sounded like
a real paramedic just now.

301
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,223
That's because I really am.

302
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,391
Exactly.

00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,730
Where's the girl I used to know
who'd jump off fences wearing a cape?

304
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,065
I liked that girl.

305
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,944
It's thanks to kids like that
that I get a paycheck.

306
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,862
What was I thinking back then?

307
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,615
Were you near a fire?

308
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,953
Yes. Paramedics accompany
firefighters to the site.

309
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,287
No one died, at least.

310
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,538
That's good.

00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,624
By the way,

00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,250
why are you so skinny?

00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,338
Are you losing weight
for your wedding day?

314
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,174
I'm killing it, right?
This jawline could cut you.

315
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,511
Could you avoid using
dangerous words like "kill" or "cut"?

316
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,346
It's making me antsy.

317
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,430
[in English] Sorry.

318
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,807
Did you call your mom?

00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,394
My mom didn't tell me
you were coming back home.

320
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645
[in Korean] Sure I did.

321
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,856
Of course you did. What about Seung-hyo?

322
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,233
He must be busy anyway.

323
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,485
How is he anyway?

324
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,404

You forgot to say my name
in your acceptance speech.

327
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,662
I did.

328
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,124
No, you just mentioned the company's name
and not mine!

329
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,711
I can tell from the color of your suit
that you visited another memorial park.

330
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,670
Yes.

331
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,297
-[Myung-woo] Did you take a compass?
-No.

332
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,592
Yeah, right. You can't deceive me.

333
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,470
You're an architect,
not a feng-shui master!

334
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,805
It's part of an architect's job

335
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,683
to learn about the cultural
and historical context of a space.

336
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,519
-Ah.
-Don't you know about gravesite feng shui,

00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,604

-[camera clicking]
-[Na-yoon] You're absolutely right.

Put that camera away.

340
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,696
I can visit a hundred memorial parks
as long as I'm with you.

341
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,948
If you want, I can get buried with you.

342
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,241
No, thank you.

343
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,160
Come on, don't be shy.

344
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,995
I'm scared. I think she means it.

345
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,121
Yes, me too.

346
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,299
[gasps] Hey, it's Roh Yoon-seo!

347
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,925
Do you know her?

348
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,845
-[Na-yoon] How do you know her?
-I don't really know her.

349
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,681
We met briefly
at Oblique's launching ceremony.

350
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,309
Amazing! Let's go say hello to her!

351
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,311
I have to go now. I'm busy.

352
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,438
Hey, where do you think you're going?

353
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,273
She's Roh Yoon-seo,

354
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,567
the woman whom every young man
considers perfect!

355
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,610
You can't leave!

356
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,071
My idea of perfection isn't a person,
but a well-made structure.

357
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,947
-You're going there again, aren't you?
-Of course.

358
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,199
No, I won't let you leave

359
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,077
until you help me get her autograph
and take a photo with her!

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,329
Just go. Go on!

361
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,497
-Hey!
-Bye.

362
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,706
Hold on.

363
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,916
Hello.

364
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,964
Oh! Oh.

365
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,093

"Grandma Kwon's Pork Wraps."

370
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,681
Did you forget Korean or something?

371
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,724
Why are you reading those shop signs?

372
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,686
The restaurant signs keep catching my eye.

373
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,062
Oh, I see.

374
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,565
I guess I'm hungry.

375
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
Right.

376
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,110
It's past lunchtime.

377
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,320
Everything looks so good.

378
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,490
"The In-Law's Fried Chicken."

379
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,910
That one doesn't sound so appetizing.

380
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,538
Don't be greedy and just pick one place.

381
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,165
One place? Ah.

382
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,749
Then...

383
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,509
[woman] Enjoy your meal.
-[Seok-ryu & Mo-eum] Thank you.

384
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,344
Hey.

385
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,598
I bet the blood of Korean people
is redder than that of others

386
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,057
because it's actually chili paste.

387
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,476
Ooh. What a scientific theory
you have there.

388
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,979
But I thought
we'd go to your family's place.

389
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,773
We came here all the time
during high school.

390
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,153
All right, let's eat these rice cakes
and talk about the good old days.

391
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,362
Wait.

392
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,364
We should have some <i>sundae too.</i>

393
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,366
Get ready.

394
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,826
Begin the battle.

395
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,828
Let's eat!

396

397
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,876
-It's good.
-[shouts]

398
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,836
It's so good.

399
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,504
[slurps]

400
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,303
[hisses] It's spicy though.

401
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,055
Really spicy. [hisses]

402
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,223
Why is it so spicy?

403
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,726
Jeez, it looks like
I can't handle spicy food now.

404
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,686
Drink some water. Are you okay?

405
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,774
Wow. I guess your blood
isn't as red as it used to be.

406
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,026
You're losing your identity as a Korean.

407
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,029
-It's too spicy.
-All right, I know what to do.

408
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,073
Let's wash them in water first.

409
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,991
-What are you doing?
-Say "ah."

410
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,909
It's okay.

411
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,453
Come on. That's sinking too low.

412
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,829
It's okay.

413
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,166
-Hide!
-What?

414
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,796
-Hello.
-[woman] Hi, what can I get you?

415
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,131
[Dong-jin] One portion
of <i>tteokbokki,</i> assorted fries,

416
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,009
and <i>sundae</i>
with lots of steamed offals, please.

417
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,594
-[woman] All right.
-It's Dong-jin.

418
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,179
-Exactly.
-[Dong-jin] Looks delicious.

419
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,937
[soft jazz music playing]

420
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,191
What's the deal with them?

421
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,194
Are they feeling sick?

422
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,117
[woman] Your food is ready.

423
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
[Dong-jin] Thank you.

424
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,996
[woman] You can pay here.

425
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

426
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,668
Thanks.

427
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,837
-Goodbye.
-[woman] Enjoy your food.

428
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,630
It looks good.

429
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,924
Ow! Oh. Oh. [gasps]

430
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,218
-Sir!
-What's in that bag?

431
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,470
[Dong-jin]
Let go of my ear first, please. Ah!

432
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,180
-Open it.
-Okay.

433
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,725
[Seul-gi]
This <i>tteokbokki</i> has 500 calories.

434
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,436
You also have <i>sundae,</i>
fried seaweed rolls, and fried squid?

435
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,104
That's 1,350 calories in total.

436
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,439
[Dong-jin] How do you know that?

437
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,275
Listen up.
This is your exercise regimen for today.

438
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,360
A hundred pull-ups, a hundred push-ups,

439
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,154
two hundred lunges and burpees, each.

440
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,864
Then 500 squats, okay?

441
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,700
That's so unfair.
I haven't even eaten them yet!

442
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,286
You ate all these in your mind.

443
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Don't you want your trainer certification?

444
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,414
What about the upcoming contest?

445
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,417
Just the fact that
you considered eating these things

446
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,710
is a crime, all right?

447
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,087
Hand them over.

448
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,423
Come on, hand them over.

449
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,009
I'm confiscating them for your own good.

450
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,054
-The offals have protein, though.
-[blows whistle]

451
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,765
Be at the gym in five minutes. Go!

453
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,186
That dimwit.

454
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,148
-I told him squid has more protein.
-Is he gone?

455
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,735
It's delicious, ma'am.

456
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,029
-Have a good day.
-You too.

457
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,864
-He's gone, right?
-[Mo-eum] Yes.

458
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,826
He should be eating at Dad's diner,
not here.

459
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,827
Hey.

460
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,663
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

461
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,999
Anyway, what was that?

462
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,585
Why did you hide from your brother?

463
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,338
You might not know
since you only have sisters,

464
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,048
but this is what having a brother is like.

465
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,549
Mm...

466
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,469
Does your family not know
that you're back?

467
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,263
[clears throat]

468
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,973
[in English] Surprise.

469
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,226
[in Korean] I mean,

470
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,520
it's been a while since I came home.

471
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,190
So I thought it would be more fun
to surprise them like this

472
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,401
than just to walk through the front door.

473
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,402
Right.

474
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,696
You're nuts. So you're making
a whole production out of...

475
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,579
Wait, "a whole production"?

476
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,124
We might as well go all-out.

477
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,875

00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,859

479
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,570
Come on, let's go.

480
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,365
We need to decorate the house
until our moms come back from hiking.

481
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,825
Wait, Mo-eum...

482
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,869
-What?
-Please promise me one thing.

483
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,456
Stay with me until the end of the day,
no matter what happens.

484
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,374
What do you mean?

485
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,877
Even if Mount Baekdu explodes
or the Han River overflows, okay?

486
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,795
Even if the world ends
or the dinosaurs come back!

487
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,297
-Hold on.
-[phone ringing]

488
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,882
-What I mean is...
-Hello?

489
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,008
Yes, captain?

490
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,260
Jae-gyeong did what?

491
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,971
Right now?

492
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,891
-All right. I'll be right there.
-You're leaving?

493
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,268
-Where are you going?
-I have to go. It's an emergency.

494
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,978
I have an emergency too.

495
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm going to need you later on!

496
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,982
Then call 911 later! Bye!

497
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,483
Hey, wait! I'm being serious!

498
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,277
Jung Mo-eum!

499
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,445
Hey!

500
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,696
Bye.

501
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,780
[Seok-ryu] But...

502
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,408
That traitor.

00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,551
There used to be a sauna here.

You really have to take a bath today.

510
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,908
See? You're so grimy with dirt,
I can hardly tell you're a human brat.

Well, I'm your grimy brat!

You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

No! I don't want to take a bath!

514

Come on!

00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,216
-Oh, come on.
-[young Seung-hyo] No!

520
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,926

[door closes]

523
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,604
Our mothers were so cruel.

524
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,651
How could they make us share a bath?

525
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,655
It was a violation of our rights.

526
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,201
I used to hate going to the sauna,

527
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,661
but it's a shame it's gone.

528
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,915
What is this place anyway?

529
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,750
There's no sign.

530
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,960
No front door either.

531
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,091
Who are you?

00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,051
[pensive music playing]

533
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,154
Bae Seok-ryu?

Choisseung?

00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,166
-[music stops]
-What are you doing here?

536
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,375
That's my line.

537
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,918
What's up with you?

538
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,670
None of your business.

539
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,964
You're stepping on my land.

540
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,968
Don't make me laugh. This is your land?

541
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,847
Wait, is it?

542
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,891
It is, so go away.

543
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,522

546
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,573

[humming]

548
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,039
What the heck?

549
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,878
{\an8}-What are you doing?
-I can't talk right now.

550
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,129
Just help me out, okay?

551
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,964
{\an8}What are you going on about?

552
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,175
{\an8}Help me out just this once.

553
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,220
{\an8}Just pretend I'm a discarded box, okay?

554
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,555
{\an8}Don't tell anyone you saw me.

555
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,891
{\an8}Got it?

556
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,811
{\an8}Whatever. Get out.

557
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,688
{\an8}-I said, get out.
-[Mi-sook] I don't believe you.

558
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,399
[scoffs] You want proof?

559
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,484
-Look at her.
-Hey.

560
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,903
Hey, stop that!

561
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,863
-That's enough!
-Gosh, how embarrassing.

562
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,115
[In-sook] One, two!

563
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,701
What's this luggage doing here
in the middle of the road?

564
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,328
-Seung-hyo.
-Mom.

565
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,081
[grunts] Give me a hug.

566
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,041
[Jae-sook] Oh, my.

567
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,377
-It's been a while, Seung-hyo.
-You're here.

568
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,712
-[In-sook] You're as handsome as always.
-He is.

569
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,048
I'm In-sook. Do you remember me?

570
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,425
Of course. How have you been?

571
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,051
My goodness!

572
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,095
-Hello.
-[Mi-sook] What are you doing here?

573
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,388
-Hello.
-Hi.

574
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,098
[Mi-sook] Why aren't you at the diner?

575
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,349
Where are you sneaking off to?

576
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,309
Why would I be sneaking?

577
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,770
Is that any way to talk
to your beloved husband?

578
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,813
Wanna try that again?

579
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,189
I just went to the market.

580
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,902
Hey, Seung-hyo! Here, have one. [chuckles]

581
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,529
-Thank you.
-[Geun-sik] It's good to see you.

582
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,655
Thank you.

583
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,701
You should've called ahead
to say you were coming home.

584
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,954
Uh, I came to receive
some furniture today.

585
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,873
-I apologize for not letting you know.
-I see.

586
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,250
I understand.

587
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,503
Your firm opens next week,
so you must be busy.

588
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,631
I invited a lot of guests
for the opening party.

589
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,967
-About that...
-So you're saying that this building

590
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,177
is your new office?

591
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,804
-[Seung-hyo] Yes.
-[Geun-sik] That's impressive.

592
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,598
-[Seung-hyo] Thank you.
-[Mi-sook] Seung-hyo.

593
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,475
-Is this your luggage?
-What? No.

594
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,810
-Really?
-This was just here?

595
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,521
-We should take it to the police.
-[Jae-sook] We should.

596
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,149
-Let's do it.
-[Mi-sook] Let me see.

597
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,442
It says something here.

598
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,027
It's in English.

599
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,236
Hold on. It is mine.

600
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,614
It's definitely mine.

601
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,408
[In-sook] Seung-hyo
has the same taste as me.

602
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,411
-I suppose.
-Pink is a man's color, you know.

603
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,622
-Right.
-You should take better care of it.

604
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,166
What if you lost it? Here you go.

605
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,793
I'll do it.

606
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
Seung-hyo.

607
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,380
Did you eat the beans I sent you?

608
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,425
-Did you eat everything?
-Uh, actually, not yet.

609
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,719
I've been too busy to eat at home.

610
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,555
You need to have healthier eating habits!

611
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,891
You want me to come over
and check your fridge?

612
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,727
I'm sorry. I'll give you an apple
as an apology.

613
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,229
An apology?

614
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,856
I'm only eating beans from today onward.

615
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,194
What are you guarding this box for anyway?
What's in it?

616
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,697
I don't know.
I mean, it can't be a person, can it?

617
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,824
[kicks box]

618
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,909
Are you hiding something precious?

619
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,077
Of course not.

620
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,954
It has nothing of value.

621
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,956
I should throw it out.

622
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,500
Really? Then we'll throw it out for you.

623
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,002
-Honey.
-Yes, I can carry it.

624
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,963
You can sell a box like this for money.

625
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,422
Hold on.

626
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,802
Now that I think about it,
I still need it to put all my trash in.

627
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,845
I'll throw it out after that.

628
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,389
Maybe there is
something of value after all.

629
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,182
-[Geun-sik] Really?
-[Mi-sook] Okay.

630
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,226
Tell me when you plan to throw it out.

631
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,978
-Okay.
-[Geun-sik chuckles]

632
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,312
[Mi-sook] Seung-hyo.

633
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,897
Don't forget the beans.

634
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,274
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,733
You should cook it better.

636
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,818
Let's go.

637
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,194
-Bye!
-Goodbye!

638
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,821
-Goodbye.
-Have a good day!

639
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,907
I'll be going too, Seung-hyo.

640
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
All right. Goodbye.

641
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,660
-See you later.
-Yes.

642
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,953
Bye.

643
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,005
[Seok-ryu] Are they all gone?

644
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,132
I'm coming out.

645
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,178
[sighs]

646
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,016
Let me out.

647
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,727
Why are you hiding from your mom?

648
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,479
Let me out! It's stuffy in here!

649
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,982
It's just very strange.

650
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,693
I thought you were
supposed to be in the U.S.

651
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,740
Did you get into trouble?

652
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,035
I have other ways of getting out.

653
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,786
[grunts] Jeez.

654
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,415
You tore the box?

655
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,418
[sighs] I can tear you apart too.

656
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,754
Aunt Mi-sook!

657
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,298
Just kidding.

658
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,509
[sighs]

659
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,929
I'm going to end you!

660
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,265
-Is that any way to talk to your savior?
-[sighs]

661
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,853
So this is your new office?
It kind of sucks.

662
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,064
-It's full of bucks though.
-Whatever.

663
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,901
Then why don't you save me one more time?

664
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,818
What?

665
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,070
Let me use your bathroom.

666
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,156
Don't mark it as your territory.

667
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,616
You can't go in there!

668
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,285
Jeez.

669
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,204
[soft piano music playing]

670
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,044
Go straight and turn left there.
That's the front door.

671
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,170
Goodbye.

672
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,922
It's actually not that bad.

673
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,508
Just follow the recommended route.

674
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,260
Hey, what are these?

675
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,178
Millstones?

676
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,348
They're stepping stones.

677
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,643
Keep your dirty hands off of them!

678
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,939
Are you doing this on purpose?

679
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,276
[scoffs] Does this place
have bad feng shui?

680
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,237
Or are you my bad luck?

681
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,407
You know you're kind of mean, don't you?

682
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,826
You don't know you're immature, do you?

683
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,868
[sighs]

684
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,829
I don't like this at all.

685
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,789
At least you were cute
when you were little.

686
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,083
You weren't cute
even when you were little.

687
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,877
You little...

688
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,587
Look at this.

689
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,048
You immediately start throwing punches.

690
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,219
I tell you, you're closer to a beast
than a human being.

691
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,430
Your fiancé must be a saint.

692
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,223
What?

693
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,517
Aunt Mi-sook gave me
your wedding invitation.

694
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,436
She offered to buy my plane ticket,

695
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,896
but I think I'll be too busy to make it.

696
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,484
Congratulations on your marriage.

697
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,486
Thanks.

698
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,948
By the way, where's your office?

699
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,993
Aren't you going to leave?

700
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,538
It's over there, isn't it?

701
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,875
[groans] Please just leave!

702
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,419
Just go, please.
Why are you going upstairs?

703
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,505
Hey, come on! Get out of there.

704
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,382
Why would you come in here?

705
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,135
Your office is huge.

706
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,094
[sighs]

707
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,971
Just go home, okay?

708
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,139
Ooh.

709
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,683
That's an impressive ceiling.

710
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,895
I guess you have eyes, after all.

711
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,316
I referred to the ceiling designs
of the Goguryeo mural tombs.

712
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,985
You mean like the Twin Column Tomb
or the Tomb of the Dancers?

713
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,903
Exactly.

714
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,447
It's a ceiling
with triangles in each corner,

715
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,282
the most common type of the era.

716
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,409
It holds the principles of

717
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,287
"the sky is round
and the earth is square."

718
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,580
In other words,

719
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,958
you designed your office like a tomb.
What a weirdo.

720
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,627
What? A "weirdo"?

721
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,254
[scoffs] Whatever.

722
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,300
Of course, someone as crude as you
wouldn't understand my art,

723
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,594
which reinterprets
our ancestors' timeless wisdom

724
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,429

For crying out loud.

728
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,071
Are you okay?

729
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,322
[groaning]

730
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,992
Do I look okay to you?

731
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,829
I can't believe you crawled out alone.

732
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,290
I have a very strong attachment to life.

733
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,419
What was it that fell anyway?

734
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,421
[Seung-hyo] Ow.

735
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,591
[Seok-ryu] This thing is heavy!

736
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,219
Did you think it'd be
as light as a feather?

What are you doing?

741
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,852
Do you have eyes in the back of your head?

742

If you don't, just stay still.

743
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,814
[groans] I knew this would happen.

744
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,859
I always end up getting hurt
when I'm with you.

745
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,902
-Be quiet and stay still.

Don't!

I told you, didn't I?

756
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,524
My body is bruised and battered
from everything you put me through.

757
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,568
You're exaggerating.

758
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,236
I don't expect you to apologize.

759
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,865
I just want you to leave now. Please.

760
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,327
Hey, I didn't want to spend
my first day back with you either.

761
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,163
-But something unexpected came up...
-Hey, Seok-ryu.

762
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,041
I couldn't care less
about what you did or didn't do.

763
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,001
I see.

764
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,004
Sorry for inconveniencing you.

765
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,590
But I know one thing.

766
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,595
Knowing Aunt Mi-sook, putting it off
wouldn't do you any favors.

767
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,264
Things are going to escalate
the longer you put it off.

768
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,225
You could face a 24-hour silent treatment

769
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,893
for what could've been resolved
in 30 minutes.

770
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,230
So stop dawdling
and just get it over with.

771
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,607
You're so annoying when you're right.

772
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,610
You're so pathetic
when you get in trouble.

773
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,613
That's it.

774
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,615
Let me hit you just once.

775
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,991
[grunts] I think

776
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,619
this cost 17 million won.

777
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,120
Not 1,700 won?

778
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,665
A designer friend of mine gave it to me.

779
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,251
If it's broken,
I should claim for damages...

780
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,543
Let me see.

781
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,631
It's not broken. It's fine.

782
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,550
What an expensive chunk of metal.

783
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,721
Look. I gave it a rub so it shines better.

784
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,973
It's so shiny now.

785
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,349
It's totally fine, right?

786
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,642
It's as good as new.

787
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,644
I'll just carefully put it back here.

788
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,812
Don't bother.

789
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,648
There, all done!

871
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,729
[sighs]

872
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,903
It's so noisy. Don't walk so close to me.

873
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,656
You're the one who's following me.

874
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,744
Do you think I'm following you?

875
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,537
You might have forgotten,

876
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,456
but our parents live
right next to each other.

877
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,665
I'm just going home.

878
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,752
Just take another road. Go on.

879
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,836
This is the quickest.

880
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,671
For crying out loud.

881
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,059
Are you craving fried chicken right now?

882
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,101
THE IN-LAW'S FRIED CHICKEN

883
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,313
I feel sorry for you. I really do.

884
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:09,527
Do you think I could ask
to borrow that helmet right there?

885
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,445
You think they'd lend it to me?

886
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:12,988
What?

887
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,865
I need something
to protect me from my mom.

888
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,950
She'll crack my melon.

889
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,328
You could've picked a more normal word
like "head" or even "skull."

890
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,874
There aren't any helmet shops nearby,
are there?

891
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,001
This lunatic is actually being serious.

892
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,337
[Seung-hyo sighs]

893
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,593
What are you doing?

894
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,891
What are you doing
in the middle of the street?

895
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,060
[upbeat music playing]

896
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,478
Hold this.

897
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,357
Hey.

898
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,900
You're driving me nuts.

899
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:52,987
[sighs]

900
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,659
I guess I underestimated you.

901
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,998
You're insane.

902
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,098
You look like a blowfish.

903
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,517
It's only natural to puff up one's body

904
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,144
when faced with incredible danger.

905
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,855
Come on, hit me.

906
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,565
What are you saying?

907
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,610
Just hit me. I need to see
if I'm protected enough.

908
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,613
Why didn't you just buy
a bulletproof vest in the U.S.?

909
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,865
I really should've.

910
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,534
Should I go back and buy one?

911
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,245
Considering the time and money
you'd have to spend,

912
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,372
just get it over with right now.

913
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,499
Mm. Mm.

914
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,128
Hey, do you want to
spend the night with me?

915
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,922
-What the hell are you on about?
-Stay with me.

916
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,923
Stop fooling around.

917
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,676
I'm not asking for much.
Just stay by my side, okay?

918
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,428
Go away! You're scaring me.

919
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,263
I'm the one who's scared.

920
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,516
I really screwed up, Seung-hyo.

921
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,562
I came home to just tell my mom
and get it over with,

922
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,149
but now I can't bear to face her.

923
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,693
What is it? What did you do?

924
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,530
I have to know what it is

925
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,659
if I'm going to help you
decide what to do about it.

926
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,576
Well...

927
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,870
The thing is...

928
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,665
[clears throat] I...

929
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,918
called it off.

930
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,336
What?

931
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,796
I said...

932
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,881
I'm not getting married.

933
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,466
Speak up, will you?

934
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,593
I said I broke off my engagement!

935
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,890
Uh, Aunt Mi-sook.

936
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,645
Hey, you can't fool me twice
with that trick.

937
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,773
[Mi-sook] What did you just say?

938
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,610
[jaunty music playing]

939
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,916
Seok-ryu.

940
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,919
What did you say? Say it again.

941
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,338
-Mom.
-[chuckles]

942
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,091
I must have heard it wrong, right?

943
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,676
Right.

944
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,802
Mom!

945
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,387
-Oh, my.
-[Seok-ryu] How have you been?

946
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,890
You must be surprised to see me
out of the blue.

947
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,725
You're still so beautiful.

948
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,354
I'm actually kind of confused
because of jet lag, you know?

949
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,274
The reason I'm back in Korea is...

950
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,191
[Mi-sook] Yes?

951
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,402
It's...

952
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,779
to tell you
that I broke off my engagement.

953
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,282
Oh, my God!

954
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,786
[grunting]

955
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,079
-[Seok-ryu] Dad!
-[Mi-sook] Geun-sik!

956
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,415
-[Seok-ryu] Dad!
-[Kyung-jong] Move out of the way.

957
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,836
[Hye-sook] He must have had a shock.

-[grunts]
-Goodness!

959
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,091
Are you all right, Geun-sik?

960
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,217
I just had a bad dream.

961
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,220
-I thought Seok-ryu said...
-Are you okay, Dad?

962
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,472
Seok-ryu!

963
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,432
It wasn't a dream?

964
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,227
No, this has to be a dream!
Just a bad dream!

965
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,437
[Mi-sook] Seok-ryu.

966
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,148
What did you say? You did what?

967
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,984
I broke off my engagement.

968
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,986
I canceled everything.

969
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,113
Everyone in the U.S. knows already.

970
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,615
You're out of your mind.

971
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,867
You're completely nuts.

972
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,951
I'm totally fine.

973
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,412
How could you call your own daughter nuts?

974
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,624
I'm calling it as I see it!
Only a nutjob would pull a stunt like this

975
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,334
a month before the wedding!

976
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,294
Come here.

977
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,545
Aunt Mi-sook!

978
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,714
Use your words, please.

979
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,425
-No violence.
-That's right, Mom. Hear me out.

980
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,135
There's a saying in the U.S.

981
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,930
"There are three types of people
who get married."

982
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:51,391
"The dumb, the poor, and the masochist."

983
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,935
Why you... Get over here.

984
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,686
Wait, I have more.

985
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,772
I have one more thing to say.

986
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,524
There's another saying that goes,

987
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:03,028
"Marriage is leaving a festival
before it begins."

988
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,321
Are you nuts?

989
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,448
What in the world happened?

990
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,408
You sounded so happy

991
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,118
-the last time we talked!
-Stop it.

992
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,248
Don't tell me that my son...

993
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,208
No, he's not my son-in-law anymore.

994
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,461
Did that jerk Song Hyeon-jun call it off?

995
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,047
[Geun-sik] That dirtbag!

996
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,550
Honey, buy us
two plane tickets right away.

997
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,677
-Okay.
-I'll tear him to pieces!

998
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,053
It's not his fault.

999
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,055
[Mi-sook] Do you have no pride?

1000
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,140
Are you seriously defending him?

1001
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,893
It wasn't his fault. It was mine.

1002
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,019
That makes no sense.

1003
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,355
What could you have possibly...

1004
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,817
Did you...

1005
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,071
cheat on him?

1006
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,119
Goodness.

1007
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,663
-Dear me.
-[grunting]

1008
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,708
Be careful.

1009
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,003
Now, breathe in deeply.

1010
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,546
You might start hyperventilating.

1011
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,006
I need CPR.

1012
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,632
You crazy brat!

1013
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,175
I can't believe you!

1014
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:11,096
-Even I never cheated on anyone,
-Mi-sook!

1015
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,056
with a pathetic husband like that!

1016
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,475
So how could you do
such an unthinkable thing?

1017
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,686
I've had it up to here with you!
I'll end you!

1018
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,772
-Aunt Mi-sook!
-You don't have to talk to me like that.

1019
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,651
Do you want me to be an unfilial daughter
who dies before her parents?

1020
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,777
-Hey.
-[Seok-ryu] What about now?

1021
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,613
As if you're a filial daughter now!

1022
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,532
-Mi-sook! Stop!
-Auntie! Hold on!

1023
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,035
-Let's talk it out like civilized people.
-That's right!

1024
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,162
Let's be civilized.
You're being too violent.

1025
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,204
Also, I'm a grownup.

1026
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,291
You can't just
discipline me like that anymore!

1027
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,585
I'll treat you like a grownup
when you act like one!

1028
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,295
Come over here, you brat!

1029
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,464
-Aunt Mi-sook!
-What are you doing?

1030
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,674
Stop hitting me and hit her instead!

1031
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,051
That's right!

1032
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,261
Why are you hitting my son?

1033
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,056
He's taking all the blows
for your daughter!

1034
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,643
He's so cruel and ruthless.

1035
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,978
He really made me do all the push-ups.

1036
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,938
-[Mi-sook] Come here, you brat!
-[Seung-hyo] Hey!

1037
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,190
What's with the ruckus?

1038
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,317
-[Seung-hyo] You should go.
-Is someone fighting?

1039
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,196
Why do you keep calling me "brat"
instead of the name you gave me?

1040
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,572
That's your issue?

1041
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,866
How about I call you "bastard" instead?

1042
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,744
-I think I prefer "brat."
-Hey, you...

1043
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,162
Are you making fun of me?

1044
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,373
Aunt Mi-sook! Stop!

1045
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,249
Don't hit me there!

1046
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,668
[Hye-sook] Hey!

1047
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,837
Are you trying to castrate my son?

1048
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,297
I've had enough.

1049
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,341
Let me go! Stop it!

1050
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,842
-[Geun-sik] Honey.
-Out of my way!

1051
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,386
Don't do this. [shouts]

1052
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,429
Uncle Geun-sik.

1053
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,058
[groans] Honey, please!

1054
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,727
Stop hitting her, okay?

1055
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,231
You haven't even heard
Seok-ryu's side of the story yet.

1056
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,734
She wouldn't do something like that
for no reason!

1057
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,237
Dad.

1058
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,448
Oh, my daughter.

1059
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,825
It's okay.

1060
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,036
She basically raised herself
without our help!

1061
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,039
So she must have had a reason
for doing whatever she did!

1062
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,005
Fine, tell me.

1063
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:10,882
Let's hear it.

1064
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,844
Will you stop hitting me if I tell you?

1065
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,429
Fine.

1066
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,890
Will you really listen to
everything I have to say?

1067
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,850
Yes.

1068
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,893
I'll listen.

1069
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,895
Are you sure?

1070
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,731
-I said yes.
-She said yes.

1071
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,774
[Seok-ryu] Mom.

1072
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,570
I also quit my work.

1073
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm unemployed now.

1074
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,579
No way.

1075
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,830
So you're... what?

1076
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,709
[groaning]

1077
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,002
-[Dong-jin] Dad!
-Geun-sik!

1078
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,299
Is he okay?

1079
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,800
Dong-jin! [crying]

1080
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,844
-What is it?
-I'm just so...

1081
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,762
You little...

1082
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,805
You hopeless brat!

1083
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,141
You quit your job

1084
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,018
on top of all that?

1085
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,227
You're insane!

1086
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,854
-Goodness, Mi-sook!
-Come here!

1087
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,897
Seok-ryu!

1088
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,982
-You said you'd hear me out!
-[Hye-sook] You're hitting Seung-hyo!

1089
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,860
-You're hitting my son!
-[Mi-sook] This is too ridiculous!

1090
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,987
-You worked so hard to get there!
-Stop it!

1091
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,363
-You had such a good job.
-Stop!

1092
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,073
-Why would you quit?
-Hey!

1093
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,825
-[Mi-sook] You little brat!
-[Hye-sook] Stop it.

1094
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,410
-I can't believe...
-[Seung-hyo] It hurts!

1095
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,078
Are you in your right mind?

1096
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,123
-We have to run!
-[Mi-sook] Hold it right there!

1097
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,917
-[Hye-sook] Hey!
-[Mi-sook] I'm not done with you!

1098
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,835
Why did you have to bring me along?

1099
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,295
I have no reason to run!

1100
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,631
I saved you from being beaten to a pulp.

1101
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,634
You're the only reason I got beaten
with a bunch of leeks!

1102
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,802
What's your plan now?

1103
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,804
Just think of it as playing tag.

1104
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,056
-Stop right there!
-We're dead if we get caught.

1105
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:42,849
[Mi-sook] Hey!

1106
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:48,647
[young Seok-ryu] <i>I'm counting to ten!
One, two, three, four,</i>

five, six, seven, eight,

1108
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,902
nine, ten!

1109
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,695
[uplifting music playing]

1110
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,781
We're dead if we get caught, okay?

1111
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,332
[Mi-sook] Hey, get back here!

1112
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,668
Stop right there, Bae Seok-ryu!

1113
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,294
[shouting and panting]

1114
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,131
Hey!

1115
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,552
That little brat. Get back here!

1116
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,224
Hey.

1117
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,145
She wouldn't follow us here, right?

1118
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,440
We shook her off a long time ago.

1119
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,652
Then why didn't you tell me?
We could've stopped running.

1120
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,279
Why did we come all the way here?

1121
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,282
I'm totally wiped!

1122
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,158
Don't slap me away like that.

1123
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,369
You're the one who grabbed my hand first.

1124
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,247
[Seok-ryu] Hey.

1125
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,540
Buy me something to drink.

1126
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,749
Are you nuts?

1127
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,418
The store is down there!

1128
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,421
I'm so thirsty right now
that I might puke.

1129
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,922
Swallow your spit.

1130
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,007
You heartless jerk.

1131
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,802
[groans]

1132
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:01,970
I'm exhausted.

1133
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,682
You should work out more
if you're exhausted from that.

1134
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,060
You try sitting in front of a computer
for ten years

1135
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,022
and see if your body comes out unscathed.

1136
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,691
That's still just an excuse.
You could've worked out more.

1137
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,443
It's so hot.

1138
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,153
Why isn't there any wind?

1139
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,740
Come here for a second.

1140
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,618
What now? What are you doing?

1141
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,869
Stand right here.

1142
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,832
Are you seriously going to use me
as your human shield again?

1143
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,334
You're my changing room this time.

1144
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,919
Hide me while I take these off.

1145
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,922
Why are you doing this to me?

1146
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,340
[soft jazz music playing]

1147
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,097
Jeez.

1148
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:52,062
How many layers did you wear?
Are you a nesting doll or something?

1149
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,563
What's that?

1150
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,149
You know, the Russian toy
that has dolls inside dolls.

1151
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,484
Oh.

1152
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,694
Are you saying I look like a doll?

1153
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,030
More like a dolt.

1154
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,281
I will end you.

1155
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,116
Just finish your shedding.

1156
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,827
I'm letting you off
for so many things today.

1157
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,050
Can I turn around?

1158
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,137
Hey, I'm turning around.

1159
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,850
[pensive music playing]

1160
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,022
Why didn't you answer me?

1161
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,734
I should've listened to you.

1162
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,489
Now Mom won't talk to me for a whole day.

1163
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,117
I'd say two days.

1164
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,743
[scoffs]

1165
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,036
That sucks.

1166
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,999
I should've looked more closely
at my mom's face then.

1167
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,584
I missed her.

1168
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,963
You should've been honest.

1169
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,382
Why did you tell her that you cheated?

1170
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,510
You don't believe

1171
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,137
that I cheated?

1172
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,681
Why not?

1173
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,519
Maybe I'm an irresistible femme fatale.

1174
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,480
-You?
-Hey.

1175
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:22,777
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

1176
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,862
The truth is...

1177
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,782
I'm hiding something huge.

1178
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,827
Just keep hiding it then.

1179
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,912
Ha! You're so annoying.

1180
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,497
Fine, I don't care.

1181
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,958
You won't guess in a million years anyway.

1182
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,295
It doesn't affect me at all.
I'm completely fine.

1183
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,172
You don't seem fine.

1184
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,304
You made two huge life decisions at once.

1185
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,057
Only a doll would be undamaged by that.

1186
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,267
-Ooh.
-[pensive music playing]

1187
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,269
So you really think I'm a doll, don't you?

1188
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,274
Maybe a satanic doll.

1189
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,442
Shut up.

1190
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:12,952
I just...

1191
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,290
felt like my life was getting overheated.

1192
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,169
You know how hard I've worked.

1193
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,672
I was studying in Korea,

1194
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,342
then I suddenly went to the U.S.

1195
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,802
and had to adapt to that life.

1196
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,428
Then I got a job

1197
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,013
and got engaged too.

1198
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,850
Going at full throttle
all the time like that...

1199
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,687
overloaded my CPU.

1200
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,482
The screen went blank,

1201
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,110
and the keys stopped working.

1202
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,737
So I had no choice

1203
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,199
but to reboot myself.

1204
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,915
That was my excuse for quitting my job
and calling off my engagement.

1205
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,754
That was brave of you.

1206
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,631
It was.

1207
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,051
So I had to come back
before my courage expired

1208
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,930
and my resolve crumbled into nothing.

1209
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,522
Excuse me. Could you take a photo of us?

1210
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,482
-Sure.
-Thank you.

It's just that Aunt Mi-sook
likes me better than you.
