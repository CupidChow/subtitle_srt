00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,470


551
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,910
You want him to succeed so badly?

552
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,520


553
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,990
Hello?

554
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,980


555
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,390
Hi, Xiao Liang.

556
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380


557
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,670
[About the Hunting Dog
you asked me to locate,]

558
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,680


559
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,750
he's at Wan Si Bar.

560
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,140


561
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,630
He didn't go anywhere.

562
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,710
Didn't go anywhere?

563
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,280


564
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,820


565
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,430
What is he doing?

566
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,350
What's wrong?

567
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,070


568
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,630
Mr. Zhang's nephew, Guo

569
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,420


570
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,230
provided an important clue.

571
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,980


572
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,150


573
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,150
Ye Tian's username in Pangu

574
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,510
is GM 001.

575
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,080


576
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,950
There's a player

577
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,940


578
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,020


579
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,390
who helped him many times.

580
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,140


581
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,630
There's a high chance

582
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,990
he was the one who took Ye Tian.

583
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,620


584
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,710


585
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,110
As long as we find him,

586
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,350
we'll most likely find Ye Tian.

587
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,920


588
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,870
All players in Pangu

589
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,410


590
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,780
have signed a privacy agreement.

591
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,250


592
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,090


593
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,510
So we can't find him for now.

594
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,400


595
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,870
His code number
in the Pangu experience cabin

596
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,610


597
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,110
is A8398X03.

598
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,230


599
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,670
I'm trying to locate him.

600
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,180
As long as he goes online,

601
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,780


602
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,890


603
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,310
I can narrow down the location

604
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,750


605
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,350
through network area troubleshooting.

606
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,030
Finding him is just a matter of time.

607
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,650


608
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,190
You're doing great.

609
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,960


610
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,480


611
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,750
I know this is unfair to you.

612
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,870
There's nothing unfair
when it comes to us.

613
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,540


614
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,550
When we left the village,

615
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080


616
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,350


617
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,830
I've already told you

618
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,470
that no matter what happens,

619
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,150


620
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,520


621
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,110
I'll stand by you.

622
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,710
I will

623
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,180


624
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,150
keep my promise.

625
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,840


626
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,390
I'm sure you know

627
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,070


628
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,560


629
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,870
that I'm doing this

630
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,750
for Zhang Hao Cheng.

631
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,310


632
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,020
I even know

633
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,560


634
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,670


635
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,950
that you agreed to help him

636
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,230
so you can...

637
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,800


638
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640


639
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,950
It's been three years.

640
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,790


641
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,110
Is it worth it

642
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,830
to go back to him?

643
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,690


644
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,110
Didn't he cause you

645
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,770


646
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,190
enough pain?

647
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,770


648
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,110
I'm indebted to you.

649
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,760


650
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,070
I'm indebted to you forever.

651
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,660


652
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,030
I clearly know

653
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,760


654
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,580
what I want from him.

655
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,230


656
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,790


657
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,150
You don't owe me.

658
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,890


659
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,230
You have never owed me anything.

660
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,370


661
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,750
Boss.

662
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,150
I didn't expect Ms. Le Le to return.

663
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,780


664
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,630
Many things will happen
out of our expectations.

665
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,130


666
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,470
What matters the most

667
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,360


668
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,870
is how you face it

669
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,490


670
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,920


671
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,340
when they happen.

672
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,349
You mean...

673
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,849


674
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,869
I'm not sure too.

675
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,480


676
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,750
People say that grudges

677
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,420


678
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,760


679
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,180
will be gone in time.

680
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,030


681
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,349
It seems like some grudges
can't be settled or sorted out.

682
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,109
What a mess!

683
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,880


684
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,600


685
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:28,830
Let's go.

686
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,590
Ms. Le Le.

687
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,160


688
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:36,950


689
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,150
I'll go.

690
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,910
Yun Yun.

691
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,440


692
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,470
What brings you here?

693
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,190


694
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,460


695
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,910
I miss you.

696
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,420


697
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,510
Even if I'm busy,

698
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,370


699
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,030
I still have to drop by.

700
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,070
Is something bothering you?

701
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,360


702
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,590


703
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,990
There is something.

704
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,860


705
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,510
What should I do?

706
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,070
Let me guess.

707
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,490


708
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,510
Someone who's capable of bothering you...

709
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,180


710
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,270
He must be Lin Feng.

711
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,700


712
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,360


713
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,550
I'm always the one asking him out.

714
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,830


715
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,190
But he turns me down
because of someone.

716
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,360


717
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,670
I know who she is.

718
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,730


719
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,950
If it's really her,

720
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,870
I won't go easy on her.

721
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,370


722
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,990


723
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,550
You like him that much?

724
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,090


725
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,470
Yes.

726
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,330


727
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,870
I once had this feeling too.

728
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,760


729
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,940
I was like a moth attracted to fire.

730
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,430
Although I knew it wouldn't end well,

731
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,150


732
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,150
I still refused to leave.

Who is he?

739
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,660
Who made you fall so deeply?

740
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,050


741
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,100
Hao.

742

743
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,630
Two glasses of whiskey, please.

744
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,070
Sure, Ms. Le Le.

745

746
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,070
Let's see if you'll
raise your voice again.

748
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,590


749
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,830
Go ahead.

750
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Now you know you're wrong?

751
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,510


752

753
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,870
You're scared, right?

754
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,590
Now you know what I'm capable of.

755
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,310


756
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,670


757
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,110
Don't look for you anymore?

758
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,440


759
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,870
What should I do with your body then?

760
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,590


761
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,030
Abandon it outside?

762

763
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,150
If you can't solve a problem,

765
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,470
find other ways then.

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,630


767
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,830
There'll always be a solution.

769
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,750

771
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,510
we can't enter the core region.

772
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,950
The core region...

773
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,630


774
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,870
The core region?

776
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,190
Fine.

779
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,910
Leave it to me.

I'll come to you.

785
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,990
Until then, have a good rest here.

786
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,230
What happened to my dress?

787
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,790

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,100


912
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,150
Let's go.

913
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,790


914
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,110
Bai Wei.

915
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,140
We'll go as planned.

916
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,130


917
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,060


918
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,070
Buns! Hot steamed buns!

919
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,620


920
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,630
Have some buns!

921
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,630


922
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,830
Help me!

923
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,070
Stop!

924
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,950
-It's you?
-It's you?

925
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,490


926
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,950
You punk!

927
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,540


928
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,980


929
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,270
I'm not in the mood
to rake up the past today.

930
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,070
She's my wife.

931
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,660


932
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,430
Stay out of this.

933
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,970


934
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,240


935
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,670
He's your husband?

936
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,700


937
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,110
Listen to your husband.

938
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,640


939
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,030
Go home.

940
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,930
No! He's a bad guy.

941
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,720


942
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,950


943
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,350
That's right. I'm a bad guy.

944
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,600


945
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,020
I'm not only a bad guy,

946
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,560


947
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,110
I'm also a member of Heavenly Society.

948
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,620


949
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,070
Don't make me get tough with you.

950
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,420
I'm not a busybody.

951
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,080


952
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,080


953
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,380
Don't go.

954
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,620


955
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,950
You're going to be a busybody?

956
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,400


957
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,580
You're going to protect her?

958
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,690


959
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,270
You're going to be her hero?

960
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,830


961
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,350
Fine.

962
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,900


963
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,990
Today, you started a feud

964
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,070


965
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,670
with Heavenly Society.

966
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,580


967
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,030
What did I do?

968
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,030


969
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,430
Why are you wearing a mask?

970
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,630
You offended someone
from Heavenly Society?

971
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,130


972
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,880


973
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,150
What do you want?

974
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,630
Remove your mask.

975
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,240


976
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940


977
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,310
There's nothing wrong with my proposal.

978
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,030
Why didn't you approve it?

979
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,620


980
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,470


981
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,750
The marketing department
needs to create a hot topic.

982
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,300


983
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,870
Xiao Lin Lin.

984
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,420


985
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,630
According to my proposal,

986
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,790


987
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,150
you and I will become
male and female ambassadors.

988
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,750
We'll carry out a series
of offline activities

989
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,350


990
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,630


991
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,870
such as the marriage ceremony in Pangu

992
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,280


993
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,590
and male and female
group social activities.

994
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,150
There's nothing wrong with that.

995
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,760


996
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,190
Ms. Zhang.

997
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,770


998
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,490


999
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,510
Your thoughts and creativity
in this proposal

1000
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,340


1001
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,790
are really great.

1002
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,820


1003
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:14,830
But based on

1004
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,550


1005
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,870
the current situation,

1006
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,270
I still think

1007
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,660


1008
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,980
that it isn't appropriate.

1009
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,510


1010
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,210


1011
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,390
But...

1012
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,190


1013
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,710
Okay, got it.

1014
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,870
Ms. Zhang mentioned about
a hot topic just now, right?

1015
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,270


1016
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,700


1017
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,110
It's here.

1018
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,860


1019
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,430
Bai Wei came for a job interview.

1020
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,540


1021
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,860
Now?

1022
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,780


1023
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,950
She didn't make any appointments,

1024
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,110


1025
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,550
nor did she apply through
our company's hiring system.

1026
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,410


1027
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,820
She came alone.

1028
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,610


1029
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,070
Correction.

1030
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,050


1031
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,430
She's not alone.

1032
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,430
She attracted many reporters here.

1033
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,000


1034
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,550
No wonder I saw her yesterday.

1035
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,110


1036
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,470
She said she
was just accompanying a friend.

1037
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,970


1038
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,660


1039
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,270
She was preparing for this.

1040
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,950
The popular Master of AR sports

1041
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,940


1042
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,050


1043
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,670
came to Celeste Group for a job interview.

1044
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,250


1045
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,710
Ms. Zhang.

1046
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,910
Is this hot topic good enough
for the marketing department?

1047
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,280


1048
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,220


1049
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,550
Let's go meet her.

1050
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,690


1051
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,230
Wait up.

1052
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,170


1053
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,750
Thank you.

1054
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,850


1055
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,230
Hi, I'm Bai Wei.

1056
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,120


1057
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,590
Have a seat.

1058
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,430
Since we know each other,

1059
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,390


1060
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,300


1061
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,740
I'll be straightforward with you.

1062
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,800


1063
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,310
Actually, I'm curious about

1064
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,060


1065
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,590
why an AR star player like you

1066
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,750


1067
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,190
would want to work in our company.

1068
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,510
Here's why, Mr. Lin.

1069
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,240


1070
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,830


1071
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,950
Ever since esports was developed,

1072
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,730


1073
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,750
we only took two years to transit

1074
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,720


1075
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,230
from traditional media
to AR fighting championship.

1076
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,020


1077
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,230
Hence I believe

1078
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,460


1079
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,470
that Pangu's virtual space

1080
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,950
will become the next
ideal platform for esports.

1081
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,380


1082
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,860


1083
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,070
So, I want to be prepared

1084
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,340


1085
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,390
and get to know more

1086
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,510


1087
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,900
about Pangu's operating system.

1088
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,090


1089
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,500
Be prepared?

1090
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,270
Ms. Bai Wei.

1091
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,760


1092
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,470
Are there any misunderstandings here?

1093
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,830


1094
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,980


1095
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,990
Although you're a popular star player

1096
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,280


1097
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,470
in AR fighting championships,

1098
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,150
this job opportunity
provided by Celeste Group

1099
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,780


1100
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,180


1101
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,190
is not for you

1102
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,720


1103
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,230
to try out a new industry.

1104
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,670
I totally understand.

1105
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,330


1106
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,580


1107
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,590
If you compare me

1108
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,540


1109
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,110
with an experienced programmer,

1110
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,420


1111
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,430
I'm no match for them

1112
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,250


1113
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,980
in terms of working ability.

1114
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,340


1115
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,430
But in terms of media attention
and coverage,

1116
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,110


1117
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,630
I'm confident to surpass them.

1118
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,120


1119
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,750
Does your company need a worker

1120
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,460
or a public figure

1121
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,500


1122
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,030
who can bring media influence

1123
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,020


1124
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,710
and attention?

1125
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,520


1126
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,950


1127
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,310
Which one is more important to you?

1128
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,730


1129
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,230
I'm sure Mr. Lin already has an answer.

1130
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,280


1131
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,350
But...

1132
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,390


1133
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,430
Pardon me.

1134
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,750
I haven't finished talking.

1135
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,320


1136
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,650


1137
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,030
Regarding my working ability,

1138
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,330


1139
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,380
I'm aware that your company

1140
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,900


1141
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,270
encourages imagination and innovation.

1142
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,270


1143
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,470
I may be a blank paper,

1144
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,500


1145
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,510
but I'm confident

1146
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,590
that I can contribute
my personal space creation

1147
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,280


1148
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,930


1149
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,230
in building an integrated system
for Pangu.

1150
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,070


1151
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,660
Let me demonstrate.

1152
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,020


1153
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,070
What are you trying to do?

1154
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,940


1155
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,420
You'll find out very soon.

1156
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,040


1157
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,470
Are you in a hurry to leave?

1158
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,270
What do you want from me?

1159
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,910


1160
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,800


1161
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,350
I want to see your face.

1162
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,980


1163
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,350
Interesting.

1164
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,000


1165
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,070
This is the specific character model
and data actions

1166
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,860


1167
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,230
I usually apply during game practices.

1168
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,350
I'm willing to authorize your company

1169
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,280


1170
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,330


1171
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,830
to use my personal data actions.

1172
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,110
When you run
the action system for Pangu

1173
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,900


1174
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,520


1175
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,740
or adjust the characters' movements,

1176
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,340


1177
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,350
it'll be easier, more convenient

1178
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,080


1179
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,430
and smoother.

1180
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,110
What's so great about that?

1181
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,960


1182
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,260


1183
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,270
To be honest, I'm taken aback

1184
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,050


1185
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,430
by your sincerity.

1186
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,500


1187
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,870
Let's cut the chase.

1188
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,960


1189
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,430
Which department are you interested in?

1190
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,470
The planning department.

1191
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,090


1192
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,850


1193
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,230
Okay. You'll be under one-month probation.

1194
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,030


1195
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,070
If you don't meet our expectations

1196
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,270


1197
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,830
or job requirements,

1198
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,330


1199
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,550
you'll be dismissed anytime.

1200
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,180


1201
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,510
Of course.

1202
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,080
So, it's a yes?

1203
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,790


1204
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,320


1205
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,590
Attention! Stand in line!

1206
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,510


1207
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,990
Hurry up!

1208
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,740
Madam.

1209
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,380


1210
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:33,750


1211
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:33,910
Madam!

1212
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:35,970


1213
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,270
How did it go?

1214
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,950
Did you teach him a lesson?

1215
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,540


1216
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:38,870


1217
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,230
Teach him a lesson?

1218
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,660


1219
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,220
Why would I?

1220
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,570


1221
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,950
After all the beatings I took

1222
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,130


1223
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,230
and this scheme we plotted,

1224
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,380


1225
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,710
wasn't it because you wanted him
to learn a lesson?

1226
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,130


1227
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,270
Learn a lesson?

1228
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,470


1229
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,750
Invincible.

1230
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,400


1231
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,910
You're the one
who needs to learn a lesson.

1232
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,920


1233
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,030
I've received complaints recently

1234
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,240


1235
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,590
saying that you're
causing trouble everywhere.

1236
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,150


1237
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,470
Madam, don't believe the rumors.

1238
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,760


1239
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,830
I, Invincible...

1240
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,350


1241
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,390
Zip it!

1242
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,540


1243
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,630
Madam, I, Invincible...

1244
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,010


1245
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,070
Zip it!

1246
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,500


1247
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,750
Madam, let me explain!

1248
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,980


1249
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,350
Madam!

1250
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,700


1251
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,790
Madam, let me explain.

1252
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,390


1253
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,830
I'm cutting your pay.

1254
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,150
Madam.

1255
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,820


1256
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,700


1257
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,030
I won't explain myself.

1258
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,690


1259
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,990
It's my fault.

1260
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,430


1261
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,510
In the future, I'll become a loving

1262
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,290


1263
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,590
and civilized member of Heavenly Society.

1264
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,480


1265
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,750
Listen up.

1266
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,190


1267
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,510
If anyone of you
create troubles outside,

1268
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,540


1269
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,870
you'll be expelled.

1270
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,610


1271
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,990
Also,

1272
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,230


1273
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,630
you'll get a pay cut!

1274
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,410


1275
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,750
Madam.

1276
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,190
Gather everyone in the society

1277
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,970


1278
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,090


1279
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,510
to find this man.

1280
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,190


1281
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,590
It's him?

1282
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,010


1283
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,150
Madam, you're confusing me.

1284
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,000


1285
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,310
What are you doing?

1286
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,980


1287
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,990
I'm just curious.

1288
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,910
What does he really look like?

1289
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,820


1290
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,910
Because of him,

1291
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,900


1292
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,820


1293
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,230
Bai Wei fought the King of Wolves
so many times.

1294
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,780


1295
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,230
She even held a high-profile
marriage with him in Pangu.

1296
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,790


1297
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,030
He must be good-looking.

1298
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,429
That might not be true.

1299
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,260


1300
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,440


1301
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,510
He might be ugly.

1302
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,370


1303
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,670
He doesn't want to scare people.

1304
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,929


1305
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,110
He's good looking. So good looking.

1306
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,020


1307
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:26,190
-What a handsome and talented man.
-Enough. Hurry up and find him.

1308
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,929


1309
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,340
Okay.

1310
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,260


1311
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,710
Remember this face.

1312
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,340


1313
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,630
Later,

1314
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,030


1315
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,429
I need you to search for him

1316
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,860


1317
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,870
in the city and remote areas.

1318
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,350


1319
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,670
Follow me.

1320
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:34,800


1321
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,469
Let's go.

1322
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:35,889


1323
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,659
Let's go.

1324
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,500


1325
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,510
Today, I'm deeply honored

1326
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,270


1327
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,510
and very happy

1328
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,030
to have Ms. Bai Wei

1329
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,690


1330
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,770


1331
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,949
joining our big family in Celeste Group.

1332
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,600


1333
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,989
She didn't come for a job interview.

1334
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,520


1335
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,830
She came for Xiao Lin Lin.

1336
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,260


1337
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,389
Mr. Lin.

1338
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,989


1339
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,070
Are you going to

1340
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,070


1341
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,590
start developing a new game?

1342
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,490


1343
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,790
You'll find out soon.

1344
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,540


1345
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,550
Xiao Qiao.

1346
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,780


1347
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,790
I can't believe you brought me here

1348
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,860


1349
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,870
in such a short time.

1350
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,620


1351
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,630
You're amazing.

1352
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,540


1353
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,030
Of course.

1354
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,650


1355
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,830
Do you know how scary it was just now?

1356
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,200


1357
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,310
Why didn't you tell me that you'll be

1358
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,430


1359
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,790
joining our planning department?

1360
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,680


1361
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:16,710
Xiao Qiao.

1362
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,070
Is this Pangu's core region?

1363
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,020


1364
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,910


1365
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,110
Pangu's most primitive and core system

1366
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,800


1367
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,110
is stored in there.

1368
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,690


1369
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,070
The security seems to be strict.

1370
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,960


1371
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,030
Of course.

1372
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,420


1373
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,990
This is the core of Pangu.

1374
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,650


1375
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,870
If something goes wrong,

1376
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,550
Pangu will be doomed.

1377
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,110


1378
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,750


1379
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,750
Ever since that accident with Director Ye,

1380
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,230
Mr. Lin reset the entire security system.

1381
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,930


1382
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,760


1383
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,830
Only the ones appointed
are allowed to enter.

1384
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,750


1385
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,190
Other people can't go in.

1386
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,430
Let's take a look.

1387
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,150


1388
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,990


1389
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,350
Xiao Qiao.

1390
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,060


1391
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,110
I remember you telling me

1392
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,970


1393
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,430
that planning department
is allowed to enter.

1394
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,700


1395
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,830
It's not like that.

1396
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,020


1397
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,070
Every quarter of the year,
we'll send someone in

1398
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,490


1399
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,750
to manage the master plan.

1400
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,880


1401
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,990
That's why we can enter.

1402
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,020


1403
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,430
Like the end of this month.

1404
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,640


1405
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,980
I see.

1406
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,380


1407
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,390
Why are you suddenly

1408
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,300


1409
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,830
so interested in our company?

1410
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,740


1411
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,750
I'm just curious

1412
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,800


1413
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,310
because I don't understand.

1414
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,020


1415
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,110
Wei Wei.

1416
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,300


1417
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,630
Something is off with you recently.

1418
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,900


1419
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,950
You got married to Xiao Liang

1420
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,260


1421
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,390
and came to work at Celeste Group.

1422
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,310


1423
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,710
You didn't even tell me.

1424
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,980


1425
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,990
In the past,

1426
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,430


1427
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,750
you would at least discuss it with me.

1428
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,460


1429
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,830
You're overthinking.

1430
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,390


1431
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,750
Who wouldn't?

1432
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,050


1433
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,350
In the phone call that day,

1434
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,990


1435
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,270
you said someone you like
proposed to you.

1436
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,580


1437
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,590
I asked if it was Zhao Jia Liang

1438
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,380


1439
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,550
but you denied it.

1440
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,470
In the end, you got married to him.

1441
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,150


1442
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,700


1443
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,710
Well...

1444
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,500


1445
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,510
I don't even know

1447
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,430
if you're telling the truth or lying now.

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,310


1449
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,390
I see it now.

1450
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,120


1451
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,510
Someone is jealous
because of Zhao Jia Liang.

1452
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,670
No, I'm not.

1453
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,310


1454
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,110
You're still going to deny it?

1455
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,650


1456
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,090


1457
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,710
Listen to me.

1458
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,210


1459
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,270
I entered Pangu

1460
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,500


1461
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,510
just to experience

1462
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,750


1463
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,150
their marriage system.

1464
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,860


1465
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,870
I'm sure you know

1466
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,750


1467
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,870
that you and Zhao Jia Liang
are my only friends.

1468
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,110


1469
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,470
I can't get married to you, right?

1470
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,390


1471
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,710
Right?

1472
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,310
So, my only choice is Zhao Jia Liang.

1473
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,920


1474
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,220


1475
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,230
I'm sure you know

1476
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,350


1477
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,710
that he's like a brother to me.

1478
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,990


1479
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,350
So, don't worry.

1480
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,350
Fine. I'll forgive you.

1481
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,190


1482
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,180


1483
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,430
You forgive me?

1484
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,140


1485
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,470
There's no next time.

1486
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,170


1487
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,510
Got it.

1488

1489
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,270
In the future,

1490

1491
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,350
I'll surely inform

1492

1493
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,030

1494

1497
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,870
Let's go. Off to work.

1498

I'm sorry, Ms. Zhang.

We'll leave now.

I'm Zhang Yun Er, vice general manager
of the marketing department.

1529
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,670
Work hard.

1538
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,110
It looks like

by having her join Celeste Group.

Instead of saying
this is a win-win situation,

1543
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,510
it's more like she's using

Even if we're colleagues,

1606

I told you not to look for me.

Why didn't you listen?

You must have missed me.

No.

1618

00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,710
I gave your body back to Celeste Group.

1625
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,150


1626
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,340
I don't know

1627
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,030


1628
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,430
if anyone will harm you.

1629
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,760


1630
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,830
You wanted to draw
a line with me, right?

1631
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,780


1632
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,070
We're even now.

1633
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,470
You're lying.

1634
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,120


1635
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,730


1636
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,150
Nothing escapes your eyes.

1637
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,460


1638
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,750
What is it? Say it.

1639
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,740


1640
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,750
Let's talk inside.

1641
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,750
Come on.

1642
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,470


1643
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,030
Let's talk inside.

1644
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,650


1645
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,000


1646
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,310
Exit now.

1647
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,810


1648
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,350
Tell the company

1649
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,470
to cancel everything.

1650
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,180


1651
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,910
Why?

1652
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,570


1653
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,670
I don't see a problem with this proposal.

1654
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,240


1655
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,070
I'll work in the planning department
until the end of this month.

1656
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,790


1657
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,710


1658
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,710
We will take turns to exit

1659
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,510
during the update of downloadable content.

1660
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,280


1661
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,300


1662
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,310
Then you can officially join

1663
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,010


1664
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,030
the planning department.

1665
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,990


1666
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,470
I disagree.

1667
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,070


1668
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,270
The internal of our company
is very complicated.

1669
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,200


1670
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,270
Moreover, you lack knowledge

1671
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,960


1672
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,550
in designing the game

1673
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,940


1674
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,180
and have a sensitive identity.

1675
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,220


1676
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,270
Joining the company so abruptly,

1677
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,500


1678
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,030
you'll attract the wrong attention.

1679
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,210


1680
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,310
If they found out that we're related,

1681
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,270


1682
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,380
it'll put you in greater danger.

1683
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,910


1684
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,990
Do you understand?

1685
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,900


1686
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,910
This is my business.

1687
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,040


1688
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,350
I'm willing to do it.
You can't stop me.

1689
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,510


1690
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,910
Why don't you ever listen?

1691
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,270


1692
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,550
You wanted to stop seeing me
for the sake of my safety.

1693
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,500


1694
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,620
You want me to quit the job
because it's dangerous.

1695
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,630


1696
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,670
When will you

1697
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,340


1698
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,350
stop using your subjective thinking

1699
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,180


1700
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,190
to view a problem,

1701
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,690


1702
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,060
Ye Tian?

1703
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,330


1704
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,910
I'm not as weak as you think I am.

1705
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,330


1706
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,470
But if you really want me to leave,

1707
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,580


1708
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,630
just tell me

1709
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,290


1710
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,430
that you want me gone

1711
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,140


1712
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,310
and you never want to see me again.

1713
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,570


1714
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,070
If so,

1715
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,150
I guess I must have been delusional.

1716
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,690


1717
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,190
You won't see me ever again.

1718
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,000


1719
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,350
I promise.

1720
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,200


1721
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,710
I'm not as weak as you think I am.

1722
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,310


1723
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,120


1724
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,390
But if you really want me to leave,

1725
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,580


1726
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,590
just tell me

1727
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,250


1728
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,260
that you want me gone

1729
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,080


1730
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,230
and you never want to see me again.

1731
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:55,540


1732
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,070
If so,

1733
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,530


1734
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,070
I guess I must have been delusional.

1735
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,890


1736
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,110
You won't see me ever again.

1737
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,950


1738
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,390
I promise.

1739
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,750
I have a feeling

1740
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,420


1741
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,380


1742
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,390
she didn't join our company

1743
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,010


1744
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,390
just for fun.

1745
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,240


1746
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,310
She must have a greater ambition.

1747
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,390
Then let's watch and see

1748
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,350


1749
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,770


1750
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,310
what she will do.

1751
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,410


1752
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,670
Then I'm also looking forward

1753
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,350
to seeing if she'll ignite

1754
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,090


1755
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,670
an unexpected spark with someone.

1756
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,060
