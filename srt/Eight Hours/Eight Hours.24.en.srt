Lin Feng?

181
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,270
Xiao Tian!

182
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,110


183
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,730


184
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,870
It's Lin Feng!

185
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,700


186
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,710
I told you.

187
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,790
He'll come to me.

188
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,650


189
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,900


190
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,909
Lin Feng!

191
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,510
Lin...

192
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,570


193
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,860


194
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,870
No way!

195
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,710


196
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,830
Why do you stop me?

197
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,140


198
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,150
We'll go together.

199
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,500


200
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,590
You...

201
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,100


202
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,110
Why are you stopping me?

203
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,570


204
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,590
Then...

205
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,430


206
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,710
Hush!

207
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,350
That's Lin Feng.

208
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,280


209
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,659


210
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,670
He's my best friend.

211
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,810


212
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,950
I told you before.

213
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,790
Don't you know him too?

214
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,580


215
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,030
Bai Wei,

216
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:55,880


217
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,750
are you overly anxious?

218
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,610


219
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,460
What if I put it this way?

220
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,330


221
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,750
Now I'm trapped in this

222
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,740


223
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,020


224
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,310
so-called world, known as Pangu.

225
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,900


226
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,070
The only person who can save me from here

227
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,350
is him.

228
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,290


229
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,940


230
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,950
He's my second-in-command,

231
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,420


232
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,430
senior engineer in Celeste.

233
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,790
How could he possibly harm me?

234
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,650


235
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620


236
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,630
He won't help you.

237
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,070
Why?

238
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,930


239
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,710
I chose to keep it from you because

240
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,610


241
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,910
I was afraid you wouldn't
be able to accept it.

242
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,850


243
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,750
The reason you are in this situation

244
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,640


245
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,790
is because of your best friend.

246
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,620


247
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,409


248
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,390
How could he harm me?

249
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,010


250
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,020
The last person who could harm me is...

251
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,790


252
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,909
Ye Tian, you must trust me.

253
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,390
He's really not here to save you.

254
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,290


255
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,990


256
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,030
When you recover all your memories,

257
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,560


258
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,510
you will know that

259
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,950
I'm not lying to you.

260
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,730


261
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,070
Trust me, please?

262
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,040


263
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,430
Xiao Tian, I'm here.

264
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,340


265
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,270
Where are you?

266
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,140


267
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,070
I can't let you go.

268
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,070


269
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,380


270
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,390
He came to kill you.

271
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,250


272
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,390
You will die.

273
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,950
There is no way Lin Feng will kill me.

274
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,800


275
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,470
Xiao Tian!

276
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,360


277
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,990
You're really here.

278
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,830


279
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,670
Do you know how hard
I've been looking for you?

280
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,440


281
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,910
What's the matter?

282
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,830


283
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,150
Why aren't you talking?

284
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,220


285
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,790
Are you blaming me?

286
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,650


287
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,950
So you know everything.

288
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,660


289
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,670
Then, there is no point for me

290
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,430


291
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,110
to say more.

292
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,140


293
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,270
Yes, I have caused you harm.

294
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,110


295
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,710
But I really didn't intend to do it.

296
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,610


297
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,880


298
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,990
I wanted you to sleep for a few days

299
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,390


300
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,460
so that Pangu can be launched
as scheduled.

301
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,790
I never knew that

302
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,840


303
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,110
things would turn out this way.

304
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,190


305
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,710
So, Xiao Tian,

306
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,740


307
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,150
can you forgive me?

308
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,110


309
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,350
But by the way,

310
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,410


311
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,630
you can't blame me for everything.

312
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,560


313
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,380


314
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,390
You always had the final say

315
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,170


316
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,180
in the company.

317
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,550


318
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,710
No changes can ever be made.

319
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,030
So I merely

320
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,100


321
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,510
intended for you to sleep for a few days.

322
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,370


323
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,110
I never expected that

324
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,160


325
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,670
someone would harm you at the same time.

326
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,560


327
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,510
So, Xiao Tian,

328
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,390


329
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,150
you can't blame me for everything.

330
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,080


331
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,310
You need to reflect on yourself too.

332
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,190


333
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,110
What do you mean?

334
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,020


335
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,850


336
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,990
Am I a joke to you?

337
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,110
Yes, I'm a joke.

338
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,080


339
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,930


340
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,070
But it's all because of you.

341
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,630


342
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,750
I share your ambition
to reshape the industry.

343
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,670
My skills are on a par with yours.

344
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,680


345
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,270
I also put in all the effort for Celeste.

346
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,230


347
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,830
Why can she only see you but not me?

348
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,590


349
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,940


350
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,950
Just because your family is well off,

351
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,360


352
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,510
you're destined to be
superior to me, aren't you?

353
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,230


354
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,470
Xiao Tian.

355
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,230
I have an even funnier thing to tell you.

356
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,150


357
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,470
The person I love

358
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,330


359
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,390


360
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,430
would rather love a vegetable

361

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,030
Who's helping you?

544
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,040


545
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,350
Is it very important?

546
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,080


547
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,590
That's right.

548
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,570


549
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,710
After all,

550
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,650


551
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,150
I killed you once.

552
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,060


553
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:38,980


554
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,230
Xiao Tian,

555
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,510
if I say I regret it,

556
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,500


557
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,110
will you believe me?

558
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,970


559
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,430
You didn't choose to give up on me

560
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,440


561
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,270
no matter how wrong I was before.

562
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,070


563
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,710
Please give me a chance.

564
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,750


565
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,430
Let's just pretend it never happened

566
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,420


567
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,860


568
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,030
and start all over again, okay?

569
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,590
Another chance?

570
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,560


571
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,790
I gave you chances

572
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,840


573
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,630
not only because you are my best friend

574
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,640


575
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,100
but also because

576
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,240


577
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,750
there are not many people who are still
able to remember their initial intention

578
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,650


579
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,070
when Celeste has grown

580
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,060


581
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,790
to the size it is today.

582
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,800


583
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,500
But you've forgotten
your initial intention.

584
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,560


585
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,310
Let me ask you.

586
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,210


587
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,870
Knowing that the product
has a major safety concern

588
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,570


589
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,390
and still insisting on
bringing it to market,

590
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,320


591
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,630
is that your initial intention?

592
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,670


593
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,670
I dare say

594
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,570


595
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,630
there has not been a single instance

596
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,720


597
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,230
of 2021 code error to date.

598
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,210


599
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,670
But you know it will definitely appear.

600
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,490


601
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,590
It's been years, Lin Feng.

602
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,700


603
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,670
How can you say that?

604
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,690


605
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,510
Don't you feel ashamed?

606
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,430


607
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,550
I think you're really funny.

608
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440


609
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,750
Where is your bottom line?

610
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,660


611
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,900


612
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,070
As an engineer

613
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,390
and Pangu's creator,

614
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,340


615
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,690


616
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,830
where is your bottom line?

617
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,550
Once, there was a person

618
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,490


619
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,350
who was my friend

620
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,350


621
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,510
and also my brother.

622
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,480


623
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,990
He's also my like-minded partner.

624
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,930


625
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,310
I gave him plenty of chances.

626
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,250


627
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,750
But today,

628
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,700


629
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,470
I can't give him another chance.

630
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,390


631
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,070
You're still the same.

632
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,040


633
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,030
Look at you.

634
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,050


635
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,830
Even when you're trapped in Pangu

636
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,960


637
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,950
and will be a goner soon,

638
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,800


639
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,950
you still think that

640
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,910


641
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,430
you're the only one in the whole of
Celeste who's doing the right thing.

642
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,400


643
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,870
Nothing anyone else says will be accepted,

644
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,940


645
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,870
nothing anyone else thinks is important.

646
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,840


647
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,910
Everyone

648
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,640


649
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,900
is a waste.

650
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,810


651
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,590
I don't understand

652
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:03,570


653
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,190
why

654
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,030


655
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,270
Bai Wei would fall for you,

656
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,360


657
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,670
the egomaniac!

658
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600


659
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,430
You broke the cure for the Master Healer.

660
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,290


661
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,950
This is the last matsutake
for the concoction.

662
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,890


663
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,070
Fine.

664
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,000


665
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,310
It can't be done.

666
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,320


667
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,540


668
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,580
[You have collected]

669
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,310
[three pieces of musk]

670
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,420


671
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,990
[calculus bovis and notoginseng,]

672

673
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,230
[and one piece of matsutake.]

674
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,230


675
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,310
You placed the matsutake here

676
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,190


677
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,910
to lure me in, right?

678
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,820


679
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,390
I remember

680
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,480


681
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,950
that you were the one who created

682
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,940


683
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,790


684
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,910
this world mission.

685
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,790
I think you know better than me about

686
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,760


687
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,380
the consequences of breaking
the world mission's item.

688
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360


689
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,540


690
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,750
Forced offline for 24 hours.

691
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,820
Goodbye.

692
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,710


693
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,860
There is no point in you doing this!

694
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,800


695
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,590
I will find you

696
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,540


697
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,110
wherever you go.

698
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,070


699
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,390
Take care.

700
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,360


701
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,310
Sure, I'll see you next time.

702
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,060


703
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,270
If the staff in the engineering department
didn't tell me,

704
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,140


705
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,270
I wouldn't have known

706
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,260


707
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,230
that the first person
to be banned for 24 hours

708
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,050


709
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,790
for sabotaging a world mission

710
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,780


711
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,660


712
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,670
would be Mr. Lin of Celeste.

713
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,670
if you have something to say,
just say it, Mr. Zhang.

714
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,630


715
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,420
Why didn't you tell me

716
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,310


717
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,950
that you can locate

718
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,940


719
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,190
Ye Tian's coordinates in Pangu?

720
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,130


721
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,870
If you ever withheld a sense
of cooperation between us,

722
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,710


723

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,790
Xiao Liang.

1260
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:44,890


1261
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,030
I know, Ms. Wei.

1262
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:45,940


1263
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,590
Ye Tian.

1265
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,390
Now that Zhang Hao Cheng
knows where I am hiding,

1266
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,290


1267
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,350
he won't let me go.

1268
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,200


1269
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,190
He won't let you go too

1270
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,060


1271
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,030
for good.

1272
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,910


1273
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,750
What should we do?

1274
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,620


1275
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,830
You might've escaped from Lin Feng
with the world mission,

1276
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,540


1277
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,830
but he'll still come to catch you

1278
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,920


1279
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,510
after 24 hours.

1280
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,360


1281
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,590


1282
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,900
If the two of them work together,

1283
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,030
we won't be able to escape.

1284
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,960


1285
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,620


1286
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,790
If he wants to play,

1287
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,830
I'll do my best

1288
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,880


1289
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,670
to play with him with all I have.

1290
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,750


1291
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,550
Le Le, I need your help.

1292
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,500


1293
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,350
I'm in.

1294
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,360


1295
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,590
But you need to promise me one thing.

1296
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,640


1297
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,350
Don't let what happened
to Jia Ping happen again.

1298
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,200


1299
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,540
I promise.

1300
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,430


1301
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,350
No matter if it's for Celeste or Pangu,

1302
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,140


1303
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,070
I won't let him have his way.

1304
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,930


1305
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,340
What should we do next?

1306
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,290


1307
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,430
Zhang Hao Cheng
is now desperate to kill me.

1308
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,360


1309
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,910
So he is definitely defenceless.

1310
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,810


1311
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,830
We'll use his

1315
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,310
to delete the root directory.

1316
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,060


1317
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:47,830
Good.

1318
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,740


1319
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,030
I'll lure him out.

1320
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,910


1321
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:05,470
Hello? Who is it?

1322
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,350


1323
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,270
Le Le?

1325
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,310
You want to see me?

1327
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,430
Say it. Where do you want to meet me?

1328
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,350


1329
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,550
Pangu?

1330
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,490


1331
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,950
Ah Li!

1332
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:27,800


1333
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,270
Boss.

1335
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,990
I've received a phone call just now.

1337
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,070
It's from Wang Le Le.

1338

1339
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,830
I'm sorry, Boss.

1340

1341
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,270
I was going to report to you.

1343
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,670
What else can you do

1344

1345
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,030

1347
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,910
I've sent the phone number to you.

Locate her immediately!

Wipe this mess clean. Got it?

1373
