00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,500


185
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,910
There is also a large gourd.

186
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,470
Is there wine in this?

187
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,230


188
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,580


189
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,870
So this is a barrier.

190
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500


191
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,590
I will stop playing with you.

192
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,170


193
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,270
Bye.

194
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,270


195
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,430
Big dummy.

196
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,430
It's really you.

197
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,190


198
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,870
How could it be?

199
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,720


200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,380


201
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,590
Yes, it's impossible.

202
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,320


203
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,470
Why are you avoiding me all the way?

204
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,720


205
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,830
You pretend not to know me.

206
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,170


207
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,110
NPC (non-player character)

208
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,710
won't answer people's questions.

209
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,470


210
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,920


211
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,150
This is not the place for you.

212
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,560


213
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,830
Leave now.

214
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,390


215
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,270
What's going on here?

216
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,550
I told you to leave.

217
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:09,910


218
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,070
Leave now.

219
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,520


220
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,750
Weak hands and feet,
you are deficient in calcium?

221
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,490


222
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,550
If you spill my medicine,

223
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,250


224
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,470
I won't let you go.

225
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,260


226
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,270
You haven't answered my question.

227
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,890


228
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,070
Tell me,

229
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,520


230
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,790
why are you in Pangu?

231
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,900


232
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,910
If you have a problem, just tell me.

233
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,630


234
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,830
I can help you.

235
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,350
I heard you had an accident.

236
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,050


237
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,250


238
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,390
I went to a lot of trouble
to see you in the hospital,

239
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,680


240
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,950
and I also conducted
a prayer session for you.

241
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,450


242
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,620
However,

243
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,780


244
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,990
you are here as if nothing happened.

245
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,780


246
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,910
You can stay here.

247
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,620


248
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,630
But you didn't participate
in the final with me,

249
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,630


250
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,830
you owe me an apology, don't you?

251
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,340


252
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,510
I don't like to be pressed down and talk.

253
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,030
Can you let go of me first?

254
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,940


255
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,710
No.

256
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,470


257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,170


258
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,350
Answer my questions first.

259
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,670
-Why are you...
-Where are the gods?

260
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,600


261
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,640


262
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,990
Searching for the stream,
the water sounds cold.

263
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,650


264
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,860
This is a blessed land
with spiritual rocks.

265
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,220


266
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,390
Bamboo Forest Drunken Monk.

267
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,140


268
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,390
Did you lure him here?

269
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,740


270
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,750
Otherwise, with his settings,

271
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,430
he would not have realized
that there were barriers.

272
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,180


273
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,530


274
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,540
Who told you to hide so well?

275
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,380


276
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,590
What choice did I have?

277
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,300


278
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
If we don't leave now,

279
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,150
it may really be too late.

280
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,970


281
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,250


282
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,350
Right, answer my questions now.

283
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,930


284
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,150
I shouldn't have saved you in the city.

285
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,180


286
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,190
It's just a game.

287
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,110


288
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,230
Why are you so nervous?

289
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,350
If we die, we will go offline.

290
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,260


291
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,430
There is no big deal.

292
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,320


293
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,250


294
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,430
Why are you so nervous?

295
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,500


296
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,510
For you, it's a game.

297
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,390


298
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,590
You can start over after dying.

299
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,120


300
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,310
But if I die, I'll really be gone.

301
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,360


302
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,550
What?

303
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,700


304
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,710
You are not connected
to the experience cabin

305
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,920


306
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,060
in the hospital,

307
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,380


308
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,670
so how did you enter Pangu?

309
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,150


310
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,510
I got it.

311
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,450


312
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,510
Your body is not connected
to the experience cabin.

313
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,050
[Confirm map information, find location]

314
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,810


315
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,110
So if you really die,

316
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,260


317
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,470
then your consciousness
won't be revived in your body.

318
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,810


319
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,820
Is that what you mean?

320
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,020


321
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,310
It means you will disappear.

322
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,420


323
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,590
Besides,

324
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,260


325
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,350
your body is not connected
to the experience cabin,

326
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,040


327
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,510
how did you...

328
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,230
Stop talking.

329
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:39,940


330
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:39,950
Let me tell you

331
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,110


332
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,230
the direction and plan of evacuation,

333
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,850


334
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,030
not a step...

335
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,790
Run!

336
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,630


337
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,330


338
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,510
What is it?

339
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,300


340
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,310
The Bamboo Forest Drunken Monk

341
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,140


342
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,150
is currently the most troublesome

343
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,220


344
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,230
wild elite ogre in the server.

345
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,900


346
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,910
I was trying so hard to avoid him

347
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,120


348
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,230
but you led him here.

349
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,090


350
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,270
Run!

351
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,350
Be careful, this drunken monk
is very difficult to deal with.

352
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,220


353
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,340


354
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,550
What are you looking at?

355
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,790


356
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:06,830
I...

357
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820


358
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,830
It's all your fault.

359
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,420


360
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,670
If he keeps on pestering me like this,
I'll be dead.

361
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,310
You go and lure him away

362
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,080


363
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:11,930


364
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,110
to make up for it.

365
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,000


366
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,230
I...

367
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,590
Okay, I can promise you that.

368
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,490


369
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,740


370
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,750
But when I settle him,

371
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,140


372
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,350
you have to tell me the whole story.

373
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,040


374
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,350
Deal.

375
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,580


376
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,740
Okay.

377
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,640


378
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,790
Don't do this to me.

379
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,710
Big dummy, bye!

380
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,560


381
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,640


382
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,990
It's settled.

383
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,750


384
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,950
He...

385
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,790
It's very simple.

386
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,580


387
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,010


388
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,030
His blood is so thick,

389
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,110


390
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,390
and so aggressive,

391
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,780


392
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,950
we should not have fought him head-on.

393
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,900


394
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,110
I've noticed it for quite some time.

395
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,050


396
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,070
I have noticed

397
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,140


398
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,270
that he subconsciously
avoided the bamboo around him.

399
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,840


400
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,150
So I guessed

401
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,660


402
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,870
that since the bamboo was designed here,

403
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,220


404
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,390
it must have a special meaning.

405
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,640


406
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,750
As they say, one subdues another.

407
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,350
Bamboo must be his nemesis.

408
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,130


409
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,790


410
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,990
You

411

412
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,180
are chased around by
an ogre of your own design.

413
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,680


414
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,870
Is it still the Pangu you developed?

415
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,870
What are you talking about?

416
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,600


417
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,510

Listen,

419

420
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,310
the reason I avoided him all the way

421
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,540


422
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,550
was to create an opportunity for you

423
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540


424
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,710
to realize this.

425

426
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,030
You don't even know this.

427

428
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,350
Thank you.

429

430
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,030

I guess I would run faster than you.

but you don't have time to listen.

440

Don't mention it, Bai Wei.

635
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,110
Mr. Ye's character model
seems so similar to his own.

636
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,980


637
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:55,990
His prayer session

638

639
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,270

641
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,150
It's selling well.

643
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,470
By the way, speaking of Mr. Ye,

644
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,540


645
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,550
I heard some particularly strange

646
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,590
internal gossip in
the test department yesterday.

647
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,400


648
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,640


649
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,030
I heard that the three hours
before and after he had an accident,

650
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,140


651
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,350
the test department's
CCTV footage was deleted.

652
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,290


653
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,510
I wonder who is to blame
or made a mistake.

654
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,590


655
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,830
Anyway, there is no discovery
after investigating half a day,

656
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,510


657
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,830
and now it's just left behind.

658
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,980


659
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,990
The higher-ups are afraid

660
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,640


661
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,910
that this matter will be hyped as news,

662
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,230


663
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,470
so the relevant departments
have been asked to keep a lid on it,

664
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,850


665
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,110
and now they still don't dare
to expose this matter.

666
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,540


667
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,670
Da Tou, is it done?

668
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,060


669
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,230
Done.

670
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,250


671
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,550
Wei, you can go back and log in directly.

672
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,130


673
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,310
Keep a low profile and
don't spread the word around.

674
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,270


675
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,510
Thanks, Da Tou.

676
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,900


677
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,910
Bye.

678
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,340


679
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,350
Done?

680
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,980


681
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,220
Wei Wei.

682
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,360


683
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,590
Zhao Jia Liang,

684
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,510
don't you think Wei Wei
has been acting very strange

685
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,230


686
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,910
since Mr. Ye's accident?

687
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,750


688
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,700
You've been thinking too much.

689
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,510


690
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,950
Someone

691
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,880


692
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,240


693
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,390
thinks no less than I do.

694
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,240


695
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,470
But the person Wei Wei cares about most

696
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,680


697
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,830
is never him.

698
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,590
Da Tou, your take-out
will be here soon, right?

699
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,390


700
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,500


701
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,700
I'll go get it.

702
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,270


703
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,590
Zhao Jia Liang.

704
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,970


705
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,110
I see

706
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,840


707
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,110
that someone is thinking
too much for Xiao Liang.

708
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,220


709
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,310
Anyway,

710
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,900


711
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,110
it looks like there is someone else
in Xiao Liang's heart.

712
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,670


713
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,870
Eat your popcorn.

714
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,660


715
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,670
Don't break it.

716
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,630
It's very expensive.

717
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,470


718
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,240


719
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,590
Take a look at this data set.

720
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,460


721
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,470
Why didn't anyone tell me in time

722
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,470


723
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,590
when something so serious happened?

724

1024

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,710
I don't get it.

1042
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,590
Your body is not connected
to the experience cabin,

1044
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,270
so how did you get into Pangu?

1045

1046
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,550
And why are you

1047

1048
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,110
trapped in Pangu?

1049
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,620


1050
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,630
Do you know that people outside are now

1052
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,710
rumouring that you are dead?

1054
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,430
Do you know

1055

that these potions that I have formulated

1056

1057
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,030
can cause the Pangu system
to crash temporarily?

1058
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,860


1059
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,220


1060
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,510
That's where I made a fool of myself.

1061
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,420


1062
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,430
I expected that the group

1064
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,750
would equip me with
a brainwave monitor outside

1065
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,020


1066
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,110
and this brainwave monitor
and the Pangu system

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,410


1068

1072
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,950

1076
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,750
