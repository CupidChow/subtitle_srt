00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,550
[It's fine, Mum.]

170
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,350
[Do you like this poster, Wei Wei?]

171
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,310
[Mum.]

172
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,230
[He is the master in AR gaming.]

173
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,350
[He's also my idol.]

174
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,510
[However,]

175
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,390
[I'll surpass him one day.]

176
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,630
[I must enter the qualifiers]

177
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,550
[and defeat him.]

178
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,110
[I believe in you.]

179
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,470
[You can do it.]

180
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,630
[But now, I've only]

181
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,910
[entered the trials.]

182
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,750
[I'm still far away from him.]

183
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,430
[A newbie]

184
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,510
[in the AR realm.]

185
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,950
[I still don't get to see him yet.]

186
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,790
[Silly girl, you'll meet him soon enough.]

187
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,150
Mum.

188
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,070
You're right.

189
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,430
I'm not just his opponent,

190
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,590
I'm on par with him.

191
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,350
Besides,

192
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,350
I actually fell in love with him.

193
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,830
Uncle Zhang.

194
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,550
You don't have to

195
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,390
discuss this trivial matter
with my father.

196
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,110
We'll go with it.

197
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,950
[Good, you're determined.]

198
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,070
[As expected from Mr. Ding's daughter.]

199
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,270
[The Deputy CEO of Ding Ge Funds]

200
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,750
[is a direct person.]

201
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,940
That's too much, Uncle Zhang.

202
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,950
[I shall not disturb you.]

203
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,910
[See you next week.]

204
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,510
[Goodbye.]

205
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,030
Who is it? Zhang Hao Cheng?

206
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,270
Your father

207
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,670
looks like discussing about Pangu 2.0,

208
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,790
but he's secretly crunching the numbers.

209
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,110
That's it about him. He's a bummer.

210
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,150
You're not mad because of him, are you?

211
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,310
You look agitated when I arrived just now.

212
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,350
What happened?

213
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,150
It's all because of Bai Wei.

214
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,900
Isn't she weird?

215
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,550
How can a master gamer like her

216
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,030
be so good at sales?

217
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,430
Xiao Lin Lin's eyes are

218
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,950
basically stuck on her.

219
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,190
I guess Bai Wei is good with herself.

220
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,510
I saw her in Pangu.

221
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,510
Yes, she's a frequent on Pangu.

222
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,350
Her name is...

223
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,230
Sea of Flowers.

224
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,310
She was fighting the demon wolf

225
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,390
in Pangu a few days ago.

226
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,270
She got married in there too.

227
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,470
Yes, that's her.

228
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,790
With a mask boy.

229
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,510
That is her team manager.

230
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,350
His name is Zhao Jia Liang.

231
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,750
I'm not interested in

232
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,190
his identity in real life.

233
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,430
But in Pangu,

234
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,470
his presence is different

235
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,270
from the aura he emits

236
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,750
in real life.

237
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,990
What is it?

238
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,230
It's...

239
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,590
I can't tell.

240
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,550
When I joined Pangu

241
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,830
and saw Bai Wei in there,

242
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,030
I thought that a master gamer

243
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,860
playing Pangu

244
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,110
would elevate its market value.

245
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,910
But Pangu's market value

246
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,230
is still underestimated.

247
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,350
Why am I telling you this?

248
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,470
I wish that you can

249
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,670
defeat Bai Wei in Celeste Group

250
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,270
and win Xiao Lin Lin over.

251
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,830
You too.

252
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,390
I hope that you can win over
your mask boy too.

253
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,030
Of course.

254
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,670
Cheers.

255
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,870
Still occupied?

256
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,870
Your cousin, Xiao Jia, was here.

257
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,110
Your cousin

258
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,150
hasn't seen you for years.

259
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,710
He heard that you're back

260
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,420
and rushed here to see you.

261
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,270
But you're not here

262
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,020
and he missed you again.

263
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,070
Yes, it's been a while.

264
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,630
Happy birthday.

265
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,230
Happy birthday.

266
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,360
I like it very much.

267
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,030
Why don't you wear it?

268
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,950
I'm not used to such exquisite watches.

269
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,070
I might break it.

270
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,990
You.

271
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,190
Did you skip your meal and drink?

272
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,630
I'll whip up something for you.

273
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,430
Wear it now.

274
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,790
I got it, Xiao Liang.

275
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,430
This player, Hunting Dog, is tracking

276
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,190
an experience cabin
with the code A8398X03.

277
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,150
A8398X03?

278
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,470
This sound like Ms. Wei's

279
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,790
experience cabin.

280
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,430
It can track its location?

281
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,990
Yes.

282
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,550
The location can be narrowed

283
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,110
when the user goes online according to
its IP address and finally

284
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,580
the exact location will be pinned.

285
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,470
However, it takes time.

286
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,829
How about it?

287
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,069
Make me a location chip for Pangu

288
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,990
and a virtual device.

289
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,589
Can you do it?

290
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,750
Alright, no problem.

291
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,750
Ms. Bai.

292
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,540
Can you sign for me?

293
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,869
[Bai Wei is so popular.]

294
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,579
What a haughty one.

295
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,470
The people in our office are
short-sighted.

296
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,750
Why do they like her?

297
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,950
They're spinning around her like flies.

298
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,630
We should find a way to contain her.

299
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,030
She is...

300
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,670
Bai Wei.

301
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,750
Why did you come in?

302
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,670
You like to play this too?

303
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,830
So-so.

304
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,710
Please close the door.

305
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,950
I'll get busy now, Ms. Zhang.

306
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,150
Hurry along.

307
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,550
Mr. Ye's father designed this gaming room.

308
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,110
After Mr. Ye took charge,

309
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,510
he's been expanding the office,

310
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,950
except this place.

311
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,630
No one in the whole company

312
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,350
except me would play with him.

313
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,990
How about a round?

314
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,300
Sure.

315
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,390
You're really good.

316
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,950
It's not weird to know.

317
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,870
You're a master gamer.

318
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,430
This is a piece of cake for you.

319
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,230
When Mr. Ye wakes up,

320
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,750
I'll ask him to play with you.

321
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,190
He won't know that you're good.

322
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,670
[You're the weak one.]

323
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,030
One more round.

324
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,630
Come.

325
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,510
Records are meant to be refreshed.

326
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,910
[Xiao Liang.]

327
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,990
Hello, Da Tou.

328
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,710
I just came out from Ms. Wei's house.

329
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,070
The chip you gave me

330
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,990
was swapped with Ms. Wei's

331
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,390
experience cabin.

332
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,630
I have turned on the virtual device too.

333
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,630
Are we good?

334
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,310
[Yes.]

335
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,830
No one will know the difference.

336
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,710
That means

337
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,950
if I'm carrying this,

338
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,150
the Hunting Dog who is

339
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,070
tracking Ms. Wei's experience cabin

340
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,910
will...

341
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,550
[Yes, they'll only find you.]

342
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,390
[It's for your safety, Ms. Wei.]

343
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,470
[This is what I can do.]

344
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,430
You guys didn't know

345
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,030
we were locked from the outside?

346
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,270
Would you even come

347
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,060
if I didn't call?

348
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,390
What are you doing in the CCTV room?

349
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,830
Caught in a daze?

350
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,590
Did I pay you to daydream?

351
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,630
Answer me!

352
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,670
Leave this to me, Xiao Lin Lin.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,430
Ridiculous!

354
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,630
What prank is this?

355
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,150
I have a new marketing plan.

356
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,830
Come and take a look.

357
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,910
Sure.

358
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,390
We'll continue next time.

359
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,990
Anytime.

360
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,670
Wei Wei, you and Mr. Lin...

361
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,550
Don't be nosy.

362
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,270
Xiao Qiao.

363
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,270
What's wrong?

364
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,550
Are you alright?

365
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,110
I'm fine.

366
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,990
I felt emotional for a while.

367
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,230
Some people will be popular
wherever they are.

368
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,270
But some people will have to
work hard for it.

369
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,950
People are different, right?

370
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,550
Just be yourself.

371
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,870
Don't mind the others.

372
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,950
No matter how capable others are,

373
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,390
they are doing it, right?

374
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,950
Nicely phrased.

375
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,260
What are you holding?

376
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,780
Fantasy Children's Day tickets.

377
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,270
You won't be interested.

378
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,950
Then why are you holding it?

379
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,950
Who are you inviting?

380
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,790
I'm inviting...

381
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,750
You're spinning

382
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,230
around me for a few times
with these tickets.

383
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,270
You didn't even invite me.

384
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,950
How would you know I'm not interested?

385
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,630
You're going?

386
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,100
Fantasy Children's Day.

387
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,110
It's for the day after tomorrow.

388
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,950
Don't forget!

389
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,670
Bye!

390
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,240
[Pangu]

391
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,390
[Your husband is online.]

392
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,670
Ye Tian is back.

393
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,030
I'll go back too.

394
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,230
What a coincidence. We meet again.

395
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,350
Have a look at the paper umbrellas!

396
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,630
Coincidence?

397
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,150
I don't think

398
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,350
the Heavenly Society will fail

399
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,790
to find someone here in Pangu.

400
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,830
Why are you alone?

401
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,030
Where's the mask boy?

402
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,070
Mask boy?

403
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,180
Well, well.

404
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,870
Do you mean my husband?

405
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,590
My husband should be happily

406
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,110
tidying up our nuptial room now.

407
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,340
Where did you move?

408
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,270
Your regular place

409
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,950
was spick and span.

410
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,910
We're hiding from inappropriate people.

411
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,030
So we're moving far away.

412
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,190
Who do you mean inappropriate?

413
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:00,870
That person

414
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,710
should know who I am talking about.

415
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,510
President, she's talking about you.

416
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,750
No, she meant me.

417
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,710
Everyone knows

418
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,630
that the capital's garden

419
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,950
is the best of the best
in the Heavenly Society.

420
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,950
You can come

421
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,510
with us if you need some flowers.

422
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,190
Thank you for the kind gesture.

423
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,110
But I think

424
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,270
regardless of the garden

425
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,230
and the flowers,

426
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:23,950
they don't matter.

427
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,230
What matters is my husband.

428
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,710
He loves flowers growing
in actual gardens.

429
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,630
Those wild flowers

430
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,470
are not his type.

431
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,350
She's badmouthing you again!

432
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,710
But he must love flowers.

433
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,020
Why the name Sea of Flowers then?

434
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,270
I don't have to explain this to you.

435
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,190
Till next time.

436
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,190
Bai Wei.

437
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,470
Bai Wei!

438
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,060
[I'm buying some flowers in the capital.]

439
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,910
[I will be back soon!]

440
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,470
We agreed to it before.

441
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,590
She forgot about it.

442
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,350
Why the rush?

443
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,830
Do come to our place.

444
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,150
Join the Heavenly Society!

445
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,470
I'm sorry.

446
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm used to freedom.

447
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,030
I'll never join a society.

448
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,350
Are you forcing me to stay, Ms. Ding?

449
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,870
So what if I am?

450
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,910
Ms. Ding.

451
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,950
You might have the most users
here in Pangu,

452
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,590
but you can't force some people to stay.

453
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,310
How about this?

454
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,350
If you can withstand ten moves from me,

455
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,790
I'll let you go.

456
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,110
[He's online now.]

457
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,110
[Why should I be scared?]

458
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,790
Alright, please guide me then.

459
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,300
Why exert yourself, Ms. Ding?

460
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,550
Such trivial matters

461
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,550
can be done by me.

462
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,510
I'm telling you.

463
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,030
If you can withstand ten blows from me,

464
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,390
I'll release you.

465
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,190
Ouch!

466
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,990
Ouch!

467
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,030
Ouch!

468
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,590
Ouch!

469
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,030
Ouch!

470
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,830
Are you nuts?

471
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,030
Did I say I was ready?

472
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,350
Ms. Ding!

473
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,590
Ms. Ding!

474
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,670
She...

475
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,910
I...

476
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,150
Avenge me!

477
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,870
Sure.

478
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,910
My high-class equipment

479
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,470
surpass everything you have.

480
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,670
Seven more moves.

481
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,550
Be careful.

482
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,110
Thanks for the reminder.

483
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,990
[High-class equipment?]

484
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,350
[We're incomparable.]

485
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,620
High-class orange level round sabres.

486
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,380
Try to block it!

487
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,310
Nice weapons.

488
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,350
Bad commandeering.

489
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,830
Really?

490
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,630
Five moves left.

491
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,510
Two moves left.

492
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,350
I'll just need one.

493
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,030
It's the last move.

494
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,910
Let's end it here.

495
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,710
We're going one on one.

496
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,140
Why are you crashing the party?

497
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,350
You forgot what you promised.

498
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,350
You never listen.

499
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,270
It's my fault.

500
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,230
I won't do it again.

501
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,910
You won't do it again?

502
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,390
Let's go.

503
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,030
Leaving so soon?

504
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,590
What do you want?

505
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,110
It's rare for you to be here.

506
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,230
Let's have a meal together.

507
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,630
No, thank you.

508
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,110
Sure.

509
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,030
We'll eat with you.

510
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,910
For your sake.

511
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,870
With her?

512
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,190
Let's go.

513
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,750
I understand, Ms. Ding.

514
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,070
Later at dinner,

515
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,870
I'll make the first move.

516
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,270
You'll prepare the gear.

517
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,310
Pangu's cooking system

518
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,390
is not easy for anyone.

519
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,150
Not to mention about the recipes,

520
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,580
manpower is needed to obtain ingredients.

521
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,030
They need to run around the world.

522
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,190
If it's not for my number of members here,

523
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,790
it's difficult to even
cook this table of food.

524
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,110
Chicken with asparagus.

525
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,550
Rouge goose breast.

526
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,310
Braised chicken with red sauce.

527
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,950
Osmanthus cake with lotus root powder.

528
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,670
Try it, Handsome.

529
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,870
I'll try it.

530
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,110
Not bad.

531
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,110
In my opinion,

532
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,870
Pangu's wedding function

533
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,750
can be tweaked just a little.

534
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,990
To make it closer to reality.

535
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,190
After marriage,

536
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,710
cooking skills would be essential to a

537
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,630
marriage.

538
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,110
How many dishes do you know how to cook?

539
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,510
I can teach you a simple one.

540
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,870
I only know one dish.

541
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,530
[Opening the Inventory]

542
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,230
What is this?

543
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,350
It's so ugly.

544
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,070
You said you like to eat

545
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,390
the water-fried egg from the
old Kang family.

546
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,150
I asked Xiao Qiao about it.

547
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,870
Then, I took a picture of it

548
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,350
and converted it into 3D.

549
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,870
And you transferred it into Pangu

550
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,830
with the opposite calculation
of the server.

551
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,310
That's right.

552
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,390
This dish might be limited to Pangu,

553
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,190
but it's preset.

554
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,350
My presentation might not be the best.

555
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,950
This is the taste.

556
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,150
This is the taste!

557
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,510
It's delicious.

558
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,110
Do you have more?

559
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,870
You like it?

560
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,190
I'll make it for you everyday if you do.

561
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:06,990
Okay?

562
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,590
Okay.

563
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,780
I do agree with you, Ms. Ding.

564
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,430
I should make delicacies for my husband.

565
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,030
But,

566
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,950
I have to make
his favourite food, don't I?

567

Your mouth is all dirty.

[Prepare RMB2 billion of ransom

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,430
Hurry! Over there!

Hurry!

Search now!

576
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:18,710
Hey.

577
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,469
What's the story behind
the water-fried egg?

578
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm all ears.

579
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,070
I'll tell you next time.

580
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,469
So cute!

581
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,150
This is...

582
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,949
You forgot?

583
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,830
Your first kill of the fiends.

584
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,750
The achievement of
Bamboo Forest Drunken Monk.

585
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,190
Can I take it with me?

586
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,150
A memento.

587
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,470
You can't take it.

588
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,550
Even if you do,

589
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,590
it will still stay in Pangu.

590
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,550
No matter if it's Pangu

591
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,230
or the outside world,

592

I can't take my first trophy.

AR game trophy was broken too.

595
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,830
Are these ancient zithers?

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,470
This is couple-specified inventory.

597

Couple-specified inventory?

My hands are not listening to me too.

Oh no!

607
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,910
Looks like we're going to be
awkward for now.

608
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,150
It's so cool!

Mr. Lin.

Greetings, Mr. Lin.

613
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,470
We found him in a garage at the suburbs.

614
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,950
The police found

615
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,510
a large amount of his personal information

616
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,980
at the hideout.

617
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,030
Including some evidence

618
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,950
mentioning about the negotiation.

619
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,390
The suspect was not caught.

620
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,910
The police are searching now.

621
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,830
Their first assumption

622
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,070
is that this is a well-planned

623
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,230
kidnap and coercion.

624
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,030
If this is a kidnap,

625
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,630
we didn't receive any phone
calls from anyone,

626
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,230
right?

627
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,310
I don't think so.

628
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,350
The police are investigating it too.

629
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,750
By the way,

due to Ye Tian's public identity

631

and to avoid unnecessary disturbance
to the public,

632
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,190
the police don't want to expose the case

633

before the perpetrator gets caught,

634
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,870
including their investigation.

Xiao Lin.

636
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,700
In order to stabilize the company,

637
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,110
this is also our consensus.

Xiao Lin.

639
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,950
Why are you looking at me like that?

640
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,710
It's nothing.

Mr. Zhang, Mr. Lin.

Mr. Zhang.

643
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,670
After our discussion with the police,

644
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,070
the police will be in charge of

645
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,910
Mr. Ye's security in the hospital.

646
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,870
This situation will never happen again.

647

Please be assured.

648
