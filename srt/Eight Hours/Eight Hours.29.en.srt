I can't tell you.

188

Bai Wei, where are you going?

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,050

Sit here.

[Oh, no.]

[If we're going to Paradise Island,
it will be troublesome.]

Where are you going?

I have something to do at 8pm.

I have to go home.

You can't.

224
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,910
You're one of the main figures this time.

226
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,230
No way.

227

228
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,990
I really have something to do.

230
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,470
It's not up to you.

231
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,320


232
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,270
I hardly got a chance
to dress up like this.

234
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,990
Yes.

236
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,750
It must be fun over there.

238
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,970


239
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,150
I think so too.

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,950
You are so reluctant to
go on a team building trip?

241
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,750


242

I didn't have anything ready.

You don't want to make everyone unhappy

the core team, do you?

248

Celeste is a group.

250
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,510
It has its own measure of loyalty.

252
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,990

254
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,950

Will the company throw a party for you?

Mr. Zhang doesn't approve of

your relationship with Mr. Lin?

Whether he approves or not,

he can't stop me from
being with Xiao Lin Lin.

It's a secret.

365
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,970


366
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,150
When you come to Pangu, you will find out

367
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,890


368
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,070
that your husband

369
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,190
is a successful man.

370
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,760


371
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,790
Ordinary but great.

372
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,460


373
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,510
Bai Wei?

374
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,370


375
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,640


376
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,910
Bai Wei!

377
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,460


378
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,470
Don't you ever bother us again!

379
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,590


380
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,710
We don't want to play with you anymore.

381
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,300


382
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,470
We are all ordinary workers.

383
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:41,940


384
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:41,950
Stop!

385
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,130


386
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,150
Bai Wei, what are you doing?

387
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,850


388
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,950
Hurry up and get away!

389
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,990
Look at the ground.

390
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,810


391
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:45,770


392
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,910
What is this?

393
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,700


394
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,830
What… What is this?

395
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,710


396
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,910
Is it a pet?

397
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,550


398
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
It's so cute.

399
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,290


400
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,590
No.

401
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,630
Listen.

402
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,650


403
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,830
Don't fool with me again...

404
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880


405
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,330


406
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,590
[How could this happen?]

407
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,780


408
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,790
Get over here

409
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,400


410
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,630
and stand behind me.

411
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,980


412
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,990
This… This is…

413
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,550


414
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,750
Try and see if you can go offline now

415
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,670
Offline?

416
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,550


417
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,780


418
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,790
I am asking you to try and go offline now.

419
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,360


420
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,510
Hurry up.

421
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,140


422
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,310
Where is my bracelet?

423
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,590
Why can't I go offline?

424
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,360


425
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,560


426
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,750
This is not scientific.

427
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,370


428
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,830
You're in hot water.

429
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,500


430
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,590
We have arrived.

431
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,860


432
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,950
Everyone, pay attention.

433
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,210


434
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,220
We are about to reach Paradise Island.

435
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,110
Let's

436
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,170


437
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,470
enjoy the sun and sand then!

438
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,350


439
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,520


440
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,790
That's great!

441
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,150


442
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,430
Let's go.

443
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,660


444
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,670
Linda,

445
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,150
are there experience cabins on the island?

446
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,040


447
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,510


448
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,670
Supply is tight even in urban areas,

449
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,730


450
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,230
not to mention the suburbs.

451
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,740


452
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,750
I'm sorry, I have a stomach ache.

453
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,180


454
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,190
I'm having my period.

455
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,820


456
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,910
I'll go back first.

457
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,390
You have asked for leave
every week this month

458
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,350


459
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,170


460
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,390
because of your period.

461
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,230
What's going on?

462
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,300


463
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,270
I'm really having a stomach ache.

464
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,260


465
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,630
I forgot to turn off the stove
in my house.

466
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,670


467
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,550
I really have to go back.

468
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,530


469
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,180
The road back to town is so jammed now.

470
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,110


471
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,830
It's too late even if you go back now.

472
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,590


473
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,330


474
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,670
I'm sorry.

475
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,990


476
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,030
I am really not ready
for the team building.

477
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
I'm not going.

478
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,850


479
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,470


480
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,710
Goodbye.

481
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,150


482
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,270
Hold on.

483
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,310
Don't come back to the core team
if you leave now.

484
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,190


485
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,530


486
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,550
This is just a team building

487
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,400


488
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,710
but you can't even get used to it.

489
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,550
The core team doesn't need such people.

490
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,520


491
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,880


492
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,150
Bai Wei.

493
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,790
You don't have to worry
about the experience cabin.

494
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,599


495
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,470


496
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,750
I promise you,

497
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,700


498
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,030
I'll definitely get a few over.

499
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,240


500
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,550
Okay?

501
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,240


502
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,630
Xiao Lin Lin.

503
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,390
I have something to tell Bai Wei.

504
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,910


505
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,630
Let's go.

506
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,480


507
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,710


508
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,940
Bai Wei,

509
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,220


510
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,670
I want to surprise Lin Feng.

511
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,270
Get straight to the point.

512
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,830


513
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,670
When the time comes,

514
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,470


515
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,980
I would like to ask you a favour.

516
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,800


517
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,020


518
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:37,990
What is that?

519
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,510
Actually, I always know in my heart

520
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,360


521
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,070
that Xiao Lin Lin likes you.

522
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,700


523
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,580


524
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,590
I told you that…

525
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,440


526
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,630
Let me finish my sentence.

527
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,820
Xiao Lin Lin has always liked you

528
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,570


529
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,990
and it's the same even now.

530
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,700


531
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,510
I have no feelings for him.

532
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,490


533
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,230


534
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,430
It's you who has misunderstood.

535
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,310
A woman's intuition is very accurate.

536
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,900


537
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,390
I could tell you're his type of girl

538
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,220


539
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,510
from the first moment

540
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,280


541
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,950
he laid eyes on you.

542
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,580


543
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,910
That's why

544
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,740


545
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,270


546
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,710
I've been against you all along.

547
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,530


548
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,790
I've made it clear to you.

549
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,420


550
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,510
I don't have any thoughts about him.

551
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,830


552
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,310
It's you who's overthinking it.

553
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,790
Actually, what I want to say is,

554
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,580


555
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,430


556
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,550
even if you like him,

557
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,230
Xiao Lin Lin still won't choose you.

558
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,970


559
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,870
Because he is the kind of person

560
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,700


561
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,790


562
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,070
who separates his feelings
from his career very clearly.

563
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,600


564
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,830
He will only choose someone
who is beneficial to him.

565
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,990
For example,

566
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,820


567
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,110
me.

568
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,690


569
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,520


570
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,830
However, I hope

571
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,790
that one day he will look at me

572
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,630


573
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,230
with the same sparkle in his eyes

574
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,010


575
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,450


576
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,590
as he looks at you.

577
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,630
As long as there is no interference,

578
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,430


579
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,740
I will definitely succeed.

580
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,630


581
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,150
If it goes well for me,

582
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,040


583
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,670
it will go well for you at work.

584
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,430


585
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,500


586
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,510
Do you understand?

587
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,230


588
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,430
Okay, I got it.

589
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,840


590
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,070
I will stay away from him in future.

591
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,110


592
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,310
Can you please do me a favour?

593
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,970


594
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,070
I want you to urge them
to get the experience cabin

595
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,850


596
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,110
here sooner.

597
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,870
If you can guarantee it,

598
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,660


599
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,230
I can tell you one more secret.

600
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,030


601
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,300


602
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,590
Alright.

603
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,600


604
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,830
What is the secret?

605
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,610


606
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,790
Lin Feng may like a dominant girl.

607
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,980
[I don't like gentle girls.]

608
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,790


609
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,510
[they must be indecisive and sloppy.]

612
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,350
[My girl must be sassy,]

[She has to be unique in this world.]

[Aren't you afraid
that you two will fight?]

619
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,760


620
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,950
[I'm not afraid.]

621
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,940


622
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:21,950
[I will certainly]

623

[tolerate her and spoil her.]

625

[I will spoil her to the max.]

626

627

[I'll make her realise]

628

629

[that there is no one in the world but me]

[who can tolerate her]

633
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,550
[so that she can't leave me.]

634
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,430


635
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,150
A dominant girl?

636
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,920


637
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,350
Is that so?

638
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,160


639
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,070
How did you know about it?

640

641
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,560


642
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,950
I guessed it.

643
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,230
You guessed it?

644
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,930


645
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,070
Xiao Lin Lin.

647
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,710
What's wrong?

648
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,720


649
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,790
What are you talking about?

650
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,600


651
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,330

Secret?

Go for it!

656
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,050


657

Zhang Yun Er.

661
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,430
Why don't you get in the water
when you come to Paradise Island?

662
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,080


663

664
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,630
I don't have a swimsuit with me.

It's okay if you don't have a swimsuit.

669
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,670
The company has provided it.

670

671
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,390

Nothing, I'm just asking.

701

This horse is generally
not close to anyone,

except for me and Xiao Tian.

705

When we were in the old mansion,

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,050


728
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,230
Is that so?

729
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,220


730
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,470
I don't feel that way.

731
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,550


732
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,750
Can you ride a horse?

733
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,590
Let's race.

734
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,400


735
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,510
The loser will accept
one condition from the other side.

736
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,390


737
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,070


738
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,270
Alright.

739
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,870
Whoever reaches
the starting point first wins.

740
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,640


741
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,430
I'll give in a bit.

742
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,230


743
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,090


744
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,110
I'll say one,

745
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,580


746
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,590
you say two,

747
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,220


748
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,230
I'll say three.

749
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,750
Your way of competition
is exactly the same as Xiao Tian.

750
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,610


751
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,820


752
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,900
Really?

753
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,530


754
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,670
What a coincidence.

755
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,260


756
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,430
One, two, three, run!

757
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,180
Hey!

758
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,230


759
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,270


760
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,430
I won.

761
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,590
I also missed it a little bit

762
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,300


763
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,030
in my previous match with Xiao Tian.

764
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,920


765
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,710
I didn't expect you
to be such a good rider.

766
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,580


767
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,520


768
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,710
I practised it when I was a kid.

769
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,710
I lost.

770
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,530


771
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,080


772
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,270
You may say the condition.

773
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,510
My condition is

774
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,170


775
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,750
get away from me.

776
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,590


777
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,710
Did I do something wrong?

778
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,530


779
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:51,910
Nothing.

780
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,860


781
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:54,610


782
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,790
Bai Wei.

783
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,390


784
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,670
What do you think of Paradise Island?

785
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,220


786
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,390
Not bad.

787
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,310
This island was first discovered
by Xiao Tian.

788
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,100


789
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,110
He bought the island

790
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,790


791
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,180


792
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,470
as a site for the core team.

793
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,620


794
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,630
We probably don't even come here

795
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,190
once a month.

796
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,920


797
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,390
In fact, I couldn't understand

798
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,260


799
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,300
his decision at that time.

800
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,180


801
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,650


802
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,820
He probably didn't know
where to spend his money.

803
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,030
Perhaps it's because he was born
with a golden spoon in his mouth

804
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,800


805
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,510
and was living a wealthy life,

806
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,400


807
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,350
and I am

808
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,180


809
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,990
the exact opposite of him.

810
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,820


811
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,350
I grew up in a poor family.

812
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,180


813
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,990
My parents saved money
to pay for my education.

814
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,780


815
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,030
If I had not received a full scholarship,

816
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,640


817
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,230
I would not have been able
to study abroad.

818
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,080


819
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,460


820
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,470
So sometimes I think that...

821
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,860


822
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,990
So are you jealous of him?

823
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,870


824
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,070
Jealous?

825
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,970


826
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,140
Maybe it's because of jealousy.

827
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,580
That's why I want to be
the person in charge of Celeste

828
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,500


829
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,990
in my own way.

830
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,760


831
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,770


832
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,870
I want the whole world to know that

833
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,310


834
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,550
there is not only Ye Tian in this world,

835
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,670
but also me, Lin Feng.

836
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,480


837
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,660


838
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,790
You did it.

839
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,910
You got what you wanted.

840
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,690


841
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,600


842
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,750
Bai Wei,

843
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,500


844
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,630
you will support me, right?

845
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,530


846
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,630
Do you forget

847
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,730


848
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,980
that you lost?

849
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,310
My condition is that

850
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,050


851
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,710
you are to stay away from me.

852
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,550


853
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,870
I'm sure you'll manage Celeste well.

854
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,750


855
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,030
But after Ye Tian wakes up,

856
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,800


857
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,950


858
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,990
what will happen to you?

859
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,790
I believe that even when Ye Tian wakes up,

860
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,620


861
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,950


862
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,190
he will not be able to change anything.

863
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:44,930


864
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,150
Really?

865
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,260


866
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,390
I'll keep Celeste
under my control very well

867
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,040


868
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,150
and you

869
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,390
will be my woman.

870
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,190


871
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,520


872
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,710
Lin Feng,

873
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,160


874
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,310
Celeste has the surname Ye.

875
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,750


876
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,950
And you, Lin Feng, has the surname Zhang.

877
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,920


878
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,190
[Bai Wei,]

879
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,920


880
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,190
[I must get you.]

881
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,700


882
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,870
In fact, the situation is not so bad.

883
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,670


884
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,830
I don't want to die.

885
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,490


886
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,590
Why me?

887
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,960


888
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,070
Why me?

889
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,860


890
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,110
Ms. Wei,

891
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,510


892
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,550
if you know this stuff,

893
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,430
you must have a way to save me.

894
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,060


895
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:47,930


896
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,230
Ms. Wei,

897
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,540


898
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,550
I'm just a security guard.

899
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,100


900
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,110
I'm nothing out there.

901
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,500


902
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,510
I've changed jobs
about four or five times.

903
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,020


904
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,030
Pangu is the only joy in my life.

905
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,780


906
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,790
Unexpectedly, great joy
begets great sorrow.
