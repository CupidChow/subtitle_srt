186
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,750
pick up the phone.

187
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,510


188
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,510
Seriously?

189
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,370


190
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,470
To prevent unauthorized media exposure,

191
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,440


192
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,230
they even blocked the data signal?

193
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,060


194
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,190
This is a little too much.

195
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,970


196
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,510
[When you get out,]

197
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,430


198
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,470
[we too, can get married.]

199
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,320


200
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,030
Finally, the day has come.

201
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,930


202
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,590
What are you thinking about, Bai Wei?

203
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,470


204
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,670
Even if Ye Tian returns,

205
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,530


206
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,620


207
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,750
your relationship

208
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,200


209
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,310
will remain unchanged.

210
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,110
You need to have more self-confidence.

211
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,950


212
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,990
Master,

213
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,030


214
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,950
I'm back!

215
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,830


216
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,270
Never Dies?

217
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,230


218
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,710
I...

219
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,730


220
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,110
Don't worry.

221
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:09,970


222
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,630
I'm here.

223
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,720


224
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,150
He can't hurt you.

225
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,210


226
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,630
Conditioned reflex...

227
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,490


228
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,750
Miss.

229
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,790


230
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,750
Let me introduce you.

231
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,550


232
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,310
This

233
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,400


234
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,150
is my master.

235
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,200


236
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,150
Master.

237
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,070


238
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,870
I'll introduce you.

239
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,730


240
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,430
She is Invincible's fiancee.

241
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,380


242
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,630
Invincible?

243
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,680


244
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,550
She said Invincible

245
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,550


246
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,270
is currently in a coma in the hospital.

247
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,140


248
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,750
She suspects that he's been online
the whole time.

249
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,700


250
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,830
So, I brought her here

251
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,980


252
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,230
to see if you have a solution.

253
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,150


254
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,840


255
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,910
Never Dies.

256
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,860
Come here.

257
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,850


258
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,630
Invincible?

259
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,490


260
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,390
What...

261
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,220


262
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,950
He...

263
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,690


264
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,740


265
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,950
Xiao Qing.

266
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,150
My parents

267
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,110


268
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,270


269
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,190
and your parents

270
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,670
all think I've lost my mind.

271
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,650


272
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,430
You scoundrel.

273
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,280


274
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,260
I knew I'd find you in Pangu.

275
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,290


276
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,740


277
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,940
I knew it!

278
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,990
Sorry. I'm sorry.

279
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,710


280
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,630
Linda.

281
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,540


282
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,230
I simply wanted to be engaged to Yun Er.

283
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,170


284
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,670
Don't think too much, okay?

285
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,650


286
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,590
Even if that meant you'd lose authority 
over Celeste?

287
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,560


288
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,630
So you knew.

289
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,510


290
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,150
I heard Zhang Hao Cheng

291
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,210


292
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,630
discussing with the board of directors

293
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,730


294
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,980
over the new CEO candidates.

295
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,890


296
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,950
He said you'd do as he wants.

297
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,920


298
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,070
There was no need to confer with you.

299
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,040


300
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,110
At least, your position will remain.

301
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,020


302
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,550
That's my bottom line.

303
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,540


304
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,070
He gets it.

305
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,980


306
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,980
I don't care about my position.

307
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,760


308
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,510
I just want to know

309
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,500


310
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,340
why you're doing this.

311
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,210


312
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,590
Because of love.

313
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,500


314
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,270
Lin Feng.

315
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,200


316
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,070
Did you think I'd believe you?

317
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,970


318
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,030
I know you too well.

319
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,890


320
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,750
You'd never give up Celeste
for anyone.

321
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,630


322
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,870
And I mean, not for anyone.

323
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,810


324
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,990
Hence why I'm reminding you
at this crucial moment.

325
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760


326
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,470
Don't take the wrong path.

327
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,250


328
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,630
A path is a path.

329
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,420


330
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,070
There is no right or wrong.

331
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,950


332
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,060
Because ultimately it's my own choice.

333
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,810


334
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,230
So, your choice is?

335
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,050


336
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,550
You'll find out.

337
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,460


338
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,910
I remember what you told me.

339
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,820


340
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,630
The wedding of your dreams
is a simple,

341
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,530


342
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,910
private affair

343
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,740


344
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,390
that belongs only to two people.

345
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,400


346
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,940
The whole wedding

347
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,860


348
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,990
is prepared by Yun Er.

349
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,790


350
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,670
I basically let her have full rein.

351
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,530


352
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,710
Now that I look at it,

353
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,670


354
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,470
this place does suit you a lot.

355
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,210


356
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,670
All the best
for the engagement party today.

357
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,570


358
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,110
I wish you two happiness.

359
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,120


360
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,990
Perhaps I have changed.

361
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,790


362
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,750
Look at how shiny this is.

363
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,760


364
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,670
It looks good on the ears,

365
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,720


366
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,270
right?

367
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,230


368

468
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,470

476
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,470
Don't do anything rash.

I get it now.

488
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,550
That means, Celeste Group

Aren't they breaking the law then?

493

494
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,710
Pangu is a project worth tens of billions.

496
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,630
Hence, the top brass of Celeste Group

497

498
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,430

500
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,630

502
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,430
They are capable of anything.

503
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,340


504
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,470

Why don't you call the police then?

508
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,589
If we call the police now,

510
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,710

shut down the server.

512
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,430
If that happens,

513

514
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,430
every user

518
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,349

519
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,220


520
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,990
Your boyfriend included.

522
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,190
That's why we can't report to the police

523
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,960


524
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,510
while keeping it secret from the public.

525
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,440


526
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,030
Including our family and friends.

527

528
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,109
Or else the outcome will be disastrous.

529
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,880


530
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,590
It's okay.

531
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,440


532
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,710
I'll wait for you.

No matter how long it takes.

535

536
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,070
I'll come and be with you in Pangu
every day.

537
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,800


538
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,150
Once you're able to log out,

539
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,000


540
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,830
we'll get married.

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,390
I'm sorry.

543

544
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,630
I didn't know playing this game

545
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,570


546
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,300


547
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,380
would be so dangerous.

548
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,510
I kept hiding from you,

549
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,310


550
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,470
because in the real world,

551
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,530


552
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,150
I'm poor

553
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,070


554
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,470
and without any accomplishment.

555
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,230


556
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,390
I'm unable to look after you.

557
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280


558
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,870
I don't have the means to make you happy.

559
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,710


560
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,710
Your parents don't think highly of me.

561
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,550


562
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,910
They don't say it,

563
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,860


564
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,290


565
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,550
but it's clear to me.

566
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,790
So,

567
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,680


568
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,470
I came to Pangu.

569
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,540


570
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,790


571
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,870
Because I...

572
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,350
I wanted to build a world

573
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,280


574
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,670
that belongs

575
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,760


576
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,390
to only you and me in Pangu.

577
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,350


578
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,970


579
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,230
But,

580
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,750
I'm too stupid.

581
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,860


582
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,190
I... I can't do anything right.

583
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,230


584
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,870
And now, I've ended up like this.

585
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,820


586
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,470
When I first met you,

587
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,310


588
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,590
what I saw

589
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280


590
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,060
was the opposite 
of how you described yourself.

591
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,940


592
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,830
In my eyes,

593
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,770


594
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,710
you aren't weak.

595
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,740


596
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,630
You are kind.

597
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,470


598
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,620
And being poor isn't anything scary.

599
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,490


600
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,550
I want to create a better life

601
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,510


602
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,050


603
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,190
together with you.

604
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,510
Remember this.

605
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,410


606
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,310
No one can look down on you,

607
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,180


608
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,830
unless you look down on yourself.

609
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,730


610
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,950
Yang Xiu Yuan.

611
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,800


612
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,310
All I want is to live a simple life

613
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,270


614
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,640


615
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,790
with you.

616
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,350
It's not real.

617
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,280


618
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,470
It's not real...

619
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,500


620
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,710


621
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,870
It's all fake!

622
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,550
It's fake.

623
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,470


624
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,790
It's all fake.

625
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,790


626
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,630
This world is fake.

627
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,580


628
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620


629
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,670
The outside is fake too.

630
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,930


631
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,070
So is the human heart.

632
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,030
I might not wake up ever again

633
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,980


634
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,820


635
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,910
in the real world.

636
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,030
I won't be able to wake up.

637
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,000


638
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,950
I...

639
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,550


640
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,710
I can't give you anything.

641
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,680


642
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,750
I can't give you anything!

643
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,710


644
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,630


645
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,910
You hear me?

646
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,830
Go.

647
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,750


648
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,590
Leave!

649
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,280


650
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,430
Just leave.

651
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,320


652
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,510
I don't want to see you again.

653
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,300


654
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,270
I don't love you anymore.

655
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,240


656
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,550
Leave!

657
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,430


658
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,870
Go!

659
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,840


660
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,350
Actually...

661
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,370


662
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,070
Actually, I lied to her.

663
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,770


664
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,270
I lied to her.

665
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,980


666
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,870
I love her too much.

667
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,890


668
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,870
I was just pretending to be a tough guy.

669
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,960


670
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,710


671
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,430
I really love her.

672
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,070
But...

673
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,080


674
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,670
I can't make her suffer.

675
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,630


676
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,670
I can't let her be in danger.

677
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,780


678
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,110
I cannot be so selfish

679
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,240


680
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,180
and make her stay with me.

681
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,090


682
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,030
In reality,

683
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,050


684
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,630
I've learned

685
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,590


686
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,430
to give up.

687
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,410


688
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,590
Xiu Yuan.

689
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,610


690
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,110
Don't give up on yourself.

691
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,070


692
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,950
And don't give up on me, okay?

693
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,000


694
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,790
I'll be with you forever.

695
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,620


696
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,310
Do you wish to give her

697
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,090


698
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,390
a proper wedding in Pangu?

699
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,270


700
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,270
Come.

701
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,310


702
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,110
Thank you.

703
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,070


704
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,550


705
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,710
Make sure you enjoy yourselves today.

706
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,110


707
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,150
Thank you.

708
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,750
Everyone.

709
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,600


710
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,550
It's about time.

711
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,420


712
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,750
We can start.

713
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,590


714
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,830
Little Lin Lin.

715
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,750


716
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,270
Are you ready?

717
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,190


718
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,110
Watch your steps.

719
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,170


720
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,470
Here, this way.

721
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,200


722
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,670
It's nice.

723
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,700


724
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,430
I like the decoration.

725
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,420


726
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,150
It's very nice.

727
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,170


728
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,950
Lovely, isn't it?

729
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,940


730
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,310
Come.

731
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,270


732
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,190
Bai Wei.

733
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,230


734
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,830
Bai Wei!

735
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,630


736
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,300
Bai Wei!

737
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,320


738
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,950
Bai Wei!

739
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,820


740
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,870
Hunting Dog.

741
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,750


742
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,110
Don't do it.

743
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,950


744
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,060
You know something?

745
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,900


746
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,190
Le Le and I

747
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,030


748
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,190
could have had a wedding too.

749
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,030


750
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,830
Of course.

751
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,760


752
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,900
It wouldn't be as grand.

753
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,730


754
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,150
Because we don't have enough money.

755
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,010


756
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,510
I used up all my savings

757
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,310


758
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,950
on the house by the beach.

759
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,790


760
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,430
We didn't ask for much.

761
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,360


762
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,110
We only needed each other.

763
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,790


764
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,710
You know what?

765
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,600


766
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,390
Le Le really adored that house.

767
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,310


768
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,470
When I gave her the keys,

769
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,290


770
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,390
she cried.

771
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,240


772
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,430
She said,

773
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,230


774
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,150
her life had been

775
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,960


776
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,070
all worth it.

777
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:19,930


778
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,070
Why did I let her open the door?

779
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,040


780
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,630
Why? Why?

781
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,440


782
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,510
What

783
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,500


784
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,750
happened to you two?

785
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,770


786
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,110
Le Le.

787
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,440


788
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,670
Le Le.

789
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,810


790
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,550
Le Le.

791
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,180


792
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,270
You're okay.

793
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,230


794
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,070
I won't let anything happen to you.

795
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,010


796
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,360


797
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,750
Le Le!

798
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,330


799
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,830
Le Le.

800
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,350
I found out who planted the bomb.

801
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,390


802
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,470
He was hired by Zhang Hao Cheng.

803
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,390


804
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,390
Why?

805
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,340


806
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,990
I wish to know why too!

807
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,870


808
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,270
Why can't he let us go?

809
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,180


810
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,110
Why did he have to destroy 
our peaceful lives?

811
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,990


812
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,070
Why did he make Le Le leave me?

813
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,070


814
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,350
I hate him.

815
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,280


816
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,210


817
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,300
Zhang Hao Cheng.

818
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,030
I want you and all your family

819
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,890


820
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,030
to be buried together with Le Le.

821
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,900


822
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,100
Hunting Dog.

823
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:49,910


824
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,990
There are many ways to get revenge.

825
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,760


826
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,750
Don't make the mistake

827
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,710


828
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,780


829
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,030
of pleasing the enemy instead.

830
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,630
Moreover,

831
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,430


832
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,270
the one you despise is Zhang Hao Cheng.

833
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,080


834
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,150
The other people are innocent.

835
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,890


836
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,750
Wang Le Le wouldn't have 
wanted you to do this.

837
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,700


838
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,260


839
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,430
No one is innocent!

840
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,390
The people down there

841
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,270


842
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,740
are mostly Zhang Hao Cheng's minions.

843
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,640


844
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,670
And those wealthy businessmen.

845
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,490


846
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,190
They're Zhang Hao Cheng's buddies.

847
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,100


848
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,150
They're the ones backing him.

849
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,980


850
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,630
Letting him have the power
to do whatever he wanted.

851
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,300


852
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,950
But not Ms. Wei.

853
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,790


854
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,110
You and I know it.

855
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,780


856
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,590
We have the same goal.

857
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,530


858
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,390
Our common enemy is Zhang Hao Cheng.

859
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,280


860
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,790
You guys assured me.

861
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,720


862
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,190
That you'd handle the rest.

863
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,100


864
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,950
But what happened?

865
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,830


866
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,550
You guys are just the same.

867
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,420


868
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,110
Nobody is truly innocent.

869
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,010


870
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,790
I get it.

871
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,710


872
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,270
You're just a loser.

873
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,170


874
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,190
You claim you're doing this 
to avenge Wang Le Le.

875
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,090


876
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,950
But have you thought about

877
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,820


878
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,590
why she had put her life

879
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,550


880
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,680


881
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,830
on the line back then?

882
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,070
Are you going to let
her previous efforts be in vain?

883
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,980


884
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,760


885
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,950
You're just powerless 
against Zhang Hao Cheng.

886
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,270
That's why you chose

887
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,460


888
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,710
the simplest, most pathetic method.

889
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,660


890
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,190
You want everyone

891
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,150


892
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,410


893
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,550
to die with you two.

894
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,550
Who else would do this but a loser?

895
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,480


896
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,350
You're putting all of their deaths

897
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,300


898
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,310
onto Wang Le Le!

899
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,160


900
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,910
Today

901
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,830


902
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,230
is my first time being a wedding witness.

903
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,190


904
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,110
I'm guessing it's Mr. Lin Feng 
and Ms. Zhang Yun Er's

905
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,010


906
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,980
first time getting engaged.

907
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,940


908
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,350
It's the first time for everyone.

909
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,160


910
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,470
I apologize in advance
for any mistakes.

911
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,270


912
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,350
Please be kind.

913
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,250


914
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:51,830
Thank you.

915
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,830


916
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,430

00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,590


1272
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,550
Stop talking!

1273
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,310
Shut up!

1274
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,420


1275
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,030
Let it go, Hunting Dog.

1276
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,850


1277
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,990
You're not evil.

1278
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,790


1279
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,830


1280
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,230
What is it?

1281
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,300


1282
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,620
What?

1283
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,140


1284
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,310
That's a deal then.

1285
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:57,990
Let's find a time

1286
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,070


1287
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,590
to go over the details.

1288
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,560


1289
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,430
What are you doing?

1290
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,390


1291
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,220
Run, Boss!

1292
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,320


1293
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:04,830
There's a bomb

1294
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:04,900


1295
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,870
under the cake!

1296
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:05,820


1297
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,070
Li!

1298
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,030


1299
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,070
Save Yun Er!

1300
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,050


1301
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,750
Save Yun Er!

1302
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,610


1303
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,940


1304
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,980
Yun Er!

1305
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,460


1306
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,390
Run, Yun Er!

1307
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,750
Yun Er!

1308
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,620


1309
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,430
The Star Moonstone.

1310
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,070


1311
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,350
I worry that when we go back
to the real world,

1312
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,230


1313
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,070
you'll think that I'm like a log,

1314
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,070


1315
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,550
always boring and dull.

1316
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,300


1317
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,710
That's not going to happen.

1318
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,790


1319
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,670
I didn't fall in love with you in Pangu.

1320
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,600


1321
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,070


1322
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,110
From the start, I was only using her

1323
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,150


1324
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,270
to help me accomplish something.

1325
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,270


1326
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,470
So that Zhang Hao Cheng 
wouldn't be able to control me.

1327
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,770


1328
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,110
Now that I've done it,

1329
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,990
I no longer need her.

1330
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,880


1331
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,870
Big or small, an evil act

1332
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,700


1333
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:14,980


1334
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,230
is still evil.
