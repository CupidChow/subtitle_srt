00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,670
She is our pretty president friend.

184
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,500


185
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,720


186
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,909
I'll come and get you tomorrow.

[Your current session is about to end.]

191

192
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,590
I don't want to.

193
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,500


194
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,510
[You have 30 seconds
until you have to log out.]

196
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,190
Be good.

197
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,510
Trust me.

198
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,390


199
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,920


200
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,070
I won't leave you by yourself.

201
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,900


202
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,110
Bai Wei.

203
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,060
Bai Wei?

204
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,900


205
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,430
She's gone.

206

207
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,230
Come sit down.

What's your problem?

211
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,110
We're no strangers.

212
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,980


213
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,390
Do I know you?

Wei Wei.

217
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,390
You're zoning out.

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,290


219
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,310
You've been out of sorts
since coming out of the cabin.

220
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,140


221
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,950


222
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,110
What's the matter?

223
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,590
You didn't finish the mission?

224
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,480


225
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,790
I can help you.

226
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,670


227

228
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,630
It's not that.

229
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,470
It's rare for us to get together
on a weekend like this.

230
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,230


231
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,310
But you

232
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,090


233
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,990
won't talk and just look gloomy.

234
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860


235
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,190
Very good.

236
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,080


237
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,420
Okay, I was wrong.

238
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,240


239
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,870
That's better.

240
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,740


241
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,180
If only I had a boyfriend like that.

242
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,950


243
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,910
Although each time you wake up,
you don't remember him,

244
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,770


245
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,910


246
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,070
he will profess
his feelings to me every day.

247
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,630
Isn't that romantic?

248
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,480


249
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,710
Yes, it's pretty romantic.

250
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,600


251
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,380


252
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,390
But if one day,

253
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,840


254
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,990
this actually happened to you,

255
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,230
the person you love stands before you

256
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,120


257
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,790
but doesn't recognize you,

258
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,670


259
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,790
you wouldn't find it romantic then.

260
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,580


261
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060


262
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,070
Sometimes, even if you
stand right in front of a guy,

263
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,910


264
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,030
he doesn't know you.

265
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,830
I think it's better
not to know each other.

266
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,690


267
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,830
I know who you're talking about.

268
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,550


269
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,710


270
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,910
But destiny

271
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,920


272
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,150
cannot be forced.

273
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,500


274
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,510
[Regarding the handover of B1 tomorrow,]

275
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,340


276
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,350
[you don't have to come to the office.]

277
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,230
[I'll go take it.]

278
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,120


279
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,850


280
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,990
I think Xiao Guo is pretty good.

281
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,510
I thank you.

282
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,430


283
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,260


284
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,270
I'm being serious.

285
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,970


286
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,230
Think about it.

287
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,270
Last month, when you forgot
to handover the character update proposal,

288
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,360


289
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,910
he was the one
who secretly did it for you.

290
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,870


291
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,720


292
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,990
Also,

293
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,760


294
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,910
every time you liaised
with the programmers,

295
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,790
you always forgot to mark each character.

296
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,830


297
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,870
He's the one who marked each one for you.

298
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,690


299
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,300


300
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,310
Everyone in the department
knows about this.

301
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,260


302
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,270
No one told you?

303
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,510


304
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,710
I wasn't told.

305
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,680


306
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,830
That's why,

307
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,860


308
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,870
the amount of attention you give
to Zhao Jia Liang

309
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,510


310
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,750
is the amount of attention
Xiao Guo gives to you.

311
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,150
You can't see the gem
that lies before you.

312
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,030


313
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,350
Alright, let's not talk about that.

314
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,200


315
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,270
Accompany me out for some fun
this weekend.

316
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,210


317
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,990
We haven't had an outing
for a long time.

318
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,850


319
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,870
I can't. I don't have time.

320
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,660


321
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,830
I can't accompany you.

322
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,790


323
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,390
But I have something for you.

324
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,150


325
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,070
What is it, Wei Wei?

326
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,910


327
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,430
Remember to use it by this weekend.

328
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,480


329
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,510
It's expiring soon.

330
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,450


331
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,070
A voucher for Muse?

332
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,910


333
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,230
This is very expensive.

334
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,130


335
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,750


336
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,870
Is it?

337
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,270
The restaurant gave it to me for free.

338
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,170


339
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,970


340
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,110
This is a couple set.

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,690


342
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,790
If you don't go with me,

343
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,660


344
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,740
who will accompany me?

345
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,030
That's up to you.

346
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,860


347
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,830
Qiao.

348
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,670


349
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,270
When someone loses their memory,

350
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,130


351
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,030
they can recover it back, right?

352
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,780


353
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,110
I don't know.

354
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,970


355
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,190
That's how they play out in the movies.

356
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,010


357
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,190
Are you serious?

358
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,130


359
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,910
You and your wife
aren't pranking me, are you?

360
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,880


361
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,340
It's 2019.

362
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,430


363
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,550
Are you still using the amnesia trope?

364
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,440


365
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,910
We came without notice.

366
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,880


367
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,070
Sorry about that.

368
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:10,940


369
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,580
Have a drink.

370
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,420


371
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,150
Looks like you really forget everything.

372
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,040


373
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,830
I used to always
make trouble for you and her.

374
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680


375
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,350
Now that we're sitting here quietly,

376
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,130


377
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,310
it feels a little surreal.

378
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,210


379
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,670
I don't know why.

380
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,510


381
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,950
From the first time I met you,

382
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,980


383
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,630
I've felt

384
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,520


385
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,510
a peculiar familiarity.

386
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,550


387
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,270
You know what?

388
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,220


389
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,750
There are two kinds of people in Pangu.

390
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,650


391
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,950
One wants to forget reality.

392
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,790


393
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,190
The other wants to live a different life.

394
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,990


395
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,630
I'd put myself in the first type.

396
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,430


397
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,430
I wish to forget reality,

398
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,210


399
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,270
and forget about who I am.

400
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,160


401
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,540


402
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,670
In the real world,

403
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,870
I manage my family business alone.

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,760


405
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,430
I always have to size up the situation

406
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,100


407
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,510
and know what to do and when to do it.

408
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,340


409
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,230
So to me,

410
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,050


411
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,630


412
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,950
Pangu is a luxury.

413
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,820


414
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,030
At least I can live more recklessly.

415
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,070
But when I met you two,

416
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,990


417
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,830
I realised I was wrong.

418
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,710


419
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,330


420
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,630
Us two?

421
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,550
Yes.

422
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,410


423
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,240


424
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,390
You and Bai Wei.

425
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,660


426
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,670
I realised

427
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,630


428
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,790
I had brought the same stuff
from the real world

429
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,660


430
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,790
into Pangu.

431
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,870
I believed money to be everything.

432
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,710


433
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,990
Before, I thought being a pay-to-win whale

434
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,860


435
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,350
was something to be proud of.

436
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,110


437
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,790
Thank you both

438
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,680


439
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,140


440
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,310
for letting me know more about Pangu

441
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,620


442
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,790
and myself.

443
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,990
Are you feeling sad?

444
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,800


445
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,620
Although I don't quite understand
what you're saying,

446
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540


447
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,710
I want to believe you're a good person.

448
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,470


449
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,920


450
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,110
I've said a lot about myself.

451
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,790
What about you?

452
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,680


453
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,390
Why did you come to Pangu?

454
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,190


455
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,510
I don't know why I'm here.

456
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,550


457
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,350
Recently, in my mind,

458
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,180


459
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,910
strange voices keep popping up.

460
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,730


461
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,570


462
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,710
They seem to be reminding me.

463
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,110
The world of Pangu and I

464
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,960


465
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,590
have this or that form of connection.

466
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,420


467
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,030
Actually,

468
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,930


469
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,390
I think you are

470
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,450


471
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,830
just like a childhood friend of mine.

472
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,750


473
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,190
With you,

474
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,160


475
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,870
I keep seeing traces of him.

476
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,640


477
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,430


478
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,670
An unknown person keeps appearing
in my mind too.

479
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,030
Really?

480
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:53,780


481
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,140


482
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,150
Who is that person in your mind?

483
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,470
You're so weak.
Do you have calcium deficiency?

484
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,330


485
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,850


486
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,070
[From today onward,]

I will bear all responsibility.

495

Bai Wei does not need
to bear any legal responsibility.

00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,540


545
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,790
Ms. Le Le, you must think of something.

546
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,530


547
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,150
Jia Ping and I came to stock up.

548
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,060


549
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,350
We then went to the Internet cafe
to play Pangu.

550
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,290


551
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,350
Now he can't log out.

552
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,350


553
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,350
I dare not tell his father.

554
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,220


555
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,310
Catch your breath.

556
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,050


557
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,550
What do you mean he can't log out?

558
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,500


559
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,350
Where is he?

560
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,340


561
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,390
He's in Pangu.

562
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,330


563
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,310
Jia Ping.

564
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,160


565
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,380
Jia Ping?

566
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,330


567
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,030
We logged out together.

568
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,910


569
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,550
But he said he couldn't do it.

570
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,530


571
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,310
He's waiting anxiously inside.

572
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,220


573
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,430
I don't know what to do.

574
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,360


575
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,350
Where is he in Pangu?

576
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,250


577
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,510
In a forest.

578
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,480


579
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,910
Not far from the main city.

580
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,810


581
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,910
Jia Ping.

582
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,710


583
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,350
Le Le.

584
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,360


585
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,470
What's going on?

586
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,470


587
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,270
Le Le, I can't log out.

588
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240


589
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,070
What is that supposed to mean?

590
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,920


591
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,950
Where's your bracelet?

592
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,830


593
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,860


594
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,790
Le Le, please don't tell my dad.

595
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,430
You have ideas.

596
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,530


597
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,300
You have to help me.

598
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,290


599
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,990
Save me, Le Le.

600
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,050


601
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,070
I don't want to die here.

602
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,170


603
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,470
How did this happen?

604
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,450


605
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,750
Wait for me here.

606
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,740


607
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,950
I'll look for help outside.

608
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,790


609
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,310
Le Le, come back quickly.

610
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,180


611
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,070
I'll wait here.

612
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,070


613
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,470
Why wasn't the player named
Hero of Jia Village

614
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,460


615
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,620


616
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,630
not discovered sooner?

617
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,390
Sorry, boss.

618
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,340


619
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,830
Where is he currently?

620
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,630


621
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,270
They're in Black Pine Forest.

622
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,200


623
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,750
I'll go and catch them right away.

624
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,680


625
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,230
But, sir,

626
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,210


627
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,100
there's one problem.

628
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,040


629
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,670
What?

630
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,720


631
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,140
Ms. Ding has also gotten the news.

632
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,170


633
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,820
They might have gotten a head start.

634
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,780


635
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,310
That annoying lass.

636
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,390


637
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,430
We can't let her find out

638
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520


639
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,950
about 2021.

640
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,740


641
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,270
Or else we can forget about

642
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,330


643
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,470
getting Ding Group to invest.

644
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,460


645
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,070
Here's what we'll do.

646
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,130


647
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,950
Find a way to delay her.

648
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,000


649
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,230
And then look for that Hero guy.

650
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,190


651
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,910
To be safe, you'll do it personally.

652
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,600


653
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,460


654
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,470
You must get rid of the witness

655
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,430
before Ding Xiang gets there.

656
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,380


657
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,430
Yes, sir.

658
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,490


659
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,750
Ms. Ding, are you still thinking about
the masked guy?

660
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760


661
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,590
Ms. Ding.

662
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,700


663
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,870
The company saw a post

664
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,970


665
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,230
on the Pangu member forum.

666
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,930


667
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,630
Supposedly a player

668
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,590


669
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,310
couldn't log out from Pangu.

670
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,300


671
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,790
The name is Hero of Jia Village.

672
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,740


673
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,990
They're still verifying the details.

674
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,900


675
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,750
I knew Zhang Hao Cheng
wasn't telling the truth.

676
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,430


677
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,310
Surely he's hiding something

678
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,290


679
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,630
about Pangu's security risks.

680
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,380


681
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,790
Dispatch the Heavenly Society immediately.

682
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,790


683
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,590
Find that player named
Hero of Jia Village

684
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,630


685
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,030
to verify the situation.

686
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,060


687
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,070
Ms. Ding, we can't dispatch anyone
from the Heavenly Society.

688
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,080


689
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,310
Pangu just released a notice.

690
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,300


691
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,550
Recent violations will be given
severe punishment.

692
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,500


693
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,670
Due to the ruckus
in the main city recently,

694
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,470


695
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,950
the Society has been barred
from any public activity for 24 hours.

696
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,940


697
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,990
Did that just happen?

698
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,010


699
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,830
Yes.

700
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,910


701
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,420
Zhang Hao Cheng.

702
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,340


703
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,950
Jia Ping.

704
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,970


705
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,770


706
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,790
Jia Ping!

707
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,110
Jia Ping.

708
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,100


709
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,660
Jia Ping.

710
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,710


711
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,820


712
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,030
I just went offline to look up
Pangu's technology.

713
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,230
How did you...

714
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,320


715
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,590
Jia Ping, wake up.

716
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,560


717
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,370


718
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,380
Wake up.

719
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,820
Jia Ping...

720
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,880


721
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,550
Jia Ping.

722
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,570


723
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,470
Jia Ping.

724
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,460


725
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,140
Jia Ping.

726
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,120


727
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,190
Jia Ping...

728
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,190


729
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,470
Call an ambulance, quick.

730
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,430


731
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,500


732
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,510
Do it.

733
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,960


734
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,110
Go.

735
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,380


736
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,630
Hurry.

737
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,630
It's done.

738
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,330


739
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,550
I was looking for you.

740
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,450


741
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,270
But you weren't in.

742
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,250


743
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,940
Just tell me what it is, Mr. Lin.

744
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,860


745
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,430
I wanted to say,

746
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,450


747
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,430
after we get off work,

748
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,490


749
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,150
perhaps we can go somewhere
to have a chat.

750
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,100


751
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,350
I've been moody lately.

752
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,420


753
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,950
I feel like

754
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:40,960


755
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,430
in the whole company,

756
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,450


757
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,620
you're the only person who understands me.

758
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,730


759
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,150
I'm sorry.

760
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,180


761
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,870
I think someone else
is more suited to keep you company.

762
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,610


763
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,550
Please excuse me.

764
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,580


765
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,070
Bai Wei.

766
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,060


767
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,990
Mr. Lin.

768
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,890


769
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,870
I think we should keep a certain distance

770
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,930


771
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,350
in the workplace.

772
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,180


773
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,910
If there's anything related to work,

774
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,990


775
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,190
you can get Linda to talk to me.

776
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,110


777
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,710
As for what you said about
me understanding you,

778
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,650


779
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,310
it's probably just a misconception.

780
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,260


781
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,310
Between humans,

782
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,280


783
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,110
it's almost impossible
to fully understand the other.

784
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,060


785
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,430
You and I are no exception.

786
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,450


787
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,460
Bai Wei.

788
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,490


789
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,710
I see you're a pro at playing
with other people's feelings.

790
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,780


791
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,150
I'm not sure what you're saying.

792
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,930


793
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,550
Xiao Lin Lin has given you his heart.

794
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,540


795
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,190
But you broke it, smashed it

796
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,180


797
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,060


798
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,070
and threw it on the floor.

799
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,590
I won't let you

800
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,610


801
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,790
bully the man I like this way.

802
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,780


803
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,390
Yun Er.

804
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,290


805
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,590
Stop talking.

806
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,500


807
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,910
Mr. Lin.

808
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:43,820


809
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,350
I really think

810
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,420


811
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,230
you don't know yourself very well.

812
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,070


813
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,450


814
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,550
Yun Yun!

815
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,110
I forgot to tell you something.

816
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,040


817
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,590
The proposal you made on the spokesperson

818
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,480


819
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,010


820
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,310
for Pangu's new advertisement

821
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,870
has been approved by the board.

822
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,930


823
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,550
From today onward,

824
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,620


825
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,630
you can carry out your plan

826
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480


827
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,950
and choose the spokesperson you want.

828
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,990


829
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,180
So from now on,

830
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,100


831
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,310
you have to be more careful
of your reputation.

832
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,280


833
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,030
We are in a professional setting.

834
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,960


835
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,140
Not a place for you to date.

836
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,020


837
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,230
Understand?

838
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,050


839
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,740
What?

840
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:42,780


841
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,750
Is my courting of Xiao Lin Lin
annoying you, Mr. Zhang?

842
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,690


843
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,830
Is it bothering you?

844
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,750


845
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,830
I don't care about you fooling around.

846
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,710


847
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,350
But I have to remind you.

848
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,460


849
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,590
Don't fall too deep.

850
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,340


851
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,070
You and he won't have a happy ending.

852
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,020


853
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,230
Who said I'm fooling around with him?

854
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,150


855
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,190
I'm not interested

856
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,170


857
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,220


858
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,230
in your power struggle.

859
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220


860
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,230
Here's a reminder to you.

861
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,710
Whether or not we'll have a good ending,

862
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,700


863
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,470
it has nothing to do with you.

864
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,420


865
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,430
I like Lin Feng!

866
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,520


867
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,030
I love him!

868
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,080


869
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,510
My condolences.

870
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,430


871
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,430
The company
will take responsibility for your son.

872
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,300


873
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,180
We have made

874
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,310


875
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,670
arrangements for his funeral.

876
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,660


877
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,430
Please take a look.

878
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,360


879
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,470
The corneas and pupils
were not responsive.

880
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,380


881
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,550
There weren't
any physiological reflexes either.

882
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,420


883
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,740
He won't wake up anymore.

884
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,700


885
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,670
The test result

886
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,530


887
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,940
said it's due to brain fatigue

888
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,910


889
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,750
that resulted in impaired consciousness.

890
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,340


891
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,980
Celeste Group will pay
for all the medical costs.

892
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,920


893
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,310
Why?

894
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,240


895
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,350
Why are they asking the family
to sign a confidentiality agreement?

896
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,340


897
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,670
The problem wasn't with Jia Ping.

898
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,680


899
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,470
I saw Zhang Hao Cheng's man

900
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,390


901
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,150
in Pangu.

902
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,100


903
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,150
I reminded you.

904
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,130


905
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,750
Do not delete the audio recording
like he asked.

906
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,760


907
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,590
Now it's clear.

908
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,610


909
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,830
There's something wrong with Pangu.

910
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,810


911
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,590
Zhang Hao Cheng is hiding something.

912
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,640


913
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,990
I'm sure he has his reason.

914
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,890


915
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,870
Even now,

916
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,850


917
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,550
you're speaking up for him.

918
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,500


919
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,350
Le Le.

920
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,300


921
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,580


922
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,710
You can go.

923
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,420


924
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,590
I'm fine.

925
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,310
Hao Cheng.

926
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,270


927
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,350
I want an explanation from you.

928
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,240


929
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,990
I was there when Jia Ping was attacked.

930
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,980


931
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,950
Was it your man's doing?

932
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,850


933
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,870
Why couldn't he log out?

934
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,860


935
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,830
Even if he was killed in Pangu,

936
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,670


937
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,620


938
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,630
in real life, he...

939
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,540


940
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,550
Le Le, I'm sorry.

941
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,310
I can't give you

942
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,300


943
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,270
an answer about that right now.

944
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,290


945
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,310
All I can say is,

946
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,280


947
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,870
I'm truly regretful

948
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,810


949
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,230
about what happened to Jia Ping.

950
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,090


951
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,110
You know there are multiple factors

952
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,030


953
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,630


954
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,670
that caused the error.

955
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,710
If I hadn't done what I did,

956
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,720


957
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,310
I

958
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,260


959
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,110
as well as the whole of Celeste
will be doomed.

960
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,090


961
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,990
We have compensated his family.

962
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,950


963
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,190


964
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,470
Consider it...

965
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,470
Consider it my sincere apology.

966
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,290


967
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,270
So Ye Tian's incident
is related to this too.

968
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,080


969
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,550
And that audio recording.

970
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,580


971
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,950
Why?

972
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,850


973
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,430
Why did you lie to me?

974
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,330


975
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,310
Le Le.

976
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,360


977
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,590
I really didn't want to lie to you.

978
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,600


979
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,710
I'm in charge of a huge company
that is Celeste.

980
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,640


981
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,350
I have to ensure the livelihoods
of thousands of employees.

982
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,240


983
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,190
I am responsible to them.

984
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,120


985
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,350
If just because of your cousin's incident,

986
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,210


987
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,300


988
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,470
the whole Celeste collapses,

989
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,070
then...

990
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:40,930


991
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,870
Le Le.

992
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,900


993
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,670
Here's a question.

994
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,640


995
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,070
If you had to choose one side

996
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,980


997
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,910
between me and Celeste

998
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,890


999
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,670
or your cousin

1000
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,540


1001
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,860


1002
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,980
to be responsible for this matter,

1003
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,990
who would you choose?

1004
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,860


1005
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,110
I just don't get it.

1006
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,870


1007
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,740


1008
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,750
A distant relative

1009
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,720


1010
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,950
who you've not met in years.

1011
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,020
For him,

1012
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,960


1013
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,510
you'd risk the livelihoods of thousands

1014
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,460


1015
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,950
of employees.

1016
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,030


1017
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,710
Would you do that?

1018
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,600


1019
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,630
I know.

1020
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,550


1021
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,950
You've suffered these past years.

1022
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,870


1023
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,350
So have I.

1024
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,270


1025
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,270
I also know

1026
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,200


1027
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,830
you're very close with Yun Yun right now.

1028
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,680


1029
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,190
She trusts you and relies on you.

1030
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,910


1031
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,270
I plan to come clean with her.

1032
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,240


1033
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,070
You know it.

1034
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,140


1035
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,070
In our relationship,

1036
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,110


1037
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,190
I've always been the weak one.

1038
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,100


1039
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,590
I don't dare to face it

1040
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,490


1041
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,310
and I am clueless as to what to do.

1042
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,200


1043
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,510
I want to be brave for once.

1044
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,400


1045
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,790
For us, and for Yun Yun.

1046
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,740


1047
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,540


1048
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,550
This way.

1049
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,310
Watch it.

1050
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,620


1051
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,780


1052
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,790
Be careful.

1053
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:35,850


1054
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,950
Okay, it's connected.

1055
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,750
[They even took down Ye Tian's ad.]

1056
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,740


1057
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,590


1058
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,660
Hey, hold on.

1059
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,610


1060
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,670
Are these things being cleared too?

1061
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,550
Yes.

1062
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,530


1063
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,540


1064
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,550
Come on.

1065
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm planning to turn this

1066
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,860


1067
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,180


1068
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,190
into a resting area for the staff.

1069
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,830
Some things are like this record.

1070
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,810


1071
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,830
To some, they carry meanings.

1072
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,850


1073
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,590
But to others,

1074
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,500


1075
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,110
they are merely outdated things.

1076
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,030


1077
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,670
But even if it's outdated,

1078
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,590


1079
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,830
Ye Tian's record will always be there.

1080
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,700


1081
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,430
No one can replace it.

1082
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,220


1083
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,630
No one.

1084
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,650


1085
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,830
Even if he never wakes up,

1086
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,750


1087
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,390
his place in your heart
can't be replaced either, right?

1088
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,400


1089
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,790
Bai Wei.

1090
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,830


1091
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,310
I'm the one who approved the renovation.

1092
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,210


1093
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,070
Sorry.

1094
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,060


1095
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,630
I forgot the gaming room
was your favourite.

1096
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,590


1097
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,430
You won't be able to spar
with Xiao Lin Lin

1098
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,380


1099
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,430


1100
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,550
in this place again.

1101
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,430
That's great.

1102
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,470


1103
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,750
Lest someone get the wrong idea.

1104
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,720


1105
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,750
Xiao Lin Lin.

1106
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,780


1107
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,950
She doesn't see your good,

1108
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,910


1109
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,710
but I do.

1110
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,740


1111
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,190
Don't be upset.

1112
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,100


1113
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,550
Let's go.

1114
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,610


1115
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,750
Here.

1116
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,750


1117
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,030
I'll put it on for you.

1118
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,910


1119
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,270
You know what?

1120
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,320


1121
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,270
I had bought this

1122
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,140


1123
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,060
before you went abroad.

1124
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,930


1125
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,590
But somehow,

1126
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,630


1127
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,180
I missed the chance to give it to you.

1128
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,170


1129
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,070
So you left

1130
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,050


1131
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,320


1132
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,430
for five years.

1133
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,310
Le Le, now that you're back,

1134
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,120


1135
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,910
I promise to make up for our past.

1136
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,040


1137
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,750
I'll make it up to you.

1138
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,640


1139
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,590
Please give me a chance.

1140
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,530


1141
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,989
Help me secure Celeste together.

1142
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,860


1143
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,429


1144
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,510
Okay?

1145
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,900
[Heavenly Society]

1146
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,630
Ye Tian.

1147
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:40,639


1148
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,030
Bai Wei.

1149
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:44,920


1150
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,190
I'm back.

1151
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,139


1152
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,070
I did my part. I'm giving him back to you.

1153
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,010


1154
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,510
Is that all?

1155
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,490


1156
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,670
Yes.

1157
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:00,680


1158
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,470
We talked for a long time last night.

1159
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,530


1160
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,830
Even when he's lost his memory,

1161
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,790


1162
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,510
the only thing he remembers is you.

1163
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,260


1164
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,630
I have to say I admire you.

1165
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,590


1166
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,070
In order to keep your beloved safe,

1167
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,030


1168
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,030
you were willing to hand him
into the enemy's hands.

1169
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,980


1170
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,110
I'd never be able to do the same.

1171
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,980


1172
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,190


1173
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,260
I've been utterly defeated

1174
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,240


1175
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,390
in the "stealing your couple" game.

1176
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,100
However,

1177
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,060


1178
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,470
I won't lose without consequence.

1179
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,360


1180
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,510
You can have this top quality divine ring.

1181
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,270


1182
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,630
Take it.

1183
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,440


1184
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,950
Consider it a wedding gift.

1185
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,830


1186
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,070
Be good to him.

1187
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,120


1188
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,110
Thank you, Ding Xiang.

1189
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,750


1190
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,420
When can I take off the mask?

1191
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,070


1192
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,990
I've been wearing it a long time.

1193
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,770


1194
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,110
Keep it on for now.

1195
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,970


1196
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,780
Master, we're here to visit you.

1197
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,530


1198
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,470
I've mastered the moves

1199
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,430


1200
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,380


1201
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,470
you taught me.

1202
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,830
Let me show you.

1203
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,860


1204
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,430
What are you doing?

1205
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,350


1206
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,270
Master, you attacked me
with a hidden weapon.

1207
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,290


1208
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,270
Was it to test

1209
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,230


1210
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,860


1211
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,030
the speed of my reflexes?

1212
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,590
Just you wait.

1213
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,520


1214
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,660
Are you okay?

1215
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,540


1216
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,150
What are you doing?

1217
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,230


1218
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,710
You...

1219
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,530


1220
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,790
Don't be scared.

1221
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,830


1222
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,070


1223
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,110
Are you all right?

1224
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,350


1225
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,390
I'm okay.

1226
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,110


1227
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,150
Release it, okay?

1228
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,570


1229
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,670
Even if you're my master,

1230
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,470
you can't simply hit my wife.

1231
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,410


1232
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,470
Release it.

1233
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,540


1234
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,740


1235
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,790
Ouch!

1236
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,600


1237
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,630
Show me. Let me see.

1238
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,470
It hurts.

1239
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,440


1240
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,990
It hurts?

1241
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:34,930


1242
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,830
It's just a boo-boo.

1243
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,790


1244
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,620


1245
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,710
Let me blow it for you.

1246
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,030
Is it better?

1247
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:41,910


1248
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,460


1249
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,550
Don't be scared.

1250
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,590
What's wrong with your master?

1251
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,420


1252
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,480


1253
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,590
Don't be scared.

1254
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,340


1255
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,470
It's okay.

1256
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,510
It's okay now.

1257
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,310


1258
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,670
Water-fried egg.

1259
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,580


1260
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,830
Water-fried egg.

1261
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,650


1262
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,950


1263
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,150
You remember?

1264
