176
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,590
Find him.

177
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,070
Ladies and gentlemen,

178
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,470
I am Wild Boar.

179
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,990
I've brought 150 men to search the street.

180
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,230
Omen has to be here.

181
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,670
Show us your support.

182
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,380
Allow Wild Boar to show you

183
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,790
an earth-shattering performance.

184
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,190
You know what?

185
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,830
I had a dream

186
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,590
about a similar scenario in the past.

187
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,110
You dreamed of being chased?

188
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,790
No.

189
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,470
I dreamed that you and I
were hiding in the bushes.

190
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,550
We weren't talking.

191
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,030
We were just quietly staring at the sky.

192
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,470
When did you

193
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,670
have this dream?

194
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,470
I'm not telling you.

195
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,710
Could it be the first time we met?

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,470
You're so annoying.

197
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,150
Don't be ridiculous.

198
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,430
I'm not a hopeless romantic.

199
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,900
Search the place properly!

200
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,390
Make sure

201
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,070
you check

202
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,630
every one of the NPC's stores.

203
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,830
You keep telling me to be careful.

204
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,550
But you don't seem scared at all.

205
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,270
I am scared.

206
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,950
I want nothing more
than to get out of here alive

207
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,830
so that I can be with you forever.

208
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,270
We will.

209
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,350
You know what?

210
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,870
Actually, there are many things

211
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,870
I didn't tell you.

212
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,230
To me, each day I am alive

213
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,590
in Pangu

214
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,630
is a miracle.

215
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,030
I should've died a long time ago

216
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,070
in the testing cabin accident.

217
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,430
But I somehow survived

218
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,350
by coincidence.

219
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,110
And I met you.

220
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,310
I suppose this is destiny.

221
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,700
I always wonder,

222
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,190
if that accident hadn't happened,

223
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,070
would we have taken notice

224
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,790
of each other like this?

225
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,390
If I could go back to that night,

226
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,110
what choice should I make?

227
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,790
Now I've finally got an answer.

228
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,030
If I could go back to that night,

229
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,670
I would still enter the testing cabin

230
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,470
that would malfunction

231
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,430
without a second thought.

232
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,790
Not for anything else.

233
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,270
But just so I could meet you,

234
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,910
fall in love with you

235
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,790
and be with you.

236
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,830
Even if our ending may not end up perfect,

237
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,950
it's all right.

238
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,230
Because every second and minute

239
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,070
I'm with you

240
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,590
is worth it.

241
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,230
Can... Cannibal.

242
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,830
Omen is here.

243
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,710
Omen is right here!

244
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,110
Run!

245
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,430
Xiao Liang, over here.

246
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,990
Quick!

247
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,950
Where are the men?

248
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,310
Come on.

249
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,110
Omen is here.

250
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,190
After him!

251
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,470
Ye Tian,

252
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,750
where are we going?

253
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,270
Look for someone at Love Flower Village.

254
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,630
That's the only way out.

255
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,270
Why?

256
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,950
You mean...

257
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,990
That's right.

258
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,710
We'll look for the quack master.

259
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,150
Charge!

260
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,950
Let's go.

261
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,230
Charge!

262
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,790
Hurry!

263
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,060
Omen and his bodyguards are injured.

264
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,710
After them!

265
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,470
Victory will be ours!

266
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,510
[Big news.]

267
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,030
[The bodyguards are players.]

268
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,070
[They've chosen]

269
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,670
[to align themselves with Omen.]

270
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,750
[Finally, we managed to surround them]

271
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,590
at Love Flower Village.

272
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,030
A final showdown will determine
who wins and loses.

273
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,350
He's not here.

274
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,270
Where is the village chief?

275
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,950
Isn't the chief right there?

276
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,790
Chief.

277
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,630
You have a visitor.

278
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,110
You're the village chief?

279
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,110
Oh, Lin Feng.

280
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,350
You really went to great lengths

281
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,910
in order to deal with me.

282
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,910
You actually modified the infrastructure
of the server without permission.

283
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,630
It's fine if I die.

284
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,910
But are you really

285
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,510
going to screw up Pangu?

286
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,310
Surrender.

287
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,710
Chase them! Stop running!

288
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,750
Quick!

289
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,030
Over here.

290
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,310
This way. Quick!

291
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,470
Freeze!

292
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,670
Stop.

293
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,310
Did you find the village chief?

294
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,590
Lin Feng modified the server.

295
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,750
The whole NPC world

296
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,870
has been messed up.

297
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,230
We are surrounded by enemies.

298
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,580
What should we do then?

299
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,950
One word.

300
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,510
Run!

301
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,350
Stop running!

302
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,230
[Love Flower Village has only one exit.]

303
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,830
[Xiao Tian,]

304
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,990
[why did you choose a dead end?]

305
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,110
Stop!

306
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,260
What's the matter?

307
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,990
What is it, Wei Wei?

308
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,030
Promise me.

309
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,550
Make sure you live no matter what.

310
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,030
What do you mean?

311
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,750
Xiao Liang, keep him safe.

312
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,390
Take him away.

313
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,230
Ms. Wei.

314
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,270
I won't go.

315
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,430
I'm not going.

316
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,030
Go!

317
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:19,790
Bai Wei.

318
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,630
Go!

319
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,510
Hurry. You need to log out.

320
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:22,869
Go!

321
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,349
Wei Wei!

322
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,829
Let's go!

323
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,430
Hurry! Don't lose them!

324
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,910
Chase them!

325
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,140
Charge!

326
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,950
Attack!

327
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,790
Bai Wei.

328
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,030
[Sorry.]

329
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,990
[You're physically fatigued.]

330
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,030
[For your safety,]

331
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,430
[you have been disconnected.]

332
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,830
[Sorry.]

333
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,950
[You're physically fatigued.]

334
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,430
[Please take a rest
before attempting to log in again.]

335
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,870
[Pangu is good,]

336
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,310
[but your health is more important.]

337
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,750
I'm fine.

338
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,190
Let me connect.

339
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,310
Ready.

340
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,590
One, two, three, push!

341
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,430
One, two, three, push!

342
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,550
Does the Black Wind Cave

343
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,430
have another exit?

344
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,550
All the exits have been blocked.

345
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,350
How could you still be so unfazed?

346
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,020
What did you promise Ms. Wei?

347
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,350
You have to stay alive.

348
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,150
Xiao Liang,

349
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,990
if I can't get out,

350
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,590
there's something

351
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,750
I'd like you to relay to Bai Wei for me.

352
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,460
One, two, three, push!

353
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,430
One, two, three, push!

355
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,950

356
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,110
Kill Omen! Go for it!

Mr. Lin.

359
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,510
Alright.

360
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,550
I was wondering

361
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,350
when you'd come to see me.

362
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,350
Lin Feng,

363
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,670
I came to urge you to turn yourself in.

364
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,190
Just stop.

365
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,350
It's not too late.

366
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,950
Turn myself in?

367
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,230
If I did that,

368
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,110
what would happen to Celeste?

369
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,590
What would happen to Pangu?

370
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,790
If you listened to the voice recording,

371
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,350
you should know that

372
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,790
it wasn't my intention.

373
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,550
I did do some wrong things.

374
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,310
But I did them for a reason.

375
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,030
Don't you see?

376
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,990
Stop deceiving yourself.

377
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,830
This contains records of all the crimes

378
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,750
you and Zhang Hao Cheng had committed.

379
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,110
It also recorded

380
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,590
what you just said.

381
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,590
This

382
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,990
is the real reason you came, right?

383
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,820
Yes.

384
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,260
Because you removed the footage.

385
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,190
I need new evidence.

386
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,670
Lin Feng,

387
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,590
I'm begging you.

388
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,070
Give yourself a chance.

389
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,230
I don't want to be the one
to send you to prison.

390
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,310
A signal jammer.

391
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,910
As for the criminal evidence
in that thing,

392
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,950
the jammer would've damaged it too.

Yun Er?

523
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,750
I kept telling you all

524
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,270
to keep her in your sight at all times.

525
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,670
Don't you know
what keeping her in your sight means?

526
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,220
You couldn't even watch a girl.

527
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,870
Are you people trash?

528
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,110
Sorry, boss.

529
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,270
Sorry?

530
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,430
Go and find her!

531
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,190
Scram!

532
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,030
Yes, sir.

533
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,190
Boss,

534
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,470
don't fret.

535
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,230
I checked the surveillance cameras.

536
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,310
Yun Er made a rope

537
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,030
using the bed sheet

538
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,110
and escaped by herself.

539
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,860
I thought she had been taken.

540
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,710
Oh no.

541
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,310
She must have gone to look for Lin Feng.

542
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,150
Help!

543
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,910
Is anyone there?

544
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,630
Help!

545
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,630
Anyone?

546
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,110
Who are you?

547
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,270
Who are you?

548
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,870
Say something.

549
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,389
It's no use.

550
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,989
The more you struggle,
the tighter it gets.

551
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,989
It'll slowly cut off
your blood circulation.

552
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,190
Your hands will be crippled.

553
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,070
You just want money, right?

554
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,429
How much do you want?

555
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,420
I'll give it to you.

556
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,350
More money than you'll ever need.

557
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,230
To answer your first question,

558
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,110
I'm not a killer.

559
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,790
And you didn't simply
come into contact with me.

560
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,270
I've intercepted all the information

561
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,469
going in and out of your house.

562
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,750
So your only choice is me,

563
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,870
Mr. Zhang Yun Er.

564
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:57,830
Why...

565
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,580
Why are you doing this?

566
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,510
The second question.

567
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,350
I didn't kidnap you for money.

568
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,270
It's because of your dad, Zhang Hao Cheng.

569
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,310
There's a debt

570
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,990
he has to pay.

571
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,430
But don't worry.

572
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,070
Nothing will happen to you.

573
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,630
I made a promise to someone.

574
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,350
I won't put other people in danger

575
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,390
just to get revenge on Zhang Hao Cheng.

576
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,110
You kidnapped me

577
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,020
so you could bait him?

578
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,550
How did you even think of that?

579
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,590
Zhang Hao Cheng only cares

580
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,710
about himself.

581
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,790
You think he'd walk into danger
to save me?

582
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,110
Stop dreaming.

583
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,710
Humans tend to do

584
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,510
unpredictable things

585
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,270
when they're caught in
extraordinary circumstances.

586
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,790
Hunting Dog.

587
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,190
[In one hour.]

588
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,590
Nanyuan Warehouse.

589
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,590
Come alone.

590
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,630
[Help!]

591
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,230
[Let me go!]

592
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,270
2021.

593
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,070
Did you come to jeer at me too?

594
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,230
Did you see Ye Tian?

595
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,910
Tell me.

596
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,030
Ms. Wei.

597
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,750
What's wrong with you, Ms. Wei?

598
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,670
Ye Tian is still alive.

599
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,230
What did you say?

600
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,630
I said, Ye Tian is alive.

601
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,190
[Xiao Liang,]

602
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,670
[there's something]

603
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,670
[I'd like you to relay to Bai Wei for me.]

604
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,830
[I have a bad memory.]

605
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,870
[Whatever you wish to say,]

606
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,030
[you can tell her yourself
after we fight a way out of here.]

607
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,830
[What's that sound?]

608
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,510
[Go and check.]

609
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,470
[Freedom?]

610
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,390
[You went to Love Flower Village]

611
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,310
[to look for him, right?]

612
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,510
[Yes.]

613
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,510
[That's him.]

614
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,230
[What do you need him for?]

615
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,230
[Because there's a method worth trying.]

616
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,990
[But it's very risky.]

617
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,030
[Cut the crap.]

618
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,070
[I promised Ms. Wei to protect you.]

619
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,270
[It doesn't matter how.]

620
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,310
[Okay.]

621
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,350
[Then let's ask for apprenticeship.]

622
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,030
[Apprenticeship?]

623
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,950
[From him?]

624
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,710
[My dear apprentices.]

625
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,110
[I will teach you the Dual Skills.]

626
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,910
Dual Skills?

627
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,670
You...

628
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,790
How can two men learn the Dual Skills?

629
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,710
Ye Tian said

630
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,750
his NPC status

631
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,590
at that time

632
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,870
did not have gender detection.

633
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,070
So Freedom wasn't able to determine

634
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,190
whether he's a man or woman.

635
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,470
To Freedom,

636
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,460
Ye Tian could be a female.

637
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,950
So,

638
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,630
you two logged out
after learning the skill.

639
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,870
The players thought Omen had died

640
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,190
and disappeared.

641
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,630
Yes.

642
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,550
Then I got out

643
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,910
of the cave together with the crowd.

644
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:37,870
Ms. Wei,

645
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,950
I've successfully completed

646
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,470
that task you have given me, right?

647
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,310
Good work, Xiao Liang.

648
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:43,580
Ms. Wei,

649
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,590
be gentle.

650
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,390
I only have one life right now.

651
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,910
If you hit me too hard and killed me,

652
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,990
that's two lives in one.

653
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,030
Sorry about that.

654
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,590
My mistake.

655
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,030
So,

656
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,870
where did you guys log out from?

657
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,670
Take me there.

658
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,150
Come.

659
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,110
Do you think

660
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,870
your dad will come?

661
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,670
If he does come,

662
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,190
what are you going to do?

663
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,950
Kill him.

664
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,310
I don't understand.

665
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,950
What kind of deep grievance

666
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,510
do you have with each other?

667
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,750
A life for a life is all.

668
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,630
Could there be
some kind of misunderstanding?

669
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,670
Zhang Hao Cheng isn't a saint.

670
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,830
But,

671
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,220
he wouldn't go as far as kill someone.

672
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,980
Of course he wouldn't
kill someone himself.

673
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,150
People like you

674
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,990
always keep your hands clean.

675
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,070
Because you get people like me
to do your dirty work.

676
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,590
Am I right?

677
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,220
Then...

678
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,950
Who...

679
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,470
Who did he kill?

680
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,430
He sent someone

681
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,870
to kill the only person

682
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,150
I cared about in this world.

683
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,150
Why?

684
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,430
That's what I'd like to know too.

685
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,310
This means

686
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,910
he knows

687
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,590
it's you who have kidnapped me?

688
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,460
Then he won't come.

689
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,670
Boss,

690
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,230
it's another 30km to the airport.

691
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,380
You can take a rest first.

692
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,270
I'll call you when we're there.

693
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,790
Drive faster.

694
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,590
Okay.

695
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,070
Are you sure it's okay
for him to log in like this?

696
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,190
What if he

697
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,510
becomes another "public enemy no. 1"?

698
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,830
I'll get him to log out

699
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,710
if there's any trouble.

700
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,150
Talking about logging out,

701
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,590
I think the duration limit

702
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,310
to be online was removed today.

703
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,270
Because Lin Feng tampered with

704
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,870
the base structure of Pangu's server.

705
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,740
Are you alright?

706
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,070
Don't worry.

707
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,750
I'm fine.

708
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,260
It turned out to be
a blessing in disguise.

709
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,670
The monitoring system can't detect me now.

710
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,270
Really?

711
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,470
Yes.

712
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,390
But I'm not sure

713
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,710
how long this situation will last.

714
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,030
We still have to hurry.

715
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,750
Wei Wei,

716
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,910
I want to go to Celeste.

717
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,710
Right now?

718
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,830
Yes, now.

719
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,190
I don't want to wait another minute.

720
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,550
Xiao Liang,

721
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,470
I need you to find more people

722
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,550
to install surveillance.

723
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,230
Try to cover

724
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,070
the whole Pangu.

725
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,270
Then we'll be able to determine

726
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,430
where the mosaic is

727
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,300
so that we can hunt it down

728
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,220
and get rid of it.

729
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,350
This is also the only way to resolve

730
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,150
the 2021 error.

731
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:01,870
Okay,

732
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,630
I'll get it done.

733
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,670
Stay safe.

734
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,150
Okay.

735
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,270
Wei Wei,

736
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,750
we will soon

737
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,310
meet in the real world.

738
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,150
I'll be waiting.

739
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,670
[42 days.]

740
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,910
[I was trapped inside for 42 days.]

741
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,870
[42 days!]

742
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,710
[I've finally woken up.]

743
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:39,950
Yun Er.

744
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,790
[Looks like you don't know
enough about a father.]

745
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,110
No!

746
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,630
[No matter how heartless
he treats other people,]

747
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,190
in his heart,

748
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,430
there is always a soft spot.

749
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,710
It's you, Zhang Yun Er.

750
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,230
[We're best friends.]

751
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,550
[Today]

752
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,980
[is probably the last time
we'd see each other.]
