00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,890


549
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,030
Hold on.

551
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,750
Ms. Ding.

552
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,740


553
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,110
Although the Ding family has shares
in the hospital,

554
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,890


555
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,590
the patient's family
has signed an agreement with us.

556
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,570


557
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,870
So...

558
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,840


559
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,270
I understand.

560
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,130


561
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,030
I won't tell.

562
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,000


563
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,070
Go ahead.

564
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:51,960


565
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,670
Just like you said, these two patients

566
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,500


567
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,270
have the same condition as Jia Ping.

568
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,120


569
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,670
For now, they still haven't showed

570
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,760


571
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,990
any pathologic reflex.

572
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,960


573
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,870
They don't show any
pupillary light reflex as well.

574
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,960


575
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,830
It's called brainwave interference.

576
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,730


577
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,030
They are in an irreversible coma.

578
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,970


579
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,670
However, their symptoms

580
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,660


581
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,150

583
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,990
to be caused by being online at Pangu.

584
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,020


585
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,230
It's hard to link this
to the 2021 code error

586
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,300


587
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,190

589
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,270

who has the same symptom

594

595
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,550

597
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,590

We need permission
from Celeste Group, Ms. Ding.

607

There's a procedure.

[I better stay away from you.]

913

[The farther the better.]

914

915
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,590
Please enjoy the food.

Thank you.

918

919
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,750
By the way,

920
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,650


921
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,630
about the close friend
you mentioned last time...

922
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,580


923
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,030
Le Le?

924
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,910


925
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,710
Have you heard from her yet?

926
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,630


927
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,790
We suddenly lost contact.

928
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,670


929
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,110
Something happened to the bar too.

930
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,960


931
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,230
I still don't know where she is.

932
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,250


933
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,830
But it's fine.

934
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,690


935
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,350
Maybe she is busy

936
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,540


937
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,870
dealing with the situation at the bar.

938
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,860


939
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,310
So she couldn't reply me yet.

940
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,070


941
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,830


942
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,990
After she contacts me again,

943
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,710
I'll introduce you to her.

944
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,430


945
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,830
Okay.

946
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,570


947
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,550
Cheers.

[User is in the game]

951

Wei Wei.

952
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,430
Wei Wei, open the door.

953
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,220


954

957
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,230
Qiao? Why are you here?

958
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,790
Wei Wei, what were you doing?

959
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,780


960
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,550
You took so long to open the door.

961
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,460


962
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,290


963
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,300
I didn't hear the doorbell.

964
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,950
What's wrong?

965

Wei Wei, are we still best friends?

968
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,430
Nonsense.

971
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,630
Of course.

972
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,590
Then, I want to clarify
something with you.

973

974
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,470
What is it?

975
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,470


976

983
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,750
Do I know witchcraft or something?

984
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,940


985
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,950
Stop denying it.

986
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,020


987
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,030
I know everything.

988
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,590
You're always not yourself the next day.

989

990
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,230
And you keep forgetting things.

00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,070


992
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,390

994
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,670
Have you heard of a disorder

995
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,490


996
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,510
called dissociative identity?

997
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,380


998
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,540


999
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,550
Why are you laughing?

1000
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,260
Do you really have that?

1001
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,140


1002
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,110
What?

1003
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,990


1004
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,350
Besides, I feel weird

1005
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,340


1006
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,660

coming here today.

00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,110
Your place wasn't this tidy in the past.

1009
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,990


1010
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,950
You even cooked?

1011
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,000


1012
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,430
When did you learn to cook?

1013
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,350


1014
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,030
I...

1015
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:38,920


1016
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,070
Why do you have two toothbrushes
when you're living alone?

1017
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,860


1018
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,310
I...

1019
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,230


1020
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,470
Wei Wei, you must be sick.

1021
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,330


1022
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,710
Let's go to the hospital now.

1023
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,650


1024
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,710
Let's go.

1025
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,690


1026
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,640


1027
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,980
Qiao.

1028
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,830


1029
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,110
What?

1030
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,500
You really want to know the truth?

1031
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,470


1032
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,870
Of course.

1033
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,740


1034
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,160


1035
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,230
All right then.

1036
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,389
Switch bodies?

1037
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,270


1038
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,350


1039
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,429
You two have been switching bodies?

1040
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,870
So Mr. Ye was you?

1041
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,860


1042
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,929


1043
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,940
And you were Mr. Ye?

1044
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,150
Qiao, I know it's difficult

1045
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,139


1046
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,980


1047
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,989
for you to accept this so suddenly.

1048
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:21,750
But...

1049
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,520


1050
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,230
Zhao Jia Liang.

1051
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,050


1052
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,670
You knew about this early on?

1053
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,659


1054
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,909
Wei Wei.

1055
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,850


1056
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,550
Even Zhao Jia Liang knew.

1057
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,540


1058
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,980


1059
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,989
Why did you hide this from me?

1060
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,870
Am I still your best friend?

1061
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,969


1062
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,900
That day, Mr. Ye and I even...

1063
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,880


1064
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,820


1065
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,949
I... I didn't mean to blow my cover.

1066
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,270
Idiot.

1067
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,199


1068
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,310
It's my fault.

1069
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,409


1070
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,320


1071
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,469
It's not your fault.

1072
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,989
Apart from Xiao Liang,

1073
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,949


1074
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,990
the one I actually wanted to tell
is Xiao Qiao.

1075
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,860


1076
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,710
She's my close friend after all.

1077
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,650


1078
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,500
I barely started dating.

1079
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,410


1080
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,510
But it's like a secret affair.

1081
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400


1082
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,510
I'm not happy about it too.

1083
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,500


1084
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,270
You really think so?

1085
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,190


1086
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,950
I'll go tell Xiao Qiao.

1087
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,790


1088
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,430
Are you still mad at me?

1089
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,280


1090
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,990
Forgive me, please?

1091
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,820


1092
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,990
Qiao.

1093
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,790


1094
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,990
So not telling me

1095
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,980


1096
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,250


1097
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,390
is your way of protecting me?

1098
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,190
Everything happened too quickly.

1099
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,240


1100
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,110
I swear I didn't mean to
hide this from you.

1101
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,010


1102
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,070
Xiao Liang knew it

1103
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,030


1104
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,460


1105
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,470
by accident.

1106
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,420


1107
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,430
Besides, he has thick skin.

1108
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,620


1109
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,790
He can protect himself.

1110
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,470
I can protect myself too.

1111
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,420


1112
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,670
Honestly,

1113
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,590


1114
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,470
I have no idea what the future holds.

1115
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,450


1116
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,950


1117
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,030
I'm not sure about this myself.

1118
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,340


1119
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,550
Qiao, I really don't want
to drag you into this.

1120
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,430
Yes.

1121
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,290


1122
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,190
I was safe indeed.

1123
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,050


1124
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,310
But do you know how awful I felt?

1125
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,080


1126
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,230
My best friend kept blowing hot and cold.

1127
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,060


1128
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,140


1129
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,150
The person I like

1130
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,820


1131
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,030
married you in Pangu.

1132
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,030
I'm your best friend.

1133
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,020


1134
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,490


1135
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,830
Have you considered my feeling?

1136
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,940
I'm sorry.

1137
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,890


1138
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,270
Indeed I had not considered your feeling.

1139
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,120


1140
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,270
I promise.

1141
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,200


1142
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,430
I'll take care of Princess Qiao's feelings
from now on.

1143
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,180


1144
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,350
You really realise your mistake?

1145
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,220


1146
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,710
You did make a mistake this time.

1147
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,540


1148
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,630
But I'll force myself to forgive you

1149
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,480


1150
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,510
because after knowing the truth,

1151
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,550


1152
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,670
I find that you are still you.

1153
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,590


1154
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,550
You're still my best friend.

1155
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,320


1156
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,830
Thanks, Qiao.

1157
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,790


1158
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,830


1159
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,950
I knew you're my best friend.

1160
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,990
Don't be so happy about it yet.

1161
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,930


1162
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,430
You haven't told me

1163
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,420


1164
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,010


1165
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,110
all of it.

1166
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,470
Is there no other way

1167
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,280


1168
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,430


1169
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,670
for you two to go about this?

1170
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,510
You can only keep switching like this?

1171
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,310


1172
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,870
He's a guy.

1173
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,750


1174
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580


1175
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,590
When you meet

1176
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,770


1177
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,910
that person you're fated to be with,

1178
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,900
you'll realise

1179
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,800


1180
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,950
that you can do anything for him.

1181
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,810


1182
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,830
Willingly.

1183
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,720


1184
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,830
That's cringey.

1185
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,740


1186
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,870
Wei Wei.

1187
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,650


1188
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,950
You're so annoying.

1189
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,900


1190
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,190


1191
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,430
Wait.

1192
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,790
Last month,

1193
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,780


1194
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,260


1195
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,270
didn't we go to a sauna together?

1196
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,350
He saw me naked?

1197
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,270


1198
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,630
I even took a shower at your place.

1199
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,570


1200
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,230
How dare you?

1201
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,200


1202
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,020


1203
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,030
I'm just messing with you.

1204
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,620


1205
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,630
It wasn't him.

1206
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,500


1207
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,510
That was me.

1208
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,650


1209
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,670
Can you two inform me first

1210
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,030
next time when you switch?

1211
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,100


1212
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,310
You gave me a fright.

1213
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,400


1214
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,710
Fine.

1215
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,530


1216
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,910
I never thought

1217
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,710


1218
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,190
you would fall for someone

1219
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,140


1220
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,960


1221
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,150
who is a bigot, bully and overtime freak.

1222
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,030
Your taste in men is surprising.

1223
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760


1224
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,900


1225
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,910
What is wrong with that?

1226
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,860


1227
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,870
I... I just...

1228
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,750
I just feel that he's pretty decent.

1229
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,500


1230
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,590
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

1231
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,350


1232
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,630
He has a nickname

1233
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,330


1234
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,590
in our company.

1235
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,460


1236
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,340
People call him Killer.

1237
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,320


1238
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,270
That's so ridiculous.

1239
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,200


1240
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,590
I feel he is quite meticulous

1241
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,580


1242
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,620


1243
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,630
and good at taking care of people.

1244
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,270
How is he meticulous?

1245
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,200


1246
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,030


1247
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,150
How does he take care of you?

1248
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,270
Wei Wei, you're hiding something.

1249
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,210


1250
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,350
Do you two have something more

1251
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,340


1252
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,230


1253
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,310
that I don't know of?

1254
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,590
I want to hear

1255
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,580


1256
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,200


1257
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,390
all of it.

1258
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,550
Who made the first move?

1259
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,510


1260
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,910
That's a long story.

1261
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,860


1262
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,060


1263
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,070
Wei Wei, you must tell me everything.

1264
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,550


1265
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,670
No.

1266
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,150
Tell me. Tell me.

1267

00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,550
Fine, I'll tell you.

1270
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,910
So who made the first move?

1271
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,880


1272
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,830
Ms. Ding,
this is the flash drive you asked for.

1273
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,700


1274
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,110
Insert it.

1275
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,050

Okay.

1278
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,350
It's connected. You can use it now.

1279
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,260


1280
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,590
Go back to work.

Okay.

[Ding Xiang, I'm sorry.]

[Wait up.]

Wei Wei.

You're Mr. Ye today?

1319

1320
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:49,910
Okay.

Act natural.

Just be your usual self.

1326

1327
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,750
Treat me as Bai Wei.

1328

1329
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,230
Mr. Ye.

00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,070
No, wait.

1333

You're Wei Wei. You're Wei Wei.

1334
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,660
The core team has a vacancy
for planning department.

1335
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,440


1336
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,550
Ms. Linda is very pleased

1337
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,520


1338
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,390
with your application.

1339
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,290


1340
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,590
But

1341
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,760


1342
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260


1343
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,430
Zhang Yun Er is competing
for the vacancy too.

1344
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,230
Zhang Yun Er?

1345
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,180


1346
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,540


1347
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,550
Ridiculous.

1348
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,030
Who is Zhang Yun Er to compete

1349
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,120


1350
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,430
for the core team's vacancy
reserved for the planning department?

1351
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,340


1352
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,610


1353
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,710
Chairman Zhang hasn't even explained

1354
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,010


1355
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,110
about the previous crash
in Pangu's root system.

1356
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,710
Now he is pulling this?

1357
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,570


1358
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,550
Does he think Celeste Group is his?

1359
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,450


1360
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,470
Bai Wei, come with me.

1361
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,360


1362
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,420


1363
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,430
What's wrong?

1364
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,870
Linda, where did you hear that from?

1365
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,810


1366
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,250


1367
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,430
The assessment for core team members
are all about capabilities

1368
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,750
and quality in emergency response.

1369
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,690


1370
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,750
How can it be fixed?

1371
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,610


1372
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,230
I was just informed
that Yun Yun wants to take part.

1373
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,020


1374
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,110
In principle,

1375
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,020


1376
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,990
any internal personnel in the group

1377
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,910


1378
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,870
has the right
to take part in this assessment.

1379
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,860


1380
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:53,940
But of course,

1381
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,910


1382
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,270
I regard highly

1383
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,110


1384
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,630
in the candidate you proposed.

1385
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,570


1386
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,750
Hence,

1387
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,650


1388
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,900


1389
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,910
the solution now

1390
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,580


1391
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,750
is to let Yun Yun and Bai Wei

1392
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,950
compete fairly and openly.

1393
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,860


1394
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,470
As for the competition programme,

1395
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,570


1396
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,310
Mr. Lin and I

1397
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,300


1398
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,580


1399
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,590
have drafted it.

1400
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,510
What do you think, Linda?

1401
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,500


1402
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,190
Since Mr. Lin and Chairman Zhang
have reached a consensus,

1403
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,090


1404
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,440


1405
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,550
I have nothing more to say.

1406
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,230
Compete fairly and openly.

1407
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,090


1408
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,070
I agree.

1409
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:18,930


1410
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,790
Bai Wei, are you up for it?

1411
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,700


1412
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,470
All right then.

1413
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,380


1414
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,780
Let me brief everyone
on the content of assessment.

1415
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,570


1416
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:33,660


1417
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,670
The only core team member

1418
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,380


1419
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,310
from the planning department

1420
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,430
will be selected between the two of you.

1421
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,240


1422
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,510
Since Qixi Festival is near,

1423
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,250


1424
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,390
our assessment questions

1425
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,510


1426
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,310
will be about the festival.

1427
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,240


1428
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,230
Hence your content

1429
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,320


1430
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,780
must be about Qixi Festival.

1431
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,640


1432
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,260


1433
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,270
You will create a viable

1434
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,400


1435
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,510
creative programme
for the festival in Pangu.

1436
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,550
There is no restriction on form and mode.

1437
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,450


1438
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,910
So that's the assessment topic.

1439
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,830


1440
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,940
The two of you can flex your creativity

1441
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,680


1442
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,390
according to your understanding.

1443
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,290


1444
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,470
