Is he reflecting on life?

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,950
Give him another chance.

34
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,430

I found that after General Long Wei

absorbed many mosaics,

45
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,350
he can

46
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,070
control NPCs.

47
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,510
He's coming to Autumn City.

48
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,030
And he's moving forward to the Far West.

49
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,670
The Far West?

50
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,430
He must be going after 
the Day Wheel and Night Wheel.

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,110
What does that mean?

52
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,510
The Day Wheel and Night Wheel controls 
the day and night of Pangu.

53
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,030
Once the order of 
day and night is disrupted,

54
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,470
the server will completely crash.

55
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,230
I get it now.

56
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,710
Pangu's server and he

57
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,830
are now integrated.

58
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,630
He can avoid this crash.

59
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,110
I think

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,350
he's trying to get offline this time.

61
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,750
Get offline?

62
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,190
The code in General Long Wei's body

63
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,430
contains an evolvable learning

64
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,310
thinking module

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,510
that can assimilate the consciousness 
information chain of players

66
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,070
into a complete account 
via the autonomous consciousness

67
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,110
of continuous learning.

68
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,030
When the system crashes,

69
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,630
he can form brainwaves

70
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,830
by compiling bytes in reverse data-mining.

71
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,070
He can absorb 
the consciousness data of any user,

72
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,180
and wake up in their body.

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,790
And those 2021 code users

74
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,910
will completely enter

75
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,550
a state of brain death 
when the system crashes.

76
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,630
So, how are we going to stop him?

77
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,950
Their next target

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,350
will definitely be the newbie hall,

79
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,510
the Day Wheel.

80
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,830
So,

81
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,630
to protect the Day Wheel,

82
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,830
we have to do our best

83
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,909
to guard the hall.

84
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,630
Killing General Long Wei

85
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,590
is our only chance.

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,230

88

You think I will hold you back?

91

93
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,310
You are asking for a beating!

94
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,870
No.

95
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,990
Alright.

96
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,110
We will go together.

97
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,430
When it's over,

98
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,070
we will go to eat

99

100
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,430
Okay.

101

Let's go.

102
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,870
Can it be stopped or not?

103
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,750
I shouldn't have gotten online.

104
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,390
Why did I go online?

105
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,310
How would I know?

106
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,550
Stupid Pangu!

107
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,310
It's all a lie!

108

109
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,500
don't worry.

110

messing with you before

127
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,790
because

128
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,430
I was venting my grudge

What are you talking about?

134

Why are you being like a girl now?

135
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,430
Don't

136
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,550
worry about it.

137
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,350
Just think of it

138
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,190
as you are on a long mission.

139

you are finally here.

147
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,789
I've been

148
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,990
feeling worried until you come.

149
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,110
General Long Wei is coming

We must protect it.

151
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,030
You still don't trust me, do you?

152
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,350
Mr. Ye,

153
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,670
today, I will show you

154
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,950
what's called a golden security guard.

155
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,310
I forgot.

156
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,430
I can't afford to die.

157
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,630
I can't even demonstrate

158
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,950
my talent in front of Mr. Ye.

159
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,670
This is such a pity!

160
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,750
He hasn't shown up yet.

161
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,430
Did we guess it wrongly?

162
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,990
He's probably scared.

163
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,110
There are so many of us,

164
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,070
and he's alone.

165
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,070
If he comes, he will be defeated.

166
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,790
That's right.

167
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,190
Any ultimate villain

168
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,900
is nothing

169
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,420
in front of Mr. Ye.

170
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,270
So what if you are here?

171
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,700
You are alone,

172
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,030

173
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,470
Most importantly,

174
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,590
our handsome Mr. Ye is here.

175
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,310
Today, we will show you

176
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,110
how many eyes Lord of the Horse God has.

177
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,470
I say,

178
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,310
Lin Feng,

179
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,470
you look much better than him.

180
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,350
General Long Wei

181
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,390
looks so fierce.

182
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,910
His eyes are as wide as goose eggs.

183
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,340
Just because

184
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,990
you wear eyeliner now 
doesn't mean you can fight.

185
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,230
Long Wei,

186
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,390
release the mosaics from your body

187
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,590
and return to your original place.

188
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,710
Why should I listen to you?

189
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,270
Pangu is so boring.

190
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,270
Let it be destroyed.

191
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,150
The more you are trying to stop me,

192
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,390
the more interested I am in your world.

193
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,230
When I get out,

194
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,230
I will conquer your world

195
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,870
like I conquered Pangu.

196
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,070
Shameless!

197
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,070
This fight is unfair! 
You got so many people.

198
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,910
I'm here to help.

199
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,350
Hi, everyone.

200
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,270
I'm Wild Boar.

201
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,230
This will be the largest main city battle

202
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,460
since the launch of Pangu.

203
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,150
[Next, I will live broadcast]

204
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,390
[the battle comprehensively for you.]

205
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,710
[This battle is a little special.]

206
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,540
It has no rules.

207
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,710
It is not

208
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,870
just a duel

209
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,190
between users and NPCs.

210
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,230
It's a battle

211
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,150
in which everyone
works together to protect

212
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,390
the 134 patients

213
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,190
who are unable to go offline.

214
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,230
Bai Wei!

215
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,790
Ye Tian!

216
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,230
Ye Tian!

217
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,430
Take back the control of the golden armor.

218
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,940
Quick!

219
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,630
Okay.

220
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,550
Hurry up!

221
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,550
They can't hold it anymore.

222
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,310
Ms. Linda,

223
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,990
we can't take back the control 
of the golden armor.

224
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,430
Figure something out!

225
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,110
Ms. Linda,

226
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,510
let me try.

227
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,590
Let Xiao Guo try it.

228
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,190
Okay.

229
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,390
Linda!

230
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,310
[Do you remember what you promised me?]

231
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,470
[Do it now!]

232
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,110
I can't.

233
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,790
Even if General Long Wei is created

234
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,590
based on your chain of consciousness,

235
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,740
and you can override it,

236
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,350
but...

237
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,190
Do it now!

238
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,950
But I didn't promise you!

239
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,390
[If you override him,]

240
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,300
the consequences are unimaginable.

241
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,550
You might even...

242
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,150
You might even 
disappear completely in Pangu!

243
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,940
You kept telling me not to 
forget my original aspiration.

244
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,620
Now is our only chance.

245
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,310
I can't let Pangu be destroyed like this!

246
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,950
[Be quick!]

247
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,990
Watch out!

248
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,150
Lin Feng!

249
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,150
Lin Feng!

250
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,910
It worked.

251
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,310
We got the golden armor's access back.

252
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:46,910
We got it back.

253
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,470
Yes!

254
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,950
Xiao Tian,

255
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,790
I did it!

256
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,230
I didn't tell you before

257
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,990
because I was worried 
that you wouldn't approve of this.

258
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,190
I can control him now.

259
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,470
I did it!

260
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,910
No.

261
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,550
I can't override him.

262
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,940
I can't control it anymore.

263
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,590
Xiao Tian,

264
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,390
kill me now!

265
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,510
Lin Feng!

266
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,590
Xiao Tian,

267
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,310
now!

268
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,870
Master...

269
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,070
Get out of my body.

270
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,430
No way!

271
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,910
I won't let you get what you want.

272
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,540
Then I'll kill them all

273
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,310
one by one.

274
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,270
Not a chance!

275
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,030
I won't let you kill them!

276
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,190
In your dream!

277
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,910
Not a chance!

278
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,830
Xiao Tian,

279
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,270
kill me!

280
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,470
Now!

281
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,630
[Not a chance!]

282
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,780
[Xiao Tian,]

283
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,110
[kill me now!]

284
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,310
[Do it!]

285
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,780
The battle is at its climax.

286
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,870
[My fellow friends,]

287
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,270
[there is no way of telling]

288
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,270
[how long Lin Feng can hold on.]

289
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,910
[Lin Feng has been holding on 
with his will.]

290
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,550
[All we can do now]

291
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,860
[to root for him.]

292
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,380
Kill me now!

293
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,070
Hurry, Xiao Tian!

294
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,990
You can't kill me.

295
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,150
Hurry!

296
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,190
I created you.

297
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,990
I gave you life

298
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,870
and the ability to learn.

299
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,510
I thought you could surpass 
me and Lin Fen,

300
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,230
and become an independent existence.

301
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,700
But in the end, you didn't learn

302
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,350
love and sacrifice.

303
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,430
Maybe one day,

304
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,230
when you can code these two things too,

305
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,270
you'll really become independent then.

306
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,470
But not today.

307
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,870
Love and sacrifice?

308
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,670
Isn't that just killing myself?

309
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,390
Mamma Mia!

310
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,070
We defeated him!

311
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,870
We won!

312
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,470
[We won!]

313
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,910
Bai Wei.

314
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,550
Are you okay?

315
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,070
I'm fine.

316
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,350
We can go offline now.

317
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,190
You can go offline now.

318
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,470
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

319
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,110
Son.

320
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,750
Mom.

321
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,510
Son.

322
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,710
Son.

323
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,830
-Dad.
-You're awake.

324
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,260
Matron! Matron!

325
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,110
Coming!

326
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,870
Let me help you up.

327
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,870
Let me help you up.

328
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,670
You're finally awake.

329
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,750
Call the doctor.

330
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,190
Go.

331
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,670
-Doctor! Doctor!
-Drink some more.

332
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,390
Xiao Qing.

333
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,910
You're finally awake.

334
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,350
Doctor!

335
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,230
My daughter is awake.

336
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,030
Let's get busy.

337
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,110
Son.

338
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,030
Linda,

339
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,190
please release 
Ye Tian's account authority,

340
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,270
re-clear the file.

341
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,540
Let him go offline now.

342
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,030
This is impossible.

343
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,150
Try again.

344
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,190
The appearance of that golden armor

345
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,390
completely disrupted 
the foundation of the server.

346
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,950
Even

347
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,830
clearing it now

348
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,310

349
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,430

350

to its initial settings.

351
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,110
So...

352

He can't go offline anymore.

353
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,750
Can't go offline?

354
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,550
How is that possible?

355
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,710
No, no.

356
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,110
There must be a mistake somewhere.

357
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,990
Try again.

358
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,710
Bai Wei,

359
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,910
there is no need to try.

360
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,750
You knew this.

361
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,470
Why did you hide it from me?

362
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,830
I think if it were you,

363
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,670
you would have done the same.

364
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,790
So, the reason you spent

365
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,270
the whole night with me

366
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,110
is because you only had 
that one night left.

367
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,740
Were you happy that night?

368
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,990
I was really happy.

369
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,390
I remember

370
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,700
every moment of you very clearly.

371
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,350
Especially your laughter.

372
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,750
No.

373
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,670
This shouldn't be the end.

374
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,190
I don't accept this.

375
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,950
This shouldn't be the end.

376
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,230
We still have a lot of things 
we haven't done.

377
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,270
I haven't introduced you to my dad.

378
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,550
We still have a lot of things 
we haven't done.

379
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,150
There must be something you can do, right?

380
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,830
Tell me,

381

Bai Wei.

383

I've made up my mind.

384
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,990
Meeting you is the happiest thing

385
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,860
in my life.

386
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,670
You made my life meaningful.

387
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,630
But I created Pangu.

388

fix this mistake myself.

390

Forgive me once more, okay?

391
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,070
Right.

392
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,790
It seems that

393

I keep breaking my promise to you.

394
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,350

Force them to go offline.

I can stay here in your place.

407

Lin Feng, what are you talking about?

408
