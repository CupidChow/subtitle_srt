00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,390
You really care about Xiao Tian.

00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,830
The day when Xiao Tian had his accident,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,830
you also came.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,830
And you left him a commemorative AR coin.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,710
We made a pact.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,310
The one who loses

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,470
will take the coin as a memento,

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,030
and return it to another person
when he wins.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,030
But he has been in coma,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,990
so, I'm keeping the coin for him first.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,670
I'm waiting for him
to wake up and return it to me.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,070
I've been staying

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,550
by Xiao Tian's side
the last couple of days.

15
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,430
I want him to wake up too.

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,950
Do you really want him to wake up?

17
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,780
What does that mean?

18
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,270
Nothing.

19
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,150
Since I've seen him,

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,150
I should go.

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,550
Bai Wei!

22
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,110
I hope you will really

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,630
take good care of your best friend.

Hi, Mr. Lin.

27
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,390
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

28

[I'm waiting for you on the rooftop.]

29
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,070
Mr. Zhang, why do you want to see me?

30
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,550
I want to confirm if what you want

31
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,950
is the same as what I want.

32
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,710
Such as

33
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,710
Ye Tian should just stay in a coma.

34
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,390
Such as it's best for everyone

35
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,830
if he never wakes up.

36
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,230
What are you talking about?

37
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,110
You heard me very clearly.

38
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,909
I'm curious about

39
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,470
the reason you administered

40
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,350
Colami to him.

41
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

42
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,390
On June 13,

43
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,710
you purchased a batch of Colami

44
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,350
from the black market.

[you secretly injected this drug]

48
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,270
into your best friend, Ye Tian's body.

49
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,710
I'm warning you,

50
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,830
you could be held legally responsible
for saying that,

51
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,590
you know?

52
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,070
You want the police to get involved?

53
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,270
Go ahead.

54
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,950
Not only will I take responsibility
for my words,

55
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,870
but I can also provide evidence
to back up my words.

56
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,230
I'm sure you remember that
on the night of Ye Tian's accident,

57
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,990
there was a three-hour gap
in the security footage

58
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,550
of the test department lobby.

59
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,710
Because of this, many people

60
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,350
were held accountable
and fired by the group.

61
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,990
The footage of the three hours gap,

62
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,430
I have it.

63
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,190
That night,

64
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,270
although you replaced certain parts
of the security footage

65
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,510
of the test department lobby,

66
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,070
you would never have thought

67
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,270
that there was another security camera
in a hidden spot in the department.

68
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,990
When the department
was renovated last year,

69
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,270
they forgot to remove it.

70
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,310
I only noticed it
when I watched the replay last night.

71
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,790
Due to the camera angle,

72
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,270
it didn't capture your face,

73
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,230
but your movements and posture

74
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,070
can't escape the body movement
identification system.

75
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,710
Are you interested

76
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,030
in watching the replay with me, Mr. Lin?

77
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,070
Let's look at

78
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,550
what you did to Ye Tian

79
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,150
when he was online

80
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,150
in the engineering machine doing tests.

81
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,030
Even if the situation was as you say,

82
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,190
as you know, Mr. Zhang,

83
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,150
you are the only person in the company

84
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,510
who can execute voltage overload

85
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,750
in the experience cabin

86
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,870
through the main control room.

87
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,390
Is this your counterattack
after being exposed?

88
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,990
Fine.

89
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,470
I can also tell you that

90
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,670
I'm not the only one

91
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,790
with access to the main control room.

92
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,390
You have access to it too.

93
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,710
Let me put it this way,

94
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,710
so what if you guessed it right?

95
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,350
The biggest difference between you and I

96
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,550
is that I have
the security footage as a proof,

97
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,790
and you have nothing.

98
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,670
As long as I show the police
the security footage

99
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,590
and blame it all on you,

100
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,510
who do you think the police will believe?

101
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,550
Alright.

102
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,310
Let's not argue about this.

103
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,230
Actually, on this matter,

104
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,070
you and I already had
a preliminary agreement.

105
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,830
It's just that you injected
Ye Tian with Colami,

106
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,909
which caused him to end up

107
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,820
in this state by accident.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,790
Just because of

109
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,070
that infrequent

110
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,909
2021 code error,

111
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,630
Ye Tian refused to take any advice

112
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,030
and was determined
to destroy the entire Pangu project,

113
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,030
taking everyone in
Celeste Group down with it.

114
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,870
Preposterous!

115
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,230
You and I would have stopped him for sure.

116
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,230
Because we wouldn't have wanted him
to go down the wrong path.

117
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,550
Right?

118
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,390
Lin,

119
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,510
the truth is, deep down,
you and I are the same kind of people.

120
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,430
No, I'm not like you.

121
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,700
You will never understand

122
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,830
my friendship with Xiao Tian.

123
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,590
I just didn't want Pangu
to be destroyed just like that.

124
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,950
That's why I injected Colami
into his body.

125
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,630
I just wanted him to sleep for a few days

126
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,070
so that Pangu could be launched
as scheduled.

127
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,590
I did not expect this would happen.

128
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,390
I've thought about
the worst case scenario.

129
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,950
I could turn myself in.

130
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,510
I could tell the world
the truth about everything.

131
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,980
I've thought about making it up to him.

132
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,870
And I've thought about all the solutions.

133
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,190
I got all the top brain specialists

134
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,310
to come and check on him.

135
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,590
I've regretted it countless times.

136
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,950
I've thought about turning myself in.

137
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,910
Now I know.

138
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,630
It's all because of you!

139
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,630
I've figured it out.

140
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,030
It's because you executed
the voltage overload first,

141
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,270
added with the effect of Colami,

142
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,390
that's why he couldn't wake up!

143
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,150
Since you've thought
about turning yourself in,

144
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,340
but why haven't you done so?

145
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,350
Are you going to say
it's because Pangu needs you?

146
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,150
Celeste needs you?

147
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,830
It can't go on without you?

148
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,030
You have to protect Celeste for Ye Tian?

149
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,870
Stop kidding yourself.

150
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,470
Ye Tian was born

151
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,550
to be the top of the biological chain

152
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,390
of human society,

153
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,830
and you weren't.

154
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,110
You know better than anyone

155
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,470
that you and he are not
the same species at all.

156
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,470
Pangu

157
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,550
is indeed the greatest work of art
I have ever seen.

158
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,310
But the flowers and applause,

159
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,710
the glory and the stage,

160
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,670
have always belonged to him.

161
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,740
Does anyone remember

162
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,230
that this is the work of you and him?

163
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:23,990
Stop.

164
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,790
Lin,

165
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,510
you could only hide in the dark corner

166
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,110
and be his shadow.

167
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,630
Ye Tian...

168
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,070
To Ye Tian, Pangu is

169
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,420
just an invention for him
to demonstrate his genius,

170
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,260
whereas Pangu means

171
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,910
everything to you.

172
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,030
If you let him shut down Pangu,

173
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,550
your life also be destroyed!

174
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,230
Because you've worked restlessly for it

175
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,790
over the past few years.

176
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,100
It is an ambition of yours
to reshuffle the industry.

177
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,750
It's a big bet on which
you stake everything.

178
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,110
It made you who you are,

179
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,190
instead of being someone's shadow.

180
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,950
Therefore,

181
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,470
even if the whole world agrees with

182
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,620
Ye Tian's decision to shut down Pangu,

183
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,390
you will never agree.

184
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,980
Even if he will stay in a coma
for the rest of his life,

185
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,190
you will still do it.

186
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,830
Stop.

187
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,950
I said, shut up!

188
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,310
Drop the act.

189
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,150
You don't want him to wake up at all!

190
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,390
You've worked your way up
from chief engineer

191
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,390
of the technical department

192
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,430
to acting CEO

193
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,310
of the group.

194
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,950
How can you give it up?

195
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,190
Can you really give up the position

196
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,190
you've always dreamed of?

197
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,190
Answer me!

198
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,220
Do you really want him to wake up

199
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,350
and ruin your life again?

200
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,870
Answer me.

201
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,190
So you're saying that

202
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,910
his consciousness is stuck in Pangu,

203
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,910
and he will never get out?

204
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,350
Here's an advice for you.
Will you take it?

205
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,140
These problems

206
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,790
are no longer your concerns.

207
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,630
Put this conversation behind you.

208
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,070
Go back to Celeste Group
and continue to be the acting CEO.

209
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,070
Boss,

210
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,270
the patient is telling everyone

211
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,260
he sees in Pangu

212
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,270
that he can't get offline,

213
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,750
but no one believes him.

214
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,590
We've tracked him down.

215
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,510
What should we do now?

216
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,100
Get online and get rid of him.

217
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,310
Now.

218
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,350
Boss,

219
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,750
once we do this,

220
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,870
there is no turning back.

221
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,350
If we don't get rid of him,

222
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,550
when this gets out,

223
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,270
it will turn many people's lives
into a living hell.

224
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,990
You understand?

225
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,030
[Yes, Boss.]

226
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,030
Man, I can't get offline.

227
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,390
Can you get my message to someone?

228
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,070
No, no.

229
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,870
You can't kill me.

230
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,630
I can't get offline.

231
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,270
If you kill me,

232
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,510
I can't be resurrected.

233
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,710
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,470
He is now in a vegetative state.

235
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,310
There is nothing more we can do.

236
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,190
Hao Ran.

237
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,190
Hao Ran, wake up!

238
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,310
Hao Ran!

239
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,750
Ran!

240
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,630
Hao Ran!

241
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,070
Ran, don't leave me.

242
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,070
Hao Ran, you can't leave me.

243
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,380
Ran, why aren't you saying anything?

244
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,310
Hao Ran.

245
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,190
Ran.

246
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,270
Doctor, I'm begging you.

247
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,710
Please save him.

248
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,590
We will do our best.

249
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,510
I assure you, we will do our best.

250
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,870
Hao Ran.

251
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,270
President, you...

252
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,270
Don't call me president.

253
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,270
Ms. Ding, the meeting with
Celeste Group this time

254
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,700
is very important to Celeste.

255
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,750
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lin
will both attend the meeting.

256
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,710
Got it.

257
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,230
Ms. Ding,

258
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,350
are you upset because of

259
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,270
what happened in Pangu?

260
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,070
Zhang Hao Cheng thought
I had been indulged in the game

261
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,870
since I created Heavenly Society,

262
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,230
so he revived the society
as soon as he could to please me.

263
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,110
Unfortunately, the game is just a game.

264
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,950
Business is my field of expertise.

265
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,070
I'm about to invest in Celeste.

266
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,790
I'm just doing my research in advance.

267
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,470
Fight no battle unprepared.

268
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,670
You haven't been online the last few days.

269
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,830
I went to the society two days ago.

270
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,310
Invincible and the others asked

271
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,150
if they should go
to confront Sea of Flowers

272
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,230
and get even with them.

273
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,190
It was fun at first,

274
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,070
but now that the outside world
is interfering,

275
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,030
that just killed the fun.

276
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,420
It's just a game.

277
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,750
When I had the mood,
I could get wild and enjoy the fun.

278
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,350
The excitement is gone now.

279
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,590
About Sea of Flowers and the masked guy,

280
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,550
just forget it.

281
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,830
Lin, you're here.

282
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,400
Have a seat.

283
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,300
Sorry I'm late.

284
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,670
You seem pale, Mr. Lin.

285
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,550
Looks like running
a big project like Pangu

286
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,470
is a lot of work.

287
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,230
Let me give you a brief overview
of the overall plan

288
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,350
for the next season of Pangu.

289
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,870
No need.

290
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,430
Everything is clearly written on
the business proposal.

291
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,270
And I have full confidence
in your technical

292
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,310
and operational skills.

293
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,550
This time,

294
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm here to talk about something else.

295
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,750
There was a rumour

296
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,710
that a user suffered a brain death

297
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,830
due to some unknown reason

298
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,470
when he was logging in Pangu.

299
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,710
This is a safety hazard of Pangu.

300
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,470
If this problem is not solved,

301
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,070
I am afraid it will affect
our cooperation.

302
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,190
After all, the safety of users
is the top priority.

303
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,790
Of course.

304
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,510
Ms. Ding,

305
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,550
actually, this rumour that you heard,

306
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,790
it caught my attention too.

307
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,470
The source of this rumour
is a Pangu member forum.

308
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,590
There is no credibility.

309
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,630
As you know,

310
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,500
a lot of eyes are watching Pangu.

311
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,030
Our competitors wish

312
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,230
something would go wrong with Pangu.

313
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
So, they hired ghostwriters

314
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,950
to slander Celeste,

315
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,110
creating so many rumours against us.

316
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,430
There is no actual proof.

317
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,590
It's not worth mentioning.

318
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,990
Sounds like
you've looked into it, Mr. Zhang.

319
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,030
Of course.

320
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,349
The patient you mentioned,

321
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,670
I've checked his medical report.

322
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,589
It was his personal illness

323
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,670
that caused this tragedy.

324
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,710
His medical records
are still in the hospital.

325
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,869
If you don't believe me, Ms. Ding,

326
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,710
you can go and take a look at it yourself.

327
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,230
Don't worry.

328
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,740
The safety of Pangu users

329
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,670
is always our top priority.

330
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,829
Mr. Lin is the authority on this subject.

331
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,620
He can tell you more about this. Right?

332
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,350
Yes.

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,190
but what he didn't expect is that

506
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,990
because the system
could not determine him,

507
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,190
it treated him as a bug

508
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,510
and threw him into the recycle bin.

Yes. This one.

00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,500
Leave him to me.

667
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,510
How can I

668
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,830
leave you alone when he's like this?

669
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,860
Go offline. Now.

670
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,350
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

671
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,070
No one will hurt you.

672
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,230
Don't worry. No one will hurt you.

673
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,790
It's okay.

674
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:39,630
It's okay.

675
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,030
It's okay.

676
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,350
Zhao Jia Liang!

677
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,590
Why aren't you up there?

678
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,990
I'm going up to see Wei Wei.

679
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,510
Don't go up.

680
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,470
Ms. Wei is in Pangu.

681
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,590
Why is she in Pangu again?

682
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,110
Does she like Pangu that much?

683
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,350
Like?

684
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,630
When your love for something
turns into a habit,

685
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,550
you will never be able to leave it.

686
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,590
Even if that thing is damaged,

687
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,630
she will still treat him as a treasure.

688
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,030
Yes.

689
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,950
When love becomes a habit,

690
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,150
it's hard to break it.

691
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:15,950
What about you?

692
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,830
Why do you have
the habit to protect Wei Wei?

693
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,070
I envy Wei Wei sometimes.

694
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,110
I think she's so lucky.

695
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,110
You and I are the same.

696
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,990
We don't realise what we already have.

697
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,510
We don't know how to cherish

698
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,110
those who are devoting themselves to us.

699
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,950
Looks like you don't need me to tell you.

700
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,550
You figured it out yourself.

701
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,070
I did not.

702
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,870
So that's pretty much that.

703
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,790
Because there was a code error problem,

704
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,590
I've been trying to help you get out.

705
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,550
Until Pangu's big update
at the end of this month.

706
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,190
Wait.

707
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,550
You're saying that
this is a virtual world?

708
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,590
There's a real world out there, right?

709
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,790
Yes.

710
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,540
You're a scammer, aren't you?

711
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,750
I'm not lying.

712
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,670
Everything you see now,

713
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,590
including what you touch,

714
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,470
was created by you.

715
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,510
I created this?

716
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,430
Who are you then?

717
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,740
Me?

718
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,670
How should I put it?

719
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,510
I'm your wife in Pangu.

720
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,910
You're my wife?

721
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,470
GM001

722
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,310
is you.

723
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,990
We got this title

724
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,470
because we are married.

725
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,790
GM001?

726
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,550
The name

727
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,350
sounds like a code.

728
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,710
It is a code.

729
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,030
You are my little code.

730
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,630
Little code, you know,

731
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,310
you were the one who wooed me.

732
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,590
We've been together for what I believe

733
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,950
to be the same amount of time
that you courted me.

734
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,190
Anyway, I only said yes

735
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,270
because you wouldn't stop pestering me.

736
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,110
I don't believe you.

737
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,310
You don't believe me?

738
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,670
I'll show you the proof.

739
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,660
[I, Ye Tian,]

740
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,910
[officially authorize Bai Wei]

741
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,390
[as my guardian starting today.]

742
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,110
[She is solely responsible
for any decisions]

743
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,710
[I make outside of Pangu.]

744
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,270
[I will accept liability for everything.]

745
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,750
[Bai Wei will not be liable
for any legal responsibility.]

746
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,350
And then, you proposed to me.

747
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,990
You're my wife

748
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,830
and my guardian?

749
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,590
Yes, that's right.

♫ Inviting the moon to drink with me ♫

Sorry.

00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,870
I don't feel good.

799
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,430
I still can't remember anything.

800
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,990
It's okay.

801
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,190
I'm here.

802
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,390
I will stay with you
as you try to recover your memory.

803
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,420
We will take our time.

804
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:00,830
Okay?

805
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,670
I think it is better for us

806
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,310
to keep a distance from each other
in the company.

807
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,070
If you want to talk about work,

808
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,270
you can find me through Linda.

809
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,510
Also, you said that I know you well,

810
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,350
I think you got it wrong.

811
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,110
She can't find out

812
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,310
about 2021.

813
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,270
To play it safe,

814
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,990
go by yourself.

815
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,820
You have to get rid of the witness

816
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,740
before Ding Xiang finds him.

817
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,230
I like Lin Feng!

818
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,830
I love him!
