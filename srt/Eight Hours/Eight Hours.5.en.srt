00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,810
I've just heard that
the lift has broken down.

171
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,440
Xiao Lin Lin.

172
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,550
Linda?

173
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,000
You seem to care so much about Lin Lin.

174
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,610
You're not getting back
together again, are you?

175
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,890
No, impossible.

176
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,600
Ms. Zhang, you're thinking too much.

177
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,730
Xiao Lin Lin,

178
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,780
you know the reason I came back.

179
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,100
I will never give up.

180
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,570
I have a meeting to attend.

181
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,900
I'll get going now.

182
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,860
Right,

183
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,270
Don't bother your cousin if you want to

184
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,620
mess with the lift again.

185
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,650
Mr. Lin, Ms. Linda.

186
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,380
How's it, Yun Yun?

187
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,000
Didn't you say no one would know?

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,040
How did he know it was a manual stop?

189
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,860
I... I don't know.

190
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,530
Forget it.

191
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,180
I've got things to do, I'll get going now.

192
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,440
Look,

193
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,550
he's always been this way.

194
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,170
Qiao, he hasn't been
bothering you lately, has he?

195
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,780
Qiao, I saw him

196
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,340
spying on you in front of our office

197
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,060
yesterday morning.

198
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,970
You need to be careful.

199
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,970
He would be a stalker.

200
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,980
What did he do to you?

201
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,090
Why did you say that?

202
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,700
You haven't even been together yet

203
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,980
and you're already defending him?

204
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,050
Yes.

205
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,210
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,460
Let's go.

207
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,630
Let's go.

208
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,370
5pm,

209
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,870
inauguration press conference.

210
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,020
7pm,

211
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,540
second season of Pangu

212
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,420
update meeting with planning department.

213
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,920
9pm,

214
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,750
appointment with Mr. Guan
of the Qing family.

215
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,930
As a reminder, the press
conference is less than an hour away.

216
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,930


217
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,320
I want to be alone for a while.

218
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,960
Xiao Tian, where have you gone?

219
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,840
You're not in here,

220
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,610
and you can't be found outside.

221
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,260
Come here quickly.

222
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,700
Pangu's prime area

223
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,860
has mountains and water.

224
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,650
With such a

225
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,670
large lake,

226
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,820
Let's hold our company's team building

227
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,390
here,

228
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,700
right on the lake.

229
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,230
Alright.

230
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,210
The era that belongs to us is coming!

231
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,380
Coming!

232
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,410
Buddy, thanks to you.

233
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,240
If it wasn't for you,

234
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know how I would have carried on.

235
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,610
Don't worry.

236
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,460
The journey has just begun,

237
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,480
and we're in it together.

238
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,060
Don't be so gloomy all the time,

239
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,410
okay?

240
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,620
I don't owe you money.

241
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,290
Moreover, look how beautiful the lake is.

242
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,560
Do you want to go down for a shower?

243
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,060
Come after me!

244
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,980
Don't run!

245
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,370
Xiao Lin Lin! Xiao Lin Lin!

246
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,410
Xiao Lin Lin, I didn't know you were here

247
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,550
until I checked your online location.

248
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,080
It's so boring to be here alone.

249
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,440
Why didn't you call me?

250
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,200
I think it's about time.

251
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,760
I have a meeting outside.

252
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,290
I'll leave first.

253
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,520
I've just arrived and you're leaving?

254
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,560
Someone is making a fire in here.

255
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,150
Where are you going?

256
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,110
Wait for me!

257
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,040
This taste...

258
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,940
I think the food system in Pangu

259
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,930
could be improved.

260
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,250
It's good enough to have something to eat

261
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,180
in the middle of nowhere.

262
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,640
Get your strength up

263
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,550
for the journey.

264
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,210
How far are we from
the Love Flower Village?

265
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,970
Over the hill behind us and
we should be there soon.

266
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,180
I wouldn't have been in such a hurry
to go home and clean up

267
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,000
if I'd known that.

268
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,000
What did you say?

269
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,790
Nothing.

270
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,230
Someone's coming, hide.

271
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,230
It's Lin Feng.

272
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,370
I can't let him know I exist yet.

273
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,720
Who's there?

274
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,890
Hi, Mr. Lin.

275
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,300
Bai Wei?

276
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,350
What a coincidence.

277
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,860
I see you everywhere.

278
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,600
What are you doing here?

279
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,820
I came to do a task.

280
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,480
This is an undeveloped area

281
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,640
and fires are strictly forbidden.

282
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,340
There are notices outside the forest.

283
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,150
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,160
I just learned about that.

285
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,340
I'll put out the fire

286
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,930
and leave right away.

287
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,570
Xiao Lin Lin,

288
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,040
you're still looking for Ye Tian in Pangu?

289
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,290
I heard from the staff

290
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,750
that you are like possessed

291
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,460
and come in to look for him
whenever you have time.

292
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,360
Who is that girl just now?

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,740
A friend.

294
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:23,830
Come out now.

295
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,180
How's it?

296
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,430
Wasn't I clever just now?

297
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,700
If it wasn't for me,

298
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,940
you'd have met him anyway.

299
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,000
Thank you.

300
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,320
I was going to

301
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,700
work on this land with him.

302
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,830
But now,

303
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,380
it's become  like this before

304
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,320
we have a chance to design it.

305
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,040
Lin Feng and you are close, right?

306
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,850
I think he's very protective of you,

307
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,120
both in the press

308
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,830
and in private.

309
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,600
So you won't see him

310
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,260
because you don't want
to get him involved,

311
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,740
right?

312
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,370
He is my best friend.

313
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,390
Involving him now

314
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,740
will make him struggle in the group

315
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,960
and it will only be detrimental.

316
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,970
You're a good friend.

317
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,810
If it were you,

318
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,600
what would you do to your best friend?

319
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,490
You'll do the same thing.

320
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:26,740
I...

321
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,740
What's wrong with you?

322
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,070
What's wrong with your lips?

323
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:36,850
I...

324
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,940
Why have my voice lowered all of a sudden?

325
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,950
Why can't I move?

326
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,540
You are now paralysed by poison.

327
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,300
Of course you can't move.

328
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,730
You must have touched something just now.

329
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,660
What should I do?

330
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,880
This poison will last for a while.

331
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,920
We don't have time to wait.

332
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,480
I'll carry you on my back.

333
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,360
You... Put me...

334
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,420
Put me down.

335
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,550
Stop it.

336
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,550
Put me down.

337
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,930
All the media are here

338
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,090
for the press conference.

339
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,970
What's up with you today?

340
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,060
You look weird.

341
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,840
No.

342
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,360
I'll be there soon
for the press conference.

343
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,470
Okay.

344
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,570
I remember you wore this suit

345
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,220
when you were interviewed at Celeste.

346
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,150
You've never forgotten
your initial intention.

347
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,910
That's good.

348
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,320
Thank you for the compliment.

349
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,290
I'll get going now.

350
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,390
[Xiao Tian, the journey has just begun.]

351
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,520
[We'll walk the rest of
the journey together.]

352
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,660
Jia Jia!

353
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,540
Come here.

354
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,500
It's here.

355
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,610
Here!

356
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,940
Coming.

357
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,770
[The owner of Wei Cai Bar, Wang Le Le]

358
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,330
My dear, long time no see.

359
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,810
Le Le!

360
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,940
You've grown taller

361
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,870
and stronger.

362
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,280
I've grown taller, right?

363
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,150
Are you jealous?

364
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,690
Let's go.

365
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,900
I missed you so much.

366
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,780
I missed you too.

367
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,790
What brings you back all of a sudden?

368
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,050
I thought you were
settling down in Holland.

369
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,640
Didn't I just tell you?

370
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,150
I missed you.

371
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,490
You're hypocritical.

372
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,100
I guess you must have some kind of secret.

373
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,740
Actually, I've been abroad for too long

374
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,950
and I'm homesick.

375
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,180
It's true.

376
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,200
Le Le, welcome back.

377
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,160
Right,

378
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,680
I heard you are working at Celeste.

379
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,880
You've made up with your father?

380
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,320
No.

381
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,310
You didn't come back for a man,

382
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,400
but I came back for a man.

383
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,170
Well, I'd be interested in that.

384
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,720
Go ahead.

385
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,390
He is very tall, very handsome,

386
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,500
almost 190cm,

387
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,950
but a little thin.

388
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,400
But it's okay.

389
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,990
I've liked him for a long time.

390
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,630
We are now working in the same company.

391
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,090
Does your dad know though?

392
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,080
Does he agree?

393
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,000
What does it matter to him?

394
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,430
I will pick my man myself.

395
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,460
Besides,

396
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,330
it's not like you don't know
my relationship with my dad.

397
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,760
Your dad...

398
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,990
Is he well?

399
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,220
Le Le, why do you keep mentioning him?

400
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,270
What a buzzkill.

401
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,700
Yun Yun, listen,

402
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,660
you're all grown up now.

403
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,040
You need to care more about your family

404
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,150
and communicate more with them.

405
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,470
After all my years abroad,

406
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,310
there is one thing I have learned.

407
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,090
No matter where we are,

408
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,380
we can only feel secure

409
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,920
when our family is around.

410
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,670
You started lecturing me
as soon as you got back.

411
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,720
Don't worry, he's fine.

412
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,050
He eats well

413
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,980
and minds a lot.

414
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,040
Stop talking about him.

415
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,100
Xiao Li Zi.

416
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,440
Boss.

417
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,310
Boss.

418
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,280
You're back.

419
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,020
Have you brought us any gifts?

420
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,250
Of course, everyone has one.

421
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,960
Thank you, boss.

422
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,860
Le Le, they all have gifts,

423
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,590
what about mine?

424
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,120
No.

425
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,550
Be good. I bought you a gift.

426
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,550


427
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,390
It's in the suitcase.

428
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,660
Yun Yun, didn't you just tell me

429
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,740
you had something to do this afternoon?

430
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,260
Right,

431
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,370
I'd have forgotten
if you didn't remind me.

432
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,510
I just took a half day off.

433
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,500
I'll get back to work now.

434
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,840
Okay.

435
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,390
I'll pass you your gift tonight.

436
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
See you tonight.

437
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,030
Bye.

438
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,980
Bye.

439
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,570
Come here, everyone.

440
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,570
Here are gifts for you.

441
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,460
Coming.

442
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,860
Alright.

443
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,940
Right, boss,

444
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,940
we've been doing well lately.

445
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,870
A few company owners

446
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,910
have asked for your help

447
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,700
in analysing stock market data
when they heard

448
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,400
you were coming back.

449
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,330
I've been abroad for so many years,

450
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,670
- I know nothing about it.
- Just ask me.

451
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,570
Didn't we always work together
like this before?

452
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,670
Welcome back, Le Le.

453
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,840
This is a bouquet of flowers for you,

454
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,290
I hope you like it.

455
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm afraid my mother

456
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,570
wouldn't like this flower either.

457
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,980
But it's a gift from you,

458
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,710
I'll take it.

459
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,180
Put the flowers in a vase.

460
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,560
Alright.

461
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,640
Mr. Zhang, this way.

462
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,460
Boss.

463
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,720
Mr. Zhang.

464
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,120
You've been abroad for so many years

465
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,470
that you've forgotten my principles?

466
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,390
When have you ever seen me drink?

467
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,640
Don't drink before driving,

468
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,950
don't drive after drinking.

469
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,380
Li is still

470
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,560
so humorous after all these years.

471
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,410
He's quite humorous indeed.

472
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,540
I asked him to buy a bouquet of flowers
yet he bought carnations.

473
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,270
Get out.

474
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,630
Why did you come back?

475
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,350
For someone.

476
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,040
I thought you'd never come back.

477
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,240
Did you think my heart was broken?

478
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,450
Shouldn't you?

479
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,630
I have thought a lot
and learned a lot in Holland

480
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,100
over the years.

481
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,790
I can't help but think

482
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,750
that I belong to this place.

483
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,700
I came back this time

484
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,290
to get back what belongs to me.

485
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,510
After all these years,

486
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,250
you never imagined there would
be someone else around me?

487
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,050
Never.

488
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,850
You're as smart as always.

489
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,920
My right-hand man is back.

490
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,420
Le Le, I'm here to ask you
to help me find someone.

491
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,600
Find someone?

492
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,540
I've got a problem.

493
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,520
As you know me,

494
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,710
I won't come to you

495
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,890
unless I am desperate.

496
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:45,530
Five, four, three, two, one.

497
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,480
The cooling time is certainly up.

498
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,870
Shall I put you down?

499
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,540
Okay.

500
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,090
Can you move now?

501
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,480
Yes.

502
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,150
But why is this Love Flower Village

503
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,260
so far away?

504
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,220
How long will it take us to get there?

505
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,330
How did you design the map?

506
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,970
It should be just

507
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,990
over the hill ahead.

508
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,680
The hill ahead,

509
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,220
and many hills ahead.

510
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,090
You keep saying the same thing.

511
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,540
Let's go.

512
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,570
Let's go.

513
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,310
Thank you.

514
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,820
Did you get in trouble because you found

515
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,980
a loophole in Pangu

516
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,140
and wanted to shut it down?

517
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,450
Pangu is a big deal for many.

518
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,040
Shutting it down means tossing money away.

519
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,620
But for me,

520
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,440
it's just a pure piece of work.

521
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,640
I just hope it's good.

522
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,310
If you can't even

523
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,900
do what you want to do,

524
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,980
and what you love to do

525
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,720
in life,

526
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,110
then what's the difference between

527
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,520
being a non-player character,

528
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,850
a puppet,

529
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,460
and these codes?

530
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,850
What are you thinking about?

531
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,410
I... I am not thinking about anything.

532
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,020
I am just thinking

533
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,660
that if you die,

534
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,120
your inheritance will be mine, right?

535
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,440
Can't you expect anything better of me?

536
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,560
What would that Dual Skills looks like

537
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,480
if it was performed?

538
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,400
Would it be literal?

539
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,240
Besides,

540
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,820
what if we can't swap our bodies back

541
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,720
after the swap?

542
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,930
Where do you have so many questions?

543
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,210
This is my first body swap.

544
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,300
[I'm sorry.]

545
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,050
[It's not that you have
a lot of questions,]

546
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,970
[but I haven't figured out]

547
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,000
[how to answer you yet.]

548
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,890
Not bad.

549
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,750
I can't wait to try it.

550
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,200
Is it cooked?

551
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,930
Once again,

552
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,300
keep an eye on this white horse.

553
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,660
It is now the last part of the mission

554
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,940
of escorting the white horse.

555
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,890
At this point of time,

556
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,380
we should be more vigilant.

557
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,410
Never let elite ogres or other players

558
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,400


559
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,510
harm this white horse, understand?

560
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,720
Eat.

561
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,330
Eat.

562
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,810
Eat.

563
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,850
Eat...

564
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,450
Eat.

565
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,770
Eat...

566
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,290
Eat...

567
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,380
Invincible, my energy is full.

568
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,900
I can't eat anymore.

569
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,470
Eat.

570
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,980
His internet network is down.

571
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,450
Probably.

572
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,420
The internet network in my dorm
is always down too.

573
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,590
I have experience in this.

574
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,400
Eat...

575
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,920
Stop eating.

576
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,720
Listen.

577
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,720
I've put

578
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,130
all my savings

579
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,180
on this escort mission.

580
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,500
You

581
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,710
and you.

582
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,250
If you get into as much trouble as you did

583
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,780
on the last mission,

584
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,320
all your prize money will be forfeited,

585
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,490
especially you.

586
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,790
Did you tell your wife

587
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,830
about this mission?

588
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,660
Don't worry.

589
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,620
We've had such a lengthy mission,

590
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,700
I've brought her here in secret.

591
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,050
Where's she?

592
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,790
Invincible, stop looking for her.

593
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,040
She's here.

594
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,930
I didn't want to make
the situation awkward,

595
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,950
so I asked her to dress up as a man.

596
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,910
Hi, sister-in-law.

597
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,390
My mum...

598
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,660
Your mum is here too?

599
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,650
No.

600
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,340
I'm home on holiday today.

601
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,240
However,

602
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,860
my mum will be back later
to watch me study.

603
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,170
How old are you?

604
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,510
16 years old.

605
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,430
16 years old?

606
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,920
Go offline.

607
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,260
But I want to play.

608
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,760
You will have plenty of time
to play in the future.

609
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,750
Go offline and study.

610
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,700
The only way to be cultured

611
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,970
is to study more

612
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,330
so that you will not be
looked down upon by others

613
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,370
and will have a stable job
and relationship in the future.

614
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,840
Got it?

615
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,250
You must be a winner

616
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,350
in real life too.

617
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,460
I see you're online every day,

618
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,850
and you don't even have to work.

619
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,540
I don't think I'm a winner,

620
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,390
I just chose to be free.

621
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,610
Didn't you get fired?

622
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,050
Why are you so talkative?

623
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,900
Listen,

624
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,590
I would like to quit that job long ago.

625
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,230
I was only late a few times.

626
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,590
They could just deduct my salary,

627
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,230
but they fired me.

628
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,110
So you don't have an income?

629
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,350
Yes, I don't.

630
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Why are you still here?

631
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,340
Go offline and study.

632
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,510
Bye.

633
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,790
How about I carry you on my back?

634
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,810
No, I said I don't need it.

635
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,230
Do you have to act tough?

636
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,820
You only have one life.

637
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,180
You have little energy
and are slow to recover.

638
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,380
And you carried me for so long earlier.

639
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,710
So what's so embarrassing

640
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,100
about me carrying you now?

641
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,770
I've done the maths.

642
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,080
Pausing for a second every six steps

643
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,320
can restore my lost energy,

644
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,880
allowing me to walk on
without any energy loss.

645
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,150
Let's go.

646
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,330
Keep talking.

647
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,090
Without any energy loss.

648
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,110
Then?

649
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,900
You're not poisoned too, are you?

650
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,350
I'm not poisoned.

651
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,980
[The character is paralysed]

652
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,780
[System Alert]

653
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,020
[by overexertion]

654
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,060
[and is unable to move.]

655
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,660
[Cooling time is 10 minutes.]

656
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,130
You're exhausted.

657
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,070
Come on.

658
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
No, put me down.

659
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,620
Stop it.

660
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,760
Keep quiet.

661
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,920
Are you retaliating against me?

662
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,290
It would be nice to have a horse now.

663
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,240
Do you have any idea

664
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,620
how much we will actually get
when this mission of

665
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,530
escorting the white horse is completed?

666
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,820
No.

667
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,910
We're destined to meet again.

668
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,580
Be good, lovely horse.

669
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,620
Here, have a carrot.

670
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,540
Come.

671
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,360
Come.

672
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,370
Come here.

673
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,220
Be good.

674
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,350
Be good, come on.

675
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,460

841
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,650
Yes, and the rings.

842
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,170
Get married?

843
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,420
You can't.

844
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,270
We can't?

845
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,970
Only the truest love

846
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,960
is worthy of my witness.

847
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,690
You have to prove

848
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,790
how much you love each other.
