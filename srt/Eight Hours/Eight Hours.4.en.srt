00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,910


185
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,110
The lady's got a hot temper.

186
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,550
Get lost!

187
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,420


188
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,820


189
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,830
Do you wish to die?

190
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,660


191
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,790
Come on.

192
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,050


193
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,060
Come with us.

194
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,860


195
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,870
What are you doing?

196
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,980


197
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,230
Let go!

198
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,990
Wait, who are you?

199
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,780


200
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,790
Why are you taking her?

201
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,580


202
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,670
Darn you!

203
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,650


204
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,670
You hit me?

205
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,190


206
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,310
You...

207
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,620


208
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,630
Boss.

209
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,460


210
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,470
Get them!

211
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,040


212
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,190
Don't move!

213
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,780


214
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,790
You want more?

215
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,980


216
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,150
Stop!

217
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,150
That's enough!

218
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,990


219
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,659


220
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,909
Zhang Hao Cheng, 
now you want to control me.

221
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,300


222
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,430
You're now the chairman of Celeste Group.

223
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,960


224
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,310
You've pushed the Ye family to the brink.

225
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,750
And now you think of me?

226
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,540


227
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,980


228
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,070
What about Mom then?

229
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,900


230
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,500
Yun Yun.

231
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,070
That's enough.

232
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,370


233
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,550
When Mom and I needed you,

234
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,580


235
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,710
where were you?

236
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,190
When Mom died of a heart attack, 
where were you?

237
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,040


238
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,340


239
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,550
If you don't remember,

240
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,400


241
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,630
I can remind you.

242
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,500


243
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,790
You were out there

244
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,710
having fun with that wench!

245
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,270
Yun Yun!

246
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,110


247
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,050


248
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,100
That's enough.

249
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,010


250
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,020
No, it's not!

251
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,260


252
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,350
You listen to me.

253
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,820


254
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,030
Don't even think

255
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,670
about washing your hands off of this debt.

256
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,470


257
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,640


258
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,870
I don't care if you two 
are still together.

259
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,400


260
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,590
But your debt to Mom 
will never be cleared.

261
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,190


262
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,310
Yun Yun, listen to me.

263
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,220


264
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,230
Come to your senses!

265
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,100


266
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,110
You're drunk!

267
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,240


268
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,429
Feeling guilty? Regretful?

269
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,669
Zhang Hao Cheng.

270
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,580


271
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,070
You want to turn over a new leaf?

272
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,950


273
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,350
Well, that will depend 
on whether I give you the chance to.

274
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,150


275
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,260


276
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,390
Let go!

277
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,940


278
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,070
Who is that so late?

279
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,990
Wei Wei.

280
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:17,930


281
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,190
I saw the lights were on in your house.

282
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,050


283
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,920


284
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,030
Don't lie and say

285
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,230
you're not in.

286
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,130


287
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,590
That you're not home.

288
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,390


289
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,550
[Bai Wei's father, Bai Jin Hui]

290
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,420


291
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,630
Lao Bai?

292
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,420


293
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,550
What are you doing here so late at night?

294
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,640


295
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,910
Just open the door.

296
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,710
Is there someone else in the house?

297
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,540


298
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,440


299
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,670
No!

300
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,340


301
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,350
Give me a minute. I'll get dressed

302
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,190


303
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,430
and then open the door.

304
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,260
Open up.

305
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,250


306
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,280


307
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,390
I'm coming.

308
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,190
What's going on?

309
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,180


310
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,660


311
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,670
Lao Bai.

312
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,850


313
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,070
You sure took your time.

314
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,230


315
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,470
You're reeking of alcohol.

316
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,640


317
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,870
Your Uncle Zhang treated tonight.

318
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,960


319
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,070
The men had a get-together

320
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,170


321
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,270
and had a few drinks.

322
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,590


323
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,780
This place is too messy.

324
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,970


325
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,110
Just like me.

326
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,790
Lao Bai.

327
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,750


328
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,340


329
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,350
Sit there.

330
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,970


331
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,990
Don't ruin my clothes.

332
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,320


333
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,470
Dad, how are Uncle Zhang and the others?

334
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,900


335
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,150
Good, they're good.

336
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,710
But they've got complaints about you.

337
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,630


338
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,030
They said you're an independent adult now.

339
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,950


340
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,070
It's hard to see you.

341
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,040


342
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,590
What independent? Nonsense.

343
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480


344
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,310
Dad.

345
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,170


346
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,790
I think you should 
go back earlier and rest.

347
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,580


348
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,380


349
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,390
It's late.

350
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,130


351
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,390
I'll get you a cab.

352
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,900


353
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,910
What's this?

354
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,060


355
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,070
I just sat down,

356
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,550
and you're kicking me out?

357
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,500


358
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,390
Is it because someone else is here?

359
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,200


360
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,710
Who? Where?

361
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,540


362
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,490


363
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,500
Your daughter is just worried
about your health.

364
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,120


365
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,350
I'm asking you to rest earlier.

366

Drive safe on the road
with Uncle Zhang, okay?

544
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,030
But why am I doing this?

545
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,790


546
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,960


547
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,110
Why am I avoiding you, ignoring you?

548
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,390


549
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,580
It's because I don't want you
to be implicated.

550
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,180
You're right.

551
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,070


552
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,270
The group wants my head.

553
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,070


554
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,410


555
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,590
But we don't know
what that person is capable of.

556
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,660


557
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,670
Everyone in the group,

558
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,500


559
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,510
and public opinion

560
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,950
could be manipulated by him.

561
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,780


562
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,900


563
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,910
I must not let

564
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,950


565
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,150
others know about my current condition.

566
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,590


567
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,790
Not to mention those close to me.

568
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,930


569
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,030
They wish to help me,

570
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,830


571
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,030
but they end up getting embroiled.

572
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,430


573
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,670
They try to help me

574
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,350


575
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,550
but end up getting 
into trouble themselves.

576
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,420


577
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,430
This is what happens

578
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,400


579
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,670
when I try to face it alone.

580
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,440


581
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,670
[So it's because he cares about me]

582
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,270
[and doesn't want to endanger me.]

583
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,120


584
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,360


585
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,540
Look at me.

586
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,760


587
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,870
What?

588
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,150
Look at me.

589
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,000


590
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,750


591
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,910
I'm not afraid.

592
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,530


593
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,750
No.

594
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,300


595
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,430
Look.

596
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,260


597
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,270
I'm the only person

598
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,800


599
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,070
who knows the whole story, right?

600
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,980


601
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,990
Plus, your body

602
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,270


603
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,510
is hidden in my house.

604
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,460


605
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,630
In other words,

606
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,010


607
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,150
only by getting you out,

608
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,430
can my life return to normal, no?

609
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,200


610
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,340


611
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,350
If I don't help you,

612
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,480


613
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,630
who else can?

614
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,790
Forget it.

615
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:52,690


616
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,260


617
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,430
We can talk again

618
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,610


619
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,710
tomorrow.

620
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,850


621
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,910
Rest early.

622
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,780


623
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,950
Hold on.

624
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,859


625
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,030
Did you say that my body is in your house?

626
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,670


627
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,790
Yes, that's what I said.

628
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,619


629
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,790
So how do you go about

630
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,200


631
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,349
changing my clothes

632
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,960


633
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,069
or giving me a bath?

634
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:21,859


635
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,990
What do you think?

636
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,339


637
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,470
Are you serious?

638
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,110
In your dreams.

639
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,080


640
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,890


641
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,990
I have something to do tomorrow morning.

642
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,940


643
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,110
I'll come to look for you
in the afternoon.

644
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,450


645
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,590
You better not avoid me.

646
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:39,550
[End neural connection]

647
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,430
Over here.

648
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,250


649
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,000


650
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,030
Okay.

651
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,610


652
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,870
Pass it to me.

653
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:02,980


654
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,190
Okay.

655
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,550


656
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,790
Here.

657
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,510


658
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,710
Lin, I was about to notify you.

659
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,480


660
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,590
How long has he been missing?

661
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,850


662
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,990
About six hours.

663
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,060


664
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,070
What about the cameras?

665
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,280


666
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,390
The surveillance was disconnected.

667
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,990


668
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,190
We don't have any workable clues yet.

669
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,820


670
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,990
There weren't even any fingerprints found.

671
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,470
You don't seem to trust me.

672
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,380


673
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,000


674
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,190
Did you think I made Xiao Tian disappear?

675
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,450


676
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,550
I made no such inference.

677
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,340


678
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,510
This was a well-executed plan.

679
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,620


680
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,630
There had to be more
than one person involved.

681
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,350


682
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,540
A group.

683
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,920


684
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,030
As of now,

685
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,970


686
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,110
we have not received any ransom calls.

687
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,060


688
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,110
Call the police.

689
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,930


690
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,070
We can't.

691
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,860


692
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,030
Xiao Lin.

693
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,030


694
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,270
In our current state,

695
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,630


696
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,830
without any solid clues or leads,

697
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,420


698
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,510
we can't let the outside know.

699
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,450


700
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,630
Lest public opinion blows up.

701
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620


702
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,830
After what just happened,

703
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,260


704
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,190
you still want...

705
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,270
I know, Xiao Lin.

706
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,100
I know you're worried about Ye Tian.

707
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,930


708
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,300


709
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,310
I watched Xiao Tian grow up.

710
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,220


711
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,390
I'm as worried as you are.

712
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,510


713
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,710
But our priority right now

714
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,830


715
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,990
is to help him safeguard Celeste.

716
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,440


717
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,590
You should know.

718
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,620


719
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,750
Although Pangu
is doing well in the market,

720
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,380


721
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,390
we still have

722
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,370


723
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,380
a bank loan worth more than 10 billion

724
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,290


725
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,470
that needs to be paid.

726
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,360


727
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,550
This is a crucial time for the group.

728
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,950


729
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,150
It cannot take any mishaps.

730
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,960


731
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,180
Let alone such an incident.

732
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:27,810


733
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,860
Think about it.

734
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,100


735
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,110
If the press learns about this

736
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,030


737
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,150
and cause panic,

738
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,300


739
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,550
it will be detrimental
to the whole company.

740
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,720


741
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,870
The slightest mistake

742
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,300


743
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,310
could mean game over for all the work

744
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,230


745
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,430
the Yes have put in.

746
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,600


747
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,750
Fine. Then tell me.

748
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,460


749
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,590
How are you going to keep this quiet?

750
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,290


751
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,390
This is a 3D printed

752
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,060


753
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,310
human model.

754
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,630


755
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,870
We've already spoken to the hospital.

756
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,560


757
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,710
Before we find Xiao Tian,

758
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,120


759
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,230
you and I are the only ones
in the company who know.

760
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,940


761
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,990
I know the interests
of the company come first.

762
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,320


763
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,390
We'll do as you proposed.

764
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,350
Simba.

765
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,130


766
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,640


767
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,750
Simba.

768
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,330


769
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,350
Father will be right back.

770
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:19,900


771
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,910
Okay?

772
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,840


773
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,030
Uncle, why did you tell Lin Feng?

774
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,920


775
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,110
He visits Ye Tian several times a day.

776
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,850


777
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,990
It won't be long

778
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,630


779
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,820
before he finds out himself.

780
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,170


781
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,150
His account is still active on Pangu.

782
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,590
But physically, he disappeared.

783
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,420


784
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,300


785
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,470
This matter is not as simple as it seems.

786
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,560


787
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,710
Look, Uncle.

788
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,020


789
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,030
Up till now,

790
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,510


791
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,710
there have been no ransom calls.

792
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,340


793
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,350
Clearly, whoever did it

794
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,550


795
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,710
isn't after money.

796
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,720


797
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,910
Do you think

798
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,540
someone knows that we are...

799
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,410


800
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,030


801
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,230
Li has a tight lip. I trust him.

802
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,280


803
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,470
And I wouldn't tell anyone.

804
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,570


805
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,790
So who could've divulged it?

806
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,160


807
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,310
You?

808
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580


809
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,590
I... I didn't mean it that way.

810
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,220


811
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,230
You jest.

812
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,170


813
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,310
How could it be me?

814
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,960


815
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,180
Alright.

816
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,220


817
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,390
Li will handle it.

818
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,870


819
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,110
We just have to find the missing person.

820
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,820


821
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,950
If he's gone,
the account will be gone too.

822
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,370


823
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,470
No need to panic.

824
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,540


825
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,550
Go on.

826
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,470


827
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,590
Okay.

828
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,720


829
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,870
Brother.

830
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,170


831
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,390
After you died,

832
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,990


833
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,230
I've been looking after Ye Tian
for close to 8 years.

834
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,620


835
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,710
I still remember what you told me.

836
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,790
No matter what happens in the future,

837
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,650


838
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,370


839
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,510
I have to protect Celeste.

840
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,690


841
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,910
Don't worry. I won't forget it.

842
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,000


843
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,270
Since the Yes are failing,

844
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,950


845
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,150
the Zhangs will take over Celeste.

846
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,150


847
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,310
Done.

848
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,590
Nice work, Xiao Liang.

849
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,510


850
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,780


851
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,950
I got it from Da Tou.

852
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,750


853
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,870
I've removed the locator.

854
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,870
No one can track it.

855
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,610


856
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,590


857
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,670
Good.

858
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,030
Nice complexion.

859
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,750


860
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,040


861
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,230
Give me a smile.

862
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,010


863
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,110
Now cry.

864
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,580


865
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,750
Ms. Wei.

866
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,440


867
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,630
What are you doing?

868
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,180


869
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,190
He might get muscle atrophy.

870
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,590


871
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,790
So I thought I'd massage his muscles.

872
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,440


873
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,630
The white hydrangeas Mrs. Bai liked?

874
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,940


875
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,110
I bought it.

876
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,550


877
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,790
It's by the door.

878
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,970


879
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,230
Thanks.

880
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:38,810


881
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,990
You're welcome.

882
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,200


883
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,350
Oh, right.

884
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,620


885
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,630
Xiao Qiao. I don't want to see her.

886
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,850


887
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,990
Make sure she doesn't find out.

888
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,620


889
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,830
I know.

890
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,720


891
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,950
I prefer not to be annoyed too.

892
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,150


893
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,390
Anyway, come here.

894
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,290


895
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,300
You still forget 
even though I keep reminding you.

896
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,770


897
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,950
You should buy your own medicine
for your ailments.

898
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,020


899
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,190
Hold on.

900
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,900


901
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,950
I have to go somewhere.

902
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,770


903
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,870
Look after him for me.

904
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,850


905
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,060
See you.

906
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,300


907
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,510
Count yourself lucky.

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,350
Are you upset?

1264
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,440


1265
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,540
No, it was fun.

1266
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,670
[It's not yet time]

1267
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,530


1268
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,330


1269
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,510
[to say some things.]

1270
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,550


1271
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,790
Did you get

1272
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,120


1273
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,340
what I said before?

1274
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,220


1275
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,430
What did you say?

1276
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,340


1277
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,550
I said,

1278
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,370


1279
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,590
I have to marry you

1280
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,220


1281
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,470
because I need your body to go log out.

1282
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,430


1283
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,670
That's the only way I can leave right now.

1284
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,340


1285
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,550
Use my body to log out?

1286
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,890


1287
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,150
To put it simply,

1288
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,140


1289
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,230
I'm in this situation

1290
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,340
because when the engineer cabin 
was going live,

1291
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,120


1292
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,410


1293
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,430
it was interrupted

1294
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,390


1295
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,630
by some unknown overload voltage.

1296
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,770


1297
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,830
It caused some minor

1298
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,720


1299
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,910
and weird concussions in my brain.

1300
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,440


1301
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,630
So, Pangu's main server

1302
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,960


1303
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,110
was unable to verify

1304
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,280


1305
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,470
my account.

1306
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,830


1307
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,870
The solution for that is,

1308
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,990


1309
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,230
I have to go out

1310
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,620


1311
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,670
and manually fix the source codes

1312
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,040


1313
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,310
in the main server room.

1314
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,550


1315
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,590
Modify the account's vulnerability

1316
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,180


1317
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,350
in order to regain connectivity
to the real world.

1318
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,290


1319
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,500
[He wants to marry you in Pangu]

1320
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,560


1321
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,790
[only because 
he wants to get out of here.]

1322
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,210


1323
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,430
[Why else would he do it?]

1324
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,670


1325
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,870
Are you listening?

1326
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,900


1327
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,030
Yes, I am.

1328
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,780


1329
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,020
This is what I just explained.

1330
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,330


1331
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,390
Now there's a little problem.

1332
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,220


1333
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,510
The procedure has to be done
by me personally.

1334
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,670


1335
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,830
In addition, my character

1336
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,770


1337
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,900
has to be in Pangu at the same time.

1338
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,600


1339
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,670
I've hidden an Easter Egg manual 
within Pangu.

1340
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,860


1341
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,870
It contains a hidden mission

1342
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,190


1343
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,430
called Dual Skills.

1344
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,480


1345
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,710
I'll make it brief.

1346
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,420


1347
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,630
By using Dual Skills,

1348
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,510


1349
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,710
I'll be able to dupe the main server

1350
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,660


1351
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,950
and established a temporary 
exchange of our consciousness.

1352
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,540


1353
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,620
Which means,

1354
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,540


1355
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,590
I'll be able to log out 
through your consciousness,

1356
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,710


1357
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,950
while you remain online with my account.

1358
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,680


1359
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,870
It's killing two birds with one stone.

1360
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,870


1361
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,150
Bai Wei.

1362
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,440


1363
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,670
What did I just say?

1364
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,920


1365
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,150
You said something
about the source code, 2D,

1366
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,230


1367
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,430
and using my body to log out.

1368
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,550


1369
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,790
Am I wrong?

1370
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,150


1371
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,390
Do you know why I'm in a hurry
to get out of here?

1372
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,840


1373
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,990
Because I'm afraid to die.

1374
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,180


1375
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,190
Because I only have one life in Pangu,

1376
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,080


1377
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,270
things might turn at any moment.

1378
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,570


1379
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,830
You know what?

1380
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,430


1381
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,710
Before I got into this predicament,

1382
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,670


1383
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,830
I found a code vulnerability in Pangu.

1384
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,100


1385
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,110
Although

1386
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,830


1387
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,070
the possibility of it occurring
is one in 10,000,

1388
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,050


1389
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,340
but if does happen,

1390
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,020


1391
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,150
it will put

1392
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,290


1393
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,510
the lives of all online users at risk.

1394
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,300


1395
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,430
That's why I must get out.

1396
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,420


1397
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,550
I have to first shut Pangu down

1398
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,280


1399
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,590
and recall all the experience cabins.

1400
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,610


1401
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,870
This matter cannot wait.

1402
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,430


1403
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,470
I spent five years developing Pangu.

1404
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,590


1405
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,790
During that time,
I didn't have one night of deep rest.

1406
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,680


1407
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,910
Why is that?

1408
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,720


1409
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,870
It's because I wanted
to create a perfect world.

1410
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,470


1411
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,710
A world without any flaws.

1412
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,330


1413
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,510
Although the code vulnerability

1414
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,700


1415
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,070
only has one in ten thousandth
of a chance to occur,

1416
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,880


1417
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,110
but to me,

1418
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,100


1419
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,150
there is no difference

1420
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,710


1421
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,950
with it being

1422
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,220


1423
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,510
50 percent or even 100 percent.

1424
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,840


1425
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,070
If anything happens to me,

1426
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,610


1427
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,790
it's no big deal.

1428
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,630


1429
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,830
There are other engineers

1430
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780


1431
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,950
like me.

1432
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,280


1433
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,430
But it's not the same for Pangu.

1434
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,180


1435
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,190
It's one and only.

1436
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,220


1437
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,230
It is unique.

1438

1439
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,790
It has to be perfect.

1440
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,290


1441
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,550
It is the meaning of my life.

1442
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,880


1443
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,070
If the code vulnerability

1445
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,950
resulted in any problems
for Pangu's users,

1446
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940


1447
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,950
then Pangu would be trashed.

1448
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,150
It will be forced to shut.

1449
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,990


1450
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,710


1451
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,910
[To safeguard user security,]

1453
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,910
[he'd even sacrifice himself.]

1454
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,380


1455
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,590
[Meanwhile, I'm more concerned about
my little whims.]

1456
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,530


1457
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,870
[When he gets all serious,]

1458
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,250


1459
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,470
[he looks so adorable, solemn,
and focused.]

1460
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,270


1461
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,630
[He has his own principles.]

1462
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,920


1463
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,110
[Isn't this why I like him?]

1465
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,990
Ye Tian.

1467
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,870
I don't think 
I've ever heard you say this much.

1468
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,300


1469
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,590
I'll help you.

1470
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,730


1471
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,990
Why are you dazed?

1472
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,990


1473
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,070
If you don't say anything,

1474
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,100


1475
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,270
I'm going to change my mind.

1476
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,070
Seems like you really care
about Little Lin Lin.

1477
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,770


1478
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,480


1479
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,670
Are you two going to start over?

1480
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,220


1481
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,590
I'm claustrophobic.

1482
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,700


1483
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,710
Say,

1485
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,700
what if I really married you in Pangu?

1486
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,320


1487
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,590
Will my character undergo any changes?

1488
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,230
Will my default surname also change?

1489
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,080


1490
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,910


1491
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,190
Should I address you as "dear"?

1492
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,630
Or "hubby"?

1493
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,490


1494
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,140


1495
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,150
Our time to shine has finally come!

1496
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,290


1497
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,300
It has come!
