You are talking about Bai Wei?

It seems to me

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,470
that you and Bai Wei 
are finally friends.

Of course...

Lin Feng may like cool girls.

Of course not.

Are you hoping

that I could be nicer to Bai Wei?

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,910
In a sense,

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,750
yes.

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,910
I won't do that.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,110
I know.

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,030
You have trust in her competence.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,750
You want her to be your right-hand woman.

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,110
But Bai Wei

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,310
isn't the kind of person

22
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,510
who can be bought.

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,150
So, what are you planning to do?

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,670
I will go head-to-head with her.

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,510
The only way to win her over

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,110
is by defeating her.

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,870
What?

28
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,230

29

We couldn't take the proper channel,

that's why Mr. Lin

49

secretly modified the Pangu cabin

50
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,950
and created this island trip.

Only through this way,

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,350
people would log in to Pangu,

I know I didn't take good care of you,

485
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,230

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,470
How dare you try to use my daughter

514
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,310
to destroy the evidence.

515
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,700
Are you trying to replace me?

516
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,060
To be honest,

517
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,710
I have absolutely no interest 
in your position.

518
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,990
The evidence you just said,

519
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,870
I don't understand 
what you are talking about.

520
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,510
No need to put your guard up.

521
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,710
I'm not recording this.

522
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,310
You should understand

523
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,500
that I haven't revealed

524
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,830
your secret yet

525
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,030
solely because

526
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,550
I don't want to break Yun Er's heart,

527
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,470
got it?

528
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,590
Actually, all this time,

529
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,990
I have never been your enemy.

530
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,110
You don't have to guard against me.

531
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,350
We've never been friends either

532
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,750
because

533
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,750
I never thought of you as a human being.

534
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,670
I told you that was an accident.

535
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,550
Accident?

536
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,470
I don't want to go through an accident

537
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,830
of your making one day.

538
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,230
For me,

539
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,230
family is far more important than friends.

540
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,670
Lin Feng,

541
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,510
listen to me carefully then.

542
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,990
If I ever

543
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,230
find out that your feelings 
for Yun Er aren't real,

544
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,750
if you dare to lie to her,

545
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,030
I will make sure 
you die a miserable death.

546
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,630
Don't worry.

547
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,870
Whether it's out of my love for Yun Er,

548
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,950
or your understanding of me,

549
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,310
I will treat her well.

550
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,020
Lin Feng,

551
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,030
you have to do three things.

552
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,510
First, at the group meeting,

553
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,470
your men

554
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,310
will obey 
all my decisions unconditionally.

555
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,990
Fine.

556
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,910
Second,

557
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,910
you have to do 
a premarital property notarization

558
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,350
and voluntarily renounce 
all property inheritance rights

559
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,070
of our family.

560
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,150
Okay.

561
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,030
Third,

562
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,310
if you and Yun Er 
have a child in the future,

563
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,950
that child

564
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,990
must carry our surname, Zhang.

565
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,270
Of course.

566
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,070
He can take the surname Lin too.

567
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,990
If you agree to this

568
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,950
without hesitation

569
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,110
and without thinking,

570
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,540
I can conclude that

571
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,590
this wedding is your conspiracy.

572
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,310
And?

573
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,070
And

574
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,670
what you did to Ye Tian

575
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,030
will make the headlines tomorrow.

576
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,590
You didn't

577
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,670
let me down on this.

578
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,030
Since you've agreed 
to the first two things,

579
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,510
I'll go back and 
draft a contract right away.

580
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,630
Two copies.

581
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,270
We are both businessmen.

582
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,590
With a contract as a guarantee,

583
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,830
I'd be more reassured.

584
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,670
Smart.

585
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,670
In return,

586
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,750
when I die,

587
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,110
you and Yun Er's child

588
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,350
can inherit Celeste Group.

589
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,550
Plus,

590
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,710
the secret you don't want 
people to find out

591
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,790
will never be revealed.

592
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,190
You

593
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,870
really are a businessman, Mr. Zhang.

594
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,950
Five days later,

595
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,420
hold the engagement ceremony.

596
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,750
Lin Feng.

597
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,230
What did he tell you?

598
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,590
He gave me his approval.

599
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,830
We will hold 
the engagement ceremony in five days.

600
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,750
[It is said]

601
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,070
[that the engagement ceremony 
of the century]

602
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,550
[will be held at noon today.]

603
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,860
[We will follow up on the story.]

604
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,110
They're here! They're here!

605
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,110
Mr. Lin Feng.

606
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,190
Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin.

607
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,070
Miss Zhang Yun Er.

608
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,830
Miss Zhang Yun Er,

609
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,590
it is well known

610
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,990
that you and Miss Ding Xiang, 
the heiress of Ding Group,

611
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,790
have been good friends for many years.

612
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,190
What do you think about the tragedy

613
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,230
that happened to her?

614
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,030
What...

615
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,790
What did you just say about Ding Xiang?

616
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,110
Miss Ding Xiang is in a coma.

617
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,750
Are you so busy preparing 
your engagement ceremony

618
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,830
that you don't know anything about it?

619
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,710
I... I...

620
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,750
Let's go back first,

621
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,540
okay?

622
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,990
Miss Zhang Yun Er,

623
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,350
please answer our question.

624
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,710
Miss Zhang Yun Er.

625
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,630
It's true that I just learned that,

626
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,910
but I believe

627
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,630
that Ding Xiang will wake up.

628
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,870
She will wake up.

629
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,350
You said that 
when the mosaic pounced on you,

630
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,150
the system prompted

631
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,870
2021 code error.

632
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,750
Are you sure about that?

633
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,950
I'm absolutely sure about it.

634
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,310
Have you figured out a way

635
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,630
to save Ding Xiang and everyone else?

636
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,110
If the root cause of

637
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,190
the 2021 code error can be solved,

638
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,350
Ding Xiang will be saved.

639
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,910
After all, her consciousness data chain 
was only shattered,

640
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,270
not completely deleted.

641
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,150
We should be able to restore it

642
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,350
through the chain of information

643
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,390
stored on the server.

644
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,670
That's good.

645
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,190
But what exactly

646
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,830
is this 2021?

647
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,150
Why would it attack players?

648
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,990
Based on Invincible

649
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,270
and Ding Xiang's cases,

650
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,590
I came to a conclusion.

651
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,830
This 2021 code error

652
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,150
is actually the host of the mosaic.

653
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,430
Host?

654
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,030
Are you saying it's a virus?

655
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,830
That's right.

656
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,550
It is a very scary

657
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,140
and untraceable virus.

658
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,390
But isn't 2021

659
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,990
a code error?

660
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,150
How would it be a virus with attributes?

661
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,070
When a user logs in to Pangu,

662
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,140
an identical message

663
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,990
is generated on the server,

664
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,660
which takes over the brain and nerves,

665
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,430
creating the feeling of immersion.

666
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,790
This error code

667
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,390
will cause the server to generate

668
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,830
an incomplete error message,

669
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,750
thus preventing the server

670
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,310
from making the correct judgment

671
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,270
and preventing
the user from going offline.

672
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,870
I get it now.

673
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,390
So for the server,

674
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,230
there would be two identical people.

675
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,070
That's right.

676
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,230
One is a real player,

677
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,580
and the other is a mosaic.

678
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,430
[I'm screwed.]

679
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,230
[What if I can't get out]

680
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,110
[and die here?]

681
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,900
[I'm getting married soon.]

682
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,550
By the way,

683
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,420
aren't you going to be a witness

684
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,110
for Lin Feng and Zhang Yun Er?

685
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,990
It's almost time, right?

686
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,470
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

687
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,630
Wait.

688
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,750
There is something

689
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,430
I need to tell you.

690
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,550
What's the matter?

691
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,630
Why are you being mysterious?

692
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,430
I promised Lin Feng

693
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,550
when he found

694
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,350
the woman he was meant to be with,

695
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,790
I would give him a big gift.

696
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,670
What's wrong with you?

697
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,870
Lin Feng put you in such a situation.

698
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,020
You still want to give him a big gift?

699
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,990
It looks like he and I are enemies now,

700
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,590
but it doesn't mean

701
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,390
we are not friends anymore.

702
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,820
Besides,

703
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,390
he has found the one he loves,

704
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,430
I'm actually pretty happy for him.

705
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,389
What are you doing?

706
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,870
Nothing.

707
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,389
I just feel that

708
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,510
you look more handsome now.

709
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,230
Actually, if one day, we too...

710
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,310
I'm sure Lin Feng

711
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,670
will give me a present too.

712
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,230
We too?

713
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,030
Alright.

714
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,949
I'll stop teasing you.

715
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,110
Tell me.

716
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,190
What kind of gift

717
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,710
did you promise Lin Feng?

718
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,110
I'll buy it on my way back,

719
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,190
and fulfill your wish.

720
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,030
Lin Feng likes boats,

721
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,310
so I plan to give him a yacht.

722
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,510

White

726
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,989
is his favorite color.

727
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,030

just go offline and call him.

Asking people one by one like this,

815
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,950
it's going to take you a long time 
to find him.

how can you be sure he's in Pangu?

818
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,980
He has to be online.

819

He has to be here.

Our relationship is 
a bargaining chip for him.

824
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,830
It's the same as him having evidence

that threatens me.

826
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,030

to detonate a bomb at the wedding.

Yes.
