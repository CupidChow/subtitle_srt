912
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,030
You know it yourself.

913
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,900


914
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,310
That's just sour grapes.

915
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,180


916
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,790
So correct the plan

917
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,750


918
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,990
I just mentioned

919
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,950


920
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,920


921
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,030
as soon as possible.

922
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,470
Execute all the contents

923
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,530


924
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,830
of today's meeting.

925
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,540


926
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,030
Do you understand?

927
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,610


928
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,270
Yes.

929
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,900


930
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,950
All right.

931
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:45,680


932
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,190
That's all for today.

933
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,920


934
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,390
Thank you all.

935
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:47,960


936
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,230
All right, Ms. Linda.

937
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,770


938
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,850
[Account: Lin Feng]

939
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,850
[Network hidden activity record: Opening]

940
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,670
What's wrong?

941
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,170


942
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,990
Are you dealing with
the executive announcement?

943
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,780


944
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,970


945
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,390
Yes.

946
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,030
You can just look at the final version.

947
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,850


948
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,270
Is there anything else?

949
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,040


950
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,870
I heard that someone
in the marketing department

951
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,870


952
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,750
violated the employee's code of practice

953
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,220


954
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,110
by investigating
the network address of colleagues.

955
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,990


956
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,350
Nothing much.

957
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,140


958
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,550
I just want to remind you

959
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,240


960
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,830
to do well in monitoring and protection.

961
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,590


962
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,030
Really?

963
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:56,820


964
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,110
How interesting.

965
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:58,960


966
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,110
But our department

967
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,240


968
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,790
doesn't recruit such a gossip.

969
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,570


970
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,390
I'll continue my work then.

971
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,300


972
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,960


973
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,550
[He found it out so soon.]

974
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,580


975
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,710
Xiao Qiao,

976
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,510
it's less than 24 hours

977
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,460


978
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,660


979
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,910
after his operation.

980
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,830
The non-immediate family

981
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,880


982
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,460
can only look after him after three days.

983
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,400


984
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,910
We came in so smoothly.

985
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,430


986
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,980
What did you tell the receptionist?

987
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,920


988
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,550
I said I'm his fiancee.

989
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,440


990
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,150
Or what else can we do?

991
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960


992
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,110
Have you checked the computer?

993
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,800


994
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,110
All the folders in his computer
are encrypted.

995
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,140


996
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,390
I can't crack it.

997
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,230


998
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,350
Let me see
if there's any way to crack it.

999
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,200


1000
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,630
Zhao Jia Liang.

1001
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,450


1002
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,390
Can you stop thinking about it now?

1003
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,320


1004
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,190
He's like this.

1005
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,140


1006
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,590


1007
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,750
Can you respect him?

1008
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,870
Guo Yi Da.

1009
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,740


1010
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,790
I don't understand what you told me

1011
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,590


1012
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,830
that night.

1013
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,710


1014
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,470
You asked me out so late.

1015
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,290


1016
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,790
What were you trying to tell me?

1017
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,550


1018
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,910
But don't worry.

1019
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,480


1020
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,070
If Zhang Hao Cheng really hurt you,

1021
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,890


1022
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,590
I'll seek justice for you.

1023
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,350


1024
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,830
Xiao Qiao.

1025
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,720


1026
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,389
Stay here with him.

1027
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,230


1028
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,190
I'll help you find out

1029
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,730


1030
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,710
what he's hiding.

1031
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,210


1032
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,710
If I don't figure it out,

1033
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,409


1034
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,429
all his sacrifices

1035
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,070


1036
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,310
will be meaningless.

1037
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,100


1038
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,020
Zhao Jia Liang,

1040
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,190
thank you.

1041
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:22,989


1042
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,389
It's nothing.

1043
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,179


1044
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,310
What's wrong?

1045
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,120


1046
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,350
Are you thinking about Guo Yi Da?

1047
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,199


1048
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,020
If I'm not mistaken,

1049
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,630


1050
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,030
this matter is related to the 2021 code.

1051
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,909


1052
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,830
When you enter the core area,

1053
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,520


1054
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,150
everything will be over.

1055
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,989


1056
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,670
Ms. Wei, dodge it!

1057
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,530


1058
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,900


1059
00:34:59,470 --> 00:34:59,950
Watch out.

1060
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,940


1061
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,310
Be careful.

1062
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,190
It's invincible.

1063
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,250


1064
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,030
Don't let it touch you.

1065
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,960


1066
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,270
It's not afraid of
physical attack and air attack.

1067
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,050


1068
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,750
It must be afraid of attribute attacks.

1069
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,430


1070
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,550
Is there a fire?

1071
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,460


1072
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,870
Firebomb.

1073
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,740


1074
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,430
The firebomb made by Da Tou
from alchemy.

1075
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,230


1076
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,820


1077
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,870
Okay.

1078
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,550
I asked Heavenly Society members

1079
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,650


1080
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,790
to find patients in Pangu

1081
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,680


1082
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,230
and they found some clues.

1083
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,960


1084
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,070
They said it's in Autumn City.

1085
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,090


1086
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,070
I came here right away.

1087
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,020


1088
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,870
But I don't know

1089
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,940


1090
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,430
what it has to do with 2021.
