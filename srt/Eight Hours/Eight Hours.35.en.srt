Look. What's wrong with him?

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,790
It was a dream.

Mr. Lin.

Please answer our question.

14
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,110
Please answer.

Mr. Lin.

16

What Zhang Hao Cheng has done

17
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,070
has nothing to do with me

18
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,030
or our group.

19
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,790
There's only one thing
I care about now.

20
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,350
How much did you hide from me

21
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,310
about the 2021 code error?

22
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,270
Mr. Lin.

23
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,950
We just knew it too.

24
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,990
Shut up!

25
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,030
You signed the contract
with Magellan Group.

26
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,710
You said you didn't know, did you?

From now on,

28

actively cooperate with the police

all the people involved.

to solve the 2021 code error.

33

Save the trapped online users.

34
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,150
I'll try my best

35
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,110
to save them

36

37

And

38
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,470
I want to remind

39
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,390
those who disobey me

40
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,990
and withhold information.

41
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,270
Wait and see.

42
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,590
I'll find you out

43
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,870
one by one.

44
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,710
I'll lead this
special investigation team.

45
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,110
Let Bai Wei be the deputy leader.

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,350
But her qualification...

47

Dismiss.

48

Move!

49

Wei Wei.

54
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,620
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,110
I lied to you.

56
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,140
Invincible is holding a letter

57
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,950
I left for you.

58
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,390
Lied to me?

59
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,670
What does it mean?

60
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,030
What's going on?

61
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,670
Why did

62
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,750
the non-player character evolve?

63
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,990
Like a terminator.

64
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,110
I don't know.

65
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,620
It's not a good thing, anyway.

66
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,070
Xiao Liang, look over there.

67
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,950
Everybody.

68
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,950
General Long Wei of Autumn City

69
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,190
is right behind me.

70
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,780
Why doesn't he stay in the main city

71
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,150
but come here instead?

72
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,310
Let me guess.

73
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,510
He may be

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,310
Pangu's new boss

75
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,390
next season.

76
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,710
Awesome.

77
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,870
Why is Pangu getting
more and more strange?

78
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,510
Da Tou.

79
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,270
Let's go back to Autumn City.

80
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,230
We have to tell Ms. Wei now.

81
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,390
Okay.

82
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,230
Invincible.

83
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,790
Where is he?

84
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,390
He...

85
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,430
He left this letter for you.

86
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,470
Then he left.

87
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,510
When did he leave?

88
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,710
He left long ago.

89
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,590
Ms. Wei.

90
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,430
He was not in a good state

91
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,990
when he left.

92
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,830
He looked like

93
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,030
he would die on the battlefield
in a drama.

94
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,110
Don't talk nonsense.

95
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,190
I'm leaving.

96
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,390
Don't come to me.

97
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,940
And you have to go offline
as soon as possible.

98
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,710
Don't log in to Pangu anymore.

99
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,070
The number of 2021 code errors

100
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,030
is far more than we thought.

101
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,190
I can't stop it anymore.

102
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,990
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,390
I let you down.

104
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,430
Forget me,

105
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,150
Wei Wei.

106
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,030
Please.

107
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,830
Ye Tian, you fool.

108
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,990
Which direction did he go?

109
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,470
I have no idea.

110
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,510
Why didn't you stop him?

111
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,190
Stop him?

112
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,750
Do you think

113
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,830
I can stop him?

114
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,870
Everybody,

115
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,390
he's not like

116
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,070
a non-player character.

117
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,390
Look at his moves.

118
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,460
How smooth.

119
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,670
Amazing.

120
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,550
He seems to have seen me.

121
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,310
Everybody.

122
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,790
I'm risking my life live streaming.

123
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,590
Everybody.

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,190
He's gone.

125
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,430
I'll continue to follow him.

126
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,670
Ms. Wei.

127
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,350
Listen to me.

128
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,750
All the mosaics have gone

129
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,910
into General Long Wei's body.

130
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,190
A... All?

131
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,790
Yes.

132

Ms. Wei.

133
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,110
Ye Tian doesn't want to talk to you.

134
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,670
It's no use sending him a message.

135
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,670
I can find him

136
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,740
if I insist.

137

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,510
I really need your skills now.

140

If you hear the message,

141

call me as soon as possible.

Check Bai Wei's online record.

You're still alive.

155

You didn't kill me.

156
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,190
Impossible!

157
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,870
Actually,
I've always been by your side.

158
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,430
No way.

159
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,230
That was just a dream.

160
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,820
There must be something wrong
with the system.

161

Check Sea of Flowers' account for me.

175
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,190
completed the Sword Cottage
special task together.

176
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,390
Sea of Flowers

177
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,150
and GM 001

178
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,110
completed the Black Forest
task together.

179
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,830
Wei Wei.

180
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,710
This beast is like a dog.
It has a weak waist.

181
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,940
Its weak point is in its waist.

182
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,430
Let's attack its vital part.

183
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,550
So you've been together

184
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,550
since the beginning.

185
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,870
Bai Wei didn't think

186
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,550
Xiao Tian was unconscious
from the beginning.

187
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,030
I'm too dumb.

188
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,630
Sea of Flowers

189
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,310
and GM 001

190
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,830
completed the only bonus task

191
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,540
of Love Flower Village.

192
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,150
They got married

193
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,390
and learned Dual Cultivation.

194
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,950
Dual Cultivation?

195
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,990
Old man.

196
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,350
I'll make up

197
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,390
for your crimes one by one.

198
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,950
Ms. Zhang.

199
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,110
Why are you here?

200
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,270
I...

201
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,670
I want to see my cousin.

202
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,710
Go in.

203
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,070
Yi Da.

204
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,230
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,190
Xiao Tian.

206
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,870
It's been a while.

207
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,830
Mdm. Chen.

208
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,390
Mdm. Chen.

209
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,510
It's just a remnant image.

210
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,030
Why are you also recycled
by the recycle bin?

211
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,430
No.

212
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,990
You're the first patient of 2021.

213
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,830
When designing Pangu,

214
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,070
I used to upload your
cognitive data chain information.

215
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,790
It's the root cause
of the 2021 code error.

216
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,270
It's all my fault.

217
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,990
Xiao Tian.

218
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,390
It's been a while.

219
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,910
Mdm. Chen.

220
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,550
Do you know that?

221
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,150
I founded Pangu with all I have

222
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,310
because I want to create

223
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,070
a new and different world

224
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,340
for everyone.

225
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,710
But in the end, I found that

226
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,310
I couldn't change anything.

227
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,910
There's no perfect thing in the world.

228
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,580
Nothing

229
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,150
is perfect.

230
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,230
I should have realized this earlier.

231
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,310
It's just like I can't save everyone.

232
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,270
I'm sorry.

233
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,910
I promised you

234
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,780
I'd take good care of Wei Wei.

235
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,430
But I can't do it.

236
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,550
I can't just stand by

237
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,790
and let her take risks for me.

238
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,710
I thought I wasn't afraid of death.

239
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,620
But

240
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,190
after entering Pangu,

241
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,950
I realized

242
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,950
I wasn't as strong as I thought.

243
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,710
I love her.

244
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,310
I can't bear to leave her.

245
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,700
Mom.

246
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,190
Wei Wei.

247
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,270
This is the remnant image of Mdm. Chen.

248
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,109
It's virtual.

249
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,430
Ye Tian.

250
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,740
Do you remember

251
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,670
when my mother was alive,

252
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,180
you promised her

253
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,390
to build Pangu

254
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,630
into a world of infinite possibilities

255
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,590
to continue her unfulfilled dreams?

256
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,070
Infinite possibilities?

257
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,550
Nothing is impossible.

258
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,750
Xiao Liang said I can't find you.

259
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,950
I found you, didn't I?

260
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,270
So as long as

261
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,310
we don't give up,

262
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,670
we can find a way to save Pangu.

263
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,950
Weren't you a believer in miracles?

264
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,550
Neither Uncle Ye nor my mother

265
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,580
wanted to see you

266
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,190
give up so easily.

267
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,910
And

268
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,190
didn't you promise to

269
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,630
stay with me
for the rest of your life?

270
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,630
Why did you leave me behind?

271
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,190
You still owe me an apology.

272
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,510
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,180
It's okay.

274
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,270
August 2nd, 8:00 a.m.

275
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,070
Bai Wei was online.

276
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,230
Ye Tian was offline.

277
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,910
August 2nd, 8:00 p.m.

278
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,030
Bai Wei was offline.

279
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,910
Ye Tian was online.

280
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,070
So you've been with me all the time.

281
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,310
Actually,
I've always been by your side.

282
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,430
No way. Impossible.

283
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,230
Lin Feng.

284
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,070
Quit it.

285
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,830
Simba.

286
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,990
I can't accept

287
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,110
what you gave me.

288
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,510
It's not an ordinary stone

289
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,780
but Star Moonstone.

290
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,270
Why haven't I thought of

291
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,350
such a simple thing.

292
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,510
From today onwards,

293
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,270
you're the controller with

294
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,110
the highest authority of Celeste Group.

295
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,710
You're my best brother.

296
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,790
You're unique in my heart.

297
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,110
Whether it's before,
now or in the future,

298
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,070
you're the one
who loves Celeste Group most.

299
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,070
I don't want you going to the bad.

300
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,870
Welcome.

301
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,470
What would you like, Miss?

302
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,030
It's okay, thank you.

303
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,630
All right.

304
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,310
You're so sure I'll come.

305
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,270
I wasn't sure.

306
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,510
After all, I made

307
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,950
so many unforgivable mistakes.

308
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,510
I'm glad you know it.

309
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,550
But

310
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,350
no matter what wrong I did,

311
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,430
you and Xiao Tian

312
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,470
are always willing to give me a chance.

313
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,500
Right?

314
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,150
What do you mean?

315
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,190
He came to see me yesterday.

316
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,350
He said he'd give me another chance.

317
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,470
And

318
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,910
I also want to be

319
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,870
who I used to be.

320
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,670
Did Xiao Tian

321
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,670
come to see you?

322
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,910
Didn't he...

323
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,230
He woke up once yesterday.

324
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,030
He also asked me

325
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,230
to help him save Pangu

326
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,430
and those trapped users.

327
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,950
He even gave me this.

328
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,350
He said he'd forgive me

329
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,350
after everything was done.

330
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,790
No way.

331
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,630
Linda.

332
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,950
I hope you can come back

333
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,470
and work with me

334
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,710
to overcome the 2021 code error.

335
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,030
And then?

336
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,670
Then I promised Xiao Tian that

337
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,430
I'd turn myself in

338
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,030
and bear all the punishment I deserve.

339
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,230
Okay.

340
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,550
I'll come back.

341
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,790
But

342
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,110
it's not for Xiao Tian

343
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,870
but you.

344
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,230
The one I once loved.

345
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,390
Right.

346
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,860
Once loved.

347
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,710
Yes.

348
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,750
I hope

349
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,230
you can find your original self.

350
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,390
I believe we'll forgive you

351
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,750
if you're willing

352
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,590
to make up for it.

353
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,670
I'll try my best

354
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,390
to make up for all my mistakes.

355
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,550
Before that,

356
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,350
I think you need to meet someone.

357
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,630
The one who has been
deeply hurt by you.

358
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,590
You're finally here.

359
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,830
How are you?

360
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,310
Your dad...

361
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,830
You didn't

362
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,310
come to me for him, right?

363
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,590
Yes.

364
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:42,990
I didn't.

365
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,590
I saw the news.

366
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,510
You announced you'd save Pangu

367
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,510
and become a hero.

368
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,430
You need to devote yourself to it.

369
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,470
And

370
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,630
I'm a stone in your heart.

371
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,150
That's why you need

372
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,110
my forgiveness to feel at ease, right?

373
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,670
I'm really sorry about

374
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,990
what happened between us.

375
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,630
I'll make up for it.

376
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,430
I don't need it.

377
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,670
I don't need your apology either.

378
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,940
Because I was wrong, too.

379
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,590
Do you know

380
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,510
I once asked someone to kidnap you?

381
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,470
I wonder if

382
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,430
you can stay with me

383
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,750
all the time like this.

384
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,670
Do you find me ridiculous?

385
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,900
If I

386
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,910
hadn't done so,

387
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,990
my dad wouldn't

388
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,750
have been arrested.

389
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,030
I wouldn't have known

390
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,270
how cruel he is to others

391
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,350
and how good he is to me.

392
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,670
Lin Feng.

393
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,790
Only now do I know

394
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,790
how annoying

395
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,710
and capricious

396
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,350
I was.

397
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,550
So

398
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,710
I won't blame you for

399
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,270
what you've done to me.

400
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,110
Don't worry.

401
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,510
Don't look at me like that.

402
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,590
It's true.

403
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,270
I just figured out a lot of things.

404
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,110
Actually,

405
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,350
I don't love you as much as I thought.

406
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,390
All I love

407
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,470
is myself, who loves you crazily.

408
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,310
Do you understand?

409
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,750
It doesn't matter whether

410
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,910
you understand or not.

411
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,430
Lin Feng.

412
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,950
Now we're square.

413
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,550
Try your best to do what you want.

414
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,230
Because I have something I want to do.

415
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,190
Good luck.

416
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,110
Goodbye.

417
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,870
Goodbye.

418
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,110
Mr. Lin.

419
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,950
There's

420
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,510
such a big hidden danger in Pangu.

421
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,910
Did the police get involved?

422
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,070
We'll fully

423
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,950
cooperate with the police.

424
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,110
We'll fix this code error at all costs

425
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,630
as soon as possible.

426
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,550
Mr. Lin.

427
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,910
There are 134 infected users

428
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,710
who can't go offline now.

429
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,430
Is it the official accurate figure

430
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,430
or more than that?

431
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,190
The number is accurate.

432
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,870
The 134 users

433
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,020
who can't go offline,

434
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,510
whether online or offline,

435
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,270
should be fully protected by our group.

436
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,990
I can promise that

437
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,430
these users who can't go offline

438
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,070
will be safe.

439
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,830
Here I'd like to urge

440
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,630
users who are still online

441
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,940
in Pangu to go offline immediately.

442
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,710
Don't do anything related to Pangu

443
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,710
until we find a solution.

444
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,270
Mr. Lin.

445
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,390
There's such a big
hidden danger in Pangu.

446
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,630
Which department head
of Celeste Group

447
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,150
should bear
the greatest responsibility?

448
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,590
I'll take full responsibility.

449
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:47,990
Matron.

450
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,830
Can you help me check

451
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,310
my child's condition now?

452
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,870
It's been so long now.

453
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,990
Everything is normal.

454
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,830
Don't worry.

455
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,670
Rest assured.

456
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,270
With Ms. Zhang, everything's good.

457
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,470
Don't worry.

458
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,030
Okay then.

459
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,270
Trust us.

460
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,950
All right.

461
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,110
We're all here.

462
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,710
Okay.

463
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,390
What's the matter, Ms. Zhang?

464
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,110
Hello, I'd like to know

465
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,670
how the condition is now.

466
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,390
All patients' physical indicators
are normal.

467
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,350
That's good.

468
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,550
Who are you?

469
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,870
The person in charge?

470
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,340
Yes.

471
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,470
I'm the person in charge here

472
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,870
before the group can find a solution.

473
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,510
I saw the news.

474
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,990
She is Zhang Hao Cheng's daughter.

475
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,190
It was all Zhang Hao Cheng's fault.

476
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,950
Zhang Hao Cheng's daughter?

477
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:33,910
Come on.

478
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,470
Go and have a look.

479
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,830
I'm sorry.

480
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,550
What's the use of money?

481
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,790
I want my son!

482
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,430
I'm sorry.

483
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,470
Don't be hypocritical.

484
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,030
Look!

485
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,830
Look!

486
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,390
Look!

487
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,150
Calm down!

488
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,870
You can't solve the problem this way.

489
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,630
I don't want to see you!

490
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,270
You hypocrite!

491
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,100
Get out of here!
Give us back our kids!

492
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,270
Solve the problem!

493
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,430
You...

494
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,990
Well done!

495
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,510
What are you doing?

496
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,390
Go away. We don't want to see you.

497
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,630
Good! You deserve a slap!

498
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,750
How immoral you are.

499
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,750
Give my son back!

500
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,830
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,870
I know it's all my dad's fault.

502
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,470
I know you won't forgive him either.

503
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,310
I'm just like you.

504
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,830
I also hate him very much.

505
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,780
But he's my dad.

506
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,190
He didn't leave me

507
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,710
when I needed him most.

508
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,070
I can't leave him now.

509
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,070
I'll take all the blame.

510
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,790
Please believe me.

511
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,910
Please.

512
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,460
I'm sorry.

513
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,990
I'm really sorry.

514

685
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,550
What are you doing?

686
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,030
Why do you get up?

687
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,270
Do you want to be in a coma again?

688
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,470
I must inform
the group's senior executives

689
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,750
that the 2021 code error

690
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,790
is real.

691

[Which department head]

[I'll take full responsibility.]

695

I must go to Celeste Group now.

696
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,950
Xiao Qiao.

697
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,470
Believe me.

698
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,750
They need me now.

[until we find a solution.]

702
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,630
I saw the news.

703
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,710
It's the best decision for you

704
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,590
to make 2021 public

705
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,310
and get all users offline.

706
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,030
I know.

707
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,590
So are you Bai Wei

708
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,910
or Ye Tian now?

709
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,150
It's me.

710
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,550
Ye Tian.

711
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,430
Actually,

712
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,230
I should've expected that.

713
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,350
You won't

714
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,270
wait inside passively

715
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,190
for me to come to you.

716
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,990
You actively join the core group

717
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,430
to get the authority

718
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,030
to restart the account

719
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,110
so that you can come out, right?

720
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,510
So Bai Wei

721
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,950
also knows what I've done.

722
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,380
I like Bai Wei.

723
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,350
But she chose you.

724
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,190
I give in.

725
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,390
I'll also pay

726
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,020
for my mistakes.

727
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,790
You're not the only one to blame.

728
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,790
I'm also responsible

729
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,270
for the 2021 case.

730
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,470
Since you're back,

731
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,070
I'll return the duty of the president

732
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,070
to you.

733
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,830
And me.

734
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,950
You know it as well?

735
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,510
Thank you for

736
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,150
taking care of Bai Wei these days.

737
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,710
Don't mention it, Director Ye.

738
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,230
There's something new in Pangu.

739
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,420
Let's go and check it out.

740
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,670
Let's work together.

741
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,710
I'll stay in Celeste Group

742
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,150
to open a channel
for you to communicate.

743
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,630
The more you stop me,

744
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,190
the more interested I am
in your world.

745
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,590
When I go out,

746
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,340
I'll conquer your world

747
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,910
just as I conquer Pangu.

748
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,190
Even if General Long Wei

749
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,790
is made according to
your cognitive chain,

750
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,110
the consequences will be unimaginable

751
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,950
if you cover him.

752
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,990
You'll even disappear completely
in Pangu.

753
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,870
I can't cover him.

754
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:18,910
Xiao Tian.

755
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,670
Kill me!

756
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,830
Lin Feng!

757
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,910
Xiao Tian!

758
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,630
Hurry up!
