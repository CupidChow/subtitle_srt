it was Lin Feng who wooing me.

170
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,600
However, I can give you some advice.

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,510
If you genuinely love him,

172
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,180
you should know

173
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,360
what he wanted most in his heart.

174
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,970
What is it?

175
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,750
Pangu

176
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,020
is everything for him.

177
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,190
What is happening?

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,140
What happens?

179
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,930
They are accomplishing a hidden mission.

180
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,820
What are they doing?

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,610
Getting married.

182
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,940
Why they make it so weird?

183
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,780
One wears a mask
while another wears a veil.

184
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,930
Are they afraid to meet people?

185
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,610
The woman seems a little familiar.

186
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,980
-Who is that?
-Isn't she

187
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,590
Bai Wei from the fighting championship?

188
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,300
Bai Wei?

189
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,820
She looks alike after you said that.

190
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,290
Look, she is so pretty.

191
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,530
We put effort

192
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,900
to get this Love Flower Ring.

193
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,780
It wasn't bought from him for 10,000 yuan.

194
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,800
-Can we pass this level?
-It seems to be true.

195
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,080
Just wait a little more.

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,020
Two young heroes

197
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,970
have been through a lot of hard work

198
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,750
and all kinds of trials.

199
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,980
Finally, you found

200
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,800
these two real Love Flower Rings.

201
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,580
This is the correct way

202
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,810
to start a Love Flower Task.

203
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,050
Saying goes,

204
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,850
gold and silver have a price

205
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,600
but love is priceless.

206
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,560
You guys come back safe and sound
this time.

207

It is also a great blessing
for our village.

208
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,680
I will keep my promise

209

and held a grand wedding for you.

210

show your date of birth.

215
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,580

Don't worry.

223
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,850
Let me calculate for you slowly.

224
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,510
This is bad.

225
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,620

Wait a hundred years
to be on the same boat.

232
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,520
Wait a thousand years to be couple.

233
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,910
This is surely the same for everyone.

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,280
It's preset.

235

This is not preset.

This is calculated instantaneously

237
