Of course I would like to help

The phrase, unfaithful man,

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,110
does not seem to be used very accurately.

16
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,510
Why is it inaccurate?

17
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,750
I am affectionate to him,

18
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,870
but he is heartless to me.

19

If he's not an unfaithful man, what is he?

20
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,460
He is not just an unfaithful man,

21
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,140
he is simply a jerk,

22
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,350
and is as ungrateful as Chen Shi Mei.

23

Bah.

The team members who were killed said

it should be him.

that if they kill the target player,

42
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,220

I'll tell you then.

187
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,510
After you drank,

188
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,300
you pressed me to the ground

189
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,750
and forced a kiss on me.

190
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,030
You're still crying your eyes out.

191
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,470
You don't even know how scary it was.

192

That's impossible.

193

Why is it impossible?

195

That's what you said.

196

I didn't expect it.

197

You usually seem dull,

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,870
but you became so sweet after drinking.

199
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,350
You said you would only marry me

200
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,950
and didn't want to leave me at all.

201

You said you wouldn't leave me forever.

202
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,710
You must be responsible for me.

203
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,590
That's what I said?

204
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,150
It's said that the truth
is told after drinking.

205
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,270
So do you really love me?

206

a lot of things that I love to hear.

211

You're going to be with me
for the rest of your life.

213
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,430
You said you would stay with me

214
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,950
and you would only marry me.

215
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,020
You also said you would
have many children with me.

216
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,750
Could I be dreaming?

217
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,630
I have remembered something.

218
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,310
You said you were going on a blind date.

219
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,350
That's not right.

220
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,950
Since I confessed my love to you,

221
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,430
why would you still be angry
and go offline?

222
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,750
Who did you go on a blind date with?

223
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,550
I...

224

I... I'm a girl.

226

Of course, I'll be shy.

227
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,350
Regarding the blind date,

228
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,780
how could I possibly go on a blind date?

229
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,710
Never mind.

230
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,980

232

Neither of us can remember it anyway.

233
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,910
Don't mention it again in the future.

234
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm asking you,

235
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,950
you haven't answered me why you're here.

236
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,270
I... I'm here for a mission.

237

It would be great

What's wrong?

370
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,190
Yun Yun is drunk.

371

Why did she drink so much?

372

from the Ding Group came.

406

Mr. Zhang is talking to her
about business collaboration.

407

Wei Wei, you're so early today.

408
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,150
Wang Ying Qiao.

409
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,270
Morning.

410
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,550
What are you doing?

411
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,750
Why are you calling me
Wang Ying Qiao again?

412
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,750
Fine.

413
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,830
I'm going to tell you
something very strange.

414
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,230
In these few days,

415
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,830
there is someone who
always sends milk to my office.

416
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,550
You know I hate drinking milk.

417
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,110
Don't you think it's weird?

418
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,030
I guess

419
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,470
it should be sent by someone
who cares about your health.

420
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,510
Wei Wei, what's wrong with you?

421
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,910
I always put you as a priority.

422
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,230
Why are you so perfunctory with me?

423
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,350
Wei Wei!

424
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,110
Look, Ms. Ding.

425
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,620
This is our latest updated version.

426
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,070
This is a new task,

427
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,220
a legendary mission.

428
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,270
In other words,

429
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,230
by completing this legendary mission,

430
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,190
Autumn City

431
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,190
will have

432
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,550
a new NPC.

433
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,030
The Grand Priest.

434
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,350
It can provide you

435
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,310
with the real-time location of any player.

436
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,110
But the precondition is

437
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,150
that you need to provide
the name of the player.

438
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,790
So is there a limit to the number of
times this positioning system can be used?

439
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,030
For the current version,

440
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,950
this system has not yet been made public

441
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,710
so theoretically,
it can be used unlimited times

442
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,030
and the other players
won't find out about it.

443
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,950
That's great.

444
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,750
Give your contact details to my secretary.

445
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,070
I'll contact you
with my mission afterwards.

446
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,300
I really didn't expect that

447
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,150
Ms. Ding turns out
to be an avid fan of Pangu.

448
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,830
I like the feeling of

449
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,070
repaying kindness with
kindness and revenge in Pangu.

450
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,710
This is very difficult
to achieve in real life.

451
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,470
Yes.

452
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,470
Ms. Ding, don't worry.

453
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,390
I will definitely let you

454
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,310
dominate the martial world in Pangu.

455
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,670
Celeste is always here to back you up.

456
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,990
Right, Uncle Zhang.

457
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,110
Regarding your previous proposal
of holding Celeste,

458
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,870
I've thought about it.

459
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,790
If you want to reduce
Ye Tian's original share ratio,

460
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,670
it is not enough to just
buy the shares of the board

461
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,470
at a high premium

462
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,750
The Ding Group needs to acquire
at least a twenty percent share ratio

463
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,950
from the secondary market.

464
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,310
So I need Celeste's share price

465
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,550
to fall by more than ten percent
in the short term.

466
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,230
You are decisive.

467
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,030
Tough enough.

468
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,310
I'll take care of the share price.

469
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,430
However, Ms. Ding,

470
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,550
don't be too harsh.

471
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,670
It is a waste if you kill the goose
that laid the golden eggs.

472
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,460
I won't.

473
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,590
Don't worry.

474
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,230
Once I join Celeste,

475
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,430
I can transfer 
a portion of my shares to you

476
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,910
at an agreed price

477
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,390
to ensure that 
you become a director of Celeste

478
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,430
with no restrictions on your work.

479
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,390
As for me,

480
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,710
I'll wait for your good news.

481
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,870
Ms. Ding, you're leaving now?

482
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,550
Let's discuss
about the details of the agreement.

483
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,390
I have something more important to do.

484
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,620
See you again.

485
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,990
See you again.

486
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,910
Right, Uncle Zhang.

487
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,150
Ask Yun Er to go online later

488
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,870
for a mission of the society.

489
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,950
Just leave it to me.

490
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,670
It is so hard to please her.

491
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,670
Yun Er, are you at home?

492
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,620
Ding Xiang...

493
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,030
Both are hard to please.

494
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,230
Luckily, there's no milk.

495
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,190
Do you not like milk?

496
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,110
You scare the hell out of me.

497
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,910
You walk without noise?

498
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,110
In fact, milk is a good source of calcium.

499
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,350
Why do you not like it?

500
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,230
I just don't like it,

501
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,190
there is no reason.

502
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,350
Why did you come to
the planning department?

503
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,550
I'm here to apologize.

504
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,510
You don't have to apologize.

505
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,660
We had nothing to do with each other.

506
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,830
You're making it awkward now.

507
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,590
No, Xiao Qiao.

508
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,590
I knew I was wrong.

509
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,540
I shouldn't have stood you up.

510
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,350
In fact,

511
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,790
I really cherished our date.

512
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,070
I was so happy that you said yes,

513
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,870
so that day...

514
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,710
Guo Yi Da!

515
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,430
No.

516
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,630
Because that day...

517
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,190
So...

518
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,270
So that's why the second time I...

519
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,230
No!

520
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,470
It was not a date!

521
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,750
I...

522
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,910
I just wanted to watch a show that day.

523
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,990
I... I didn't...

524
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,710
I can understand that you were busy.

525
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,110
You don't have to apologize.

526
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,510
Xiao Qiao,

527
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,790
you should be angry.

528
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,710
I know I shouldn't have left you behind.

529
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,190
It's too late for me to say anything now.

530
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,190
However, if you give me a chance,

531
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,030
I will definitely...

532
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,630
Go ahead with your work.

533
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,510
I'm going in first.

534
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,630
You didn't send the milk, did you?

535
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,340
No.

536
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,870
Why would I do something so boring?

537
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,230
That's good then.

538
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,430
I really have nothing to do with him.

539
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,590
But you went on a date with him.

540
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,830
Just admit it.

541
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,270
Don't be shy.

542
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,910
Just admit it if you're in love.

543
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,830
That's right.

544
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,070
Don't be shy.

545
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,150
I'm not!

546
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,950
So

547
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,310
the Heavenly Society

548
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,870
must complete this legendary mission

549
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,220
no matter how hard it is,

550
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,710
understood?

551
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,270
Yes.

552
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,180
Okay, let's get moving.

553
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,510
What's wrong with you?
You drank too much yesterday?

554
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,430
When Guo Yi Da told me that
you wanted to complete this mission,

555
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,870
I was immediately refreshed.

556
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,270
How's it? I'm great, right?

557
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,670
Ding Xiang, you have to think it through.

558
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,310
The difficulty level of
this Grand Priest mission

559
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,950
is beyond the ability of players

560
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,990
of our level to complete.

561
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,470
If we fail,

562
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,590
the Heavenly Society's strength
will be greatly affected.

563
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,030
Of course the Heavenly Society

564
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,070
can't do it all alone.

565
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,750
But what if I told you

566
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,230
that I had all the players in Pangu
to help me?

567
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,590
Are you prepared to spend money on it?

568
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,830
Of course.

569
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,710
Rarely can anyone resist the lure of cash.

570
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,300
Advanced players who participate,

571
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,230
regardless of success or failure,

572
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,430
will receive 10,000 Pangu gold coins

573
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,070
from the Heavenly Society.

574
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,670
I don't believe I can't succeed

575
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,830
with the help of so many people.

576
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,510
You are doing all this
to get back at Bai Wei

577
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,030
and her masked boyfriend?

578
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,590
Isn't that a bit too costly?

579
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,190
It's not that you don't know me well.

580
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,550
In my world,

581
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,630
there is never a cost.

582
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,900
Welcome.

583
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,350
This white porcelain vase
is quite suitable.

584
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,470
You have a good taste.

585
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,590
This vase is the treasure of our shop.

586
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,620
Treasure in the shop?

587
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,430
Can't you NPC

588
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,750
change your scripts?

589
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,190
Wait, come here.

590
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,310
Why are you in such a hurry?

591
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,670
The Heavenly Society
is going on a big mission.

592
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,750
Everyone can participate it.

593
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,150
If you go, you will receive
ten taels of silver.

594
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,390
Now they are distributing the money.

595
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,390
I'm leaving.

596
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,110
The Heavenly Society gives away money?

597
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,710
Look.

598
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,110
It would be nice to have this.

599
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,150
Heavenly Society!

600
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:48,510
Heavenly Society!

601
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,750
Last ten spots available.

602
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,270
We want a master.

603
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,590
I'm a master!

604
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,780
Pick me!

605
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,870
I'm a master!

606
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,110
Pick me!

607
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,190
Pick me!

608
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,870
How's it? It's not bad, right?

609
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,270
It's true that if we set

610
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,670
a limit on the number of recruits,

611
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,870
in just a short while,

612
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,110
we can recruit more people than
we did in the previous half hour.

613
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,230
People only cherish things
that are hard to come by.

614
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,150
Thus, in the eyes of those who
have succeeded in receiving money,

615
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,310
The Heavenly Society

616
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,030
has provided them with
a great opportunity to make money.

617
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,790
So they must come no matter what.

618
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,510
I now think

619
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,190
you're a better businessman
than your father.

620
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,750
It's a waste of your talents
to be in charge of

621
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,670
the marketing department of Celeste.

622
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,270
I don't care about this.

623
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,460
You know

624
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,790
the reason I work at Celeste.

625
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,310
You're taking your affections
too seriously.

626
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,790
Everyone,

627
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,510
let's depart!

628
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:53,910
Heavenly Society!

629
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,430
Isn't the most recent mission
of the Grand Priest

630
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,470
planned to be released to the public

631
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,910
only in the next DLC?

632
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,630
Where did they get the news?

633
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,550
Ms. Linda,

634
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,390
we don't know what's going on either.

635
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,950
The Heavenly Society has gathered
more than 5,000 people now

636
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,230
to attack the Demon Dragon Valley.

637
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,470
Stress on the sub-server

638
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,550
is reaching its limit.

639
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,790
Heavenly Society?

640
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,910
It seems that they can really

641
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,740
go beyond their level to
complete this difficult mission.

642
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,390
Has anyone activated
the Grand Priest Awakening Mission?

643
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,310
Yes.

644
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,940
But that's too far ahead.

645
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,710
Originally, this mission

646
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,830
can only be done at the final period.

647
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,550
I wonder where the Heavenly Society

648
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,710
has gathered so many players
from to help them.

649
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,990
And I wonder what they are trying to do.

650
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,340
[Heavenly Society.]

651
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,270
[Ding Xiang.]

652
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,270
[The Grand Priest can
pinpoint a player's location.]

653
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,870
[Who is she trying to find]

654
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,590
[by accomplishing this mission?]

655
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,350
What batch of reinforcements is this?

656
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,710
The fifth batch.

657
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,940
There are still new players
coming from Autumn City.

658
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,430
But it seems like

659
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,790
we don't need the sixth batch anymore.

660
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,310
That demon is dying.

661
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,230
Defeat it with the players' lives.

662
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,780
It's really simple and brutal.

663
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,110
As long as it works.

664
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,140
It's a game anyway.

665
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,550
Report!

666
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,030
Reporting to the President.

667
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,390
The Demon Dragon has been defeated.

668
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,750
Really?

669
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,150
Pass on my words.

670
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,470
Additional 10,000 gold coins
for each person on the team

671
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,990
that kills the Demon Dragon.

672
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,630
Yes, President.

673
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,830
It's almost three o'clock.

674
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,750
Le Le invited me for afternoon tea.

675
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,830
Wouldn't you like to come with
me to see that Grand Priest awaken?

676
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,190
This is the biggest thing I've ever done

677
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,870
in Autumn City.

678
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,270
I'm not interested.

679
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,550
I'm different from you

680
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,110
who is content to be in Pangu.

681
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,190
Instead,

682
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,950
I prefer real life.

683
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,470
Just leave.

684
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,510
You have no passion at all.

685
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,190
I'm leaving.

686
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,310
Xiao Xiao.

687
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,030
Later, ask someone

688
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,390
to send the Dragon Ball
back to Autumn City.

689
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,310
Alright.

690
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,950
Let's go back.

691
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,830
[Pangu]

692
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,070
Look.

693
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:47,110
Welcome, Grand Priest!

694
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,900
My dear friend,

695
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,710
thank you for waking me up.

696
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,430
Say your wish.

697
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,070
Grand Priest,

698
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,910
I want to know

699
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,150
the precise location
of a person right now.

700
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,150
Who are you looking for?

701
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,470
Ms. Linda,

702
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,870
I wonder who Ms. Ding

703
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,070
is looking for.

704
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,070
That player is really unlucky.

705
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,350
The first player

706
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,310
in Pangu who would be hunted down
by everyone is here.

707
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,870
[Special permission is required]

708
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,470
[Special permission granted]

709
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,460
[Locate Sea of Flowers]

710
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,310
[I have to go online right away.]

711
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,830
[Or Bai Wei will be in danger.]

712
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,790
These bamboos are good.

713
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,909
I can use this bamboo node

714
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,780
as a bottle.

715
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,469
Which department are you from?

716
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,150
Planning department.

717
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,230
Didn't you get a notification?

718
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,110
Our group's cabins are
all under repair today.

719
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,270
We can't log in here.

720
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,230
Why didn't you say it earlier?

721
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,310
You didn't ask earlier either.

722
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,870
Where are you going in such a hurry?

723
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,430
I'm fine.

724
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,150
Hello, I'm going online.

725
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,950
Let me see.

726
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,190
What a skill.

727
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,230
You found out about it.

728
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,830
Where is your husband?

729
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,070
Why don't I see him?

730
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,310
Why are you so fond of him?

731
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,110
You still can't forget my husband?

732
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,510
It's okay that your husband is not there.

733
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,180
At least you are here.

734
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,510
This is better than nothing.

735
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,030
You wouldn't be interested in me too,
would you?

736
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,270
Listen, you can't do that.

737
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,230
I won't go that far.

738
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,510
I'm here to kill you.

739
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,430
It turns out that
you're trying to kill me.

740
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,470
Please, it's just a game.

741
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,270
There's no point in you killing me once.

742
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,750
Who said I would only kill you once?

743
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,510
Starting from now,

744
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,910
you can't escape from me anymore.

745
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,590
I can kill you to level zero.

746
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,420
Aren't you and your husband in love?

747
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,790
After he goes online,

748
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,430
I'll send you two back to
level zero together.

749
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,510
This is the consequence
of your humiliation of me.

750
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,110
There is a cabin in Zone N2.

751
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,030
He will be offline in 20 minutes.

752
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,150
No, I need to go online now.

753
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,510
You can see it yourself.

754
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,150
Where do we have cabins now?

755
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,270
There are so many people lining up.

756
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,670
Hey...

757
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,630
What are you doing?

758
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,070
Violations will cause things to go wrong.

759
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,510
It would be fine if he had to
go offline in an emergency.

760
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,230
No way.

761
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,270
Go offline in an emergency?

762
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,350
I'll call the police if you do this.

763
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,670
You...

764
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,990
President.

765
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,430
You are still a president of a society.

766
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,550
You don't have to go so far.

767
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,670
If I displease you,

768
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,670
I can apologize to you.

769
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,590
I'm sorry.

770
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,230
Shoot!

771
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,710
I'll see how much longer you can avoid it.

772
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,430
[Your husband is online.]

773
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,310
Come on.

774
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,470
Shoot!

775
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,950
I'm sorry.

776
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,830
I'm really sorry.

777
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,340
Is there something wrong with you?

778
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,070
Me?

779
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,750
Do you think something is wrong with me?

780
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,830
Stop pretending!

781
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,500
It just happened and you're pretending
to have memory loss, aren't you?

782
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,780
I forced you to go offline?

783
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,950
You're still laughing?

784
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,380
Are you sick?

785
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,750
I just had a good time

786
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,870
but you suddenly dragged me down

787
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,950
and logged in yourself.

788
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,830
I just got a sword of the highest grade.

789
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,830
It's the highest grade.

790
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,110
Say it!

791
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,070
Are you going to settle this
publicly or privately?

792
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,540
Highest grade?

793
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,270
Don't go!

794
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,310
No one taught you to be
a gentleman with girls?

795
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,300
Who are you?

796
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,390
He is Mr. Lin of the Celeste Group.

797
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,990
Mr. Lin, why are you here?

798
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,790
Bai Wei, you were in a hurry
to come to the experience store.

799
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,990
Was there something urgent?

800
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,870
I was in a hurry to do a mission.

801
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,140
Mission?

802
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,340
A mission in Pangu?

803
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,020
Mr. Lin, it was my fault for doing
the mission during working hours.

804
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,830
You may deduct my salary.

805
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,300
Just for a mission,

806
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,830
you rushed all the way out of the group

807
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,350
and was almost hit by a car.

808
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,710
Hit by a car?

809
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,910
Was he okay?

810
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,110
You should be asking if you're okay.

811
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,380
Forget it.

812
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,110
You're always so weird anyway.

813
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,270
Mr. Lin, since I have come out today,

814
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,550
can I take a day off?

815
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,150
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

816
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,590
Bye.

817
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,150
Bai Wei.

818
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,110
Mr. Lin, will you refuse my leave?

819
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,420
No, of course you can take a day off.

820
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,430
I would like to say

821
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,710
that it's my birthday in a few days.

822
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,590
Many people from the group
will come to the party.

823
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,670
Will you come along?

824
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,230
I know you have your concerns.

825
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,630
Just come as a friend, okay?

826
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,380
[The day after tomorrow,
it's Ye Tian's turn to come out.]

827
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,910
[He must want to celebrate]

828
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,950
[his best friend's birthday.]

829
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,030
Okay, I will come.

830
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,590
Thank you.

831
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,910
Mr. Lin, I'm leaving.

832
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,270
Okay.

833
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:18,750
Bye.

834
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,670
Big Hero Ye Tian.

835
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,070
You're so great today.

836
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,070
Fortunately, you came early.

837
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,350
If it's only half a minute late...

838
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,270
Half a minute late and you'll be gone.

839
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,510
I know.

840
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,190
Don't be angry.

841
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,100
I won't do it...

842
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,310
What did you promise me before?

843
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,270
I promised you not to run around alone.

844
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,390
But did you do it?

845
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,430
I didn't.

846
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,470
Hey, please forgive me.

847
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,030
Don't make the situation so awkward.

848
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,790
Hero.

849
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,950
Since Comrade Ye Tian

850
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,510
heroically saved Comrade Bai Wei today,

851
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,990
the organization decided

852
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,750
to give Comrade Ye Tian a gift.

853
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,350
I'm not kidding.

854
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,110
I'm not kidding either.

855
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,030
This gift is that I promised Lin Feng

856
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,670
that I would go to his birthday party
the day after tomorrow.

857
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,420
This way, you can meet with

858
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,150
your best friend

859
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,150
and have fun.

860
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,550
I'm not going.

861
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,830
You really don't want to go?

862
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,950
Please go.

863
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,310
Brother Ye Tian.

864
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,510
Hero.

865
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,590
Are you really not going?

866
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,710
Then, I'll tell him you're not going.

867
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,950
No, I'll tell him I'm not going then.

868
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:54,950
Come back here.

869
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,870
Listen,

870
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,710
you can't do that again.

871
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,830
I promise.

872
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,830
However, when I was on my way back,

873
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,070
I was thinking about a question.

874
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,710
How did Ding Xiang find me?

875
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,710
When I was alone in the bamboo forest,

876
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,140
there was no one around.

877
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,910
How did she find me?

878
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,270
She even brought so many people
to ambush me.

879
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,590
This is also the most troublesome part.

880
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,510
Because she accomplished

881
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,670
a mission in Pangu that
should not occur at this stage

882
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,470
and found a NPC

883
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,230
who can pinpoint any player's
location in Pangu,

884
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,150
the Grand Priest.

885
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,070
From now on,

886
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,870
wherever you hide,

887
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,750
she just needs to say your name
to the Grand Priest,

888
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,750
and she can find out your location
through him.

889
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,590
In other words,

890
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,110
as long as she wants,

891
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,990
she will be able to find you immediately.

892
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,790
It seems that we can no longer live
in the small courtyard in the mountain.

893
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,790
We have to always move in a wide range

894
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,990
to ensure our safety.

895
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,060
So what's the limit on requesting
a player's location

896
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,350
from the Grand Priest?

897
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,500
It can't be infinite.

898
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,350
It's unlimited.

899
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,230
Because this is

900
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,270
a legendary NPC after all.

901
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,430
Oh my goodness.

902
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,910
How could you come up
with such a perverted

903
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,990
NPC?

904
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,350
So what do we do now?

905
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,350
The system will query and
monitor your location every day.

906
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,830
When the time comes,
you have to go offline.

907
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,950
Then you have to leave me alone

908
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,750
to face the female devil, Ding Xiang.

909
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,510
In fact, there is a way.

910
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,350
You won't give in to Ding Xiang, right?

911
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,830
Or do you want to marry her?

912
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,790
What are you thinking?

913
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,950
How can I trust your safety

914
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,190
to someone else?

915
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,230
That's good then.

916
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,470
So how are you going to save me,

917
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,390
my big hero?

918
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,260
Here's the way.

919
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,830
Kill the Grand Priest

920
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,550
and solve this problem once and for all.

921
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:40,910
NPC in the system

922
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,870
can be killed?

923
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,230
Others can't do it

924
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,910
but I can.

925
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,750
Let's go to Autumn City to get something.

926
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,420
Wait a minute.

927
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,390
Autumn City?

928
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,350
That's the base camp
of the Heavenly Society.

929
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,950
Ding Xiang must be looking for us
all over the world right now.

930
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,270
Maybe she have already reached
the small courtyard in the mountain now.

931
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,580
At this time, Autumn City is safer.

932
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,190
As soon as Ding Xiang passes by,

933
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,740
we will wear the uniforms
of the Heavenly Society

934
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,660
and blend in with her team.

935
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,750
What's wrong? Are you okay?

936
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,030
I have sprained my ankle.

937
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,790
A heinous sin.

938
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,900
No mercy for you!
