36
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,550

38
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,030
Why did you have to take the risk?

54

58

71
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,270
I don't care what reasons he has

I won't agree to it, okay?

76
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,789
I know you're going to be mad at
what I'm about to tell you.

But I have to say it out.

80
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,910
I've been holding these words
in my heart for very long.

84
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,710
It's that he can borrow your body.

86
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,190

And also,

Together with these mechanisms
and hidden passages,

190
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,270
it should be fine.

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,510
The proposal that is due next Monday.

365
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,500


366
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,100


367
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,300
Have you done it?

368
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,540


369
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,550
Not yet.

370
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,020


371
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,030
Which one is it?

372
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,210


373
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,590
They are almost done with it.

374
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,750
It's the overview of the proposal.

375
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,220


376
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,990
They will conduct a unified review
next Monday.

377
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,820


378
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,700
Who told you to run around?

379
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,460


380
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,830
You deserve this.

381
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,800


382
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,790
It's so painful.

383
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,760


384
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,030
This area hasn't been developed yet.

385
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,090


386
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,110
How did you two get in?

387
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,020


388
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,870
It's all thanks to him.

389
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,810


390
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,070
I don't know what's wrong with him today.

391
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,060


392
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,990
He kept running to the edge of the map.

393
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,880


394
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,270
I couldn't even stop him.

395
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,230


396
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,750
He didn't cause you
any trouble today, did he?

397
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,230


398
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,390
No.

399
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,220


400
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,790
What is this?

401
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,770


402
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,990
These are blood-supplementing
and Qi-boosting pills.

403
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,980


404
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,430
Eat more. They will
speed up your recovery.

405
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,350


406
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,070
I have to eat more then.

407
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,060


408
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,590
I'm a man.

409
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,080


410
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,150
It's better to travel 10,000 miles
than read 10,000 books.

411
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,980


412
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,090


413
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,390
I can't do it in my real life.

414
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,380
So I think

415
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280


416
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,870
I can surely do it in Pangu.

417
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,770


418
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,870
Are you blaming me now?

419
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,450


420
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,030
If it wasn't for you,

421
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,020


422
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,630
if it wasn't for avoiding you,

423
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,230


424
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,710
I wouldn't have fallen into

425
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,580


426
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,010


427
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,350
the trap that Miracle dug.

428
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,510
What's with him recently?

429
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,470


430
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,630
He's not in a good mood lately.

431
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,180


432
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,910
Did you two fight again?

433
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,620


434
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,270


435
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,590
No.

436
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580


437
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,590
It's normal for couples

438
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,630


439
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,910
to fight and have a little argument.

440
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,790
But most importantly,

441
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,780


442
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,510
you have to learn to understand
and comfort each other.

443
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,590


444
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,310
You have to accommodate each other,

445
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,300


446
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,390
especially the man.

447
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,250


448
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,290


449
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,390
Be careful!

450
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,540


451
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,910
Are you all right?

452
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,620


453
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,030
I'm fine.

454
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,110
All the traps in Pangu
will lead to real pain.

455
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,930


456
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,310


457
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,590
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

458
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,950
Miracle,

459
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,880


460
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,870
your yard is so cool!

461
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,680


462
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,670
I'm surprised that not only
can you play the game well,

463
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,610


464
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,590
you can also design traps.

465
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,250


466
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,710
You're really omnipotent.

467
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,710


468
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,430
Unlike me, I'm a nobody.

469
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,270


470
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,280


471
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,430
In real life,

472
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,520


473
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,950
I can't stand on my legs.

474
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,450


475
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,670
In the game,

476
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,630


477
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,950
I'm still a very clumsy person.

478
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,430
It's so beautiful here.

479
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,990


480
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,710
Is this your wedding house
with Sea of Flowers?

481
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,590


482
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,710
Wedding house?

483
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,530


484
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,950
Where is she?

485
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,850


486
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,390
How come I didn't see her today?

487
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,180


488
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,390
You two are newly-weds.

489
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,190


490
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,550
She won't leave you here alone, will she?

491
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,420


492
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,140


493
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,230
No, she went to work.

494
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,080


495
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,150
I'm waiting for her at home.

496
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140


497
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,790
Don't you have to work?

498
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,900


499
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,270
Today is a working day.

500
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,930


501
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,190
I'm a professional gamer.

502
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,830


503
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,870
I don't need to go to the office.

504
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,830
Professional gamer?

505
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,400


506
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,070
No wonder you can play so well.

507
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,930


508
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,390
I'm sorry.

509
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,460


510
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,150
Why don't you use my elevator?

511
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,990


512
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,270
Sure, thank you, Mr. Lin.

513
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,220


514
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,470
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

515
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,310


516
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,510
This is your exclusive elevator.

517
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,300


518
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,110
It's fine.

519
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,040


520
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,710
Thanks.

521
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,620


522
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,950
Boss,

523
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:14,830


524
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,820
Lin Feng isn't alone in the elevator.

525
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,550


526
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,430
Who else is in there?

527
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,340


528
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,990
Bai Wei.

529
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,880


530
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,270
She's in the wrong place

531
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,070


532
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,590
at the wrong time.

533
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,420


534
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,870
It's just bad luck for her.

535
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,770


536
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,430
You finished the workload

537
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,420


538
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,240


539
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,510
of an entire department in one week
all by yourself.

540
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,070
Bai Wei,

541
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,110


542
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,030
are you sure
you never studied game design?

543
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,910


544
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,780


545
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,790
I have learned a little about it.

546
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,670
I have read the materials on this aspect.

547
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,410


548
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,390
In fact, I have read
the algorithm you provided.

549
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,350


550
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,830
It's really complex.

551
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,350


552
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,030
I still think

553
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,820


554
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,710
it's not something a newbie can do.

555
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,520


556
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,790


557
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,110
Maybe I was just lucky.

558
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,220


559
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,470
It's not worth mentioning.

560
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,580


561
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,590
Why isn't the elevator coming down?

562
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,860


563
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,870
Is there something wrong?

564
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,100


565
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,270
Why did the elevator stop suddenly?

566
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,310
Can anyone see us?

567
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,270


568
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,940


569
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,950
The elevator is broken!

570
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,970


571
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,470
This again?

572
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,550
It's over.

573
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,390


574
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,640


575
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,110
What's going on?

576
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,470


577
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,550
This...

578
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,710


579
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,910
I didn't do anything this time.

580
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,080


581
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,310
Mr. Lin, are you okay?

582
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,330


583
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,510
I have claustrophobia.

584
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,340


585
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,550
There must be some technical issues
with the elevator.

586
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,310


587
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,500
It shouldn't be a big problem.

588
00:14:59,330 --> 00:14:59,860


589
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,030
Don't worry about it.

590
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,550
We're dead.

591
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,830


592
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,750
What's the situation?

593
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,880


594
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,100


595
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,590
What should we do?

596
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,140


597
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,270
Maintenance department!

598
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,910


599
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,270
Hurry up!

600
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,840


601
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,870
Quick!

602
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,970


603
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,990
What should we do?

604
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,810


605
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,950
Should we call the police?

606
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,850


607
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,260
Where's the maintenance department?

608
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,520


609
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,270
When are they coming?

610
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,110


611
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,710
Xiao Tian.

612
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,700


613
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,910
Mr. Lin

614
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,890


615
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,190
is going to be okay, right?

616
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,460


617
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,750
Quick!

618
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,020


619
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,190
Okay.

620
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,290


621
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,590
How did it get stuck?

622
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,760


623
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,150
Shouldn't it fall right down?

624
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,950
I'm not sure either.

625
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300


626
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,390


627
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,430
But with the strength
of the current steel cable,

628
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,210


629
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,510
they won't last long.

630
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,880


631
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,190
[No, the cable must be broken.]

632
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,050


633
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,110
[We must leave now.]

634
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,580


635
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,790
[We can't wait.]

636
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,250


637
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,590
Mr. Lin, don't be nervous.

638
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,350
Relax.

639
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,380


640
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,270
Take a deep breath.

641
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,350


642
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,150
Take a deep breath.

643
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,070


644
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,030
It's okay.

645
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,070


646
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,900


647
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,110
You help me up first,

648
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,310
or it'll be too late. Hurry up.

649
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,180


650
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,030
Quick.

651
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,080


652
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,480


653
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,670
Can you reach the top?

654
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,589
Don't move.

655
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,470


656
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,550
Can you go up?

657
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,510


658
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,109
Push harder.

659
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,980


660
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,310
Push harder.

661
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,200


662
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,349
Almost there.

663
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,920


664
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,660


665
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,710
Come on, Lin Feng, give me your hand.

666
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,710
No, I don't have any more strength.

667
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,830


668
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,340
We're running out of time!
Give me your hand!

669
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,330


670
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,140


671
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,070
I said I can't do it!

672
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,910
I don't have any more strength!

673
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,710


674
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,380
I understand how you are feeling now.

675
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,310


676
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,710
You're terrified.

677
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,240


678
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,310
I have fears too.

679
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,060


680
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,470
I used to be afraid of heights.

681
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,400


682
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,830
I couldn't even look down
from a three-meter building.

683
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,820


684
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,780


685
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,790
I'd be terrified.

686
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,810


687
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,020
I couldn't even move.

688
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,150
But do you know how I got over it?

689
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640


690
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,200


691
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,470
I forced myself

692
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,670


693
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,990
to jump from a 10-meter platform
of the swimming pool.

694
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,860


695
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,870
Because I know,

696
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,580
as a professional esports player,

697
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,570


698
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,530


699
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,070
I can't have any weaknesses.

700
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,870
I kept jumping and one day,

701
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,570


702
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,190
I wasn't afraid of heights anymore.

703
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000


704
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,640


705
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,070
I believe you. You can do it too.

706
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,500


707
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,070
Come, give me your hand.

708
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,030
Trust yourself.

709
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,860


710
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,310


711
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,790
We don't have time. Hurry up!

712
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,100


713
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,110
Quick.

714
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,580
No, I really can't do it.

715
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,490


716
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,870
Hurry up! We're running out of time!

717
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,610


718
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,830
Stop pushing me.

719
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,760


720
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,310
Don't push me.

721
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,360


722
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,430


723
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,590
I've got no strength left.

724
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,430


725
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,830
I've got no strength left.

726
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,180


727
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,190
You're the president of Celeste Group.

728
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,990


729
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,150
You can do it.

730
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,190
Believe in yourself. You can do it.

731
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,320


732
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,550
Give me your hand.

733
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,040


734
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,980


735
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:48,990
Quick.

736
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,790
Hurry up.

737
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,710


738
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,550
Come on.

739
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,640


740
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,990
Give me your hand.

741
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,050


742
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,150


743
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,350
Come on. Quick.

744
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,230
Come on. You can do it.

745
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,610


746
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,900


747
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,910
Come on!

748
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,420


749
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,590
Get out of the way!

750
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,040


751
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,270
Hurry up!

752
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,510


753
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,550
I'm scared.

754
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,970


755
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,980
Xiao Lin Lin.

756
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,010


757
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,350
Hurry up!

758
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,510
He wants me to be his mentor?

759
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,480


760
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,270
Yes, Ah Xiu wants you to be his mentor.

761
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200


762
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,950
But look at him,

763
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,840


764
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,310
it doesn't seem to be the case.

765
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,260


766
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,270
He's embarrassed to tell you.

767
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,440


768
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,510
He's afraid that you'll reject him,

769
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,340


770
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,790
so he told me to ask for him.

771
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,650


772
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,410


773
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,710
Dou Zi, I'll be honest with you.

774
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,030
I think of you two as my friends.

775
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,030


776
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,310
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
let you two come here.

777
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,000


778
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,750
I know.

779
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,950


780
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,990
But I really...

781
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,870
He's started doing leg physiotherapy.

782
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,760


783
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,630
Leg physiotherapy is a very painful

784
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,620


785
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,850


786
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,070
long-term process.

787
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,270
He doesn't say anything,
but I know it in my heart.

788
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,050


789
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,470
That's why he's acting weird now

790
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,620


791
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,470
and has a small temper.

792
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,450


793
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,830
I'm not angry at him.

794
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,700


795
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,510
I just feel bad for him.

796
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,460


797
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,630
It all started with
that one miracle you gave him.

798
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,540


799
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,790
It gives him hope for the future.

800
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,360


801
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,510
He wants to stand up properly now

802
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,400


803
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,630
and give me a perfect and decent wedding.

804
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,070


805
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,310
You're very important to him.

806
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,910


807
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,430
So, I hope

808
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,420


809
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,830
you can help us get through this together.

810
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,470


811
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,550
While he's doing physiotherapy,

812
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,320


813
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,790
he can go online

814
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,730


815
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,470
to meet his mentor and learn some skills.

816
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,420


817
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,430
Perhaps

818
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,240


819
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,590
this is the best way for him

820
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,710


821
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,110
to push through the pain.

822
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,040


823
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,710
Stop playing, come here.

824
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,640


825
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,680


826
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,580
Me?

827
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,430
Who else?

828
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,390


829
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,350
What's wrong, Miracle?

830
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,300


831
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,720


832
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,910
You want to see me?

833
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,350
Why are you still calling him Miracle?

834
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,140


835
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,310
You should call him Master.

836
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,260


837
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,070
Master, please accept my respect!

838
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,030


839
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,550
Get up.

840
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,500


841
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,910
We don't do such things in Pangu.

842
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,670


843
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,070
I can take you as my disciple.

844
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,760


845
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,150
But I have two conditions.

846
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,110


847
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,710
Name it.

848
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,640


849
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,510
First, I can only log in once
every other day.

850
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,510


851
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,270
Second,

852
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:37,800


853
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,340
you must not tell anyone

854
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,010


855
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,830
about this place.

856
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,700


857
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,670
I know.

858
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,360


859
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,390
You don't want people to bother you.

860
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,090


861
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,910
Only these two conditions, right?

862
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,490


863
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,430
Dou Zi, quick.

864
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,240


865
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
From now on, you should
call him Master too.

866
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,570


867
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,830
Okay.

868
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,690


869
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,590
I told you

870
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,830
I can do it.

871
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,470


872
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,940


873
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,030
By the way, Master, where's Mistress?

874
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,550
Mistress?

875
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,440


876
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,780


877
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,910
Right.

878
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,670
As a matter of fact,

879
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,810


880
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,430
you don't have to be together every day.

881
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,270


882
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,870
Sometimes, you can separate for a while

883
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,860


884
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,630
to keep things fresh between you.

885
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,230


886
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,470
Because if you're together every day,

887
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,600


888
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,110
you'll get bored of each other.

889
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,030


890
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,070
Isn't there a saying like this?

891
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,060


892
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,100


893
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,110
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

894
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,830
I'm not talking about us.

895
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,940


896
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,190
We're not married yet.

897
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,170


898
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,630
That's better than being
two worlds apart from each other.

899
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,230


900
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,270
Being two worlds apart,

901
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,150


902
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,470
we know each other very well.

903
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,290


904
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,510
You understand me

905
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,940


906
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,470
and I understand you too.

907
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,410


908
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,110
But sometimes,

909
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,640


910
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,630
I can't tell the boundary
between real and virtual worlds.

911
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,400


912
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,670
I can't even tell if it's you

913
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,460


914
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,790
or me.

915
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,680


916
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,190
Master is right.

917
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,740


918
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,030
Although I don't understand,

919
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,060


920
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,470
I think it sounds great.

921
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,360


922
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,940
Nonsense.

923
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,600


924
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,950
Show me everything.

925
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,640


926
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,510
Show me all your skills.

927
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,500


928
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,110


929
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,270
Don't leave out anything.

930
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,220
Now.

931
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:48,720


932
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,870
Okay.

933
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,860


934
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,830
Master, look carefully.

935
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,700


936
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,790
Teleportation!

937
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,880


938
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,990
Teleportation!

939
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,930


940
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,330


941
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,390
You...

942
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,150
I'm so glad you're fine.

943
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,110


944
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,990
God is merciful.

945
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,000


946
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,870
I'm so glad you're fine.

947
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,620


948
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,950
It's not that God is merciful.

949
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,010


950
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,870
She saved me.

951
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,790


952
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,790
Great.

953
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,710


954
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,670
Drink some water first.

955
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,570


956
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,330


957
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,590
Thank you.

958
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,030
Right, I have something for you.

959
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,920


960
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,870
I want to give this to you.

961
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,800


962
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,430


963
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,510
Mr. Lin, you don't have to do this.

964
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,110
I can't take this.

965
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,770


966
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,990
Just accept it.

967
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,880


968
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,710
It's nothing special.

969
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,550


970
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,310
Open it and have a look.

971
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,310


972
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,150
What is this? It's so beautiful.

973
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,870


974
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,070
I also thought this stone
was very special.

975
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,730


976
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,190
So I kept it until now.

977
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,090


978
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,230
Just keep it as a memento.

979
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,170


980
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,270
To remind us of today

981
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,260


982
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,570


983
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,190
and our friendship that has been through
life and death.

984
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,750
Okay?

985
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,660


986
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,270
Okay, I'll take it then.

987
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,850


988
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,150
Thank you.

989
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,880


990
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,530


991
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,910
You're welcome.

992
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,830
I'll get going first.

993
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,720


994
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,310
You gave the Star Moonstone to Bai Wei?

995
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,140


996
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,070
You didn't give it to me back then.

997
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,910


998
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,750
Congratulations.

999
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,690


1000
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,390
You found a girl you really like.

1001
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,300


1002
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,470
Thanks.

1003
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,320


1004
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,340
However,

1005
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,360


1006
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,830
someone is going to be sad.

1007
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,710


1008
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,680


1009
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,910
The significance of handmade gifts

1010
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,950
would be far greater

1011
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,940


1012
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,750
than anything else for girls.

1013
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,720


1014
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,910
No matter how bad you do,

1015
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,010


1016
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,510
it's the thought that matters.

1017
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,180


1018
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,710
Your thought is the most touching part.

1019
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,640


1020
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,230
I understand.

1021
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,110


1022
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,840


1023
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,190
Right,

1024
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,190
if you see Bai...

1025
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,140


1026
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,830
If you see Sea of ​​Flowers,

1027
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,590


1028
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,990
don't tell her about this.

1029
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,880


1030
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,750
Ah Xiu, it's almost time!

1031
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,830


1032
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,150
We should go offline now!

1033
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,020


1034
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,990
Master, I've had enough practice today.

1035
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,480


1036
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,420


1037
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,510
Right, don't forget to
send my regards to Mistress.

1038
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,720


1039
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,830
Good luck!

1040
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,510
I haven't mastered
the greatest martial arts yet.

1041
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,500


1042
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,740


1043
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,750
Why did we go offline?

1044
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,070
Let's do rehab first.

1045
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,960


1046
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,910
Fine.

1047
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,730


1048
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,350
Come on.

1049
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,410


1050
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,480


1051
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,750
Take your time, don't rush.

1052
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,870
Okay, don't have to rush.

1053
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,810


1054
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,150
Good luck.

1055
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:33,880


1056
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,630
Good luck!

1057
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:34,640


1058
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,150
We've alarmed him this time.

1059
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,130


1060
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,750
We can't do this anymore.

1061
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,440


1062
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,630
I didn't expect this kid to be so tough.

1063
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,280


1064
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,590
All of them are so lucky.

1065
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,110


1066
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,910
What should we do, Boss?

1067
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,900


1068
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,990
You can leave now.

1069
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,890


1070
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,730


1071
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:02,990
Okay.

1072
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,790
Uncle, you want to see me?

1073
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,780


1074
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,470
You're here.

1075
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,420


1076
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,790
I can only rely on you now.

1077
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,680


1078
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,950
Rely on me?

1079
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,830


1080
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,060


1081
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,430
No, Uncle,

1082
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,150
didn't you say that

1083
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,230


1084
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,230
Wan Si Bar can handle it all?

1085
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,220


1086
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,670


1087
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,780
We screwed up.

1088
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,460
Recrimination after the event
won't solve the problem.

1089
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,410


1090
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,590
Now I can't plant my man there.

1091
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,250


1092
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,830
I need you in Pangu

1093
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,960


1094
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,070
to check the identity of the accounts

1095
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,010


1096
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,270
and solve the problems inside.

1097
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,140


1098
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,830


1099
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,990
But, Uncle,

1100
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,470
I can't locate his account now.

1101
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,570


1102
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,510
Find a way to do it, then.

1103
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,350


1104
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,630
Uncle,

1105
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,560


1106
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,790
are we really going to kill him there?

1107
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,670


1108
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,230
Now things are getting
more and more serious.

1109
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,700


1110
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,590
Yi Da, you need to know

1111
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,400


1112
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,990
that if this can't be done,

1113
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,470


1114
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,350
you'll go down with me too.

1115
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,280


1116
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,770


1117
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,780
Do you understand?

1118
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,270
I understand.

1119
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,140


1120
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,190
Do you know about this?

1121
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,010


1122
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,470
The moment the elevator fell,

1123
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,310


1124
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,030
I pulled Lin Feng up

1125
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,020


1126
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,830
in the nick of time!

1127
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,850


1128
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,190
I'm so cool, right?

1129
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,160


1130
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,710
Are you done?

1131
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,630


1132
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,870
What were you doing?

1133
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,890


1134
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,230
What were you doing?

1135
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,940


1136
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,390
You even climbed out of the elevator.

1137
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,100


1138
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,070
You two had got some nerves.

1139
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,700


1140
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,470
This is exactly a negative example.

1141
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,320


1142
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,550
And yet you've come to gloat
and be complacent about it.

1143
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,380


1144
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,070
Get down here!

1145
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:33,990


1146
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,310
That wasn't my fault.

1147
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,300


1148
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,310


1149
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,550
Why are you blaming me?

1150
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,990
It's all because of
your shoddy construction!

1151
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,070


1152
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,750
Even the elevator is broken.

1153
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,800


1154
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,670
You want to argue it out?

1155
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,750


1156
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,990
I tell you,

1157
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:47,950


1158
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,350
this incident is not
as simple as you think.

1159
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,970


1160
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,390
They are clearly coming after
you and Lin Feng.

1161
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,280


1162
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,990
Starting today,

1163
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,630


1164
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,790
you can't go to Celeste Group anymore.

1165
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,290


1166
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,870
The plan is cancelled.

1167
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,480


1168
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,750
Why?

1169
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,740


1170
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,390


1171
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,670
No why.

1172
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,950


1173
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,070
Why are you yelling at me?

1174
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,550
Lin Feng won't yell at me.

1175
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,430


1176
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,710
He won't yell at you?

1177
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,550


1178
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,710
Go to him, then.

1179
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,480


1180
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,870
Fine, I'll go to him.

1181
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860


1182
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,540


1183
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:09,750
Let me tell you,

1184
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,740


1185
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,910
he even gave me

1186
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,470


1187
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,710
a dark green stone today.

1188
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,110


1189
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,780
It's nice.

1190
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,030
Unlike someone else...

1191
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,950


1192
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,470
What is the stone like?

1193
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,290


1194
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,990
[Finally, you can't hold back and
take the initiative to talk to me, right?]

1195
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,880


1196
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,310
It's just a dark green stone.

1197
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,070


1198
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,670
It's fluorescent. It's pretty nice.

1199
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,530


1200
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,830
[Is it the Star Moonstone?]

1201
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,960


1202
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,330


1203
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,550
Are you jealous?

1204
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,750
No.

1205
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,510


1206
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,470
It's almost time, I'll go offline.

1207
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,320


1208
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,030
Goodbye.

1209
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,820


1210
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,210


1211
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,430
This person

1212
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,820
is so weird.

1213
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,670


1214
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,190
Pangu portable adapter.

1215
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,170


1216
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,910
The company just produced it

1217
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,370


1218
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,430
and I've brought it to you immediately.

1219
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,370


1220
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,070
How is it? Feel it.

1221
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,020


1222
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,390
See if it meets your expectations.

1223
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,390


1224
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,470
Right,

1225
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,590


1226
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,390
I want to tell you something.

1227
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,370


1228
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,030
Today, a girl

1229
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,940


1230
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,910
saved my life.

1231
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,930


1232
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,630
This girl

1233
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,610


1234
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,790
is the type of girl

1235
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,720


1236
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,350
that you'll have a hard time forgetting

1237
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,420


1238
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,790
after seeing her for the first time.

1239
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,640


1240
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,830
She's very unique.

1241
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,720


1242
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,700


1243
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,950
Sometimes I even feel that

1244
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,470


1245
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,590
she's very similar to you.

1246
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,990
Sometimes, she's nothing like you.

1247
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,920


1248
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,870
When the incident happened today,

1249
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,430


1250
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,150
I felt that everything

1251
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,130


1252
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,910
was like a dream.

1253
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,860


1254
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,630
[A beautiful dream.]

1255
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,540


1256
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,210


1257
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,310
That dream

1258
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,180
gave me an unprecedented impulse.

1259
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,160


1260
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,550
So I think

1261
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,370


1262
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,630
I must have fallen in love with her.

1263
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,510


1264
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,030
I gave her the Star Moonstone.

1265
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,900


1266
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,630
But I'm sure she doesn't know

1267
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,620


1268
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,410


1269
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,590
the meaning of it yet.

1270
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,190
How about this?

1271
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,120


1272
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,620
I'll bring her to see you another day.

1273
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,750


1274
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,310
She's your old rival, Bai Wei.

1275
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,290


1276
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,990
Xiao Tian,

1277
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,110


1278
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,270
don't you think this is a quirk of fate?

1279
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,190


1280
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,670
[It's really the Star Moonstone.]

1281
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,530


1282
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,390
This stone represents your love.

1283
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,380


1284
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,430
Since you don't want to give it to me,

1285
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,300


1286
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,510
we should break up.

1287
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,410


1288
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,470


1289
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,710
What's up, man?

1290
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,150
Are you okay, buddy?

1291
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,570


1292
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,950
You broke up?

1293
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,860


1294
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,750
This stone is called Star Moonstone.

1295
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,300


1296
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,469
It's very precious to me.

1297
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,290


1298
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,780
I was thinking that

1299
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,520


1300
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,790
if I ever have the chance to meet

1301
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960


1302
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,150
a lover who's destined for life,

1303
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,120


1304
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,870
I'll give it to her.

1305
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,810


1306
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,830
But so far I haven't met anyone.

1307
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,860


1308
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,830
You've got to be kidding me.

1309
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,880


1310
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,909
You're so romantic.

1311
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,830


1312
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,310
Love between men and women
is unreliable these days.

1313
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,030


1314
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,830
Why don't you give the stone to me?

1315
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,780


1316
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,340


1317
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,389
Only your brother will never leave you.

1318
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,310
That's impossible.

1319
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,270


1320
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,830
[Give to the lover
who is destined for life?]

1321
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,680


1322
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,550
[Bai Wei?]

1323
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,530


1324
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,570


1325
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,780
Yun Er.

1326
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,790
Actually, I really don't understand

1327
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,780


1328
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,350


1329
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,510
what you like about Lin Feng.

1330
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,550
Sister,

1331
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,450


1332
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,420


1333
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,660
you're so pretty.

1334
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,910
You can get any man you want.

1335
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,690


1336
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,950
You have to keep your options open.

1337
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,800


1338
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,430
Then what do you like

1339
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,550


1340
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,230
about the mask boy in Pangu?

1341
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,150


1342
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,350
You're right.

1343
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,270


1344
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,670
If you can explain

1345
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,900


1346
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,630
your feelings clearly,

1347
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,220


1348
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,780
then it won't be your real feelings.

1349
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,760


1350
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,190
As a matter of fact,

1351
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,790


1352
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,390
I didn't like Lin Feng that much at first.

1353
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,210


1354
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,550
I just thought of him
as Ye Tian's only friend,

1355
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,310


1356
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,590
so I wanted to steal him over.

1357
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,500


1358
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,750
I couldn't tell that

1359
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,540


1360
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,990
you have so much resentment
towards Ye Tian.

1361
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,570


1362
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,510
You don't understand.

1363
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,130


1364
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,580
You have always been superior
since childhood.

1365
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,370


1366
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,150
You won't understand
the humiliation of being oppressed.

1367
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,000


1368
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,150
Especially

1369
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,140


1370
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,470
when I saw Zhang Hao Cheng

1371
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,540


1372
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,750
grovelling to him.

1373
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,350


1374
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,390
I felt very uncomfortable.

1375
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,330


1376
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,870
Beautiful ladies,

1377
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,810


1378
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,190
have a drink with me.

1379
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,130


1380
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,420
So you tried to take revenge
on Ye Tian in this manner.

1381
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,410


1382
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,830
In the end, I fell into it instead.

1383
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,420


1384
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,700
And it's getting deeper and deeper.

1385
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,630


1386
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,710
You...

1387
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,460


1388
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,820


1389
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,350
Love is a game.

1390
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,110
You lose once you get serious.

1391
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,790


1392
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,390
You're just too serious.

1393
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,260


1394
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,390
But I don't want to lose.

1395
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,280


1396
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,910
If you don't want to lose, go for it.

1397
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,810


1398
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,350
Look, Sea of Flowers is standing between

1399
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,280


1400
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,910
the guy in Pangu and me.

1401
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,900


1402
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,990
But I never give up.

1403
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,320


1404
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,510
Besides,

1405
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,930


1406
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,790
whatever I want,

1407
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,690


1408
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,750
I'll always get it.

1409
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,670


1410
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,190
Indeed.

1411
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,130


1412
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,830
Good men should belong to us.

1413
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,500


1414
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,430
Bai Wei? Why would she get them?

1415
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,910


1416
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,590
All these years,

1417
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,570


1418
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,210


1419
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,100
Xiao Lin Lin never gave me any gift.

1420
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,550
Who is she to take his gift?

1421
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,430


1422
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,830
All the best!

1423
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:05,860


1424
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,190
Zhao Jia Liang,

1425
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,130


1426
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,790
did something happen to Wei Wei recently?

1427
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,720


1428
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,830
Is it?

1429
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,710


1430
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,270
Ever since she joined Celeste Group,

1431
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,150


1432
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,710
she's like a different person.

1433
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,310


1434
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,830
Sometimes when I look at her,

1435
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,820


1436
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,470
I feel like she's a stranger.

1437
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,160


1438
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,230
She just joined a new working environment.

1439
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,540


1440
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,150
She needs to adapt to it.

1441
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,090


1442
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,870
She must be feeling stressed.

1443
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,050


1444
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,790
We need to understand her more.

1445
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,380


1446
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,750
But...

1447
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,370


1448
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,550
Yesterday, all I did

1449
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,680


1450
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,470
was upload a wrong character card.

1451
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,370


1452
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,790
But she scolded me in public.

1453
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,680


1454
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,390
No matter what happened previously,

1455
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,240


1456
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,030
she never treated me like that.

1457
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,840


1458
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,350
Is there something wrong with her?

1459
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,070


1460
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,340
How is that possible?

1461
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,180


1462
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,830
Don't be absurd.

1463
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,650


1464
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,130


1465
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,510
No, why are you all like this?

1466
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,270
You think about others all the time.

1467
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,730


1468
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,230
Why can't you think for yourself?

1469
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,850


1470
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,990
What's the matter?
Why are you so irritable?

1471
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,450


1472
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,790
I'm not.

1473
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,710


1474
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,110
Did you have a fight with Wei Wei?

1475
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,980


1476
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,510
Were you scolded
for your unsuccessful confession?

1477
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,500


1478
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,710
Ms. Wei and I are not like what you think.

1479
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,100


1480
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,990
Shut up and finish your drink.

1481
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,870


1482
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,990
As a matter of fact,

1483
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,860


1484
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,870
if you want to pursue a girl,

1485
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,860


1486
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,390
you have to be patient.

1487
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,150


1488
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,590
Be mysterious.

1489
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,210


1490
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,990
Be mysterious, do you understand?

1491
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,880


1492
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,270
You can't be at her beck and call.

1493
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,260


1494
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,570


1495
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,510
You have to surprise her.

1496
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,510
It's better to show up
at the critical moment.

1497
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,320


1498
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,350
Perhaps she might fall in love with you.

1499
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,240


1500
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,710
What critical moment?

1501
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,530


1502
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,070
Like holidays, birthdays

1503
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,880


1504
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,950
or your anniversary with her.

1505
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,850


1506
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,590
Let's say my birthday is in two days,

1507
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,990


1508
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,030
if you appear in front of me

1509
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,180


1510
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,350
without telling me in advance

1511
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,470


1512
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,710
and take me to the amusement park

1513
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,550


1514
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,350
to take a Ferris wheel,

1515
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,040


1516
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,750
and you put on a firework show,

1517
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,550


1518
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,030
then you...

1519
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,660


1520
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,670
Stop!

1521
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,830
Don't use yourself as an example.

1522
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360


1523
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,350
I feel weird thinking about it.

1524
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,100


1525
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,740
I'm just giving you a suggestion.

1526
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,330


1527
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,470
Can't I use it as an analogy?

1528
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,010


1529
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,390
If you have such a good suggestion,

1530
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,380


1531
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,350
you should suggest it to
Xiao Guo from your department.

1532
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,080


1533
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,950
He could make use of it.

1534
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,660


1535
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,710
Zhao Jia Liang.

1536
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,570


1537
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,070
Zhao Jia Liang!

1538
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:27,910


1539
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,630
Do you want me

1540
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,680


1541
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,110
to date someone else so much?

1542
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,950


1543
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,710
Why do we have to

1544
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,820


1545
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,670
look for someone else to be with us?

1546
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,090


1547
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,310
Why can't we just be like
what we used to be?

1548
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,230


1549
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,510
Did I annoy you?

1550
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,370


1551
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,350
No, it's my problem.

1552
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,220


1553
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,060
Zhao Jia Liang,

1554
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,980


1555
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,270
Guo Yi Da gave me
a ticket to the magic show.

1556
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,620


1557
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,830
I've been hesitating whether to go or not.

1558
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,240


1559
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,710
But just now,

1560
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,700


1561
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,980


1562
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,070
I've decided that I want to go.

1563
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,270
Because at least I feel that

1564
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,320


1565
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,630
there's someone in this world
who needs me.

1566
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,490


1567
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,430
Have fun.

1568
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,290


1569
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,030


1570
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,230
Zhao Jia Liang!

1571
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,430
I don't understand.

1572
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,400


1573
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,390
Mr. Lin, I can't accept this.

1574
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,090


1575
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,310
Please understand.

1576
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,220


1577
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,630
Didn't we have an understanding yesterday?

1578
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,620


1579
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,020


1580
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,030
But yesterday I didn't know

1581
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,950
that this is no ordinary stone.

1582
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,730


1583
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,670
It's Star Moonstone.

1584
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,420


1585
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,670
How did you know about it?

1586
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,660


1587
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,830
Maybe one day

1588
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,780


1589
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,470
there'll be a girl who will accept

1590
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,510


1591
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,750
the Star Moonstone from you.

1592
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,700


1593
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,430
But this girl...

1594
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,270


1595
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,270
I won't allow her to be that girl.

1596
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,160


1597
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,150
I won't allow her to be that girl?

1598
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,020


1599
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,710
What's that supposed to mean?

1600
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,730


1601
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,880


1602
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,150
[How did Bai Wei know about this?]

1603
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,110
[I have always regarded
Xiao Tian as a brother.]

1604
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,620


1605
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,120


1606
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,270
[No matter what I do,]

1607
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,830
[I want to look up to him.]

1608
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,300


1609
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,070
[So no matter what I want,]

1610
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,920


1611
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,150
[I'll compete fairly with him.]

1612
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,030


1613
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,750
[Bai Wei, I like you.]

1614
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,780


1615
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,460
[You're a newcomer]

1616
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,450


1617
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,470
