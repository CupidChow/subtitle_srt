Let's go the other way.

1429
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,850


1430
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,120
Alright, let's go.

1431
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,760


1432
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,280
Nice!

1433
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,720
Bye.

1434
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,420


1435
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,810


1436
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,090
Excuse me.

1437
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,810


1438
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,160
Be careful.

1439
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,950


1440
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,120
Why are you in Pangu?

1441
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,520


1442
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,720
I heard something happened to you.

1443
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,560


1444
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
It took me a lot of effort
to visit you in the hospital.

1445
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,940


1446
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,200
You can stay here without going out.

1447
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,880


1448
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,950
However, you don't participate
in the final with me,

1449
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,080


1450
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,310
do you still owe me an apology?

1451
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,240


1452
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,640
One man alone
against our core servers,

1453
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,430


1454
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,530


1455
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
he won't have any chance of winning.

1456
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,270


1457
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,400
Your body is not connected
to the experience cabin,

1458
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,810


1459
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,920
so how did you get into Pangu?

1460
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,180


1461
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,360
Then, why are you stuck in Pangu?

1462
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,230


1463
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,630


1464
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,710
Do you know the people out there
said you're dead now?

1465
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,760


1466
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,030


1467
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,320
Once you die, you'll realise
everything is meaningless!
