00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,730


721
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,890
then I can't

722
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,880


723
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,120


724
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,450
just wait here alone.

725
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,000


726
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,290
Boss,

727
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,480


728
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,530
I think it's not appropriate

729
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,220


730
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,650
to steal other people's horses
which are tethered outside.

731
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,730


732
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,130
Why is it not appropriate?

733
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,330


734
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,730
That Sea of Flowers

735
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,750


736
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,130
stole my horse too, didn't she?

737
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,050


738
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,490
She made me lost so much money.

739
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,120


740
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,450
One horse is not enough,

741
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,160


742
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,570
I'm going to steal many horses.

743
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,610
Sea of Flowers!

744
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,270


745
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,740


746
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,970
Pangu is such a small world.

747
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,050


748
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,250
Why do I see you everywhere?

749
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,920


750
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,170
Hi.

751
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,180


752
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,730
What a coincidence.

753
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,920


754
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,250
You're looking for a horse, right?

755
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,080


756
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,090
The horse I get from you

757
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,570


758
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,730
is just under the tree
at the east end of the village.

759
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,370


760
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,770
I'll bring you there.

761
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,410
The time for the task has long passed!

762
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,000


763
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,410
Listen, Sea of Flowers.

764
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,910


765
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,130


766
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,580
What you owe me

767
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,990
isn't merely a horse.

768
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,440


769
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,600


770
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,090
You have offended Heavenly Society.

771
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,420


772
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,490
Today, I will beat you
until you concede defeat.

773
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,250
Your core team

774
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,240


775
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,430


776
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,810
is not good
in PK (confrontation) fighting.

777
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,170


778
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,490
I don't want to bully you.

779
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,790


780
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,290
Coincidentally, I went out
on a mission today.

781
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,770
I brought the combat group
of the Heavenly Society.

782
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,270


783
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,200


784
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,490
Look.

785
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,760


786
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,170
I'm leaving.

787
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,850
Go after her!

788
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,860


789
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,490


790
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,810
Go after her!

791
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,650
Sea of Flowers, you ask for it!

792
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,440


793
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840


794
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,210
Try to brag more.

795
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,370


796
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,810
You can't run anymore.

797
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,360


798
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,490
All of you.

799
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,420

802
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,770
Take a stone and knock her
until she's offline.

803
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,920


804
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,290
Okay.

805
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,510


806
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,730
Boss, it's not appropriate to bully women.

807
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,890


808
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,210
Hey, don't you see that

809
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,810
she's the one who bullies me?

810
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,390


811
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,250


812
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,730
Moreover,

818
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,530
What are you afraid of?

819

820
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,730
Right.

821

822
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,450
All of you!

823

824
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,930
Aim.

825
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,370
One, two, three, smash.

826

916
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,850
You ask for mercy, aren't you?

917
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,490
You want to apologise, aren't you?

918
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,920


919
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,270


920

924
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,210
If I die, I can't be resurrected.

926
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,570
At most, I'll apologise to you.

928
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,290

936
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,650
I really like your reason.

[I also need
my own fingerprint for verification.]

960
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,410
[Gosh.]

However, for the journey after this,

What exactly do you want to do?
