189
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,909
the first time I met her,

191
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,520


192
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,710
it was in Autumn City.

193
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,050


194
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,270
Autumn City?

195
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:38,940


196
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,950
Yes.

197
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,670
It's a game

200
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,909
in Pangu.

202
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,790
Can you be more specific?

203

204
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,150
When we were in Autumn City,

205
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,900


206
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,909
she's always giving us a hard time.

207
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,430
Sea of Flower is her name.

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,190
I can recognise her
even if she turns into ashes.

212
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,590
You just remember Sea of Flower,

Thanks.

Sorry about that.

230
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,830
Just in time.

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,670
Go!

Isn't this the only way

244
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,510
What should we do?

246
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,590
Do we have another way?

247
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,750
We are running out of time.

252
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,270
and passing through the Wizard Forest.

253
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,170


254
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,230
This way.

255
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,950
Is this the place?

256
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,700


257
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,310
Don't worry.

Just follow me. You won't go wrong.

262
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,630
Wait a minute.

264
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,030
Are we lost?

265
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,630
We've passed this tree three times.

266
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,490


267
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,150
How is this possible?

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,850


269
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,750


270
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,910
You're dazzled.

271
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,640


272
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,830
Come here.

273
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,700


274
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,710
This tree is big and thick.

275
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,300


276
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,430
And there are traces of
being struck by lightning.

277
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,060


278
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,230
It's easy to recognize.

279
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,220


280
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,230
It seems that you have little knowledge of

281
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,160


282
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,350
the game design aspect.

283
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,350
Did you know

284
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,170


285
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,260


286
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,550
due to the overwhelming
number of trees in Pangu,

287
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,730


288
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,750
the designers often use

289
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,010


290
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,350
the same material files.

291
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,010


292
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,020
Hence, you will not be surprised

293
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,620


294
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,630
to see some of the trees

295
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,500


296
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,710
with the
same appearance, body, and features.

297
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,780


298
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,830
Don't think so much.

299
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,430


300
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,630
Let's go.

301
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:09,830


302
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,030
Come back.

303
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:10,990


304
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,190
Look at it.

305
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,140


306
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,150
The mark I just left with the knife

307
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,660


308
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,830
is right here.

309
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,830
This is the mark you left behind?

310
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,580


311
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,110


312
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,340
Something's wrong here.

313
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,930


314
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,070
Am I right?

315
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,680


316
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,910
We're not really lost, aren't we?

317
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,420


318
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,580
What should we do now?

319
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,910
We don't have much time left now.

320
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,690


321
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,800


322
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,910
It's ok.

323
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,670


324
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,990
Based on my intuition,

325
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,110
as long as we cross this way,

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,920


327
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,490


328
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,750
we will reach Black Wind Cave.

329
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,910
Really?

330
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,660


331
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,340


332
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,350
I'm not trusting you

333
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,360


334
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,470
as a tour guide anymore.

335

336
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,790
You can question
my proficiency in the game,

337
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,660


338
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,670
but you can't question

339
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,310


340
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,510
the knowledge I have
about Pangu's environment?

341
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,290


342
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,390
Don't forget.

343
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,670
I'm God

344
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,460


345
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,350


346
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,550
here.

347
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,500


348
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,660
Everything you said is correct.

349
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,310


350
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,390
But you'll have to say that
at the entrance to the Black Wind Cave,

351
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,380


352
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,590
I would believe it a bit more.

353
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,470


354
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,830
Put away your sarcastic remarks

355
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,640


356
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,710
Let's be fair.

357
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,260


358
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,270
From the first step

359
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,660


360
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,670
we both went into this forest,

361
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,520


362
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,830
not to mention that it was an attack,

363
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,650


364
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,870
have you seen even a monster here?

365
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,200


366
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,390
This is what you call professionalism.

367
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,380


368
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,500
This...

369
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,710


370
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,870
What's that sound?

371
