a lot of sense of security.

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,510
Thank you.

725
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,670
Thank you for accompanying me.

726
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,550


727
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,080


728
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,270
I need to continue the journey

729
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,750


730
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,910
will Ah Xiu.

731
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,220


732
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,430
Miracle

733
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,860


734
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,030
and Sea of Flower,

735
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,800


736
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,070
we'll meet again.

737
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,270
See you.

738
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,110


739
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,830
Be brave.

740
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,570


741
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,560


742
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,910
I think

743
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,310


744
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,510
he likes you too.

745
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,380
I envy them.

746
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,180


747
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,460


748
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,630
They have a good relationship.

749
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,710
What's wrong?

750
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,500


751
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,620


752
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,910
I'm thinking

753
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,050


754
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,070
he can actually get the best skill

755
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,100


756
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,350
in Pangu soon.

757
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,230


758
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,430
But he gave up.

759
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,020


760
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,270
I feel sorry for him.

761
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
It's just a game.

762
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,040


763
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340


764
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,470
Not everyone cares about games that much.

765
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,910
Reality is still the most important.

766
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,760


767
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,080


768
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,390
I think Dou Zi did a good job.

769
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,750
Didn't you feel touched at all?

770
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,470


771
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,110
But there're
so many disappointments in reality

772
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,870


773
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,430
and we can't control them.

774
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200


775
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,990
I think

776
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,770


777
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,700
Pangu is like a fairy tale,

778
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,650


779
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,630
a perfect dream.

780
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,460


781
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,650


782
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,870
But

783
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,910
we still need to wake up
from a dream eventually.

784
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,630


785
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,830


786
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:49,910
Look.

787
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,790
Why did we do so much?

788
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,630


789
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,550
Isn't it just to wake you up?

790
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,350


791
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,270


792
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,430
Right?

793
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,890


794
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,140
Yes.

795
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,430
All of these

796
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,140


797
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,000


798
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,190
are just a dream.

799
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,810


800
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,150
This Pangu world

801
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,220


802
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,590
is just made up of codes.

803
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,310
I'm

804
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,250


805
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,920


806
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,110
also made up of part of the codes.

807
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,910
OK, Mr. Codes,

808
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,790


809
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900


810
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,150
I'll help you to evolve
into a human today.

811
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,340


812
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,390
What do you mean by 
evolving into a human?

813
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,830


814
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm a human.

815
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,260


816
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,270
Mr. Codes.

817
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,310
Repeat if you dare to.

818
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,050


819
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,800


820
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,030
Mr. Codes,

821
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,230
let's get married.

822
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,050


823
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,470
Let's go.

824
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,270


825
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,870


826
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,070
Do you mean that Bai Wei

827
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,340


828
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,350
supposed to perform

829
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,300


830
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,310
on the night of 17th May,

831
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,710
but she rejected it later?

832
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,500


833
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,380


834
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,550
She didn't feel so well that day.

835
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,910
That's why she applied for leave.

836
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,860


837
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,910
So, is there something different

838
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,660


839
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,680


840
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,790
about her recently?

841
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,330


842
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,590
Which media are you from?

843
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,230
You don't have to ask these questions

844
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,220


845
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,300


846
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,470
if you want to ask her
for an interview, right?

847
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,350


848
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,590
The interview piece
will be more interesting

849
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,230
if I can understand her more, right?

850
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,010


851
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,710
OK.

852
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,620


853
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,120


854
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,310
Then, you have to write well.

855
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,390


856
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,630
Of course.

857
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,750
Xiao Liang is here.

858
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,930


859
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,310
Then

860
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,830
is there anything happening to her family?

861
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,670


862
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,440


863
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,670
I'm not sure.

864
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,270
The reason that she gave 
is different every time.

865
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,010


866
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,440


867
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,630
Different reasons.

868
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,810


869
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,910
Xiao Liang.

870
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,570


871
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,580
Is there anything else

872
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,330


873
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,470
besides that?

874
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,220


875
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,350
Are you here to apply for leave
for Ms. Wei again?

876
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,890


877
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,030
Who is the person next to the leader?

878
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,450


879
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,460
Today is fine.

880
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,590


881
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,910
He's a reporter.

882
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,590
I heard that he wants
to interview Ms. Wei.

883
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,250


884
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,680


885
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,110
Xiao Liang,

886
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,000


887
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,470
is Ms. Wei fine?

888
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,030
It has been days since I met her.

889
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,720


890
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,420


891
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,630
Xiao Liang,

892
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,490


893
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,630
do you know that person?

894
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,180


895
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,350
Not bad.

896
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,510


897
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,710
It's really the Sunlight Gemstone.

898
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,220


899
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,230
Only men and women
who truly love each other

900
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,760


901
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,990
deserve to have it.

902
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,910
Can I marry him them?

903
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,700


904
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,890


905
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,110
Sure.

906
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,110
But

907
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,910


908
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,030
before you get married,

909
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,770


910
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,830
you have to make this Sunlight Gemstone

911
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,510


912
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,970


913
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,150
into a Love Flower Ring

914
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,240


915
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,390
as the proposal ring during the wedding.

916
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,030


917
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,150
This is

918
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,730


919
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,350
our...

920
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,950
Your tradition in 
Love Flower Village, right?

921
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,090


922
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,350
It's not easy to get married.

923
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,940


924
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,150
There's a touching love story

925
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,910


926
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,110
about this Love Flower Ring.

927
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,870
According to legend...

928
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,610


929
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,830
According to legend,

930
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,630


931
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,830
once upon a time,

932
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,640


933
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,830
there was a pair

934
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,630


935
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,310
of knights

936
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,960


937
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,060


938
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,230
who are good at kung fu,

939
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,470
and they love each other very much.

940
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,240


941
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,640


942
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,910
The male's

943
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,270
name is Freedom.

944
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,070


945
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,320


946
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,470
The female's name is Shang Qing Qiu.

947
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,430
It's really hard to get married 
in this Love Flower Village.

948
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,250


949
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,100


950
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,110
I wonder how the older people

951
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,150
got married here.

952
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,960


953
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,510


954
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,710
Dual Cultivation is an Epic Poetry Skill.

955
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,070
It's good that

956
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,920


957
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,710
the missions are more complicated.

958
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,580


959
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,540


960
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,550
But I think this process...

961
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,300


962
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,510
Don't stop him.

963
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,060


964
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,070
We'll be in trouble

965
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,750


966
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,870
if we missed important information.

967
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,350
Freedom went through untold hardship.

968
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,110


969
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,950
Finally, he made the first 
Love Flower Ring

970
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,690


971
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,730


972
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,940
in the world

973
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,910
with this Sunlight Gemstone.

974
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,660


975
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,150
He intended to give the ring 
as a surprise

976
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,020


977
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,790
to Shang Qing Qiu
on their wedding day.

978
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,570


979
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,990
Unfortunately,

980
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,760


981
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,270


982
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,510
a night before their wedding day,

983
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,350
in order to save

984
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,170


985
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,430
the kids kidnapped by the Black Wind King,

986
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,040


987
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,670


988
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,870
they entered the Black Wind Cave.

989
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,580


990
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,830
They successfully saved the kids.

991
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,020


992
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,110
But they have never

993
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,630
came out of that 
Black Wind Cave anymore.

994
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,380


995
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,470
Nobody has ever seen

996
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,150


997
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,870
that Love Flower Ring that
represents love anymore.

998
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500


999
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,750
To commemorate their sacrifice

1000
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,570


1001
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,110
and their great love story,

1002
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,880


1003
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,390

1006
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,430
will use the same way

1007
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,350
to make an imitation Love Flower Ring

1008
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,090


1009
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,500


1010

from the Sunlight Gemstone

1011

as the wedding ring on the wedding day.

1012

1013
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:34,960


1014
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,150
Wait a moment.

1015
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,520


1016
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,910
I'm confused.

1017
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,190
Are we looking for
the real Love Flower Ring

1018
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,940


1019
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,080


1020
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,350
or the imitation ring?

1021
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,380


1022
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,390
You have to learn to pick up
the important points of his story.

1023
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,310


1024
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,550
There're a few messages in his story.

1025
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,300


1026
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,550
First, it's the Black Wind Cave.

1027
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,580


1028
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,590
Second, it's the Black Wind King.

1029
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,980


1030
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,190
Third, it's the lost Love Flower Ring.

1031
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,430


1032
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,630
This means that the final stage

1033
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,270


1034
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,550
is definitely a fighting mission.

1035
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,870
Do you understand now?

1036
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,740


1037
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,380


1038
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,590
What's the use of our gemstone then?

1039
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,610


1040
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,790

I have

1045
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,870
a suitable shank here.

1046
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,620

1048
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,350
It can be the shank for
your Love Flower Ring.

1050

It's cheap.

1051
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,690


1052
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,870
It's really not expensive.

1053
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,960


1054

verify your relationship.

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,620


1263
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,790
You can have a look.

1264
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,390
I think we still need a while more 
according to my prediction.

1265
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,210


1266
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,440


1267
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,950
Let's wait and see.

1268
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,390
My son,

1269
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,180


1270
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,790
have you really thought through it?

1271
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,550


1272
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:31,900


1273
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,070
Yes.

1274
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,360


1275
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,590
I have thought through it.

1276
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,830
I'll leave Sword Cottage today

1277
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,680


1278
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,550


1279
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,750
and learn zither in the zither school.

1280
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,990
Many people wish to enter

1281
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,820


1282
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,000


1283
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,190
Sword Cottage but they're not eligible.

1284
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,790
And you

1285
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,630


1286
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,860


1287
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,110
wanted to give up.

1288
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,560


1289
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:53,670
Dad,

1290
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,460


1291
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,710
you often said that

1292
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,750
there're many paths for a person.

1293
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,540


1294
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,990
I want to walk on my path.

1295
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,750


1296
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,590
OK.

1297
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,460


1298
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,420


1299
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,630
I don't understand the path you chose.

1300
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,160


1301
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,350
But I respect you.

1302
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,910
I won't stop you

1303
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,650


1304
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,790
since you want to leave.

1305
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,660


1306
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,110
This sword...

1307
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,970


1308
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,410


1309
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,420
I wanted to pass it on to you

1310
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,150


1311
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,430
during your birthday.

1312
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,110
Looks like

1313
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,910


1314
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,110
it should stay with me now.

1315
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,870


1316
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,410


1317
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,590
It's too long.

1318
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,350
Did you see the sword yet?

1319
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,130


1320
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,210


1321
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,390
That's Long Yuan Sword.

1322
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,480


1323
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,630
That's our target.

1324
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,640


1325
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,910
Who wrote this story?

1326
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,310
It's long and boring.

1327
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,100


1328
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,840


1329
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,990
Wei Wei.

1330
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,320


1331
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,510
Wei Wei.

1332
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,960


1333
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,190
Talk to your mum nicely.

1334
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,070


1335
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,390
You're too wilful this time.

1336
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,530


1337
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,750
Why are you stopping her?

1338
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,300


1339
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,510
Let her go.

1340
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,340


1341
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,670
She dropped out of medical school

1342
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,660


1343
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,870
without discussing it with us.

1344
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,880


1345
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,150
She wants to be a professional AR fighter.

1346
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,100


1347
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,110
She wants to be poor in the future.

1348
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,070
Let her be!

1349
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,880


1350
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,620


1351
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,630
Mum,

1352
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,030


1353
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,390
I don't understand now.

1354
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,810


1355
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,990
What's wrong with AR Fighting?

1356
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,390
Do you remember

1357
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,210


1358
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,490


1359
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,670
you were so happy for me

1360
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,340


1361
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,590
the first time I became the champion?

1362
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,260


1363
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,630
How come you don't support me now?

1364
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,990


1365
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,270
I have no objection if you take that
as a hobby.

1366
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,590


1367
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,950
But if you take that as your career,

1368
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,330


1369
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,590
have you thought of your future life?

1370
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,780


1371
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:56,790
Can you ensure that

1372
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,470


1373
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,710
you'll have a stable income?

1374
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,250


1375
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,510
Can you ensure that you won't regret it
in the future?

1376
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,230
This is the path that I chose.

1377
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,000


1378
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,340
I'll never regret it.

1379
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,900


1380
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,790
And I'll tell you with my capability

1381
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,580


1382
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,570


1383
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,750
that I can succeed.

1384
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,510
Don't come back anymore

1385
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,330


1386
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,760


1387
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,940
if you walk out of this house now.

1388
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,530


1389
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,710
I'll see it as

1390
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,179


1391
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,350
raising you for nothing.

1392
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,909


1393
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,270
Don't take it so seriously.

1394
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,870


1395
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,070
Let's talk in the house.

1396
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,170


1397
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,389
OK.

1398
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,790
I'll leave now.

1399
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,650


1400
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,580


1401
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,790
I'll leave now!

1402
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,830
Wei Wei!

1403
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,610


1404
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:39,670


1405
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,030
Wei Wei...

1406
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,840


1407
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,070
I

1408
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,949
didn't do it intentionally.

1409
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,770


1410
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,110


1411
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,230
Wei Wei!

1412
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:53,750


1413
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,870
Wei Wei!

1414
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,580


1415
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,710
Wei Wei!

1416
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,330


1417
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,630
What should we do later?

1418
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,520


1419
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,630
The son of Master Ou

1420
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,490


1421
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,750
will leave this Sword Cottage in a while.

1422
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,420


1423
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,710
This old man will be quite sad.

1424
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,830


1425
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,070
He'll walk to the ancestral hall.

1426
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,950


1427
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,070
This is the only chance
that he'll be alone.

1428
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,050


1429
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,150
We have to take this chance

1430
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,390


1431
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,590
and do something bad.

1432
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,080


1433
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,270
Kill him

1434
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,470


1435
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,790
and take away the treasure
of Sword Cottage from him,

1436
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,870
Long Yuan Sword

1437
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,660


1438
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,150
to exchange for 10,000 taels of gold.

1439
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,860

Kill Master Ou?

1442

1443
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,030
Oh yes.

1444
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,720


1445
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,910
Time is running out.

1446
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,470


1447
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,870
We have three minutes only.

1448
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,140


1449
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,150
His son will feel pity for him

1451
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,870
and come back later.

1452
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,450


1453
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,550
I don't want to fight

1454
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,300


1455
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,670
two top NPCs

1456
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,310
at the same time.

1457
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,370


1458
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,660
The son will come back.

1459
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,910
Are you feeling bad to do so?

1460
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,570


1461
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,860


1462
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,150
Let me tell you.

1463
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,230


1464
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,670
This is just a mission in the game.

1465
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,350


1466
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,430
They're not real humans.

1467
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,050


1468
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,190
They're just NPC.

1469
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,960


1470
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,070
They can appear

1471
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,540


1472
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,910
and disappear anytime.

1473
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,710
Although this is just
the mission in the game,

1474
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,450


1475
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,950
sometimes

1476
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,750


1477
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,020


1478
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,030
the difference

1479
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,850


1480
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,110
between the AR world and reality is small.

1481
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,730


1482
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,950
When I see the story of Master Ou
and his son,

1483
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,170


1484
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,190
I feel like it's the story of my mum

1485
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,150


1486
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,310
and me.

1487
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,080


1488
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,270
Sometimes I think

1489
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,670
if I didn't choose the path

1490
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,450


1491
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,800


1492
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,990
to be an AR fighter,

1493
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,260


1494
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,470
and chose to take the sword

1495
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,950
from my mum,

1496
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,650


1497
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,480


1498
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,630
will everything be different now?

1499
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,050


1500
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,230
She'll not have anxiety

1501
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,720


1502
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,910
and fell sick.

1503
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,580


1504
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,830
And she won't...

1505
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,830


1506
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,990
It's all over.

1507
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,310
Why did I mention it again?

1508
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,130


1509
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,060
