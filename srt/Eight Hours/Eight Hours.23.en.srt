185
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,590
his best wingman,

186
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,460


187
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,830
including you,

188
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,680


189
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,590


190
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,750
but no one ever told me

191
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,510


192
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,790
what I would be

193
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,470
without Xiao Tian.

194
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,350


195
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,630
I might be nothing.

196
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,520


197
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,420
That's why I'm going to try it.

198
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,210


199
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,900


200
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,910
I'm adhering to my own principles

201
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,320


202
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,510
by giving up on Xiao Tian's principles.

203
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,070
I'm still the same me from college.

204
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,060


205
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,240


206
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,390
The path I'm on now 
is the one I should be on!

207
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,310
All I can say is

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,170


209
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,159


210
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,470
I hope you won't get lost.

211
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,909
The path I forged on my own

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,690


213
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,909
is the right path.

214
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,810


215
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,710


216
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,870
Let me continue.

217
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,830
Before we could get married,

218
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,890


219
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,830
we had to complete

220
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,820


221
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,260


222
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,350
a pre-marriage mission,

223
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,980


224
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,990
which was picking Snow Lotus.

225
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,780
When we reached the foot of a mountain,

226
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,770


227
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,020


228
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,030
we ran into Never Dies and Dou Zi,

229
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,870


230
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,070
and a Bull Demon King.

231
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,100


232
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,110
He had two super large bull horns.

233
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,760


234
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,150
He looked so scary.

235
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,030
Then I thought at the time

236
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,020


237
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,390


238
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,510
that you would treat them as competitors.

239
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,790
But at the critical moment, you just,

240
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,780


241
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,030
swoosh,

242
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,850


243
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,330


244
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,310
you knocked Bull Demon King down.

245
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,470
You were super handsome,

246
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,460


247
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,060


248
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,070
super brave at that moment.

249
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,820


250
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,830
Does that ring a bell?

251
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,549
It's okay. Let me continue.

252
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,400


253
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,030
After we killed them,

254
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,020


255
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,640


256
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,750
we went straight to 
the bottom of the mountain.

257
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,220


258
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,230
The mountain was huge.

259
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,659


260
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,669
I'm telling you, the wind was so strong 
at that time.

261
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,340


262
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,350
You were stumbling and staggering

263
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,990
at the time, you know?

264
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,860


265
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,770


266
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,910
Remember that?

267
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,390
It's okay. I'll keep going.

268
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,070


269
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,870
Then we climbed a big mountain,

270
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,680


271
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,090


272
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,230
and it snowed a lot on top 
of that mountain.

273
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,100


274
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,190
You were like a little kid.

275
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,630
You grabbed a handful 
of snow mischievously

276
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,480


277
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,860


278
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,870
and threw it into

279
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,940


280
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,950
Never Dies' clothes.

281
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,350


282
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,510
Remember that?

283
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,630
Alright. I'll keep going.

284
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,540


285
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,350
Then we went to Love Flower Village.

286
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,370


287
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,390
We found that we needed

288
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,380


289
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,070
Love Flower Rings to get married.

290
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,950


291
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,030
And you came up with that idea.

292
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,090


293
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,550
We had to go to a place 
called Black Wind Cave,

294
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,400


295
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,780


296
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,790
to get the original version 
of Love Flower Rings.

297
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,460


298
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,470
Then we got into a fierce fight

299
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,620


300
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,630
with the monster.

301
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,670
Love Flower Ring?

302
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,510


303
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,280


304
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,670
Yes. This is the one.

305
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,980


306
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,230
Love Flower Ring.

307
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,300


308
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,430
Yes.

309

312
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,670
Got the Love Flower Rings.

313

314
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,030

315
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,140


316
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,230
There are some fragments 
of memories inside my head.

317
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,030
Is there a very important task

318
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,050


319
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,310

322
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,870

Zhang Hao Cheng, you're so cruel.

729
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,800


730
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,710
I, Wang Le Le,

731
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,700


732
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,730


733
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,910
will not die by the hand of a man.

734
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,310


735
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,350
I'm sorry.

736
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,230


737
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,390
I... I let you

738
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,840


739
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,750
down.

740
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,230


741
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,470
Le Le! Le Le!

742
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,870
Le Le!

743
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,780


744
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,430
Le Le? Le Le?

745
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,330


746
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,140


747
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,150
♫ The sea chants for the sky ♫

748
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,850


749
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,990
♫ With the raging of the waves ♫

750
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:46,900


751
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:46,910
♫ Make a wish on an ordinary night ♫

752
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,100


753
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,110
♫ Praying that the red eyes ♫

754
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,790
Come.

755
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,670


756
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,550
Cheers.

757
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,480


758
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:06,020


759
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:06,030
♫ I hold you with all my love ♫

760
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,330


761
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:11,350
♫ Can you hear my wish in the noise? ♫

762
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:19,380


763
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:19,390
♫ Perhaps you can understand it 
only if you are closer to me ♫

764
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,030
This feels so real.

765
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,800


766
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,420


767
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,430
Even the burn pain feels

768
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,470
exactly the same as in the real world.

769
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,260


770
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,780


771
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,030
Is this world called Pangu

772
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,120


773
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,310
really created by me?

774
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,310
I find it hard to believe that.

775
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,090


776
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,040


777
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,470
Oh, you.

778
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,720


779
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,030
Even with amnesia, 
you're still so narcissistic.

780
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,830
This feels like a dream.

781
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,580


782
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,700


783
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,950
How did I do it?

784
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,590
Because you are a genius.

785
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,450


786
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,790
Happy now?

787
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,520


788
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,150
Genius?

789
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,050


790
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,110
You're the second person 
to say I'm a genius.

791
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,900


792
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,560


793
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,790
Who is the first person then?

794
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,030
The first person

795
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,890


796
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,620


797
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,950
is my best friend.

798
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,150
What is your best friend

799
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,970


800
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,710
like in your eyes?

801
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,640


802
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,020


803
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,190
I don't know how to describe this feeling.

804
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,390
It's like

805
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,160


806
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,710
he's another me.

807
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,630


808
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,550
He possesses all of the qualities

809
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,460


810
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,470
that I lack.

811
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,330


812
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,670
Such as the meticulousness,

813
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,570


814
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,850


815
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,070
the composure,

816
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,150
and the courageous trait to fight.

817
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,950


818
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,070


819
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,230
How should I put it?

820
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,590
It's as if God sent him

821
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,660


822
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,390
to be my friend.

823
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,230


824
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,350
He just appeared in my life.

825
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,230


826
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,900


827
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,910
You said this perfect world called Pangu

828
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,800


829
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,030
was created by me,

830
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,430
but I can assure you that

831
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,170


832
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,070
half of the credit belongs to him.

833
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,770


834
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,070
Half of the credit.

835
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,940


836
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,120


837
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,390
I never thought
you would believe him that much.

838
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,580


839
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,830
I also believe

840
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,400


841
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,510
that he will come to find me.

842
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,850


843
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,990
He will get me out.

844
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,030
He will do everything he can

845
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,910


846
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,300
to get me out of here.

847
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,070


848
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,120


849
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,230
Okay. I believe that too.

850
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,030
Cheers.

851
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,860


852
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,080


853
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,390
Cheers.

854
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,870
I woke you up, didn't I?

855
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,700


856
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,310
I bought you some breakfast.

857
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,180


858
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,910
Get up and have some.

859
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,710


860
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,230
What treasure

861
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,310


862
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,430
did you put in that box?

863
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,450


864
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,150
You've been holding it

865
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,170


866
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,390
when you came out of the bar.

867
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,220


868
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,750


869
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,910
Take a look at it.

870
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,350
All these things

871
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,179


872
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,070
were from me.

873
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,030


874
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,060
I didn't think you would still have them.

875
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,000


876
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,469
What I experienced last night

877
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,280


878
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,429
made me come to my senses.

879
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,480


880
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,139


881
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,150
My years-long obsession 
with Zhang Hao Cheng

882
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,480


883
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,710
became suddenly clear to me.

884
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,770


885
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,990
That isn't love.

886
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,190


887
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,430
It's because his money and status

888
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,710
can give me the life I once wanted.

889
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,690


890
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,000


891
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,110
His promises and sweet words

892
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,150
were leading me.

893
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,080


894
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,110
In the end, he pushed me into the fire.

895
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,080


896
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:24,950


897
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,110
It's over.

898
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,260


899
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,390
It's like a beautiful bubble.

900
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,030
One poke and it bursts.

901
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,010


902
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,630


903
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,710
You know,

904
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,270
Now that everything is over,

905
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,200


906
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,590
I'm relieved.

907
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,550


908
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,950
These tiny, insignificant objects 
in this box

909
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,950
