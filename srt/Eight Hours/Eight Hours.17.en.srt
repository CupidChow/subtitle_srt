00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,000


187
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,270
You're just inferior in some ways.

188
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,120


189
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,470
But most of the time,

190
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,330


191
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,150
you are stronger than Xiao Tian.

192
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,080


193
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,030
A lot stronger.

194
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,020


195
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,230
Okay, Linda.

196
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,280


197
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,230
Thanks for your kind words.

198
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,140


199
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,790
However,

200
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,760


201
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,820
I just want to be alone now.

202
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,659


203
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,550
Okay?

204
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,530


205
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,070
Don't worry about me.

206
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,050


207
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,150
Another hot fix?

208
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,950


209
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,550
Something's not right.

210
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,370


211
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,270
Master!

212
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,100


213
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,150
Why is he coming right now?

214
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,070


215
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,790
How was I, Master?

216
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,770


217
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,030
Am I fast enough?

218
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,000


219
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,790
Can you teach me the Bagua Palm now?

220
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,760


221
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,950
I'm busy.

222
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,909


223
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,510
Not available.

224
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,430


225
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,310
What is this?

226
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240


227
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,670
It's rainbow coloured.

228
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,530


229
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,300
Are you making rainbow candy?

230
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,240


231
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,030
Why is it smoking?

232
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,010


233
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,310
What is in this pot?

234
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,080


235
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,750
Are you teaching me how to cook?

236
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,710


237
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,470
Is this beef?

238
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,320


239
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,470
Or chicken?

240
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,400


241
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,950
It smells nice.

242
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,770


243
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,870
Watch out!

244
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,740


245
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,550
Another failure!

246
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,560


247
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,550
Master, am I poisoned?

248
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,530


249
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,590
This is so powerful.

250
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,510


251
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,390
I'm feeling really cold.

252
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,340


253
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,309
My blood count is getting low.

254
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,299


255
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,510
[You're under lethal poison attack.]

256
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,600


257
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,750
[Life in danger, incurable.]

258
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,539


259
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,150
My blood count is draining really fast.

260
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,030


261
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,830
Master!

262
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,760


263
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,910
Master, where are you going?

264
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780


265
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,350
Master!

266
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,280


267
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,590
Master, look!

268
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,340


269
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,110
I'm dying! I'm dying!

270
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,190


271
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,990
Look! Look!

272
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,970


273
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,670
Where is Ah Xiu?

274
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,570


275
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,510
He disappeared in a flash!

276
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,530


277
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,150
Ah Xiu's master, what are you doing?

278
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,090


279
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,230
Hurry, give me a life potion!

280
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,220


281
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,950
Life potion?

282
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,990


283
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,990
Hurry!

284
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,970


285
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,190
Why do you need a life potion?

286
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,250


287
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,590
Are you poisoned?

288
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,500


289
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,870
Ah Xiu.

290
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,930


291
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,350
This poison is really strong.

292
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,230


293
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,270
I was dead before I knew it.

294
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,060


295
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,950
Well done, Master.

296
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,900


297
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,950
Give me all of your life potions.

298
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,890


299
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,790
Thank you.

300
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,630


301
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,710
No way, Master.

302
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,820


303
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,750
Are you trying to play hardball?

304
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,770


305
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,630
I can't.

306
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,590


307
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,830
This poison will continuously
harm my life.

308
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,620


309
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,350
Then it's the same like Ah Xiu's name.

310
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,420


311
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,310
It never dies or ends itself.

312
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,170


313
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,990
Where are you going, Master?

314
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,890


315
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,350
Are you looking for a cure?

316
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,190


317
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,830
Normal players can't cure me.

318
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,760


319
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,190
I must find the Master Healer.

320
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,060


321
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,430
I see.

322
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,310


323
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,950
This Master Healer

324
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,820


325
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,620


326
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,670
sounds like a high-level mission.

327
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,270
How about this, Dou Zi?

328
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,320


329
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,790
You shouldn't follow us.

330
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,760


331
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,030
This journey will be a dangerous one.

332
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,990


333
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,070
You might get hurt.

334
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,170


335
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,220
Why are you turning this
into a heroic series?

336
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,340


337
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,310
If you can cure it,

338
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,230


339
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,030
you can kill yourself.

340
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,830


341
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,470
That's right.

342
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,590


343
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,990
Master, why didn't I think of that?

344
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,050


345
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,310
Let me help you out.

346
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,400


347
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,190
Die,

348
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,110


349
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,550
and you'll recover immediately.

350
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400


351
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,150
Don't be afraid, Master.

352
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,900


353
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,590
I'll be quick.

354
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,660


355
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,270
It's just a hit.

356
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,380


357
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,190
No, I can't die!

358
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,340


359
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,030
Ah Xiu!

360
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,930


361
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,150
Are you alright?

362
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,300


363
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,910
I'm fine.

364
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,850


365
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,710
I want to earn the full level achievement.

366
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,620


367
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,550
Don't wreck it for me!

368
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,590

541
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,070
Normal crabs can't be compared with it.

543
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,030
That's right.

545

Everyone is different.

549
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,510
Some people think that they're king crabs.

550
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,410


551
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,750
But in the end,

552
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,630


553
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,190
they're merely normal crabs.

554
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,140


555
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,390
That's true.

556
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,270


557
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,470
They taste different too.

558
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,370


559
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,910
In my heart, you're the one and only.

560
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,800


561
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,870
No one can be compared to you.

562
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,810


563
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,390
Is that so?

564
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,260


565
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,950
Do you know that I feel like

566
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,829


567
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,030
I've broken a piece of
handcrafted piece of art?

568
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,910


569
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,069
After Mr. Ye's mishap,

570
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,930


571
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,630
I have tried plenty of ways to salvage

572
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,720


573
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,589
all his products

574
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,710


575
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,710
and designs.

576
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,630


577
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,069
But in fact,

578
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,980


579
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,310
I was the one

580
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,240


581
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,940
who destroyed it all.

582
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,850


583
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,710
I'm sorry.

584
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,610


585
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,790
Please excuse me.

586
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,690


587
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,190
Hello, buddy.

588
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,110


589
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,230
Can you transfer RMB5,000 to my phone?

590
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,170


591
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,630
Thanks.

592
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,550


593
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,910
It's an emergency.

594
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,740


595
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,110
I'm giving a treat.

596
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,990


597
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,470
Okay.

598
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,350


599
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,630
Thank you so much.

600
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,600


601
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,190
Big brother.

602
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:09,990


603
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,190
Big brother.

604
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,040


605
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,580
I need your help.

606
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,470


607
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,190
My family

608
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,000


609
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,590
arranged a blind date for me today.

610
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,430


611
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,070
I like her very much.

612
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,890


613
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,310
But I'm a bit problematic.

614
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,110


615
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,190
When I like a girl,

616
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,940


617
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,950
I would have difficulties talking to her.

618
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,850


619
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,230
Can you spare me some help

620
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,940


621
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,870
and cooperate with me?

622
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,890


623
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,670
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

624
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,580


625
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,350
Brother!

626
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:33,290


627
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,550
Brother.

628
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,530


629
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,990
Don't leave, big brother.

630
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,820


631
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,270
I can only depend on you now.

632
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,200


633
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,870
Help me.

634
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,780


635
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,310
Please help me out, big brother.

636
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,190


637
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,100
Brother.

638
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,150


639
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,110
I like her, I really like her.

640
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,040


641
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,430
I really like her, please.

642
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,350


643
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
Don't give up on me.

644
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,640


645
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,150
I'm begging you.

646
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,060


647
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,190
Brother.

648
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,150


649
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,670
Brother!

650
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,770


651
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,350
Master.

652
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,110
Dou Zi and I used up our savings

653
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,190


654
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,430
to buy life potions for you.

655
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,280


656
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,510
You must use them wisely.

657
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,430


658
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,190
Thanks.

659
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,130


660
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,870
By the way,

661
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,650


662
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,750
I used my personal savings too.

663
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,700


664
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,310
How dare you speak about it?

665
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,410


666
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,950
You hid 20 taels from me.

667
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,920


668
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,910
It's just 20 taels.

669
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,030


670
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,630
Did you find the Master Healer?

671
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,750


672
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,950
Where is he?

673
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,910


674
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,710
I've asked around.

675
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,710


676
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,350
The NPC told me

677
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,250


678
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,310
that the Master Healer

679
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,400


680
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,910
roams around the world without plans.

681
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,820


682
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,350
But someone saw him
at the Love Flower Village.

683
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,240


684
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,510
What does he look like?

685
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,290


686
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,190
The NPC said he

687
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,100


688
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,350
has white, long hair

689
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,130


690
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,670
with a heavenly vibe and benevolence.

691
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,640


692
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,270
But we met every NPC

693
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,380


694
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,550
at the Love Flower Village.

695
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,550


696
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,670
There's no one like that.

697
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,660


698
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,190
I guess we have to go to
the Love Flower Village again.

699
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,040


700
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,790
Sure, Master.

701
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,890


702
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,380
I'll lead the way.

703
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,400


704
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,910
Let's go, Dou Zi.

705
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,630


706
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,670
Wait!

707
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,550
Tell me.

708
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,430


709
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,030
Why did you keep so much money from me?

710
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,940


711
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,750
Don't try to fool me.

712
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,540


713
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,510
Your birthday is coming up.

714
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,480


715
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,310
I know that you like the new costume

716
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,380


717
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,060
with flying dragon and dancing phoenix.

718
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,000


719
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,740
I wanted to surprise you.

720
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,680


721
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,550
But now...

722
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,480


723
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,230
I'm sorry.

724
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,140


725
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,670
Don't try to be witty in front of me.

726
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,580


727
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,620
Your money here and the outside world

728
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,560


729
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,790
are all under my care.

730
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,770


731
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,790
Of course.

732
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,740

919
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,590
They're smitten by me.

920
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,610


921
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,270
They even stalked me here.

922

923
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,950
Mr. Lin?

924
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:09,850


925
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,910
Bai Wei?

927
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,550
Smitten?

928
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,440


929
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,790
Are you Lu Hu's fan, Mr. Lin?

930
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,630


931
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,420


932
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,590
You two knew each other?

933
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,390
Who is this, Lin Lin?

934
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,280


935
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,350
I don't know him.

936
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,410


937
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,230
My name is Lu Hu.

938

939
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,380
Lu Hu (Land Rover)?
I'm Lan Sheng (Range Rover).

940
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,290


941
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,150
You don't know me?

942
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,010


943
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,190
Then I have a song for you.

944
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,960


945
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,070
♫ I listen slowly ♫

946
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,120


947
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,870
Stop.

948
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,960


949
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,780
Snow Falls.

950
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,670


951
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,550
It's a well-known song.

952
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,520


953
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,390
Can you sing something new?

954
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,310


955
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,790
Bai Wei is here?

956
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,690


957
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,550
Is he your boyfriend?

958
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,440


959
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,430
No.

960
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,140


961
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,870
So it's a blind date?

962
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,710


963
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,350
As Bai Wei's close friend,

964
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,170


965
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,350
I have to look out for her.

966
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,210


967
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,950
Why don't we join them, Xiao Lin Lin?

968
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,790


969
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,550
[Close friend?]

970
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,470


971
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,070
[What do you want, Zhang Yun Er?]

972
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,020


973
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,110
[I'm down in my luck today.]

974
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,080


975
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,390
[I shouldn't have come out.]

976
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,300


977
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,660
[I wonder how Ye Tian is now.]

978
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,540


979
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,350
Almost there!

980
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,300


981
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,350
Stop!

982
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,450


983
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,470
Let me down.

984
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,300


985
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,750
Let me down, let me down!

986
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,670


987
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,470
What is it?

988
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,400


989
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,320
What's the matter, Master?

990
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,470


991
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,270
Have a drink.

992
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,420


993
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,670
Give him a life potion now.

994
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,730


995
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,950
It's the last bottle.

996
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,070


997
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,110
Last bottle?

998
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,020


999
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,870
Why didn't you save up?

1000
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,680


1001
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,310
You drank all of them by yourself.

1002
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,180


1003
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,190
That's not right, Master.

1004
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,020


1005
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,230
How did

1006
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,300


1007
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,790
the village attract so many people?

1008
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,750


1009
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,590
They're all women as well.

1010
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,600


1011
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,870
Let's go.

1012
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,690


1013
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,820
[Your blood count is too low.]

1014
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,900


1015
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,950
[You are in a critical condition
and need immediate treatment.]

1016
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,920


1017
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,310
My blood count is getting low.

1018
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,140


1019
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,990
We must act faster.

1020
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,850


1021
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,470
If I can't catch up,

1022
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,400


1023
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,910
I might die even before

1024
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,820


1025
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,270
I get to see the Master Healer.

1026
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,060


1027
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,900
Dou Zi, listen.

1028
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,860


1029
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,870
You'll stay here and take care of Master.

1030
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,730


1031
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,310
I'll look for medicine.

1032
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,890


1033
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,710
I know there are many women there,
but you don't have to act so obviously.

1034
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,590


1035
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,230
[You'll get a hard time when we go back.]

1036
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,070


1037
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,900
Are you alright?

1038
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,780


1039
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,310
What are you doing, Master?

1040
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,290


1041
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm looking for herbs.

1042
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,390


1043
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,750
You really like Bai Wei, Mr. Lu Hu?

1044
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,610


1045
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,310
Really...

1046
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,210


1047
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,790
Average.

1048
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,770


1049
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,660
Then you should give up.

1050
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,580


1051
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,910
Big brother, I thought
we're together on this.

1052
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,770


1053
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,830
I have difficulties speaking to women.

1054
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,650


1055
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,150
You have to help me.

1056
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,990


1057
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,550
If you can't even say

1058
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,620


1059
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,190
directly to her that you like her,

1060
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,140


1061
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,670
this relationship will be meaningless.

1062
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,590


1063
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,750
She deserves better.

1064
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,690


1065
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,430
Xiao Lin Lin, you shouldn't be nosy.

1066

1067

1071
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,910
I wrote a song in the washroom just now.

Waiter!

1093
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,090
♫ How do I keep you with me? ♫

1094
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,160
♫ I will stay ♫

1095
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,040
♫ You are my only desire ♫

1096
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,780
♫ Finding love, be my boy ♫

1097
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,750
♫ How can I find love? ♫

1098
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,820
♫ I am your love ♫

1099
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,520
♫ How do I keep you with me? ♫

1100
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,350
♫ I will stay ♫

1101
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,300
♫ Give you all my love ♫

1102
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,930
♫ Love you hard, I am your harbor ♫

1103
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,820
Bai Wei, if we're not destined
to be a couple,

1104
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,650


1105
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,230
when this song's released,

1106
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,100


1107
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,870
please give me a like

1108
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,820


1109
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,550
and double press 666 for me.

1110
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,480


1111
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,470
Sure, thank you.

1112
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,420


1113
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,110
Help me out, will you?

1114
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,210


1115
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,870
I haven't paid the bill.

1116
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,920


1117
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,740
Please pay it for me.

1118
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,660


1119
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,030
What's all this?

1120
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,030


1121
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,790
It's fun to heal people.

1122
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,570


1123
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,030
But it's difficult to level up.

1124
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,110


1125
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,630
We can't get experience points
by killing monsters.

1126
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,560


1127
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,910
We have to look for patients.

1128
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,870


1129
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,270
How could there be so many patients?

1130
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,320


1131
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,070
That's right.

1132
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,040


1133
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,110
Besides, the direct level up mission

1134
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,840


1135
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,190
is super weird.

1136
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,300


1137
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,070
They want us to find... Who is that?

1138
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,700


1139
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,390
The Master Healer?

1140
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,310


1141
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,270
I've waited for three days now.

1142
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,320


1143
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,750
But I never saw that person.

1144
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,720


1145
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,270
It's an emergency! Emergency!

1146
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,360


1147
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,350
Hold up, dear ladies.

1148
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,320


1149
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,150
Please hold up, dear ladies!

1150
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,230


1151
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,830
Dear ladies.

1152
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,740


1153
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,390
There's an emergency.

1154
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,450


1155
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,070
Dear...

1156
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,160


1157
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,470
What is it?

1158
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,350


1159
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,870
Dear ladies.

1160
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,740


1161
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,430
Someone's poisoned.

1162
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,320


1163
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,990
Please spare me some life potions.

1164
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,800


1165
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,110
Just one bottle from each of you.

1166
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,920


1167
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,470
Who's poisoned?

1168
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,490


1169
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,350
Where is that person?

1170
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,390


1171
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,510
Who is it?

1172
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,580


1173
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,550
Where is that person?

1174
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,650


1175
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,910
He's a really handsome guy.

1176
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,680


1177
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,750
Right there.

1178
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,520


1179
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,220
Mr. Lin, Ms. Zhang.

1180
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,040


1181
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,590
I shouldn't disturb your date any further.

1182
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,670


1183
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,270
I'll take my leave now.

1184
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,160


1185
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,030
Bai Wei, let me take you home.

1186
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,810


1187
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,590
No, it's alright!

1188
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,630


1189
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,100
Goodbye.

1190
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,030


1191
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,310
Bai Wei, I want to speak
to you in private.

1192
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,320


1193
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,870
Lin Lin, if it's about work,

1194
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,750


1195
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,110
you can assign it to Wei Wei tomorrow.

1196
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,910


1197
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,510
Don't tire her out.

1198
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,380


1199
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,510
I shall not disturb you two.

1200
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,470


1201
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,070
Goodbye.

1202
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:33,960


1203
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,150
Lin Lin! We're not done with our dinner!

1204
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,210


1205
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,990
I'm full.

1206
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,050


1207
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,630
Then let's go to the circus.

1208
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,500


1209
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,230
Can you give me a chance?

1210
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,110


1211
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,460
Let me have a fair competition
with Bai Wei.

1212
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,380


1213
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,590
No.

1214
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,480


1215
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,230
I want to get a chance for myself too.

1216
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,110


1217
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,110
Bai Wei.

1218
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:01,920


1219
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,030
I want to say that

1220
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,920


1221
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,270
I really like you.

1222
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,090


1223
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,150
I know you might not feel the same.

1224
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,040


1225
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,110
But it's okay.

1226
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,060


1227
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,110
I just wish that you won't
reject me constantly.

1228
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,020


1229
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,380
At least let me have some time with you.

1230
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,260


1231
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,750
Mr. Lin, I...

1232
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,640


1233
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,790
Are you scared?

1234
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,790


1235
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,790
Why should I?

1236
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,650


1237
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,790
You're scared that you might fall for me.

1238
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,670


1239
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,990
I actually feel

1240
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,830


1241
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,270
strangely familiar when I'm around you.

1242
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,200


1243
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,550
That familiarity makes me think that

1244
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,280


1245
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,950
I've known you for a very long time.

1246
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,810


1247
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,910
I don't believe in affinity before.

1248
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,710


1249
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,190
Until I met you.

1250
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,170


1251
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,110
I realised that

1252
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,000


1253
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,150
affinity does exist.

1254
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,100


1255
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,510
So,

1256
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,220


1257
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,950
I don't want to

1258
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,030


1259
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,390
give up on our affinity this easily.

1260
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,190


1261
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,950
[But the one who is familiar to you,]

1262
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,100


1263
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,070
[who knows you well,]

1264
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,140


1265
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,950
[and shares an affinity
with you is Ye Tian.]

1266
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,960


1267
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,550
Bai Wei.

1268
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,410


1269
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,870
I hope you can give me a chance

1270
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,730


1271
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,630
to take good care of you.

1272
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,520


1273
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,870
Mr. Lin, my ride is here.

1274
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,940


1275
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,670
I'll talk to you next time.

1276
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,710


1277
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,750
I'll go now. Goodbye.

1278
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,660


1279
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,190
Let's go, sir.

1280
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,600


1281
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,670
Bai Wei.

1282
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,830
Please consider

1283
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,570


1284
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,270
what I've just said.

1285
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,080


1286
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,390
Okay.

1287
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,390


1288
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,510
I'm sorry, I need to go.

1289
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,480


1290
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:31,950
Goodbye.

1291
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:31,800


1292
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,670
Goodbye.

1293
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,580


1294
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,950
Wish me luck, Xiao Tian.

1295
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,860


1296
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,950
High experience points!

1297
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,010


1298
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,150
What poison is this?

1299
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,190


1300
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,590
Dear ladies.

1301
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,740


1302
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,470
Please don't cut the queue.

1303
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,620


1304
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,670
Don't cut the queue!

1305
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,820


1306
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,310
Let's do it one by one.

1307
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,240


1308
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,670
But remember the condition.

1309
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,460


1310
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,070
One bottle of life potion
for one treatment.

1311
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,020


1312
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,350
Sure.

1313
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,170


1314
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,590
I have levelled up!

1315
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,650


1316
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,949


1317
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,150
I'll treat him ten times.

1318
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,750
These ten bottles should be enough.

1319
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,820


1320
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,030
But why do I think that Master

1321
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,130


1322
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,900
looks like a laboratory white mice?

1323
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,750
Shut it!

1324
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,630


1325
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,469
I'm receiving treatment!

1326
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560


1327
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,630
Why are you in a daze?

1328
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,250


1329
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,179


1330
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,230
Continue.

1331
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,870
Don't learn from him.

1332
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,880


1333
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,710
Don't worry.

1334
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:46,780


1335
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,830
I won't.

1336
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,690


1337
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,989
Unless if you're poisoned.

1338
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,030


1339
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,429
I'm just joking.

1340
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,260


1341
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,260


1342
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,550
Just joking.

1343
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,429
I'm going offline now.

1344
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,460


1345
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,540


1346
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,950
Uncle.

1347
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,230


1348
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,430
Uncle.

1349
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,990


1350
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,310
I found him!

1351
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,830
Didn't you say you couldn't
pinpoint his location?

1352
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,610


1353
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,630


1354
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,790
A colleague of mine

1355
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,950
saw him at Autumn City.

1356
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,790


1357
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,790
He said he's going to
the Love Flower Village.

1358
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,560


1359
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,090


1360
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,270
Are you sure he's Ye Tian?

1361
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,590
He saw him in person.

1362
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,380


1363
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,590
Love Flower Village?

1364
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,400


1365
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,400


1366
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,550
Rather it be wrong than it to run.

1367
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:21,900


1368
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:21,950
Yes.

1369
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,510


1370
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,670
I will hire the professionals.

1371
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,550


1372
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,710
Hurry.

1373
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,310


1374
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,510
Yes, Sir.

1375
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,390
Come and have a seat.

1376
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,050


1377
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,560


1378
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,790
Yi Da.

1379
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,350


1380
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,550
You impressed me this time.

1381
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,920


1382
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,230
Well done.

1383
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,390
It's pure luck.

1384
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,220


1385
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,320


1386
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,590
By the way,

1387
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,740


1388
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,950
what is the name of the colleague
who told you

1389
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,230


1390
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,430
Ye Tian's whereabouts?

1391
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,160


1392
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,310
Uncle.

1393
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,070
He's just a

1394
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,090


1395
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,630
close colleague of mine.

1396
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,510


1397
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,460
Don't make it hard for him.

1398
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,310


1399
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,900


1400
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,070
I promise.

1401
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,940


1402
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,950
He won't think much of it.

1403
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,070
He won't think about Ye Tian.

1404
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080


1405
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,110
What do you mean?

1406
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,920


1407
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,630
I was just asking.

1408
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,500


1409
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,770


1410
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,990
Of course.

1411
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,340


1412
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,470
It's better if you can

1413
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,160


1414
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,350
give me a guarantee.

1415
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,150


1416
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,350
I guarantee.

1417
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,510


1418
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,710
I'll guarantee with my life.

1419
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,700


1420
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,910
Master, this should be enough.

1421
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,460


1422
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,630
Master.

1423
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,040


1424
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,230
Have a bottle of potion.

1425
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,310
I smell like medicine.

1426
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,020


1427
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:51,830


1428
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,990
It's all done now.

1429
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,100


1430
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,230
Let's go.

1431
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,630


1432
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,710
Remember the target?

1433
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,140


1434
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,310
Yes.

1435
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,480


1436
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,670
Move out!

1437
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,360


1438
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,550
Master.

1439
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860


1440
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,990
Where do you think the Master Healer is?

1441
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,190
Handsome boy!

1442
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,250


1443
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,310
Handsome boy, do you need
our treatment tomorrow?

1444
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,300


1445
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,910
We have enough life potions.

1446
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,830


1447
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,880


1448
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,910
Thank you, dear ladies.

1449
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,710
Thank you, everyone.

1450
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,600


1451
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,190
Goodbye.

1452
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,040


1453
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,680


1454
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,710
Master, do you remember
the formula of the poison?

1455
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,960


1456
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,180
This formula has full potential
for us to earn big money.

1457
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,410


1458
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,470
If you sell this at Autumn City,

1459
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,960


1460
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,270
you will be

1461
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,830


1462
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,030
the richest guy in Pangu
in less than a week.

1463
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,530


1464
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,670
Shut up.

1465
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,680


1466
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,870
You must not tell anyone about today.

1467
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,260


1468
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,590
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

1469
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,340


1470
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,630
I won't let Dou Zi expose it too.

1471
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,470
According to them,

1472
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,260


1473
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,030
the Love Flower Village doesn't have

1474
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,390
an NPC named Master Healer.

1475
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,150


1476
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,810


1477
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,190
The Master Healer must live in seclusion.

1478
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,450


1479
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,540
We can ask the village head.

1480
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:12,890


1481
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,110
Village head?

1482
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,110
All NPC names

1483
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,790
in the Love Flower Village

1484
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,640


1485
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,650


1486
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,830
is in his records.

1487
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:17,930


1488
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,110
Let's go.

1489
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,320


1490
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,470
My dear disciple.

1491
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,150
Master.

1492
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:28,960


1493
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,310
It's you.

1494
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,220


1495
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,080


1496
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,260
My dear disciple.

1497
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,960


1498
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,150
Master, this is my Grand Master?

1499
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,750
The village head has another identity

1500
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,750
which is the sect leader
of Freedom Sect, Freedom.

1501
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,620


1502
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,900


1503
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,910
When you marry Dou Zi,

1504
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,830
you will know about it too.

1505
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,790


1506
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,920


1507
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,230
We mustn't judge a book by its cover.

1508
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,610


1509
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,870
Hurry.

1510
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,470


1511
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,830
Master.

1512
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,910
Do you know where the Master Healer is?

1513
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,620


1514
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,870
Master Healer? Master Healer?

1515
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,840


1516
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,100
Who is that?

1517
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,060


1518
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,270
Fine.

1519
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,030


1520
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,330


1521
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,630
Excuse us.

1522
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,480


1523
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,710
Wait.

1524
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,040


1525
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,350
If it's someone else,

1526
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,230


1527
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,420
I might not have told them easily.

1528
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,610


1529
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,830
But you're my disciple.

1530
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,490


1531
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,670
You're eligible to know my biggest secret.

1532
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,910


1533
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,110
I wish the heaven and earth
as my cauldron,

1534
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,150
all titles unite upon the Master Healer.

1535
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,940


1536
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,790
Yes, I'm the Master Healer.

1537
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,800


1538
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,510
The Master Healer is me.

1539
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,230


1540
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,790
No way. Aren't you Freedom?

1541
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,600


1542
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,750


1543
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,990
So obscure.

1544
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,130


1545
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,510
Can't Freedom become
the Master Healer?

1546
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,020


1547
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,150
People laugh at my craziness.

1548
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,390
I laugh at their ignorance.

1549
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,080


1550
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,360


1551
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,630
Listen to me, Master.

1552
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,910


1553
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,110
This fellow must be a trickster.

1554
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,150


1555
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,310
Please help me get rid
of the poison, Master.

1556
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,560


1557
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,710
My dear disciple.

1558
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,950
You are being attacked by a rare poison.

1559
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,930


1560
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,870
How are you still alive?

1561
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,880


1562
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,260


1563
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,550
You're really talented.

1564
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,170


1565
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,350
I'm not confident enough

1566
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,940


1567
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,110
to say that I can cure you.

1568
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,940


1569
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,110
Never Dies.

1570
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,670


1571
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,710
Do you have money?

1572
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,890


1573
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,110
Money? What money?

1574
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,150
Should I say, healers must be benevolent.

1575
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,000


1576
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,620


1577
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,790
I should treat you free of charge.

1578
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,390
You'll know if you look at him now.

1579
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,340


1580
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,350
But the herbs for your treatment
are costly.

1581
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,380


1582
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,750
If you don't spill some cash,

1583
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,730


1584
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,520


1585
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,670
your master is going to die here.

1586
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,630


1587
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,670
This is...

1588
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,440


1589
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,750
I think I have to

1590
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,310
climb mountains and cross seas.

1591
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,410


1592
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,430
Don't take all of them!

1593
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,460


1594
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,350
Master, you left something behind.

1595

I'll help you get rid of the poison now.

He's flying!

1604
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,350
[You have received treatment
from the Master Healer.]

Master!

1611
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,550
You're already cured, Master?

That's really fast!
