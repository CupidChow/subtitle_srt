172
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,470
He may also be the masked guy.

174
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,790
Impossible.

You're wrong.

178
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,420
Ye Tian won't be in Pangu.

179

180
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,030
I might be wrong.

181

182
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,070
But I'm happy to be.

183
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,950


184
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,350
Ask everyone to look for him.

188
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,060

190
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,190
Turn them over.

192
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,390

We must find him!

207
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,750


208
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,110

210
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,310
Everything

212
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,070
is not coincidental, right?

213
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,960


214
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,590
Qixi Festival, Qixi Festival.

218
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,270
We don't have a plan up until now.

219
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,120


220
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,380
My gosh.

224
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,750
If we want to win,

226
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,270

228
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,750
What about couple costumes?

230
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,910
Tacky.

232
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,350
Couple playground?

234
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,550
Normal.

238
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,700
Why so anxious?

239
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,630


240
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,350
You're so impatient.

241
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,250


242
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,710

249
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,070
think about the question

as game creators.

251
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,840


252

254
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,150
What is the most well-known story

255
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,060


256
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,870
The Cowherd and Weaver Girl

258
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,030
That's it.

and let them build their own magpie bridge

267
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360


268
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,750

Don't cry, my dear.

727
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,710
You mean

728
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,620


729
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,540
you found out at first that

730
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,650


731
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,190
something was wrong inside Pangu?

732
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,180


733
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,190
You investigated on your own

734
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,370


735
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,230
and by chance,

736
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,210


737
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,740
your clues fall on me.

738
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,810


739
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,590
Yes.

740
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,550


741
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,910
But I didn't know that

742
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,720


743
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,390
the users' personal safety is at stake

744
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,350


745
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,750
because of that error code

746
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,820


747
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,620
2021.

748
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,590


749
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,310
And your analysis is correct.

750
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,310


751
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,070
If we alert the police,

752
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,990


753
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,830
Zhang Hao Cheng will destroy the server

754
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,880


755
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,110
and evidence to save himself.

756
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,190


757
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,100
If that's the case,

758
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,030


759
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,350
it will also implicate users of Pangu

760
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,340


761
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,760


762
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,950
who have now been infected
with the 2021 virus.

763
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,150
So,

764
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,000


765
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,910
one of you stays in here

766
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,900


767
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,670
and another stays out there

768
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,670


769
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,510
to carry out your plans

770
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,500


771
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,630
in order to let Ye Tian

772
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620


773
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,610


774
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,510
enter the core team of the group
as soon as possible

775
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,540
and solve this problem.

776
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,680


777
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:41,860


778
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,870
Alright.

779
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,990
Before you solve this problem,

780
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,970


781
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,220


782
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,230
I'll send the members of Heavenly Society

783
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,170


784
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,180
to look for users who're
infected with the 2021 virus

785
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,390
and protect them.

786
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,340


787
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,230
Thank you.

788
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,120


789
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,070
Ding Xiang.

790
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,070


791
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,470
I have a question.

792
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,570


793
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,380


794
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,390
Go ahead.

795
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,540


796
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,550
How did you confirm that Ye Tian

797
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,510
is this masked guy beside me?

798
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,460


799
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,310
Intuition.

800
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,260


801
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,870
You might not know about this.

802
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,860


803
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,820
But Ye Tian and I've known each other
since little

804
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,760


805
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,950
because of the collaboration
between Ding and Ye.

806
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,910


807
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,260


808
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,270
On my seventh birthday,

809
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,460


810
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,470
you were there too.

811
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,790
Our families were talking about us

812
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,890


813
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,790
getting engaged.

814
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,770


815
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,590
Have you really forgotten?

816
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,520


817
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,870
I...

818
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,790


819
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,390
It's fine.

820
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,290


821
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,670
It's been so long.

822
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,720


823
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,620
It's okay if you forget about it.

824
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,500


825
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,630
We can continue what's left off

826
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,560


827
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,670
on our own.

828
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,640


829
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,100


830
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,110
By the way, Bai Wei,

831
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,390
everything that I had done in the game

832
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,380


833
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,670
were all for fun.

834
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,620


835
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,940


836
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,030
I have my own boundaries in reality.

837
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,830
Besides,

838
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,710


839
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,230
I'm not interested in Ye Tian.

840
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,130


841
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,710
You won't stand a chance even if you're.

842
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,510


843
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm starting to admire you.

844
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,060


845
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,470
Thanks.

846
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,400


847
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,310
I'll go now.

848
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,200


849
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,110
Contact me if something comes up.

850
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,070


851
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,590
I don't know if you believe me.

852
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,530


853
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,790
I can't remember

854
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,700


855
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,430
everything she said.

856
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,370


857
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,790
I'm a late bloomer.

858
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,850


859
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,870
In my heart,

860
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,820


861
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,750
I only remember you.

862
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,780


863
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,070
I don't believe you.

864
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,010


865
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,820


866
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,830
Don't!

867
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,420


868
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,430
I'm not lying!

869
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,070
I believe you.

870
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,970


871
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,730


872
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,750
For an adorable, beautiful, smart girl

873
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,620


874
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,630
with high EQ

875
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,660


876
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,670
and IQ like me,

877
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,620


878
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,630
it's normal for you

879
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,350
to remember me.

880
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,310


881
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,630
What a narcissist.

882
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,510


883
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,020


884
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,030
I learnt it from you.

885
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,750
I taught you nothing.

886
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,640


887
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,070
Why don't we sit up there for a while?

888
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,980


889
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,990
Make way! Make way!

890
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,990


891
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,030
She's my master's wife.

892
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,080


893
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,670
She's my master's wife.

894
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,740


895
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,470
She's my master's wife.

896
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,560


897
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,790
For today's test,

898
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,590


899
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,150
Zhang Yun Er proposes

900
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,890


901
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,070
to organize a fun fair for the ladies.

902
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,910


903
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,910
Bai Wei proposes to

904
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,900


905
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,550
initiate a magpie bridge miracle
in the main city.

906
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,510


907
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,030
Both are unique in their own way.

908
