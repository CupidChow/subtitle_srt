00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:22,940


724
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,630


725
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,870
You're crazy.

726
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,470
No.

727
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,290


728
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,990
Normally, when a player
is disconnected by force,

729
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,090


730
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,630
the system will deem it as offline.

731
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,730


732
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,230
They will then wake up in the cabin.

733
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,210


734
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,630
But my account

735
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,720


736
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,430
is bugged.

737
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,410


738
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,750
If I become separated...

739
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,770


740
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,510
You'll die.

741
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,550


742
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,950
There will be a small probability event

743
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,010


744
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,870
where the system misjudges

745
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,770


746
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,550


747
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,590
my disconnect by logic.

748
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,390
The small probability in the logic

749
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,420


750
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,540
is my chance to return to the real world.

751
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,500


752
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,430
No, that is not a chance.

753
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,530


754
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,230
You're making a bet with your life.

755
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,290


756
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,110
I won't let you.

757
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,210


758
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,710
But it's worth it.

759
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,610


760
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,630
I won't...

761
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,730


762
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,230
For you, everything is worth it.

763
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,330


764
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,150
I'm not going to let 
anything happen to you.

765
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,140


766
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,510
Even if it's a minute possibility,

767
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,470


768
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm willing to give it a try.

769
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,700


770
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,470
No, I won't let you do it.

771
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,540


772
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,390
I just have to jump.

773
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,490


774
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,590
No...

775
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,460


776
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,750
This is the only chance.

777
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,700


778
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,070
No, I won't...

779
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,170


780
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,790
I won't let you.

781
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,780


782
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,550
Ye Tian.

783
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,350


784
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,030
Ye Tian!

785
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,960


786
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,870
Where am I?

787
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,720


788
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,030
It's really me.

789
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,970


790
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,630
I did it.

791
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,570


792
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,190
[No, my consciousness is not stable.]

793
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,020


794
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,750
Mr. Ye?

795
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,820


796
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,110
Mr. Ye.

797
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,170


798
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,630
Mr. Ye is awake. Get help!

799
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,680


800
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,820
Hurry. Take Mr. Ye back to the room.

801
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,920


802
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,150
Leave me be. Let me go.

803
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,000


804
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,310
Go to Greenwood Lane, Haohan Street.

805
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,060


806
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,780
Go to Greenwood Lane, Haohan Street.

807
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,810


808
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,630
Someone needs saving at Greenwood Lane!

809
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,570


810
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,870
Mr. Ye.

811
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,570


812
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,070
Mr. Ye!

813
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,140


814
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,430
Are you okay?

815
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,530


816
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,470
Mr. Ye!

817
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,570


818
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,140
Mr. Ye!

819
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,240


820
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,030
Mr. Ye!

821
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,880


822
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,790
Mr. Ye!

823
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:47,750


824
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,380


825
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,390
Dr. Wang.

826
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,550
Check over there with Xiao Qin.

827
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,420


828
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,950
Okay.

829
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,050


830
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,390
Mr. Ye!

831
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:50,490


832
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,910
Mr. Ye!

833
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,000


834
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,910
Mr. Ye!

835
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,740


836
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,710
Mr. Ye!

837
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,660


838
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,110
Atenolol.

839
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,030


840
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,110
It's used to treat irregular heart beat.

841
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,070


842
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,660
It should help Bai Wei.

843
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,610


844
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,740
Mr. Ye! Mr. Ye is here.

845
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,800


846
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,750
He's here!

847
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,840


848
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,630
Mr. Ye!

849

852
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:18,670
Quick!

853
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:18,760


854
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,150
Mr. Ye!

855
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,240


856

Come down here.

857

858
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,950
Hold on.

859

860
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,470
[Mr. Lin, Mr. Ye is awake.]

861
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,430


862
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,750
Little Lin Lin! Where are you going?

863
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,700


864
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,590
Tell me where.

865
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,460


866
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,390
Okay.

867
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,360


868
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,790
I'll be right there.

869
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,690


870
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,590
That looks like Ye Tian.

871
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,480


872
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,710
Bai Wei!

873
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,570


874
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,510
Bai Wei!

875
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,410


876

Ye Tian, I am here.

Ye Tian...

882
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,750
I'm here.

883

Bai Wei!

Bai Wei.

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,230
Wake up.

Sorry, I came late.

You're awake.

904
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,750
It's really you.

905
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,550


906
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,390

He went to buy beer.

1132
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,030
Why did he go himself?

1133
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,070


1134
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,870
We can get it delivered.

1136
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,140

You're right.

1138

I'll look for him.

1140
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,150
What's wrong?

1141
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,080


1142
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,790
Zhao Jia Liang, 
I can't remain here further.

1144
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,670
My consciousness
is about to return to Pangu.

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,710


1146
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,590
Return to Pangu?

1147
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,520


1148
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,550
Didn't you successfully log out?

1149
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,380


1150
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,950
I don't have time to explain.

1151
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,580


1152
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,410


1153
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,550
I've already been seen.

1154
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,030
If people from Celeste Group find out,

1155
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,070


1156
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,470
they will surely investigate the matter.

1157
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,320


1158
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,830
Promise me.

1159

1160
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,750
Don't let Bai Wei appear at the scene.

1161
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,660


1162
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,390
Be careful of Zhang Hao Cheng.

1163
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,130


1164
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,950
Make sure Bai Wei is safe.

1165
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,870


1166
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,910
Got it?

1167
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,830


1168
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,350
Now go.

1169
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,210


1170
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,750
Look after her for me.

1171
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,670


1172
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,790
Time to eat, two giant babies.

1173
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,590


1174
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,510
Right, they went to get some beers.

1175
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,340


1176
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,310
They should be back by now.

1177
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,220


1178
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,190
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

1179
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000


1180
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,150
I didn't hear it ring.

1181
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,790


1182
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,180
Where's Ye Tian?

1183
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,120


1184
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,750
Why isn't he back yet?

1185
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,750


1186
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,910
I don't know. I didn't see him.

1187
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,690


1188
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,190
Oh no. It's people from Celeste.

1189
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,010


1190
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,590
We have to find Ye Tian.

1191
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,520


1192
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,310
Is that Ye Tian?

1193

1194
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,790
Ms. Wei...

1195

1196
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,950
Ms. Wei.

Don't go, Ms. Wei.

1199

1200
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,790
Ye Tian!

1203
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,740
[I'm sorry. I just promised you]

1204
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,630
[I wouldn't let you wait for me alone.]

1205
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,570


1206
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,750
[But I...]

1207
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:34,840


1208
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,630
Let me go.

1209
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,590


1210
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,670
[Broke it right away.]

1211
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,450


1212
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,590
Ms. Wei.

1213
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,630


1214
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,780
Let me go.

1215
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,510


1216
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,110
What just happened?

1217
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,000


1218
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,310
Ye Tian did it for your sake.

1219
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,170


1220
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,710
Mr. Lin, the report isn't out yet.

1221
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,600


1222
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,470
Why don't you take a rest first?

1223
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,370


1224
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,430
Rest assured.

1225
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,270


1226
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,190
Despite the erratic EEG,

1227
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,990


1228
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,070
Mr. Ye's vitals are relatively stable.

1229
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,990


1230
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,550
He went to Haohan Street when he woke up.

1231
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,480


1232
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,990
The police showed up
after being tipped off.

1233
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,880


1234
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,270
They cracked down on 
an underground drug factory

1235
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,230


1236
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,670
on Greenwood Lane.

1237
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,700


1238
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,030
Xiao Tian fainted near Yibin Square.

1239
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,920


1240
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,910
No one knows why he was there.

1241
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,610


1242
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,910
My men

1243

1244
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,510
are cooperating with the police
to find out more details.

1245
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,390


1246
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,510
It's all right.

1247
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,380


1248
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,900
At least he's alive.

1249
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,810


1250
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,790
That's already very fortunate.

1251
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,750


1252
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,790
By the way,

1253
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:14,750


1254
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,590
why aren't we

1255
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,630


1256
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,870
conducting intracranial screening surgery 
on Xiao Tian?

1257
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,780


1258
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,430
It's not the right time.

1259
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,250


1260
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,270
He just experienced a violent awakening.

1261
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,140


1262
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,340
He comes in and out of consciousness.

1263
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,270


1264
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,430
We can't pinpoint the reason.

1265
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,310


1266
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,270
So maintaining the current state

1267
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,310


1268
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,750
is our only option.

1269
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,640


1270
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,870
We'll wait for more detailed test results.

1271
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,710


1272
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,740
I'm setting up a foreign panel
of specialists to review his case.

1273
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,670


1274
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,270
You really know all the ins and outs

1275
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,110


1276
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,030
of Ye Tian's condition, Mr. Lin.

1277
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,870


1278
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,510
A rarity.

1279
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,410


1280
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,750
Ms. Wei.

1281
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,850


1282
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,430
Ms. Bai Wei.

1283
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,520


1284
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,470
You can't go in.

1285
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,390


1286
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,990
Why?

1287
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:23,890


1288
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,990
Mr. Ye needs

1289
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,090


1290
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,630
recuperation.

1291
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:25,730


1292
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,470
You're not allowed to disturb him.

1293
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,560


1294
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,710
You're doing more harm than good.

1295
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,800


1296
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,150
Ye Tian doesn't want you to...

1297
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,530


1298
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,430
Xiao Liang, it's dangerous for him

1299
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,270
to be alone in there.

1300
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,170


1301
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,950
I must see him.

1302
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,870


1303
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,270
Even just one glimpse.

1304
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,290


1305
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,590


1306
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,590
-What are you doing?
-Ms. Wei.

1307
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,710
Stop...

1308
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,780


1309
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,950
Let me go.

1310
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,760


1311
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,790
Ms. Bai Wei.

1312
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,640


1313
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,590
What are you doing here?

1314
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:41,640


1315
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,150
I heard Ye Tian is awake.

1316
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,890


1317
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,950
Can I go in and see him?

1318
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,740


1319
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,750
Mr. Ye just underwent testing. 
He needs rest.

1320
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,550


1321
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,380
Come with me.

1322
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,330


1323
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,310
I'll wait here.

1324
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,100


1325
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,510
You really care about Xiao Tian.

1326
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,340


1327
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,950
When the accident happened,

1328
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,790


1329
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:40,870
you came too.

1330
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,810


1331
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,790
You even left

1332
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,800


1333
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:43,990
a commemorative coin
from the AR Fighting Championship.

1334
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,900


1335
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,670
We made a pact.

1336
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,610


1337
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,470
The one who lost

1338
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,300


1339
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,590
will take the coin as a memento.

1340
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,410


1341
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,910
It will be returned when they win.

1342
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,770


1343
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,990
But he hasn't woken up.

1344
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,830


1345
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,870
Hence I've been keeping the coin.

1346
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,700


1347
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,990
I'm waiting for him to wake up
and return it to me himself.

1348
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,720


1349
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,950
In the past few days,

1350
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,860


1351
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,590
I've been watching over him like this too.

1352
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,480


1353
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,550
I too, hope that he'll wake up soon.

1354
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,400


1355
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,990
Do you really want him to wake up?

1356
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,820


1357
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:49,790
Don't bring up Xiao Tian.

1358
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:49,840


1359
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,830
Be it Xiao Tian or Zhang Hao Cheng.

1360
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,760


1361
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,790
I don't need anyone's permission

1362
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:52,840


1363
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,830
to do something.

1364
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,920


1365
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,830
I'm the group's

1366
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,860


1367
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,190
CEO!

1368
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,090


1369
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,570


1370
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,710
He got too close to the furnace.

1371
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,750
Part of his character data was erased.

1372
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,630


1373
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,750
That's why he doesn't remember me.

1374
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,650


1375
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,910
Do you actually want him to wake up?

1376
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,930


1377
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,510
And disrupt your life again?

1378
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,560


1379
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,030
Ye Tian, watch out!

1380
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,930
