The reason I avoid you

549
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,910
is for your own good.

You will understand after this.

554
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,150
If I can get out of this place,

[You have been transported
to the location]

[where the intruder
synthesizes the bug potion.]

560
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,130


561

564
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,430
Lin Feng, just put the Easter egg here.

566
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,710
All right.

567

568
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,510
Cover it up.

569

570
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,230
This location is perfect.

47, 73.

575

576
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,030
This is equivalent to

577
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,260


578
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,270
the big Easter egg in Pangu.

580
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,950
Whoever gets it first

590
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,750
it'll be game over then, right?

591
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,700


592
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,950
How many eggs are left?

594
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,590
Who knows?

596
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,950
Guys, you are lucky!

598
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,470
You just registered but you get to know

599
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,530


600
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,750

Not bad.

646
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,390
Standing at a high place is dangerous,
be careful not to fall.

647
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,160


648

You don't have to kneel down.

653

Get up, quickly! Get up.

Newbies.

661

It's time to test your obedience.

662
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,560


663
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,960

666
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,190
I cannot hit a woman.

667
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,310
Brother Invincible,
my dormitory is about to lose power.

668
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,160


669
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,170


670

This...

671

672
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,910
Look at me!

673
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,740


674
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,950
Little girl, make a move!

675
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,710


676
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,870
Me?

677

She hit me!

678
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,100


679

She hit me!

681
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,990
That girl hit me!

682

687
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,830
She hit someone!

688
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820


689
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,830
She hit an old man!

690
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,900


691
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,910
She hit someone!

693
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,670
Let me tell you.

695
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,790
If you keep doing this,
I'm not going to be polite to you.

696
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,940


697
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,070

699
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,590
Mr. Lin?

705
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,950
Go back and tell your president this.

707
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,950
Don't do things recklessly.

708
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,190
There are laws in Pangu.

709
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,070


710
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,060


711

Big brother, he's the person

983
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,030
you will be able to find him, right?

984

985
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,630
Ms. Wei, how about this?

986

987
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,150

You should know what I mean, right?

You told me not to court him back then.

1225
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,830
That's why I was transferred overseas.

1226

It's different now.

1227

Yes.

1230
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,750
At that time, he was just a small staff
in the technology department.

1231

1232

1233
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,910
It's good now.

1234

1235
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,550
He's been promoted by you.

1237
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,230
So, we're well-matched now.

1243
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,590
you want me to keep an eye on him

1244
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,790


1245
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,990
when you returned home this time.

1247
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,870
But I'm sorry.

1248

1249
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,590
My relationship with him...

1250
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,010


1251
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,190
