There is no one left.

No one.

Let's go!

[Eight Hours]

28
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,750
He came from there.

29
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,430
I was there.

30
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,910
Yes.

31
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,270
Then, he climbed over the wall.

32
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,270
I don't know why,

33
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,190
but I was frozen.

34
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,750
I don't know

35
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,070
who told me either.

36
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,750
I just heard a voice in my earpiece.

37
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,910
"There is a bomb under the cake."

38
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,630
He knocked me out with a punch.

39
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,750
Then, he took off my uniform.

40
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,550
I couldn't react.

41
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,670
I was dumbfounded.

42
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,190
I think he was limping.

43
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,910
He probably has some problems 
with his leg,

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,310
but he is really agile.

45
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,350
Really?

46
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,350
Yes.

47
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,790
Boss,

48

all guests have been informed

49

as you instructed.

50
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,950
No one is suspecting anything.

51
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,110
This is just a farce.

52
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,590
I've walked Yun Er back to her room.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,670
Starting tomorrow,

54
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,860
triple the number of bodyguards at home.

Also,

56
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,870
dispatch a secret team to protect Yun Er.

57
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,140
She must not know.

58
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,710
Yes, Boss.

59
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,590
I will go and get it done now.

60
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,590
Wait.

61
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,750
Look into Hunting Dog.

62
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,909
Hunting Dog?

63
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,270
Just do it!

64
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,350
Yes, Boss!

65
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,590
Did you get frightened,

66
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,070
my son-in-law?

67
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,980
I'm fine.

68
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,990
I'm just curious.

69
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,750
Who holds such a deep grudge against you?

70
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,790
It's just a prank.

71
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,950
Don't take it seriously.

72
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,060
It's such a pity

73
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,750
that the engagement ceremony was ruined.

74
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,910
Yun Er is hiding in her room.

75
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,070
She's upset.

76
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,030
Go and comfort her.

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,910
By the way,

78
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,470
before the board meeting tomorrow,

79
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,270
let's

80
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,030
talk about the shareholding.

81
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,670
It will save us some trouble 
during the voting.

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,110
Why are you laughing?

83
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,790
Why are you laughing?

84
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,380
I'm laughing at you.

85
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,710
What you really care about 
is obviously the equity,

86
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,870
yet you had to bring up 
your daughter first.

87
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,260
Why?

88
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,590
To show that you are a good father?

89
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,950
If I were you,

90
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,590
and if I really cared about her,

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,990
I would have asked

92
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,950
why did you run out alone

93
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,670
and leave her inside

94
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,670
on her own?

95
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,710
Lin Feng,

96
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,550
do you think I can't do anything

97
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,350
to you from now on?

98
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,270
Get something straight.

99
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,150
It's just an engagement,

100
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,110
not a wedding.

101
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,630
Besides, the engagement ceremony 
was interrupted.

102
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,950
Listen to me,

103
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,830
at the moment,

104
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,310
you are not related to my family.

105
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,150
If it weren't that I don't want 
to break my daughter's heart,

106
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,350
I have dozens of ways to get rid of you,

107
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,990
got it?

108
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,110
Okay.

109
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,550
We are not related at all.

110
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,670
But I hope you will take a look at

111
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:44,550
your study first.

112
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,550

It's all thanks to your baby girl.

Are you seeing this?

121
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,710

Hello, Xiao Liang.

131
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,750
You called me a dozen times this morning.

132
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,630
Is everything okay?

133
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,110
My signal was blocked 
at Zhang Hao Cheng's house.

134
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,190
There's nothing now.

135

Really?

136
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,510
Really.

137
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,950
I just wanted to ask

138
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,950
if the ceremony went well.

139
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,790
So, did it go well?

140
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,470
I'm telling you, 
it was going well at first.

141
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,110
Then, there was a big misunderstanding.

142
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,550
A man suddenly came out

143
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,070
and said there was a bomb under the cake.

144
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,550
Fortunately, everyone is fine.

145
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,510
I don't know who did it.

146
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,430
A bomb?

147
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,750
Who pulled such an awful prank?

148
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,830
How would I know?

149
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,270
Alright.

150
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,270
I have to go.

151
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,390
I'm logging in to Pangu.

152
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,550
I need to talk to Ye Tian.

153

Tomorrow

154

is an important day for you and Ye Tian.

155
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,140
You should plan it well.

Yes.

We can finally enter 
the core area tomorrow.

Yes!

Bye bye.

Thank you.

162
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,390
We will

163
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,470
borrow your room for one night.

164
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,630
It'll be our wedding room.

165

It's for

good luck.

167

What nonsense were you talking about?

168
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,630
It's embarrassing.

You're back.

Are you going to get married again?

What are you thinking?

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,390
Don't you know

the monogamy rule inside Pangu?

175
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,780
This is Invincible and his wife.

176
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,350
His wife?

177
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,270
Invincible can't get offline in Pangu.

178
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,150
So, I took the opportunity

179
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,710
to hold them a wedding ceremony.

180
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,310
Invincible

181
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,590
is a pretty lucky guy.

182
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,510
I thought

183
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,110
you wouldn't be online tonight.

184
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,990
Why wouldn't I be online?

185
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,910
Tonight

186
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,350
may be your last night

187
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,230
in Pangu.

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,750
It's an important day.

189
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,550
Of course I have to be here for you.

190
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,750
Yes.

191
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,270
Today is the last day.

192
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,870
How about this?

193
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,510
Since today is the last day,

194
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,510
Autumn City is still open,

195

let's go and explore it.

196

Yes.

Have you ever thought about

what is the first thing

249
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,510
you want to do when you get out?

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,670
I have to think about it.

252
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,270
I'd suggest that

253
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,550
after you go out,

254
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,590
you should solve the problems 
of Celeste Group first,

255
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,830
like Lin Feng

256

and Zhang Hao Cheng.

257
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,670
Only when Celeste is united,

258
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,830
you will be able to focus on solving

the 2021 code error,

260
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,030

but

264

the first thing I want to do

265
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,790
has nothing to do with these.

266
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,470
What does it have to do with then?

267
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,990
You.

00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,510
Boss,

343
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,350
Yun Er stayed here

344
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,510
with you all night yesterday.

345
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,790
She only went home to rest this morning.

346
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,790
Li,

347
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,470
you're not good at lying.

348
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,230
Don't force yourself.

349
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,590
She stayed with me all night?

350
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,910
I can't believe you said that.

351
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,110
Yun Er really stayed with you all night.

352
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,380
She only went home to sleep

353
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,630
after the doctor said 
you're out of danger.

354
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,030
Alright, that's enough.

355
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,070
Stop covering for her.

356
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,470
I know my own daughter.

357
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,190
Given her personality,

358
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,950
she is probably looking for Lin Feng now.

359
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,390
She doesn't care about me.

360
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,980
I just hope she will grow up

361
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,910
after what she went through.

362
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,620
[Lin Feng]

363
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,830
Lin Lin,

364
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,790
where are you?

365
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,470
Why didn't you answer my calls?

366
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,790
[I'm downstairs.]

367
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,870
You're downstairs?

368
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,870
Lin Lin! Lin Lin!

369
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,150
[How's your dad?]

370
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,070
Don't worry.

371
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,430
Zhang Hao Cheng is fine.

372
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,790
I asked the doctor.

373
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,590
Why don't you come upstairs?

374
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,870
You should come down.

375
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,510
I should come down?

376
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,870
Why?

377
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,990
I have something to tell you.

378
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,390
Okay.

379
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,990
I'll come down.

380
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,630
Xiao Lin Lin.

381
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,190
What's the matter?

382
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,310
You're being mysterious.

383
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,190
Are you going to take me somewhere?

384
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,670
Can you reveal it in advance?

385
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,150
But

386
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,470
we can't go too far.

387
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,110
Because I have to go
to the hospital at night.

388
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,070
I need to talk to you.

389
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,470
Can we walk and talk?

390
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,910
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,190
You mean you left early yesterday

392
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,150
and didn't accompany me

393
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,510
to take Zhang Hao Cheng 
to the hospital, right?

394
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,070
It's fine.

395
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,550
I'm not a child.

396
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,230
Besides, Li was there.

397
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,190
Did something happen 
at the company yesterday?

398
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,350
Nothing happened.

399
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,430
I left early

400
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,630
because I didn't want to face you.

401
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,630
Because I used you.

402
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,180
You are talking about

403
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,110
the evidence you told me to burn, right?

404
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,630
That's fine.

405
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,950
I wanted to destroy it long ago.

406
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,550
If that had continued to exist,

407
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,070
there would always be 
a barrier between us.

408
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,150
As for Zhang Hao Cheng's illness,

409
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,430
he has been unwell for the past two days.

410
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,950
You don't have to blame yourself.

411
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,670
I mean it, Lin Lin.

412
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,790
I don't blame you.

413
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,310
Why are you looking at me like that?

414
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,150
It's really fine, Lin Lin.

415
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,510
By the way,

416
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,350
our engagement ceremony

417
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,990
hasn't been completed

418
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,150
because of that prank.

419
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,550
We will hold it again with fewer guests.

420
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,670
More people, more trouble.

421
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,390
Next time, it will be just you, me, Linda,

422
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,350
and Bai Wei...

423
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,950
Yun Er.

424
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,950
You are a smart girl.

425
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm sure you understand what I mean.

426
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,550
I...

427
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,550
I don't understand.

428
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,590
There will be 
no more engagement between us.

429
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,830
That's fine. We won't be engaged then.

430
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,470
You've proposed to me.

431
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,750
We...

432
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,390
We will just get married.

433
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,230
Lin Lin,

434
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,470
let's get married.

435
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,550
The only reason I got close to you

436
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,390
was to get you to help me

437
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,110
delete all the evidence 
your father had on me.

438
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,470
I didn't know where the evidence was,

439
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,030
only you did.

440
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,790
My feelings for you,

441
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,750
and our engagement,

442
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,470
were all preparations

443
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,630
to get what I want.

444
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,190
Your dad was right.

445
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,070
I'm not a good guy.

446
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,270
I lied to you.

447
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,110
I know that

448
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,550
playing with someone's feelings

449
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,990
is a very shameless act.

450
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,390
So, however you want to punish me,

451
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,430
I'll accept it.

452
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,270
But I want you to know that

453
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,950
if I were given another choice,

454
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,350
I would still do it.

455
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,270
Because Celeste is very important to me.

456
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,950
I won't dare to dream 
of your forgiveness.

457
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,870
Lin Feng!

458
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,710
Why didn't you just lie to me,

459
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,030
just leave me?

460
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,870
Or you could just come up with an excuse.

461
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,510
I would've believed anything you told me.

462
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,590
You deserve to know the truth.

463
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,070
Take it back.

464
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,750
I thought

465
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,510
this Star Moonstone was 
the most precious gift I ever received.

466
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,350
So, amidst the chaos yesterday,

467
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,510
I had to find it

468
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,950
no matter what.

469
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,830
I thought if I found it,

470
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,550
we'd go back to the way things were.

471
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,990
But it's broken.

472
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,590
It's broken.

473
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,350
Just like this crack.

474
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,230
I can't stop thinking about

475
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,950
why you

476
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,510
left me behind yesterday.

477
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,540
I cried a lot yesterday,

478
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,670
but it wasn't because of this stone.

479
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,910
You won't understand.

480
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,270
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,940
There's something 
I've been wanting to ask you.

511
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,770
♫ With all my love ♫

512
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,070
♫ Can you hear my wish ♫

513
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,790
How do you and Bai Wei

514
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,820
♫ In the noise? ♫

515
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,150
usually get along?

516
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,880
♫ Perhaps you can understand it ♫

517
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,310
What does that mean?

518
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,310
♫ Only if you are ♫

519
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,910
She's your girlfriend, right?

520
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,510
Yes.

521
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,640
♫ Closer to me ♫

522
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,990
She is my girlfriend.

523
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,670
That's weird.

524
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,110
What's weird?

525
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,790
You see,

526
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,350
when you're offline,

527
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,270
she's always online.

528
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,670
When she's offline,

529
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,980
you're always online.

530
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,950
Don't you guys

531
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,590
see each other in the real world?

532
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,830
I get it.

533
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,670
You're doing retro style, aren't you?

534
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,870
You're doing online dating, aren't you?

535
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,790
Online dating?

536
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,380
We are both men.

537
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,430
There is no need to be shy.

538
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,510
To be honest with you,

539
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,910
my girlfriend and I...

540
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,070
No.

541
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,590
I mean, my wife.

542
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,150
My wife and I

543
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,750
also met on

544
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,070
another online game.

545
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,950
We were dating online too.

546
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,950
And guess what happened.

547
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,510
I found that

548
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,150
she just lived 
in the neighborhood next to mine.

549
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:34,310
Do you and Bai Wei live far away 
from each other?

550
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,110
You have to date in reality.

551
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,270
Date in reality?

552
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,550
Date in reality,

553
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,750
I want that too.

554
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,990
You can't just think about it.

555
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,190
You need to take action

556
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,430
to bring your relationship into real life.

557
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,990
You see,

558
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,870
online dating

559
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,310
may sound romantic.

560
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,630
But what if something happens

561
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,150
to her in real life,

562
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,510
you won't be able to help.

563
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,110
Even if nothing happens to her,

564
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,660
holding hands,

565
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,150
taking a walk together,

566
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,430
that feeling is

567
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,550
completely different from in the game.

568
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,790
It's two different things.

569
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,670
In real life...

570
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,230
Celeste Foundation

571
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,390
is a guarantee for the future 
of all Celeste employees.

572
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,190
Whether it is children's education,

573
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,110
medical care or housing,

574
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,590
the foundation will provide 
adequate support.

575
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,510
The foundation

576
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,030
was suspended for a while
because Mr. Zhang had concerns

577
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,830
about the group's income.

578
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,590
Since the group's income is now stable,

579
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,830
I believe the foundation 
must be restarted immediately.

580
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,950
Who is for it,

581
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,230
who is against it,

582
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,030
please vote on it.

583
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,990
I'm for it.

584
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,190
Mr. Lin,

585
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,510
forgive me for being blunt,

586
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,870
If you are taking your own money

587
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,350
to do charity,

588
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,270
old guys like us

589
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,630
will applaud your decision,

590
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,550
but have you ever thought about

591
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,830
how many shareholders'
interests this is going to affect?

592
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,630
That means

593
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,390
the dividends 
we shareholders are entitled to

594
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,620
are distributed to the employees.

595
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,190
I object.

596
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,630
Is that what you think?

597
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,070
Is that what you all think?

598
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,510
Mr. Ye has repeatedly told us

599
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,230
that treating employees well

600
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,790
not only benefits the group,

601
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,150
but also ourselves.

602
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,590
And you want to overthrow 
the tradition of Celeste

603
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,750
just for a small profit.

604
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,790
How shortsighted.

605
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,670
We're shortsighted?

606
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,830
Lin Feng,

607
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,390
please get the fact straight,

608
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,670
you are

609
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,590
Celeste's CEO.

610
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,350
You are responsible 
for the interests of all shareholders.

611
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,990
Besides,

612
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,430
the employees are paid.

613
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,550
The group didn't mistreat them.

614
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,350
Stop bringing up

615
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,430
Mr. Ye.

616
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,470
Their time is over.

617
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,670
So,

618
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,430
you won't get us to pass this resolution.

619
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,110
Right.

620
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,110
Thanks for the reminder.

621
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,270
I'm the CEO.

622
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,390
I'm going to use

623
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,700
my CEO

624
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,790
veto right.

625
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,070
I, Lin Feng,

626
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,470
will vote down all your objections today.

627
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,070
The proposal is passed.

628
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,310
Lin Feng,

629
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,510
you're too cocky!

630
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,670
If Mr. Zhang was here,

631
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,950
would he have allowed this?

632
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,990
But he isn't here.

633
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,550
I should remind you,

634
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,550
the second rule for the board,

635
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,150
in the absence of

636
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,510
both the chairman and vice chairman,

637
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,340
the CEO

638
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,020
will assume the authority 
of the above two.

639
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,230
So,

640
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,350
I make the call today.

641
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:56,830
You...

642
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,430
Meeting adjourned.

643
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,190
This is outrageous.

644
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,030
Yes.

645
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,430
What is this?

646
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,750
Bai Wei,

647
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,870
stop trying.

648
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,270
The original computer

649
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,270
requires a Level 1 access card to boot it.

650
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,590
So, I'm not even a Level 1.

651
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,070
All newcomers are Level 4.

652
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,950
I've been working here for four years, 
and I'm only a Level 3.

653
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,790
I see.

654
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,620
If I want to use

655
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,230
the original server

656
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,630
to modify Pangu's data,

657
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,060
is it only Mr. Lin who can do it?

658
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,110
About that...

659
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,670
You can take the modification file

660
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,910
to the operation end

661
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,430
to get a one-time 
Level 1 access permission,

662
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,230
but this also requires approval.

663
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,470
Alright.

664
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,030
I got it.

665
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,830
Thank you.

666
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,510
Isn't this...

667
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,190
He looks so imposing.

668
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,350
Mr. Lin,

669
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,310
if you have something to say, 
you can say it.

670
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,710
The speech for the engagement ceremony,

671
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,150
it was well-written.

672
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,710
I was really touched.

673
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,270
Thank you.

674
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,390
I was just speaking from the heart.

675
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,110
But let me say this upfront,

676
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,310
when you get married,

677
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,470
I'm not going to officiate it.

678
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,790
There won't be a next time.

679
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,430

To be precise,

683
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,790
she and I have never

684
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,830
really been together.

685
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,670

689

they are all fake.

690
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,550
I was just using her

691
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,710
to help me do one thing the whole time,

692
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,989
so that I could get rid 
of Zhang Hao Cheng's control.

693
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,510
Now that I did it,

694
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,590
I don't need her anymore.

695
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,980
How could you do that?

696
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,870
I've told her everything.

697
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,230
She hates me so much,

698
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,350

to allow him to gradually empty Pangu,

702
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,909
this is what I call a great evil.

703

704
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,230

could no longer control me,

705
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,590
so that I can reclaim control of Celeste,

706

the original ideal and vision 
of Xiao Tian and me,

710
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,910
this is small evil to me.

711
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:04,990
Therefore,

712
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,230
I made a choice.

713
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,230
Whether it is great evil or small evil,

714
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,470
they both are evils.

00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,510
I would've never thought

850
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,430
you were the hacker expert.

851
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,150
When you stopped

852
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,230
foreign hackers

853
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,070
from attacking our Internet 
five years ago,

854
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,350
you were so cool.

855
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,830
Am I not cool now?

856
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,510
You are cool.

857
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,430
Of course you are.

858
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,430
You see,

859
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,390
you hacked into the website 
that I had been trying

860
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,430
to hack into for four days 
in just three hours.

861
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,270
Stop praising me.

862
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,590
You are not bad yourself.

863
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,030
You were able to find the cloud drive

864
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,110
where Guo Yi Da stored his files 
in such a short time.

865
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,350
It was just a lucky shot.

866
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,190
Zhao Jia Liang,

867
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,150
you frightened me.

868
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,470
I thought it was someone else.

869
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,740
This is Ms. Linda.

870
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,470
My boss.

871
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,710
This is Xiao Liang.

872
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,430
My friend.

873
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,750
What are you doing here again?

874
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,510
It's dinner time.

875
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,230
So, I just brought you some food.

876
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:05,750
If there is nothing else,

877
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,550
I will get going.

878
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,190
Okay.

879
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,300
Remember to eat it.

880
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,270
Xiao Qiao,

881
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,510
I didn't know

882
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,830
you are a popular girl.

883
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,310
Ms. Linda,

884
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,510
what are you talking about?

885
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,070
He's my friend.

886
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,870
Done.

887
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,470
It's finally breached.

888
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,430
Come.

889
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,190
Let's see what interesting things

890
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,030
Xiao Guo has left for us.

891
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,150
Linda,

892
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,590
as I expected, you are good.

893
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,030
You found what I want so soon.

894
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,230
This time,

895
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,950
you won't see this coming.

896
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,150
Xiao Tian,

897
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,470
I can't delete your account,

898
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,430
and I can't find your coordinates,

899
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,550
but I can make you

900
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,350
everyone's enemy in Pangu.

901
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,790
Lin Feng modified my code

902
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,030
with the original server.

903
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,190
He turned me into

904
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,870
an NPC,

905
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,270
Omen.

906
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,350
[The Omen has come.]

907
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,270
[The country shall be ruined.]

908
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,630
Doesn't that make you a universal enemy?

909
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,660
You have no place to hide now?

910
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,750
That's right.

911
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,950
[You will receive]

912
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,620
[the highest honor 
and reward ever in Pangu.]
