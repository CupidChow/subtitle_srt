249
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,030
It's acute gastritis.

251
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,870

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,160


1257
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,310
Yun Yun, listen to me.

1258
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,280


1259
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,830
You have to stop this cold war 
with your dad.

1260
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,590


1261
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,790
Show him more concern occasionally.

1262
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,690


1263
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,230
I'm sure when something happens to you,

1264
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,150


1265
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,510
although he doesn't say it outright,

1266
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,490


1267
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,670
he's actually worried about you.

1268
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,560


1269
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,230
Of course.

1270
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,200


1271
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,010


1272
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,150
When something happens to him,

1273
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,270
he chooses not to tell you

1274
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,230


1275
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,670
in case you worry.

1276
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,520


1277
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,430
If anything happens to him,
it's because he deserved it.

1278
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,290


1279
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,350
Nothing to do with me.

1280
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,300


1281
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,670
All I need is you, Ms. Le Le.

1282
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,660


1283
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,990
Silly girl.

1284
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,900


1285
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,990
Lao Bai, I need to hurry to work.

1286
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,980


1287
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,030
I'll talk to you later.

1288
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,860


1289
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,510
I have time today.

1290
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,380


1291
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,500


1292
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,510
Today is my day off.

1293
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,520


1294
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,830
I just need to clock in briefly
at the office.

1295
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,900


1296
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,910
Listen to me.

1297
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,660


1298
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,790
There's nothing between Lin Feng and me.

1299
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,120


1300
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,390
I knew you were going to set me up
for another blind date.

1301
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,830
Mr. Bai Jin Hui.

1302
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,660


1303
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,550
What era are we living in?

1304
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,480


1305
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,940
I'm not going.

1306
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,830


1307
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,710
You said yes to your friend,

1308
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,700


1309
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,850


1310
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,990
so you go.

1311
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,830
No. Don't you try that with me.

1312
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,690


1313
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,910
I'm not going.

1314
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,810


1315
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,540


1316
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,550
So what if they have good credentials?

1317
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,710


1318
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,950
I have pretty good credentials myself.

1319
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,870


1320
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,150
Why do I have to meet him?

1321
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,510
Good morning.

1322
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,200


1323
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,670
[Why is everyone staring at me?]

1324
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,690


1325
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,470
[Am I imagining it?]

1326
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,300


1327
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,030
[How odd.]

1328
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,980


1329
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,190
[What is happening?]

1330
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,150


1331
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,510
Wang Ying Qiao.

1332
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,360


1333
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,350
Did someone send you milk again?

1334
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,270


1335
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,030
I wonder who has a crush on you.

1336
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,930


1337
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,070
Could it be Guo Yi Da 
from the programming department?

1338
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,980


1339
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,870
Hey, stop assuming.

1340
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,770


1341
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,750
Blessings should be shared.

1342
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,590


1343
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,030
You can have the milk.

1344
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,900


1345
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,670
Thanks.

1346
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,550


1347
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,670
Milk is my least favorite drink.

1348
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,640


1349
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,230
She's the one in the video yesterday
with Lin Feng.

1350
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,150


1351
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,950
Did you see the clip?

1352
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,910


1353
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,580


1354
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,590
Stop talking.

1355
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,250


1356
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,390
She's here.

1357
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,830
Did you see the video of them?

1358
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,680


1359
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,690


1360
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,190
They were holding hands.

1361
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,700


1362
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,220
Stop talking. She's here.

1363
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,730


1364
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,950
Stop talking.

1365
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:15,830
Qiao.

1366
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:15,700


1367
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,790
What's the matter? 
Is omething bothering you?

1368
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,690


1369
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,620
Nothing's bothering me.

1370
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,550


1371
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,510
You, on the other hand...

1372
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,410


1373
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,510
What did you do with Mr. Lin last night?

1374
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,550


1375
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,710
What... What did I do with Mr. Lin?

1376
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,570


1377
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,310
You don't have to keep it from me.

1378
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,170


1379
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,390
I actually think you two 
are a great match.

1380
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,260


1381
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,390
Honest.

1382
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,300


1383
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,470
What great match?

1384
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,470


1385
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,790
Wei Wei, am I still your best friend?

1386
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,700


1387
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,590
When you married Xiao Liang in Pangu,

1388
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,580


1389
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,390


1390
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,270
you didn't tell me.

1391
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,830
That's fine.

1392
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:49,770


1393
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,820


1394
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,830
But last night 
you had supper with Mr. Lin.

1395
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,790


1396
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,990
You still didn't tell me.

1397
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,910
What's that about?

1398
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,860


1399
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,140


1400
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,350
The whole company saw you.

1401
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,990
Did you two also go
to the hospital yesterday

1402
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,950


1403
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,250


1404
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,350
so he can meet your dad?

1405
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:02,790
Is it true?

1406
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,690


1407
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,350
Did you then spend the night with him?

1408
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,200


1409
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,390
Wei Wei, I didn't expect that from you.

1410
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,220


1411
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,950
So, what they're saying is true, huh?

1412
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,940


1413
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,710
What are you talking about?

1414
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,760


1415
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,590
Is it true?

1416
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,520


1417
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,870
Is it true?

1418
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,860


1419
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,240


1420
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,390
Tell me, Wei Wei.

1421
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,190
I have something to do. I need to go.

1422
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,060


1423
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,310
Wei Wei.

1424
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,200


1425
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,990
I heard about last night.

1426
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,870


1427
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,190
It seems to be progressing quickly.

1428
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,030


1429
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,670
I wish.

1430
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,530


1431
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,710
Bai Wei, don't be so smug.

1432
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,540


1433
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,470
Yesterday, you went to a roadside stall
with Little Lin Lin.

1434
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,330


1435
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,510
And the whole company 
hears about it today.

1436
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,320


1437
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,630
Did you intentionally spread the news?

1438
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,550


1439
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,350
Ms. Zhang, 
you can't simply make up stories.

1440
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,250


1441
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,950
Besides, Mr. Lin and I had supper

1442
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,940


1443
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,570


1444
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,750
as fellow colleagues.

1445
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,790
Still, if we were dating,

1446
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,640


1447
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,020


1448
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,030
you can't stop us.

1449
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,350
You...

1450
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,230


1451
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,430
Yun Er.

1452
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,410


1453
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,710
There has to be a limit

1454
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,700


1455
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,630


1456
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,750
to your jealous behavior.

1457
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,820
Here's a reminder.

1458
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,790


1459
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,390
Best you don't attempt

1460
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,470


1461
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,950
another stupid stunt
like disrupting the main server

1462
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,060


1463
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,790
again.

1464
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,850


1465
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,270
Especially not troubling Yi Da.
Understand?

1466
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,240


1467
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,250


1468
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,350
Lin Feng has chosen 
not to pursue the matter

1469
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,630
so you weren't found out.

1470
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,610


1471
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,150
Count yourself lucky.

1472
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,140


1473
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,430
One more thing.

1474
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,320


1475
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,870
I won't interfere with how
you deal with personnel.

1476
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,750


1477
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,230
But if you try

1478
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,110


1479
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,110
to manipulate the operation of Pangu,

1480
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,150


1481
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,470
I'll be the first to voice out.

1482
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,350


1483
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,670
You always stand by outsiders
rather than supporting me.

1484
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,630


1485
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,630
Yet Ms. Le Le wants me
to think for your sake?

1486
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560


1487
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,790
Never.

1488
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,720


1489
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,750
Ms. Wei.

1490
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,690


1491
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,030
Wang Ying Qiao's told me over the phone.

1492
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,980


1493
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,670
Ye Tian doesn't care about you at all.

1494
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,660


1495
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,230
Do you know what people
are saying right now?

1496
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,160


1497
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,420


1498
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,430
That you went to Celeste

1499
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,570


1500
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,710
just to seduce Lin Feng.

1501
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,710
It's as bad as you can make it out to be.

1502
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,590


1503
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,860
That Wang Ying Qiao.

1504
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,730


1505
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,910
You should know me better.

1506
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,830


1507
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,230
You know how I am.

1508
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,310


1509
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,430
Why are you bothered?

1510
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,420


1511
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420


1512
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,510
How can I not?

1513
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,910
He doesn't have the authority.

1514
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,680


1515
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,870
If he continues like this,

1516
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,860


1517
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,390
the company will...

1518
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,430


1519
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,470
Yes, sure.

1520
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,420


1521
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,430
I heard you.

1522
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,090


1523
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,110
I'll talk to him.

1524
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,980


1525
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,830
Don't think it's no big deal.

1526
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,990
I'll take care of it myself.

1527
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,660


1528
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,670
You need to take this seriously.

1529
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,500


1530
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,510
Since when did you become so long-winded?

1531
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,630


1532
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,710
Go on now.

1533
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,070
Go.

1534
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:31,960


1535
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,750
Bye-bye.

1536
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,590


1537
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,390
Hey. Why are you drinking in the day time?

1538
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,300


1539
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,150
You're back.

1540
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,900


1541
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,310
Did you go to the gazebo with him?

1542
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,130


1543
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,710
Did you drink with him?

1544
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,560


1545
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,640


1546
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,950
Do you like him?

1547
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,030
What are you talking about?

1548
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,890


1549
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,670
You're not allowed to like him.

1550
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,540


1551
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,990
You're drunk. Let me go.

1552
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,980


1553
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,060


1554
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,070
I'm not drunk.

1555
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,470
Ye Tian.

1556
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,190


1557
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,590
Ye Tian!

1558
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,460


1559
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,530


1560
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,670
You're really drunk.

1561
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,530


1562
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,590
Ye Tian, let go.

1563
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580


1564
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,590
Let me go!

1565
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,870
I won't have you like him.

1566
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,880


1567
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,790
You've really disrespected me.

1568
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,670


1569
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,030
You had never said

1570
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,990


1571
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,870


1572
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,110
that you like me.

1573
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,430
Now you're stopping me from liking others?

1574
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,310


1575
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,510
Yes, I do like you.

1576
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,350


1577
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,630
Even if you're stuck in Pangu forever,

1578
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,700


1579
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,470
I'm still willing to be with you.

1580
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,320


1581
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,310
But what's the meaning
of your actions today?

1582
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,150


1583
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,340
On what grounds were they made?

1584
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,170


1585
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,550
As a friend?

1586
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,310


1587
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,110
A crush?

1588
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,000


1589
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,460
Or a lover?

1590
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,300


1591
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,830
Who am I to you?

1592
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,660


1593
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:14,440


1594
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,910
Don't go.

1595
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,430
Then tell me.

1596
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,290


1597
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,630
I didn't do anything wrong.

1598
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,480


1599
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,020


1600
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,030
I think of you as...

1601
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,420


1602
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,430
Sure, you did nothing wrong.

1603
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,460


1604
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,470
It's all my fault.

1605
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,060


1606
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,070
You can stay here by yourself.

1607
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,750


1608
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,950
I'm going for a blind date.

1609
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,190
Don't go.

1610
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,050


1611
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,710
Ye Tian, you pig!

1612
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,700


1613
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,570


1614
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,580
You stupid pig!

1615
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,790
You just had to annoy me.

1616
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,780


1617
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,800


1618
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,030
So annoying!

1619
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,070
Just stay in there forever.

1620
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:52,970


1621
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,870
I... I didn't mean the last part.

1622
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,620


1623
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,670
Just the last sentence.

1624
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,580


1625
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,910
Hello, Lao Bai.

1626
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,760


1627
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,030
I told you, I'm not going
to the blind date.

1628
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,110


1629
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,190
What?

1630
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,070


1631
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,680


1632
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,910
You said yes, not me.

1633
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,810


1634
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,820
You have pride,

1635
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,020


1636
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,150
but I don't?

1637
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,270
Besides, does your daughter 
need to go on blind dates?

1638
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,110


1639
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,830


1640
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,030
What?

1641
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,390
You think I can conjure 
a boyfriend out of thin air?

1642
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,270


1643
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,270
That's a different matter altogether.

1644
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,200


1645
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,350


1646
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,590
Okay, okay.

1647
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,540
Fine. It's just one meal.

1648
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,440


1649
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,070
But you have to promise me

1650
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,060


1651
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,340


1652
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,350
not to set up

1653
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,370


1654
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,630
these meaningless things again.

1655
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,230
You better mean it.

1656
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,130


1657
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,590
It's just a meal.

1658
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,470


1659
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,800


1660
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,110
I'll go.

1661
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,230
See how I'll annoy you.

1662
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,080


1663
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,230
Who is that?

1664
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,100


1665
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,670
I don't know him.

1666
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,490


1667
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,350
Your humble servant, Lu Hu (Land Rover).

1668
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,120


1669
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,150
Lu Hu?

1670
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,100


1671
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,790
Then I'm Range Rover.

1672
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,660


1673
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,350


1674
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,390
Once this hot patch is installed,

1675
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,980
the original list of poisons 
will be overwritten.

1676
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,820


1677
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,140


1678
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,150
Then the bug of fighting
poison with poison

1679
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,830
in Pangu

1680
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,890


1681
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,950
will be removed completely.

1682
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,820


1683
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,190


1684
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,350
Watch out!

1685
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,870
A colleague of mine

1686
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,080


1687
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,110
found it in Autumn City.

1688
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,290


1689
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,430
He said he's going 
to Love Flower Village.

1690
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,650


1691
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,950
Better dead than sorry.

1692
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,840


1693
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,630
Tell them.

1694
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,550


1695
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,950
The player that manages to kill the target

1696
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,680


1697
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,190
will be rewarded handsomely.

1698
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,080
