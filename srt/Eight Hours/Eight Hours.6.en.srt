722
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,950
How is it?

723
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,840


724
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,950
You can count on me.

725
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,860


726
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,030
I'll find him.

727
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,910


728
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,390
Feels like we're back in the past.

729
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,180


730
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,950
Anchen Hospital has a lot of CCTVs.

731
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,860


732
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,540


733
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,550
But you're only looking at the drone shots

734
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,310


735
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,390
Xiao Wu took.

736
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,010


737
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,110
What do you expect to find?

738
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,110
It's no use checking CCTV footage.

739
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,900


740
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,980


741
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,990
The police

742
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,050


743
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,110
had taken all the footage.

744
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,000


745
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,150
They've been blocked.

746
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,750
As for what I can find
from the drone shots,

747
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,560


748
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,310
we'll see soon enough.

749
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,200


750
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,470
It's right opposite the hospital.

751
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,300


752
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,800


753
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,990
What a coincidence

754
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,670
to be able to capture
Ye Tian's kidnapping.

755
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,570


756
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,350
It doesn't matter whether 
we can see the guy's face.

757
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,150


758
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,110
We just need to see the car.

759
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,950


760
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,670
The car was parked 
at the hospital entrance for seven hours.

761
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,460


762
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,230
The dashcam recorder

763
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,090


764
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,470
is our only witness.

765
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,310


766
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,410


767
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,550
This is why you're known 
as the hunting dog.

768
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,950
This is the deposit.

769
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,780


770
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,180
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

771
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,180


772
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,840


773
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,990
[Things are going well.]

774
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,350
[Are you coming to see me tonight?]

775
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,220


776
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,190
Please hold on.

777
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,030


778
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,460


779
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,470
Mr. Zhang, the directors are ready.

780
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,270
You can start any time.

781
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,120


782
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,830
Okay, carry on.

783
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,870


784
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,950
Sure. Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

785
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,940


786
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,380


787
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,390
Wu.

788
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,150
Yesterday went well.

789
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,000


790
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,350
Expect a promotion soon.

791
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,380


792
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,550
Thanks for your guidance, Mr. Zhang.

793
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,460


794
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,830
Apologies, everyone.

795
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,620


796
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,950
I was held up.

797
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,420


798
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,630
Mr. Zhang.

799
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,150
Mr. Zhang.

800
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,060


801
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,470
Sit.

802
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,340


803
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,700
Excuse me.

804
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,720


805
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,750
We were discussing

806
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,740


807
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,070


808
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,270
about your proposal.

809
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,420


810
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,510
We have some differing views. Right?

811
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,790
Who is it that thinks differently?

812
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,570


813
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,110
It's actually me.

814
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,940


815
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,590
I remember Mr. Ye set such a rule.

816
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,570


817
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,230
The rule that no staff of Celeste
will get their salary cut.

818
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,090


819
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,390
So...

820
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,470


821
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,590
That's before.

822
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,390


823
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,230
Now is now.

824
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,080


825
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,950
Celeste's current cash flow
is stretched thin.

826
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,760


827
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,790
Cutting salaries is a last resort.

828
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,570


829
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,910
I'm sure the staff will understand.

830
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,700


831
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,070
After all, giving up personal interest

832
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,110


833
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,110
is for the group's long-term development.

834
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,970


835
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,990
I've seen the financial statements
for this quarter.

836
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,870


837
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,390
The net profit

838
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,280


839
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,430
is enough to pay the staff.

840
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,300


841
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,490


842
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,670
What about the stakeholders' bonuses?

843
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,270
Didn't you say it yourself, Mr. Zhang?

844
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,050


845
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,040


846
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,230
Temporarily sacrificing personal interest

847
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,310
is for the group's long-term development.

848
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,160


849
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,290


850
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,430
Right?

851
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,830
Lin.

852
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,690


853
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,350
Arguing for the sake of arguing
is childish behavior.

854
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,110


855
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,030
Seek common ground 
while reserving differences, right?

856
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,000


857
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,390
I was just jesting.

858
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,220


859
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,000


860
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,110
If we wish to reserve differences,

861
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,670
let's have a vote then.

862
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480


863
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,190
The minority will go with the majority.

864
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,050


865
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,430
Be democratic, right?

866
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,300


867
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,710
Raise your hand
if you support this proposal.

868
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,480


869
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,470
Dou Zi, you go!

870
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,210


871
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460


872
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,470
Don't push yourself.

873
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,190


874
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,310
We should both go.

875
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,140


876
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,150
You must be kidding.

877
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,310
I promised you

878
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,110


879
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,660


880
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,670
that I'd give you
the perfect wedding gift.

881
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,990
I will complete this mission
no matter what.

882
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,930


883
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,950
Watch me.

884
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,890


885
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,670
I'll show you my secret skill.

886
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,530


887
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,310
Did you see that, Dou Zi?

888
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,240


889
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,270
Just a bit more.

890
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,100


891
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:26,890


892
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,030
Well?

893
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,240


894
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,390
Did you see how high I jumped?

895
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,090


896
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,190
That was a cool move, right?

897
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,420
Give me one more chance.

898
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,180


899
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,940


900
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,190
This time, I will surely succeed.

901

We risked our lives

trying to cross the bridge.

How come you still remember

1489
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,150
I saw you again when you passed
the newcomer qualification

and formally became a player.

Did you go there because of me?

1497

[She wasn't feeling well that day.]
