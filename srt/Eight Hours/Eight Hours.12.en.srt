I'm not as weak as you thought.

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,200
You don't have to worry about me.

that you want me to leave

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,460
and you don't want to see me again.

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,920
Alright,

10
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,150
just take it as I showed interest
in an uninterested party.

11
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,310
I'll never let you see me again.

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,400

[I won't leave even if you say it.]

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,750
You chose to be silent, right?

17
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,040
I'll take it as you agreed.

18
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,380
[I knew it.]

19

[You won't say anything
if I don't force you.]

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,590
You kept quiet when I asked you.

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,970
And you refrained me from leaving.

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,230
What do you want?

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,830
Since you're holding me,

24
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,630
I'll take it as
you don't want me to leave.

25
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,240
Right?

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,620
Please nod your head if I'm right.

27
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,570
Alright.

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,300
You told me all those things

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,560
because you're worried about me.

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,180
But, do you know that

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,050
you hurt me the most

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,850
when you don't allow me to help you

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,740
and exclude me from everything?

34
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,330
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:44,930
You should be like this just now.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,229
Don't do it again.

37
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,190
Act according to what I said this time.

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:50,810
I'll take this as your apology.

39
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,110

Good.

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,260
I want them to pay the price
for what they have done now and before.

48
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,380
Hold on.

You only have a life left.

50
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,960
I have more.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,310
It's okay.

52
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,800
It's better that I go.

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,620
I'll go.

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,580
How should we go about it now?

55

Do you want to fight
individually or all together?

How should we fight?

57
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,270
Stop!

58
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,750
You're so arrogant!

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,029
You brought so many people.

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,000
We meet again, mask boy.

61

There's no one

we can't find in the main city.

63
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,120
So you are the President
of the Heavenly Society.

64
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,800
Mask boy?

65
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,470
What did she mean?

66
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,310
Did you meet her before?

67
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,790
No, it's not like what you think.

68
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,510

Bai Wei.

Am I close to you?

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,230
True.

73
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm quite close with the members
of Heavenly Society.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
I hit them whenever I see them.

75
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,820
Let bygones be bygones.

76
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,450
It's all misunderstanding.

77
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,930
Everyone in Pangu

78
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,300
is here to enjoy.

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,700
Fighting each other will kill the fun.

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,560
Shall we be friends?

81
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,920
Both of you haven't
joined any society, right?

82
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,490
How about joining Heavenly Society?

83
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,100
Sorry,

84
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,150
we can be friends,

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,030
but we are not interested

86
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,030
to join your society.

87
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,910
I won't force you.

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,210
Here are a few boxes of advanced elixir

89
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,070
and premiums weapon set.

90
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,490
Just take it as gifts from me.

91
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,620
You can

92
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,820
look for me when you face difficulties

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,670
in Pangu.

94
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,970
And this.

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,230
This silk wear is especially for you.

96
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,600
I think it matches your mask.

97
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,350
Premium accessories.

98
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,370
The probability is low.

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,540
I didn't expect

100
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,790
to see it so soon in Pangu.

101
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,140
Apart from the one I'm wearing now,

102
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,540
this is the second piece of silk wear

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,300
in this whole main city.

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
We'll be a good couple.

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,220
Premium accessories?

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,460
I heard that it is 100% resistant
to physic damage.

107
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,410
You must try.

108
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,300
-You...
-You...

109
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,190
This silk wear is
resistant to fire damage,

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,900
not physic.

111
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,560
Sorry,

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,920
I'll compensate you another day.

113
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,300
It's alright. It's just a trivial matter.

114
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,170
I'll just hire someone

115
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,790
to make more

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,060
for you to destroy.

117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,960
Don't be arrogant
just because you're rich.

118
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,580
I don't want it.

119
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,060
How about this?

120
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,510
What's that?

121
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Killing weapon, be careful.

122
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,840
This is Supreme Sacred Ring.

123
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,500
It can kill a devil easily.

124
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,840
Mask boy,

125
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,770
you like this ring.

126
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,900
I'll give it to you.

127
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,530
President...

128
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,610
Sorry,

129
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,159
I have a ring already.

130
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,980
I still prefer the one old.

131
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,480
You made me shy.

132
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,710
I won't disturb you then.

133
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,090
You're welcome to visit Heavenly Society

134
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,010
anytime.

135
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,390
And I'll show you someday that

136
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,880
the new one is better than the old one.

137
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,320
Bye.

138
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,490
Mask boy?

139
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,260
You have bad love luck.

140
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,220
It's tiring to keep standing.

141
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,880
How about you take a seat there?

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
It's alright, I want to lose weight.

143
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,460
I swear to the lamp

144
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,820
that I only met her once.

145
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,660
I don't even know

146
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,120
that she's the President
of Heavenly Society.

147
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,670
I'll return all the boxes to her.

148
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,890
I'll return them now.

149
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't do it.

150
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,140
I didn't say anything.

151
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,890
Just put it here.

152
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,480
It's her good intention.

153
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,169
Alright, I'll go offline now.

154
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,220
Hold on.

155
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,730
How come you go offline
so early today?

156
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,390
Why? You don't want me to leave?

157
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,160
Alright.

158
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,540
Tomorrow is my first day

159
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,790
working in your company.

160
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,770
I need to dress up on the first day.

161
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,180
I can't make you lose face.

162
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,910
Right, Mr. Ye?

163
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,970
Alright then.

164
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,510
Oh yes.

165
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,770
Beware of Zhang Hao Cheng

166
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,190
after you arrive at the company.

167
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,360
He's the vice president of the group.

168
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,670
He's the most suspicious person
in the company now.

169
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,820
Yes, I know it.

170

there's a hidden meaning in your words?

00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,500
She said that she didn't know anything
when she joined us.

Bai Wei

387

is too humble.

388

I have a feeling

389
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,940
that she doesn't just join our company

for fun.

391
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,030
She must have a bigger ambition.

392
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,150
I agree.

393
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,250

how many surprises she'll give us.

some unexpected relationship
with her soon.

I'm your fan.

422
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,110
Can I have your signature?

423
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,820
I just joined the company
and I'm not familiar yet.

424
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,030
How does the shield anti-cheat software

425
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,370
restrict the player from going online?

426
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,120
I'll explain.

427
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,100
This system

428
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,020
will delete

429
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,450
the account of a player

430
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,370
who is online for more than 24 hours.

431
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,980
If the player is offline

432
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,940
for more than 24 hours,

433
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,190
the time calculator will return
to zero automatically.

434
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,270
Thank you.

435
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,590
[Ye Tian]

436
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
The situation is like this.

437
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,520
Because both of us are using
the same account,

438
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,520
the shield anti-cheat software

439
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,630
is observing me now.

440
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,840
If each of us takes turns for a day,

441
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,420
can we avoid its observation?

442
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,890
Actually, I've thought of a way.

443
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,730
It's to use

444
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,250
the time difference of
this shield anti-cheat software

445
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,330
to swap our bodies.

446
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,460
Then, we have to come back

447
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,170
within the longest online time of Pangu
which is eight hours

448
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,120
to swap another person out
from the game.

449
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,620
In this case,

450
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,850
this shield anti-cheat software

451
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,850
will not be able to detect me.

452
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,380
And you'll not lose your life in Pangu

453
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,540
because you're online for too long.

454
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,740
Anything you don't understand?

455
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,700
I can explain again.

456
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,480
I think I understand it.

457
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,610
But...

458
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,580
If

459
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,220
we take turns entering the game,

460
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,020
Ms. Ding Xiang will look for us here.

461
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,050
Do we still wait here?

462
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,460
If...

463
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,220
Of course we don't wait here anymore.

464
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,970
I'll bring you out from here. Hurry up.

465
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,880
Where are you bringing me to?

466
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,450
We'll arrive soon.

467
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,380
We're here.

468
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
This part is an unexplored area
in the map.

469
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,790
It'll be used as a residential area
for players in the future.

470
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,260
It's safe here

471
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,690
because there isn't any update yet.

472
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,180
No one will investigate this area.

473
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,180
Sounds quite good.

474
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,080
I think Ding Xiang
won't be able to find us here too.

475
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,370

665
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,530
Ms. Wei,

666
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,830
have you been under
too much pressure recently?

667
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,180
We can give up

668
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,210
if you really can't take it.

669
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,370
Forget it. I know I can't stop you.

670
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,360
You can go now.

671
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,680
Zhao Jia Liang,

672
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,260
thank you.

673
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,860
We should listen to the leader
on this issue.

674
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,070
I think so too.

675
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,010
Wei Wei.

676
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,620
[You forgot again that you're Bai Wei.]

677
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,620
Have a seat.

678
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,850
Take it easy.

679
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,250
I'm sorry.

680
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,060
The purpose of this meeting

681
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:31,830
is to discuss

682
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,350
our proposal for Krypton Gold Option.

683
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,389
I think we should remove all.

684
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,460
Mr. Lin,

685
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,139
these are the updated content
set by Mr. Zhang.

686
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,920
Putting an end to Krypton Gold in Pangu

687
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,550
is the rule I set up
with Mr. Ye back then.

688
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,870
This is a principle issue.

689
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,239
Just do according to what I said.

690
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,830
The focus of Pangu

691
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,199
is about the experience of the players.

692
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,830
Besides

693
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,510
practising martial arts

694
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,469
to improve the players' ability to fight,

695
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,700
we want the players to explore,

696
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,080
experience good and bad,
distinguish right from wrong.

697
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,480
And most importantly,

698
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,280
we want to restore
the communication between people.

699
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,340
The element that destroys
the purpose of this game

700
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,420
shouldn't exist.

701
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,460
If

702
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,960
we allow the Krypton Gold Option,

703
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,320
it will be equivalent to
defeating ourselves.

704
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,240
This game will just be a
normal game like any other.

705
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,200
Am I right?

706
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,190
Slow pace and experience

707
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,320
is the core advantage of Pangu.

708
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,970
You can continue.

709
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,970


710
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,480
You're right.

711
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,980
You just joined our company

712
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,800
and you already understand
the core spirit of our company.

713
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,500
Very good.

714
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,910
[Does this worth a round of applause?]

715
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,740
[Mr. Lin,]

716
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,190
[your requirement towards
new staff is too low.]

717
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,230
Are you Wang Ying Qiao?

718
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,880
What's wrong with you?

719
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,340
Don't you know my name is
Wang Ying Qiao?

720
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,650
You acted weird since yesterday.

721
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,820
You're like another person.

722
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,090
What's wrong?

723
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,080
How did I act weird?

724
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,770
You...

725
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,400
I can't tell

726
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,660
you about your weirdness.

727
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,900
I just think that you're weird.

728
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,530
Wei Wei, are you okay?

729
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,530


730
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,690
It's funny.

731
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,290
Yes.

732
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,590
Wei Wei,

733
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,540
Ms. Zhang is here, let's go.

734
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,880
Everyone in the company
said she doesn't like you,

735
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,710
you shouldn't offend her.

736
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,290
Bai Wei,

737
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,310
you're really good.

738
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,680
I heard that you put up
a good show this morning

739
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,660
and sat in Mr. Lin's position.

740
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,300
Looks like you're good at grabbing seats.

741
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,990
The place that you're sitting in now

742
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,380
was the special seat

743
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,430
when Ye Tian came here for coffee.

744
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,990
You even dare to take this seat.

745
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,480
[I'm used to it.]

746
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,870
Could you two please leave here
for a while?

747
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,740
What reason do you have?

748
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,790
The marketing department
will have a meeting now.

749
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,740
The unrelated people have to leave.

750
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,500
Ms. Zhang, we'll leave now.

751
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,200
Bai Wei, let's go.

752
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,630
This coffee place is open

753
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,380
to all employees.

754
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,500
There're no rules stating that

755
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,460
a department

756
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,680
can use it for any reason.

757
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,810
If I have misunderstood the rules,

758
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,410
we can verify with the legal department.

759
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,240
Yun Yun, let it be.

760
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,660
Don't fight with her.

761
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,040
Alright, Bai Wei,

762
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,600
you're arrogant.

763
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,650
The player, Hunting Dog, is locating

764
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,450
an experience cabin
with the code A8398X03.

765
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,380
This looks like the experience cabin code

766
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,400
of Ms. Wei.

767
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,260
I'm not interested to know

768
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,280
her identity in reality.

769
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,750
But, in Pangu,

770
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,520
she gave me a different feeling

771
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,360
in reality.

772
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,760
Although you have
the most players in Pangu,

773
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,420
you can't keep some people
who are meant to leave.
