427
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,990
If we were bullied by the seniors,

429
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,830

what would we do?

431

433
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,550
But you're no match to her.

434
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,420


435
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,710
That's a different story.

437
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,710
But I won't let her bully my friend.

439
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,610

450
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,030
I won the first set.

451

You'll serve this round.

Do you even know how to play tennis?

458

459
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,860

Why don't you forfeit this game?

461

It's none of your business.

00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,090


729
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,630
No sides will be taken,

730
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,620


731
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,500


732
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,510
no battles

733
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,260


734
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,270
and no shops

735
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,930


736
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,110
to purchase weapons and armors.

737
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,350
That means there won't be trades

738
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,340


739
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,870
and profit model.

740
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,860


741
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,870
We can organise online activities.

742
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,720


743
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,230
When I apply a user's perspective

744
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,100


745
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,300


746
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,470
and an objective angle

747
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,660


748
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,950
in preparing this proposal,

749
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,910
brotherhood is more 
interesting to me.

750
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,740


751
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,790
It will attract more users.

752
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,510


753
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,310
We think about our loved ones more
during festival seasons.

754
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,160


755
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,550
What do you think?

756
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,520


757
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,350
High in the mountains,
my brothers will miss me

758
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,250


759
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,350
like I'm only missing Cornel 
in the greenery.

760
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,200


761
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,430
We can organise a Cornel Festival.

762
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,330


763
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,110
You're right.

764
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,080


765
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,510
We can reconnect long lost friends

766
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,500


767
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,060


768
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,230
so they can reminisce the good old days.

769
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,550
Isn't that great?

770
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,520


771
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,270
Linda.

772
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,220


773
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,910
Are you okay?

774
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,860


775
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,430
Just an old problem.

776
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,410


777
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,350
I'm okay.

778
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,280


779
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,710
I agree with Bai Wei.

780
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,580


781
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,300
Through this Cornel Festival,

782
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,290


783
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,350
we can organise related 
theme based activities

784
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,340


785
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,100


786
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,150
and go on a tour.

787
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,230
In that case,

788
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,170


789
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,150
we'll achieve the topic-worthiness,

790
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,070


791
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,590
popularity and profit
that Mr. Zhang wants.

792
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,410


793
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,990
At the same time, 
we can promote positivity.

794
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,930


795
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,670
It matches the spirit of the times.

796
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,510


797
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,070
Mr. Lin.

798
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,940


799
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,630
There are no weak troops
under a strong general.

800
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,440


801
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,710
I'm flattered.

802
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,590


803
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,150
Okay.

804
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,950


805
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,870
We'll go as your plan.

806
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,770


807
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,470
Bai Wei.

808
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,360


809
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,230
Let's have a meal together

810
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,140


811
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,670
and talk about the details 
of Cornel Festival.

812
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,630


813
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,470
Mr. Lin.

814
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,330


815
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,150
We're done for the day.

816
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,140


817
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,950
Are you trying to exploit your employee?

818
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,780


819
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,350
That's not right.

820
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,190


821
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,660
I'll get going.

822
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,490


823
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,710
You gave her a stone

824
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,520


825
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,750
but she returned it?

826
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,610


827
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,990
You asked her out for a meal

828
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,980


829
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,750
but she refused?

830
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,590


831
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,270
Don't be a busybody.

832
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,130


833
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,030
Are you feeling well?

834
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,890


835
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,070
Yes.

836
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,020


837
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,550
Great.

838
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,520


839
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,750
Why isn't she here yet?

840
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,620


841
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,630
Why is she offline

842
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,620


843
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,630
for so long today?

844
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640


845
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,470
What is she doing in the office?

846
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,390


847
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,830
Why isn't she here?

848
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,610


849
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,070
What's wrong?

850
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:44,930


851
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,510
I'm exercising.

852
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,370


853
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,510
Playing hopscotch?

854
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,500


855
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,630
You're bored because 
you waited too long?

856
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,470


857
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,110
What are you thinking about?

858
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,990


859
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,780
Why are you so late today?

860
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,680


861
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,430
I'm busy today.

862
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,340


863
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,310
Moreover, Lin Feng asked me out 
for a meal just now.

864
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,210


865
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,190
You can't go.

866
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,120


867
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,190
Why?

868
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,120


869
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,040


870
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,380
You're a newbie.

871
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,180


872
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,190
You just joined the company.

873
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,240


874
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,550
You should keep your distance 
with the authorities.

875
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,110
If not, people will talk.

876
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,940


877
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,190
Just because of that?

878
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,090


879
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,110
It's for your own good.

880
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,980


881
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,190


882
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,150
We're colleagues.

883
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,270
It's normal to have a meal together.

884
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,350


885
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,990
It's normal.

886
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,910


887
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,250


888
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,260
Come to the Cornel Festival with me.

889
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,510
I designed it.

890
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,780


891
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,790
Let's go.

892
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,760


893
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,420
[Hulu Prefecture]

894

895
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,830
Hurry up!

896

897
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,990
Look!

898

Happy Cornel Festival!

Happy Cornel Festival!

902

Sir.

903
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,110


904
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,160


905
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,390
Here you go.

906
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,710


907
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,790
There's wine.

908
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,750
It's chrysanthemum wine.

909

00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,940


1093
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,750
with three guilds.

1094
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,700


1095
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,820


1096
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,830
Even if users already have
a specific partner,

1097
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,270


1098
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,510
their marriage will be 
automatically cancelled

1099
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,710
after signing this contract.

1100
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,700


1101
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,590
They'll be able to 
remarry someone else.

1102
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,550


1103
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,570


1104
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,750
Good job.

1105
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,590
You'll get a pay rise.

1106
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,450


1107
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,990
Thank you.

1108
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,970


1109
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,990
When you meet that guy later,

1110
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,090


1111
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,030
let him sign this contract.

1112
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,960


1113
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,110
What do you think, Dai Dai?

1114
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,040


1115
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,030
It's a great move!

1116
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,010


1117
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,430
Bai Wei will be pissed off!

1118
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,280


1119
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,550
But...

1120
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,460


1121
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,670
President.

1122
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,580


1123
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,470
I'm not sure if I should say this.

1124
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,210


1125
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:25,950
Spit it out.

1126
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:25,890


1127
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,030
You've never seen

1128
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,930


1129
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,510
his face before.

1130
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,250


1131
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,070
Why do you like him?

1132
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,030


1133
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,670
He's a mystery because of his mask.

1134
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,560


1135
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,190
It's interesting.

1136
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,060


1137
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,230
It's cool.

1138
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,170


1139
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,550
I can be imaginative.

1140
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,460


1141
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,870
What a great speech.

1142
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,800


1143
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,390
President.

1144
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,190


1145
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,670
You are the most

1146
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,540


1147
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,030
admired and respected person.

1148
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,770


1149
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,590
People are talking about it.

1150
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,540


1151
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,190
You're the one pursuing him.

1152
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,080


1153
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,150
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

1154
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,870


1155
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,670


1156
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,950
What do you mean?

1157
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,630
I do what I want.

1158
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,620


1159
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,030


1160
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,190
I enjoy as I please.

1161
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,150
Do you think I'm afraid of

1162
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,140


1163
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,270


1164
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,350
people talking about me?

1165
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,550
He'll figure it out one day

1166
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,360


1167
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,950
and stay by my side.

1168
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,930


1169
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,790
You mean based on

1170
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,650


1171
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,350
Ye Tian's current situation,

1172
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,400


1173
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,550
it's unlikely that
he can go online in Pangu?

1174
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,340


1175
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,110
Yes.

1176
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,070


1177
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,990
But...

1178
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,700


1179
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,350
One of the test results

1180
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,260


1181
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,950
is suspicious.

1182
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,860


1183
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,870
Tell me.

1184
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,770


1185
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,150
We found that there's
an abnormal neuron reaction

1186
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,040


1187
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,270
in his cerebral cortex.

1188
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,150


1189
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,910
That means his nerve centre

1190
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,730


1191
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,110
is being controlled.

1192
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,020


1193
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,990


1194
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,150
He also has some anesthesia reactions.

1195
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,150
You think someone

1196
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,110


1197
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,190
gave him anesthesia?

1198
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,060


1199
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,110
It's just a prediction.

1200
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,050


1201
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:45,950

Okay.

1204
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,870
You may get back to work.

1205
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,280


1206
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,310

Go find the prescription medicine

1210
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,370


1211
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,550
that stimulates nerve centre

1212
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,390


1213
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,390
and its purchase history.

1231

1233

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,420


1449
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,950
Tian.

1450
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:35,780


1451
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,150
An old friend came to visit you.

1452
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,020


1453
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:39,900


1454
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,030
Do you still remember her?

1455
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,430
Do you visit him frequently?

1456
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,380


1457
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,110
At least three times a week.

1458
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,980


1459
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,940
I'm afraid that he'll be upset

1460
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,930


1461
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,730


1462
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,860
if he doesn't see me.

1463
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,140
Can I visit him frequently too?

1464
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,020


1465
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,750
Of course.

1466
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,620


1467
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,470
I guess I was right.

1468
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340


1469
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,020


1470
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,030
What is it?

1471
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,510
I know why you returned

1472
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,580


1473
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,270
the Star Moonstone to me.

1474
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,250


1475
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,190
Tian always spoke about you.

1476
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,040


1477
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,190
I didn't think a lot at that time.

1478
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,130


1479
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,590
I thought you were rivals,

1480
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,380


1481
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,750
that's why he acted like that.

1482
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640


1483
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,590
You like Tian, right?

1484
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,470


1485
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,620


1486
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,630
Yes.

1487
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,510
I've always treated Tian as my brother.

1488
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,300


1489
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,350
No matter what I do,

1490
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,180


1491
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,630
I look up to him.

1492
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,560


1493
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,910
If I want something,

1494
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780


1495
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,910
I'll compete with him in fair way.

1496
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,750


1497
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,270
If I lose,

1498
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,150


1499
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,560


1500
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,670
I'll be happy for him.

1501
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,670


1502
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,870
But I won't give up easily.

1503
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,350
If not,

1504
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,210


1505
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,910
he'll look down on me.

1506
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,770


1507
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,870
Am I right, Tian?

1508
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,750


1509
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,550
What are you trying to say?

1510
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,440


1511
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,390
I like you, Bai Wei.

1512
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,290


1513
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,350
I heard from the other colleagues.

1514
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,040


1515
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,590
Xiao Lin Lin went to have a drink 
with her at the food stall.

1516
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,470


1517
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,990
They were so close.

1518
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,860


1519
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,190
I heard they even went
to meet Bai Wei's father.

1520
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,050


1521
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,470
Hi, Uncle.

1522
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:37,530


1523
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,780


1524
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:38,790
[You have a boyfriend?]

1525
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,150
[Why didn't you tell me?]

1526
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,100


1527
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,550
[You're disrespecting me.]

1528
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,360


1529
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,450


1530
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,470
[You've never told me that]

1531
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,200


1532
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,390
[you like me.]

1533
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,110
[Yet you don't allow me to 
fall in love with someone else.]

1534
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,970


1535
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,670
[Why did you do that today?]

1536
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,550


1537
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,790
[Who are you to do that?]

1538
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,720


1539
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,820


1540
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:53,910
[My friend?]

1541
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,300


1542
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,310
[Someone I'm seeing?]

1543
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,510
Or my lover?

1544
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,460
