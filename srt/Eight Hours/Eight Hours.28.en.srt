00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,450


904

[Mum.]

905
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,100


906
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,750
[Mum!]

907
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,820

[Wake up.]

[Wake up.]

912
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,870
Then, I slowly got closer to you.

913
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,540


914
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,710
And at last, I fell in love with you.

915
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,239


916
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,980


917
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,350
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

918
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,030
I didn't know how to tell you.

919
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,810


920
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,310
I did approve the experiment

921
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,100


922
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,030
that Madam Chen took part in.

923
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,540


924
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,949
I've always thought that she died
because of her illness.

925
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,650


926
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,820
I only found out the truth

927
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,670


928
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,550
two days ago.

929
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,400


930
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,590
Do you believe me?

931
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,420


932
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,230


933
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,540
I believe you.

934
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,190
Ye Tian.

935
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,060


936
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,470
It was a decision my mother made herself.

937
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,030


938
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,950
It had nothing to do with you.

939
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,640


940
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,590
I was wrong to blame you before.

941
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,050


942
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,870
I'm sorry.

944
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,110
Can you promise me one thing?

945
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,850


946
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,350
I hope when you get out,

947
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,340


948
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,740


949
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,750
you'll deal with the 2021

950
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,140


951
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,310
code error immediately.

952
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,910
I don't want more people to get hurt.

953

Only then

956
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,060


957
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,430
will my mother's sacrifice be worth it.

958
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,310
Ye Tian.

959
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,190

00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,790
Thank you.

961
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,480


962
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,430
In the days after my mum's passing,

963
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,250


964
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,310
you've been secretly protecting me.

965
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,210


966
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,390
I should thank Madam Chen

967
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,030


968
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,630
for making me meet the wonderful you.

969
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,990


970
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,430
Ding Xiang.

971
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,280


972
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,180


973
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,510
What is it?

974
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,390


975
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,590
Did something happen?

976
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,910
I can't log out.

977
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,570


978
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,370


979
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,630
You can't access the user interface.

980
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,050


981
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,510
Did you try tactile logout?

982
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,520


983
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,750
Of course.

984
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,910
Is there a history of epilepsy
within your family?

985
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,500


986
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,620


987
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,630
No.

988
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,190
Are you sure?

989
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,140


990
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,160


991
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,510
Yes.

992
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,750
How could this be?

993
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,220


994
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,870
At first, I categorized
the 2021 code error

995
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,980


996
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,990
as epilepsy

997
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,980


998
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,010


999
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,020
because when a player experiences

1000
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,080


1001
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,270
a strong stimulation,

1002
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,590
the abnormal discharge of brainwave

1003
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,580


1004
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,840


1005
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,230
is similar to that
of an epileptic seizure.

1006
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,110
Was my reasoning wrong?

1007
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,770


1008
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,910
Ding Xiang,

1009
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,530


1010
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,260


1011
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,270
what we're about to ask of you

1012
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,830


1013
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:02,950
is of utmost importance.

1014
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,230
We hope to have your cooperation.

1015
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,880


1016
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,510
We need to check your body.

1017
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,370


1018
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,870
Check my body?

1019
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,650


1020
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,110
Although from the outside,

1021
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,990


1022
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,790
you're made up of pixel blocks,

1023
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,560


1024
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,710
on the inside,

1025
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,560


1026
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,950
you are a composition of cognitive data.

1027
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,650


1028
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,910
You are the first,

1029
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,720


1030
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,430
and the only victim of 2021

1031
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,520


1032
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,790
I've encountered in Pangu.

1033
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,690


1034
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,590
I need to look into
all your cognitive data chain.

1035
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,260


1036
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,590
Okay. How will you do it?

1037
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,240


1038
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,070
Actually, this check isn't like

1039
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,060


1040
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,510
a normal check.

1041
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:33,940


1042
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,430
Because the cognitive data chain
is one whole entity.

1043
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,970


1044
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,310
So,

1045
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,070


1046
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,470
we have to observe you more intuitively.

1047
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,190


1048
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,750
Found it.

1049
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:54,700


1050
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,830
At her waist.

1051
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,710


1052
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,870
The colour on this part

1053
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,860


1054
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,780


1055
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,870
is much lighter, almost transparent.

1056
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,990
The colour is lighter, almost transparent?

1057
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,870


1058
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,470
I got it.

1059
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,040


1060
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,970


1061
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,110
It's because some information was lost
in the cognitive chain.

1062
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,710
The reason she couldn't log out

1063
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,540


1064
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,550
is because there is a loss in the chain.

1065
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,490


1066
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,310
Thus, the experience cabin is unable

1067
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,300


1068
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,310


1069
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,630
to collect the complete cognitive data.

1070
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,390
Therefore, it cannot process
the log out command.

1071
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,230


1072
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,380


1073
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,910
What caused the loss
in the cognitive chain?

1074
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,910
I remember now.

1075
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,540


1076
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,630
When I fought with the mosaic,

1077
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,620


1078
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,270
I think it touched me.

1079
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,770


1080
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,720


1081
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,990
If that's the case,

1082
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,180
Xiao Liang's guess was right.

1083
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,930


1084
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,550


1085
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,830
The mosaic is the 2021 code.

1086
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,270
If so,

1087
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,220


1088
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,030
it means I totally got the source

1089
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,090


1090
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,190
and cause of 2021 wrong.

1091
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,100


1092
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,670
To find out the specific problem,

1093
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,450


1094
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,270
I have to get to the core area

1095
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,210


1096
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,700
and run tests on the main server

1097
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,600


1098
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,150
to know for sure.

1099
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760


1100
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,430
Before that,

1101
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,180


1102
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,870
to ensure your safety,

1103
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,720


1104
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,630
stay close to us as much as possible.

1105
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,620


1106
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,750
Don't move around too much.

1107
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,460


1108
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,550
But it didn't take me long
to find this place.

1109
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,400


1110
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,510
How safe can it be?

1111
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,900


1112
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,150
Follow me to a place.

1113
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,890


1114
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,470
Boss,

1115
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,360


1116
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,470
there's an update
regarding Ms. Ding Xiang.

1117
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,350


1118
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,390
Sir,

1119
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,320


1120
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,510
she hasn't been into the office
the past two days.

1121
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,380


1122
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,030
Supposedly she's taking a break.

1123
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,680


1124
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,710
I offered to check up on her,

1125
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,700


1126
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,990
but she said no.

1127
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,710


1128
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,220
Also,

1129
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,840


1130
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,270
she's been hanging around

1131
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,350


1132
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,150
in Pangu the past few days.

1133
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,820


1134
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,630
I'm not sure what she's up to.

1135
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,470


1136
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,100
Okay, got it.

1137
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,000


1138
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:44,950
You may go.

1139
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:44,810


1140
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,990
Luckily, we planted our own man
near Ding Xiang.

1141
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,880


1142
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,470
Looks like that woman
is still not giving up.

1143
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,270


1144
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,230
Boss,

1145
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:58,930


1146
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,510
do you mean she's investigating

1147
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,100


1148
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,190
the 2021 issue in Pangu?

1149
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,730


1150
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,590
What else did you think?

1151
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,200


1152
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,950
Li,

1153
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,630


1154
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,620
use my authorization

1155
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,220


1156
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,950
to check her records in Pangu
the last two days.

1157
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,620


1158
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,260


1159
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,270
I want to know everything she did

1160
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,080


1161
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,270
and where she went.

1162
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,830
Yes, sir.

1163
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:17,710


1164
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,070
Boss,

1165
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,010


1166
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,950
she hasn't logged out for 48 hours.

1167
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,600


1168
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,080
[Total online time exceeds 48 hours]

1169
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,830
48 hours?

1170
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,500


1171
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,030
That's the longest

1172
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,080


1173
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,510
any player has been in Pangu.

1174
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,200


1175
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,150
Wouldn't she be...

1176
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,070


1177
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,950
Out of all possible timings,

1178

1179
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,310
she had to choose this moment.

1180
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,030


1181
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,950
So what should we do now?

1182
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,620


1183
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,830
This is my private asset in Pangu.
It's very safe.

1184
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,640


1185
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,830
You can use it as your temporary lodging.

1186
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,290


1187
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,270
Thank you.

1188
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:29,900


1189
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,350
Ding Xiang.

1190

1191
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,970


1192
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,470
What about you? Where will you go?

1193
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,390


1194
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,670
I've been in here for two days.

1195
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,280


1196
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,470
If I don't go and curb the issue,

1197
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,680


1198
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,110
very soon, not only Ding Group,

1200
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,750
but the public will also notice.

1201
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,970


1202
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,990
As soon as people start talking

1203
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,300


1204
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,500
about Pangu's huge security risk,

1205
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,830
the world will be turned upside down.

1206
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,380


1207
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,990
We can go with you.

1208
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,620


1209
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,820
No need. I can handle it.

1210
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,730


1211
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,790
I'm suddenly beginning to admire her.

1212
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,400


1213
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,550
What is it?

1214
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,300


1215
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,140
You're worried about her?

1216
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,900


1217
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,310


1218
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,030
She only has one life right now.

1219
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,710
[I didn't want to do this.]

[Knowing your personality,]

1225
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,870
[Why?]

1226
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,630


1227
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,950
[Why didn't I recognize you sooner?]

1228
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,820


1229
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,270
[I doubt Ye Tian could change anything]

over Celeste.]

1235
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,230
Whereas you

1236

1237
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,390
will belong to me.

1239
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,070
Celeste has the surname Ye.
