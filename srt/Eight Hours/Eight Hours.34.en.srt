He's not coming.

18
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,790
You're asking him

19
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,430
to trade his life for mine.

20
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,030
There is no way he will come.

21
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,190
Looks like you don't know
enough about a father.

No matter how heartless
he treats other people,

No.

51
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,590
Where were you when Mum died?

52

act like a good father all of a sudden.

Yes, yes.

56
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,630
I let your mother down once.

57
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,990
I can't let you down again.

Yun Er,

59
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,150
I have to save you this time.

60
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,310
I don't need you to save me.

61
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,310
Go!

62
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,910
Go!

63
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,790
Can you release her now?

64
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,790
I don't need you to save me.

65
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,750
I can let her go,

66
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,580
but before I do that,

67
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,390
you have to answer my questions.

68
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:27,750
Go ahead.

69
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,430
Why did you kill Wang Le Le?

70
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,070
What?

71
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,540
Wang Le Le?

72
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,909
Le Le?

73
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,590
What is going on?

74
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,470
On August 12, 7.30pm,

75
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,270
why did you send that man

76
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,180
to Laishui County to kill Le Le and me?

77
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,990
Because Le Le found out something

78
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,430
she wasn't supposed to know.

79
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,270
So,

80
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,350
you admit it?

81
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,070
I knew I couldn't hide it from you,

82
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,750
so,

83
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,150
I wanted you to die with her.

84
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,310
I just didn't expect

85
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,550
that you would survive.

86
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,910
But we had already left this city.

87
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,950
I know.

88
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,470
She was no longer a threat to you.

89
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,310
I couldn't take the risk.

90
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,910
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,070
You can tell that

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,030
to Le Le yourself.

93
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,350
I don't understand.

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,350
You knew that Le Le and I...

95
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,430
I didn't want to kill her too.

96
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,310
How could this happen?

97
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,030
I thought Le Le

98
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,550
was living the life she wanted.

99
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,070
At this point,

100
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,350
there is something you should know.

101
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,310
Actually,

102
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,390
I met Le Le

103
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,390
a long time ago.

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,030
We didn't meet each other through you.

105
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,230
Not through me?

106
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,310
Haven't you always wanted to know

107
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,910
who that woman is?

108
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,750
It can't be.

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,260
But don't worry,

110
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,430
before your mother died,

111
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,230
Le Le and I

112
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,030
never started any relationship.

113
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,070
You're lying!

114
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,180
That's impossible.

115
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,110
At this point,

116
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,950
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

117
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,190
Yun Er,

118
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,740
so,

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,270
you should hate me.

120
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,150
You should hate me.

121
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,590
This way,

122
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,670
when I die,

123
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,630
it won't hurt so much.

124
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,870
Zhang Hao Cheng...

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,590
Hate me. Hate me, Yun Yun!

So you didn't come alone.

128
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,990
Didn't I tell you to get on the plane?

129
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,670
Boss,

130
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,190
you have taken care of me
for so many years.

131
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,270
I can't just leave you

132
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,030
when you're in trouble.

133
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,190
This has nothing to do with you,

134
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,750
Li!

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,429
I did this all by myself.

136
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,309
Let me bear the consequence alone!

137

No!

See that?

141
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,670
This is a father.

142
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,910
Once,

143
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,990
I also had a chance

144
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,670
to be a father.

145
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,910
No!

147
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,590
Do what you should do.

148
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,550
Let her go.

149
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,230
Hunting Dog,

150
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,430
I'm begging you.

151
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,710
Please let him go.

152
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,030
I'm begging you.

153
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,830
Please let him go.

154
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,510
Yun Er!

155
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,110
Go now.

156
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,590
Forget me.

157
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,070
No.

158
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,350
Live your life well.

159
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,230
Go.

160
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,190
I'm not leaving you.

161
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,990
Ding Xiang!

162
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,950
And many people.

163
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,910
It's all because of me.

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,950
Go.

165
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,350
Leave with Li.

166
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,230
Go.

167
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,790
Not me.

168
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,910
I called the police.

169
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,390
I have turned myself in.

170
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,030
Zhang Hao Cheng,

171
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,870
the police have heard

172
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,030
everything you said just now.

173
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,750
Zhang Hao Cheng,

174
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,780
it's over for you.

175
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,670
You should bear legal consequences
for everything you've done.

176
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,950
You can't get away now.

177
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,620
Yun Yun,

178
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,350
all that matters is that you're okay.

179
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,150
You are okay now.

180
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,710
Have you reached Mr. Lin and Mr. Zhang?

181
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,030
No.

182
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,590
They are not answering their phones.

183
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,950
Even Ms. Zhang can't be reached.

184
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,710
What happened?

185
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,230
20 minutes ago,

186
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,430
I don't know what happened,

187
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,750

Thank you.

233
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,990
Are we

234
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,950
going home now?

235
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,470
No need.

236
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,750
Tonight, I'm taking you to some places

237
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,700
to do some things.

238
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,750
Things I promised you.

239
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,230
No.

240
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,990
You've just recovered.

241
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,310
You need to rest.

242
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,390
We've got plenty of time for that.

243
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,350
It's a big day for me today.

244
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,910
As my girlfriend,

245
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,350
you have to do as I say.

246
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,870
Buckle up.

247
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,350
Alright.

248
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,420
I will do as you say.

249
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,630
Let's get ready to go.

250
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,870
The first stop,

251
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,470
here we go.

252
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,710
I like this so much.

253
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,470
Boss, I will take this.

254
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,070
Got it.

255
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,310
What's the matter?

256
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,060
Are you afraid that
someone will take your girlfriend away?

257
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,980
Of course.

258
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,900
You're so short.

259
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,910
What if someone takes you away

260
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,470
when I look away?

261
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,230
You're asking for a beating!

262
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,990
Bai Wei...

263
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,950
Boss, I'll take these

264
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,950
and two T-shirts.

265
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:45,830
Okay.

266
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,950
What are you going to do now?

267
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,150
You will find out later.

268
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,390
This shirt is so plain.

269
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,540
This isn't my style.

270
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,790
It will affect my good looks.

271
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,510
I'm going to change it.

272
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,030
Don't move.

273
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,310
What are you doing?

274
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,190
Stand still.

275
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,780
Don't move.

276
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:14,870
Done.

277
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,230
What...

278
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,390
What did you draw?

279
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,750
Bai Wei.

280
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,270
My name.

281
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,830
What? You think my handwriting is ugly?

282
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,510
I won't dare.

283
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,030
Not only is your handwriting lovely,

284
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,150
but you are even more lovely.

285
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,950
Good boy.

286
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,710
I want to draw too.

287
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,150
Ye Tian.

288
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,630
You are quite obedient.

289
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,390
What's that saying?

290
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,390
The pain of coaxing your wife
will be much greater than

291
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,430
any pleasure you might derive
from upsetting her.

292
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,990
My old sow will punish me
to kneel on the washboard,

293
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,070
I don't want that.

294
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,790
Who are you calling an old sow?

295
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,550
Not you.

296
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,790
I was talking about...

297
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,390
Bai Wei!

298
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,510
How dare you!

299
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,150
Hang on.

300
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,670
Who were you calling your wife?

301
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,430
I haven't said yes yet

302
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,589
after I left Pangu.

303
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,990
Fine.

304
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,150
If you don't say yes,

305
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,950
I'm going to take you
to play something exciting.

306
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,270

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,590
Let me see. Let me see.

348
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,630
Stay still. Stay still.

349
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,950
Ouch.

350
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,830
Blow it for me.

351
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,590
Blow it.

352
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,750
Blow it.

353
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,700
♫ How can I find love? ♫

354
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,580
♫ I am your love ♫

355
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,060
♫ How do I keep you with me? ♫

356
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,270

♫ Love you hard, I am your harbor ♫

359
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,670
Thank you.

360
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,670
We're here.

361
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,110
Go knock on the door.

362
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,190
No.

363
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,830
You said you're hungry.

364
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,150
Look at the time now.

365
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,790
It's rude to disturb them at this hour.

366
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,150
Careful that the owner will beat you up.

367
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,940
Don't worry.

368
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,070
I'm their regular customer.

369
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,630
Boss, open the door!

370
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,270
Boss, open the door!

371
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,390
Who is it?

372
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,910
It's me.

373
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,470
It's so late now.

374
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,510
Why are you waking me up?

375
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,030
What do you want?

376
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,470
Coming. Coming.

377
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,630
Kang,

378
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,270
it's been a long time.

379
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,950
Miss me?

380
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,790
Xiao Ye?

381
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,950
You're alright now?

382
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,950
Do you serve my favourite,

383
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,950
the best water-fried egg I've ever had?

384
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,990
I don't have any

385
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,150
the best, best, best water-fried egg
in the world.

386
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,430
Come in. Come in.

387
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,590
Hurry.

388
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,590
Come on.

389
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,390
Have a seat.

390
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,350
Kang,

391
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,110
thank you.

392
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,070
Nothing has changed here.

393
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,990
How nice.

394
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,390
You brat,

395
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,510
you finally got yourself

396
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,430
a girlfriend.

397
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,350
You're catching on.

398
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,390
Good eye, Kang.

399
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,740
You are wearing couple shirts.

400
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,870
Everyone can see it.

401
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,100
You see,

402
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,230
she has YT written on it.

403
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,540
That means Ye Tian, right?

404
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,150
And this,

405
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,790
BW?

406
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,910
Let me guess.

407
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,670
Hi, sir.

408
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,830
I'm Bai Wei.

409
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,670
Xiao Tian told me about you before.

410
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,630
I'm sure he only told you
about my water-fried egg.

411
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,710
Why do you look familiar to me?

412
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,390
Have you been here before?

413
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,470
I secretly came
to learn your skill before,

414
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,430
but I didn't learn the essence.

415
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,110
It's just an insignificant skill.

416
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,830
There is no need to learn it secretly.

417
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,310
You want to learn it?

418
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,630
Come, come.

419
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,670
I will show you now.

420
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,470
Yes!

421
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,470
Come, come.

422
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,820
Add water.

423
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,070
Add the eggs.

424
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,710
Put the lid on.

425
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,390
Ms. Bai,

426
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,350
you want to learn this

427
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,670
because you want
to make it for Xiao Ye, right?

428
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,270
Xiao Ye,

429
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,310
you are a lucky brat.

430
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,790
You found a girlfriend
who loves you so much.

431
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,310
I love her too.

432
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,990
That's good.

433
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,830
How nice to be young.

434
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,310
If your...

435
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,110
If

436
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,430
my parents were still alive,

437
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,030
I'm sure they would like her too.

438
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,750
Yes, yes.

439
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,030
It's done.

440
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,470
Dear guests, please take a seat.

441
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,110
Here.

442
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,110
Thank you, sir.

443
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,710
Kang,

444
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,950
thank you.

445
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,430
It's my pleasure.

446
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,870
Hold on.

447
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,710
That's not how you eat water-fried eggs.

448
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,230
Watch and learn.

449
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,110
This is soy sauce.

450
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,830
Pour a circle on top first,
let it soak through.

451
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,950
Throw the chopsticks aside.

452
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,150
Hold the plate up.

453
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,100
Close your eyes.

454
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,350
You know what they say,

455
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,550
water

456
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,790
and the egg,

457
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,150
together, they make a perfect dish.

458
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,230
Nice!

459
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,230
Why are you laughing?

460
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,950
Eat it.

461
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,550
Leave it.

462
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,830
This is part of the experience.

463
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,030
Okay.

464
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:31,670
Kang,

465
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,350
we are leaving.

466
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,150
Come again!

467
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,590
It's been a long time
since I've felt this way.

468
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,750
Was it good?

469
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,430
Yes.

470
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,070
But I think you're being weird today.

471
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,590
What is weird about me?

472
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,070
Are you really not sleepy at all?

473
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,990
You're so excited.

474
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,350
I'm not sleepy.

475
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,780
Next stop,

476
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,270
here we come.

477
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,310
I kept telling you on the way here.
You wouldn't listen.

478
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,310
This isn't Autumn City

479
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,510
which opens 24 hours a day.

480
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,820
They are already closed.

481
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,910
Yes.

482
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,590
I thought I could go shopping with you,

483
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,270
and be your ATM.

484
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,150
Let's come tomorrow morning, okay?

485
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,110
No.

486
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,750
It's now

487
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,230
or never.

488
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,630
Get off the car.

489
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,710
Why are you acting like a child today?

490
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,670
What's wrong with being a child?

491
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,190
Wei Wei,

492
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,390
do you remember the dance

493
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,460
that was interrupted on the day

494
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,630
we got married in Pangu?

495
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,230
Would you like to finish the dance today?

496
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,150
Okay.

497
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,980
Beautiful Ms. Bai Wei,

498
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,710
may I invite you to dance,

499
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,870
please?

500
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,470
I accept your invitation.

I miss you so much.

550
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,150
It's been a long time.

551
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,950
I have dreamed of you

552
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,700
several nights as I do now.

553
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,430
I dreamed that you woke up

554
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,740
and appeared before me as you are now.

555
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,470

556
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,390

557

It's like

558
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,750

559
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,910
And then?

560
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,830
And then,

561
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,350
I never dreamed of it again.

562
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,910
It's not because I've forgotten,

563
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,270
it's because deep down,

564
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,030
I simply don't know how to face you.

565
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,430
Do you regret it?

566
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,910
Regret?

567
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,150
Will regret help?

568
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,430
Xiao Tian,

569
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,510

You've had

571
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,910
a hard time over the years, haven't you?

572
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,150
Of course.

that I finally beat Zhang Hao Cheng?

580

581

He no longer has power

582
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,070
in Celeste.

583
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,470
We can realise

584
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,230
our dreams and visions in Celeste.

585
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,750
He can't control us anymore.

586
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,030
Will you be proud of me?

587
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,870

588

You won't be proud of me.

590
