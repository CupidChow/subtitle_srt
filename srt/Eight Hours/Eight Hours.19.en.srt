00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
She hasn't been at the office recently,

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,380
so they haven't told me exactly when.

173
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,210
Well, we need their help.

174
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,620
Let's wait patiently.

175
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,090
Yes.

176
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,090
That's right.

177
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,450
It's like what you said.

178
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,800
That's how Bai Wei is.

179
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,130
She's affectionate to Lin Feng
for one minute,

180
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,240
and cold to him the next.

181
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,220
I can't figure out what she is thinking.

182
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,630
She's playing hard to get.

183
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,990
Bai Wei is quite something.

184
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,720
Ms. Le Le, you're saying

185
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,460
that Bai Wei is seducing Lin Feng?

186
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,020
Yun Yun, listen,

187
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,600
every woman

188
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,630
treats men differently in the world.

189
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,810
The carrot and stick approach

190
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,690
is outdated.

191
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,140
The thing about men,

192
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,240
if you cling to them, 
they don't care about you,

193
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,350
if you stay away from them,

194
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,860
they may be gone.

195
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,600
So, it's important that

196
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,140
you play it just right.

197
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,160
Oh, no.

198
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,140
Lin Feng's birthday party 
is the day after tomorrow.

199
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Based on what you just said,

200
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,590
Bai Wei will be there.

201
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,530
She will make a move on Lin Feng

202
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,870
at his birthday party.

203
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,350
What should I do then?

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,010
Silly girl, let me figure out 
what you can do.

205
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,670
I think

206
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,660
you should get him

207
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,200
a very thoughtful birthday present.

208
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,980
A birthday present?

209
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,410
The most important thing is that 
you can't be mean to Bai Wei.

210
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,980
You can't be capricious either.

211
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Why?

212
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,510
Because you need 
to show that you're big-hearted.

213
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,050
Only then, men will appreciate you.

214
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,900
A perfect woman

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,330
will give a man

216
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,640
complete control over her,

217
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,350
and surprise him occasionally.

218
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,990
Most importantly, when a man is vulnerable

219
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,150
and in need of help,

220
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,140
she will come forward immediately

221
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,910
and fully dedicate herself.

222
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,200
Yun Er, you're home.

223
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,730
Zhang Hao Cheng, this is my bestie.

224
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,710
Isn't this Ms. Wang?

225
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,500
It's been a long time, Mr. Zhang.

226
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,030
Yes, indeed.

227
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,580
When did you return home?

228
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,520
Not long ago.

229
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,210
Have a seat.

230
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,220
I didn't know

231
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,060
you two are best friends.

232
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,870
What'd you expect?

233
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,960
Ms. Le Le is the best.

234
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,830
Good, good.

235
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,760
Why don't you stay for dinner?

236
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,060
Yes!

237
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,030
Ms. Le Le, stay for dinner.

238
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,320
Are you sure I'm not imposing?

239
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,800
Of course you are not.

240
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,880
You are one of us.

241
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,660
You see, my daughter is right.

242
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,220
You're one of our own. 
No need to be so polite.

243
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,360
Alright.

244
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,920
I'd be glad to stay for dinner.

245
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,630
Good.

246
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,130
I recall your thoughts

247
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,240
on the perfect woman

248
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,740
from years ago.

249
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,620
I was really impressed.

250
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,080
And I'm curious

251
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,200
about your idea of

252
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,930
the perfect woman.

253
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,350
[Pangu]

254
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,650
Welcome, Grand Priest.

255
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,610
Grand Priest! Grand Priest!

256
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,950
I finally met Grand Priest.

257
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,650
My young friend,

258
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,590
are you still looking for that person?

259
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,690
I want to know exactly where she is now.

260
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,570
Let's see
what Grand Priest is capable of.

261
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,270
She's at Autumn City Square.

262
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
Autumn City Square?

263
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,180
That doesn't sound possible.

264
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,080
President,

265
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,280
is there something wrong

266
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,270
with this NPC?

267
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,900
How dare you doubt my skills!

268
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,700
Stop hiding.

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,750
Show yourself!

270
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,940
Get ready to attack.

271
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,790
Are you insane?

272
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,730
You're trying to kill an NPC?

273
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,810
Okay. Go on and kill him.

274
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,030
Let me see how you can kill him.

275
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,030
Kill him now! What are you waiting for?

276
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,130
No way. They really killed him.

277
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,770
Come on!

278
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,140
Heavenly Society
assassinated Grand Priest!

279
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,840
Autumn City is sending soldiers

280
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,070
to capture all the rebels.

281
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,240
President, run! Run!

282
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,260
Stop there!

283
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,440
They are so cruel.

284
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,750
President.

285
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:42,820
Let's go offline.

286
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,930
What happened?

287
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,620
I don't know what's going on either,

288
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,720
[NPC is disconnected from the server]

289
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,150
but this is what the system says.

290
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,930
The entire Autumn City is in chaos now.

291
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,490
This is impossible.

292
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,430
NPC can't die.

293
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,990
No. Grand Priest isn't dead.

294
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,360
He was just removed

295
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,720
by some special mechanism within Pangu.

296
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,150
When Mr. Ye created Pangu,

297
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,160
he left a lot of strange props in it.

298
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,450
Many of which I have never even seen.

299
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,839
He said

300
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,400
that he wanted to leave 
unlimited possibilities for Pangu.

301
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,990
What's going on? Who is that?

302
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,870
Welcome, General Long Wei!

303
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,160
Welcome, General Long Wei!

304
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,600
Welcome, General Long Wei!

305
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,410
The ones who committed a heinous crime
shall be executed!

306
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,670
Stop there!

307
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
Stop there! Stop right there!

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,100
What's going on?

309
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,760
Stop there!

310
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,380
The city has gone into lockdown. No way.

311
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,470
Why did he stop?

312
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,730
He can't leave Autumn City.

313
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,410
What is this NPC

314
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,460
that looks like Lin Feng?

315
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,980
He's General Long Wei.

316
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,640
If any player uses a special mechanism

317
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,270
to sabotage Pangu World,

318
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,930
General Long Wei will appear

319
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,930
and kill them.

320
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,460
And the player who is killed by him

321
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,260
will have his account permanently deleted.

322
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,360
He's that strong?

323
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,990
Isn't that just suspension of 
game account in disguise?

324
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,190
Thank goodness.

325
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,770
Die!

326
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,570
Die?

327
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,370
Come on and kill me!

328
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Come on!

329
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,660
Come on!

330
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,960
Cut it out. Let's go.

331
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,170
But with your narcissistic nature,

332
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,480
shouldn't you have used your face

333
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,330
for General Long Wei's face?

334
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,090
When have I ever been narcissistic?

335
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,000
You aren't a narcissist?

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
Why did you model your face into

337
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,350
the rookie receptionist then?

338
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,170
That was an accident.

339
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,080
But the truth is the truth,

340
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,810
you are more handsome than 
the rookie receptionist.

341
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,870
Let's just go.

342
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,000
Come and kill me.

343
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,540
Come on.

344
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,580
Let's go!

345
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,210
Here, Ms. Le Le.

346
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,210
Try this. It's super fresh.

347
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,200
These are all Madam Wong's specialties.

348
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,330
I specifically asked her to make them.

349
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,090
It's nice.

350
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,150
Ms. Le Le's bar is really fun.

351
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,920
We were so wasted last time.

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,550
Really?

353
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,910
You made it sound so fun

354
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,690
that even I want to 
check out the bar myself.

355
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,130
You want to come, Mr. Zhang?

356
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,710
My door is always open.

357
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,650
But I'm usually only available 
in the evenings.

358
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,270
If you both come together,

359
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,790
I will personally receive you.

360
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,360
I can't wait to go.

361
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,060
Too many dishes, honey.

362
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,430
Hello?

363
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,980
You got arrested?

364
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,770
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

365
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,720
Ms. Le Le, my friend needs my help.

366
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,510
I have to go.

367
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,240
See you again!

368
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,210
Aren't you going to have some more?

369
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,450
No, no.

370
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,380
It's almost time. I have to go.

371
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,040
See you again, Mr. Zhang.

372
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,760
Le Le.

373
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,820
Let's have a chat.

374
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,770

They are dissolved!

380
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,490
They are dissolved. This is great news.

381
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,390
Does it look good?

382
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,060
Yes.

383
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,870
Are you still upset?

384
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,110
Why would you say that?

385
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,870
Well, I know you.

386

After so many years,

440
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,090
this is the first time 
I came to your house.

441
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,460
If it wasn't for that recording,

442
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,000
would you never have let me come?

443
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,480
Le Le,

444
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,690
I always tried to avoid running into 
you and Yun Yun when you were both

445
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,900
in the house.

446
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,190
Today, however,

447
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,160
I find it interesting.

448
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,450
I can see that

449
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,810
Yun Yun really thinks of you as a sister.

450
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,610
Yun Yun is adorable.

451
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,870
I really like her too.

452
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,360
Le Le,

453
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,700
I want you to know that

454
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,770
what happened was an accident.

455
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,830
An accident?

456
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,040
-You mean you and me, or...
-Ye Tian.

457
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,480
The machine lost control, 
which caused Ye Tian's accident.

458
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,460
All Celeste Group's employees

459
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,950
should actually be grateful 
for this accident.

460
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,350
If it hadn't been for that accident,

461
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,400
Celeste would have been ruined.

462
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,080
What makes you say that?

463
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,630
Because he wanted to shut down Pangu.

464
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,040
You know,

465
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,010
when he does things,

466
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,590
he never considers the feelings of others.

467
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,190
Why do all the employees

468
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,870
have to pay the price 
for his recklessness?

469
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,760
That's not what I heard on the recording.

470
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,970
I know,

471
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,240
anyone who has heard 
the recording would think

472
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,950
that I was going to commit a crime.

473
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,330
But the truth is, when I say died,

474
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,690
I mean eliminate the impact on Ye Tian.

475
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,800
We can't let anyone know 
that Ye Tian's accident

476
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,790
was due to the malfunction 
of the Pangu cabin.

477
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,650
You know,

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,240
a  lot of eyes are watching this.

479
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,060
Any negative rumors could 
cause havoc at Celeste Group.

480
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,520
And the hospital could not issue

481
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,290
the medical test report I wanted.

482
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,180
So...

483
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,340
So, you never wanted to kill Ye Tian?

484
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,380
Of course.

485
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,260
Why would I want to kill him?

486
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,360
Then why are you hiding the truth?

487
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,940
I don't want to hide it either.

488
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,290
It's what I had to do.

489
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:17,930
Le Le,

490
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,690
I don't do these things

491
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,860
for myself.

492
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,800
I have to protect Celeste Group.

493
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,540
I want to watch it thrive.

494
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,430
I want Yun Yun to live comfortably

495
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,580
for the rest of her life.

496
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,990
I owe her so much.

497
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,850
Even now, I can still deeply feel

498
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,210
her pain and suffering.

499
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,800
As her father, I want to do my best 
to make up to her.

500
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,330
That's why Celeste Group can't fall.

501
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,060
The truth cannot be released yet.

502
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,710
Do you understand

503
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,070
why I am doing this?

504
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,190
I brought that recording.

505
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,620
There is no backup.

506
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
I won't let anyone else get it.

507
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,220
Thank you for your trust.

508
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,240
I trust you.

509
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,440
Le Le, I give you my word,

510
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,870
now that the glitch has been fixed,

511
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,020
I will do my everything 
in my power to save Ye Tian

512
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,070
and let him recover as soon as possible.

513
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,870
Hao Cheng, don't put 
so much pressure on yourself.

514
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,630
As long as you don't 
keep anything from me,

515
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,940
I will always stand by your side.

516
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,940
I promise you.

517
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,950
It's about time. I should get going.

518
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,460
Stay.

519
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,440
Your fridge is full of instant food.

520
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,980
You're eating junk food 
like this every day,

521
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,340
it's no surprise that you are weak.

522
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,410
♫ My yearning is like an ocean ♫

523
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,230
I have prepared many

524
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,340
nutritious dishes for you.

525
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,370
♫ Have you ever thought 
of rowing to the other side? ♫

526
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,590
When I'm not around,

527
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,740
remember to eat on time.

528
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,230
♫ I think there's a girl there ♫

529
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,650
♫ Waiting for me 
to take her to the future ♫

530
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,660
♫ My longing is like an ocean ♫

531
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,080
♫ I wish there was someone chilling

532
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
♫ So I wouldn't be alone ♫

533
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,890
♫ He will appear one day ♫

534
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,130
♫ Falling in love makes someone ♫

535
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,980

537
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,260
♫ Missing someone is a great pity ♫

538
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,870
♫ Can you show up ♫

539
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,210

546
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,310
And he said he didn't like me.

547
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,980
♫ How can I find love? ♫

548
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,050

Are you insane?

♫ How do I keep you with me? ♫

557
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,380
Everyone dies.

♫ I will stay ♫

559
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,570
Once you die, you are free from worry.

♫ Give you all my love ♫

561
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,100
♫ Love you hard, I am your harbor ♫

562
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,590
What's happening to me?

563
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,150
I'll get offline first.

564
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,670
Why? Why?

565
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,700
Why can't I get offline?

566
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,450
Hurry up!

567
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,850
Hao Ran!

568
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,800
Make way! Make way!

569
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,480
Please calm down.

570
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,270
Please wait outside.

571
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,460
Family, please wait outside.

572
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,190
Calm down.

573
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,240
We will take care of him.

574
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,430
Don't panic. Don't worry.

575
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,900
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

576
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,060
Our company will take care of it.

577
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,840
Don't panic.

578
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,420
Don't worry.

579
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:36,930
Sit here.

580
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,630
Sit here first.

581
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,810
Don't worry.

582
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,400
When will he come out?

583
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,830
Go and ask the doctor.

584
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,730
Don't be sad.

585
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,990
Our company will take full responsibility
for your boyfriend's accident.

586
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,530
Tell us what happened.

587
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,850
He has been playing 
this game since last night.

588
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,100
He hasn't been offline all day.

589
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,370
I went to get him in the morning 
after I made breakfast.

590
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,590
He was answering.

591
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,870
When I walked over to him, 
I found that he...

592
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,520
Smell of perfume?

593
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,290
[Boss, we have a problem.]

594
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,810
This way, please. Welcome.

595
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,760
Welcome, this way, please.

596
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,530
Please come in.

597
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,890
This way, please.

598
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:34,970
Welcome. Welcome.

599
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,080
I attended last year's party.

600
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,250
You're here.

601
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,090
Yes.

602
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,800
It's been a long time, Mr. Lin.

603
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,860
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

604
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,620
Thank you.

605
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,300
Thank you. Thanks.

606
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,140
Mr. Lin.

607
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,890
Mr. Lin, happy birthday.

608
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,460
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

609
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:56,860
Hold on.

610
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,860
Hello. Hi.

611
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,460
Penny for your thoughts.

612
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,890
Cheers.

613
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,290
This is really nice.

614
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,880
It seems like it was just yesterday

615
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,580
when you celebrated 
your birthday here last year.

616
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,640


617
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,660
I remember after we came back to China,

618
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,110
this is where I had 
my first birthday party.

619
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,770
The only difference is

620
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,870
Xiao Tian was here.

621
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,760
The three of us were still together.

622
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,900
I remember Xiao Tian said

623
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,200
we could borrow this place 
for our wedding.

624
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,950
Let's not talk about the past, okay?

625
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,450
Come in!

626
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,180
Come on, girls.

627
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,830
Leave your things here.

628
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,930
Let's eat and drink, 
and have as much fun as you want.

629
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,530
Okay!

630
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,630
Let's sit there.

631
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,270
Sit anywhere you like.

632
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,280
Make yourself at home.

633
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,210
Yes. It's really time to move on.

634
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,880
In the past...

635
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,840
I say, girls, listen to me,

636
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,530
that's the latest design I saw.

637
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,920
Don't you think you've gone a little far
with your joke?

638
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,890
You know who I am talking about.

639
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,400
This way, please.

640
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:30,900
This way, please.

641
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,490
It's been a long time.

642
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,140
This way, please.

643
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,180
My house, I'm back.

644
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,850
Thank you.

645
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,140
Please come in.

646
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,670
This way, please.

647
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,070
Simba.

648
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,580
Excuse me.

649
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,570
How do you know its name is Simba?

650
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,330
I just asked someone.

651
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,550
Simba's daddy is Xiao Tian.

652
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,650
When Xiao Tian was busy with his work,

653
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,840
I've always been 
the one taking care of it.

654
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,810
So, I just moved here.

655
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,880
I can look after his house for him too.

656
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,630
Simba.

657
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,740
Daddy will be back soon.

658
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,610
Got it?

659
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,630
Good boy, Simba.

660
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,040
Be good, okay?

661
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,200
Daddy will be right back, alright?

662
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,290
What do you think? Cute, isn't it?

663
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,950
Yes, yes.

664
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:21,540
Sure, sure.

665
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,370
Let's open the presents.

666
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,380
Go over there

667
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,100
and open the gifts you brought.

668
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,010
Let's open the gifts.

669
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,180
Okay, sure.

670
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,400
Come, come.

671
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:35,670
Boss.

672
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,400
You were the first to arrive on the scene?

673
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:37,960
Yes.

674
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,020
No actions from PR and 
marketing departments yet.

675
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,040
How is the test result?

676
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,010
Not very optimistic.

677
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,580
All his physical reactions

678
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,930
have now disappeared.

679
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Both his corneal and 
pupillary reactions are gone as well.

680
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,310
His vitals are still stable,

681
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,320
but recovery is no longer possible.

682
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,970
We will call this code error

683
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,190
2021 code error for now.

684
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,600
There is a very small chance

685
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,720
that a specific group of people 
will experience

686
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,310
abnormal brain wave discharge after
a certain level of strong stimulation

687
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,780
when logging into Pangu.

688
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,620
Like many patients with epilepsy,

689
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,860
this will cause 
temporary brain dysfunction.

690
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,810
When this happens,

691
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,570
Pangu will immediately take over

692
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,670
the user's brainwave consciousness,

693
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,380
separating the user's body 
from his consciousness

694
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,410
and causing the user 
to suffer from cerebral palsy,

695
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,700
and they will never be able 
to log out of the game.

696
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,730
How did it go with the family?

697
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,550
They are satisfied with 
the compensation we offered.

698
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,560
They've signed 
the confidentiality agreement.

699
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,220
They won't tell anyone about this.

700
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,750
Boss, everyone in the hospital 
works for us.

701
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,380
I've talked to the person in charge.

702
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,730
Don't worry, the news won't get out.

703
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,410
Ding Xiang is unpredictable.

704
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,720
It's hard to tell
whether she will collaborate with me.

705
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,290
We are in talks about 
Pangu's second phase investments.

706
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,260
At this juncture,

707
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,930
if we announce that

708
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,660
Pangu has a major security vulnerability,

709
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,090
imagine how chaotic the situation will be.

710
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,740
What should we do then?

711
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,740
Block the news. 
The press mustn't interfere.

712
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,950
Boss, it's easy to keep the press quiet,

713
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,650
but this patient's character

714
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,410
is still in Pangu.

715
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,070
If he spreads the truth in there,

716
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,700
how are we going to keep him quiet?

717
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,050
First, locate his account.

718
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,000
Go online and 
track him down in the system.

719
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,860
Tell Yi Da to keep an eye on the players.

720
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,650
If he finds someone 
spreading negative news,

721
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,330
block the account.

722
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,020
Also, keep this within the company.

723
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,350
Lin Feng mustn't know about this. Got it?

724
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,630
Copy that, Boss.

725
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,620
Let's check this out.

726
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,290
What is this?

727
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,440
Who is this from?

728
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,280
Me.

729
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,630
Thank you.

730
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,760
It's beautiful.

731
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,470
Xiao Lin Lin, check out my gift.

732
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,380
What is this?

733
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,560
Check it out.

734
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,240
It's a commemorative bat.

735
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,150
It's this year's.

736
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,890
This is the commemorative bat 
of the winning team this year.

737
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,770
It has the name of the entire team 
engraved on it.

738
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,360
Do you like it?

739
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,260
Of course I do.

740
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,210
It wasn't easy for me to get it.

741
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,920
Happy birthday, Xiao Lin Lin.

742
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:13,680
Thank you.

743
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,040
What did you get him, Bai Wei?

744
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,880
Happy birthday, Mr. Lin.

745
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,570
Thank you.

746
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,860
I didn't expect...

747
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,850
It's so beautiful.

748
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,510
So exquisite!

749
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,420
Why did I survive in Pangu 
when it was obvious

750
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,710
that my experience cabin 
was overloaded with voltage?

751
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,170
It's because someone injected me

752
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,930
with central nervous system depressant.

753
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,740
The external voltage was overloaded,

754
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,760
but because my consciousness 
was paralyzed,

755
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,190
like a blessing in disguise,

756
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,810
it became a piece of code in the system

757
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,000
and was saved.

758
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,810
You have probably been injected 
with a narcotic agent,

759
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,410
that's why your form 
can't be actualized in Pangu.

760
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,120
You mustn't fall asleep.

761
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,240
If you fall asleep, you will disappear.

762
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,450
Ye Tian!
