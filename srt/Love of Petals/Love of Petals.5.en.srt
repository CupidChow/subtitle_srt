Come on, Little Black, you need to work harder.

How could it have disappeared?

12

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,270
What a sweet fragrance.

15
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,040
I wonder what kind of spiritual treasure or elixir

16
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,630
has been cultivated within this little girl.

17
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,830
If my master were to drink her blood,

18
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,360
would he be able to achieve the full-body sarira?

Why are you here?

What... what just happened to me?

24
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,720
Did I get too tired

25
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
from planting flowers

26
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,510

27
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,800
She probably has no idea

28
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,630
that she almost died just now.

29
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,210
That demon must have sensed

30
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,920
the Flower Spirit within her

31
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,950
and mistakenly thought that draining her blood

32
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,159
would let her seize its power.

What do you mean?

This stuff is precious.

63
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,750
Natural fertilizer has the best nutrients.

64
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,120
Its roots are damaged now,

65
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,950
so it needs these nutrients more than ever.

66
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,830
It has to absorb them well.

No worries.

82
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,320
If she dies because of this,

83
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
won't the Flower Spirit return?

84
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,120
Don't tell me it'll just disappear instead.

85
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,670
Tomorrow is the last day.

86
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,390
You have to recover quickly.

87
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,910
Otherwise, what should we do?

88
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Little Black,

89
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,080
you must absorb the spiritual energy here.

90
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,390
Work hard,

91
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,300
and try to heal as soon as possible, okay?

92
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,630
How about I give you

93
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,840
some advice?

94
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,550
Master.

95
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,670
Do you have a solution now?

96
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,380
I can conjure a fake one for you

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,670
to pass off as real,

98
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,620
so you don't have to bother saving it.

99
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,360
Master.

100
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,200
This method may temporarily resolve the crisis,

101
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,550
but if discovered, it will still expose us.

102
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,480
Now it still has a chance to survive.

103
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,390
There's still time to save it.

104
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,630
If we give up now,

105
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,790
there will be no hope left.

106
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,850

107
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,720
no matter what, I won't give up on it.

108

Alright.

109
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,150
It's rare to see you

110
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,750
show such compassion for plants.

111
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,090
Then, as your master, I will teach you a mind technique.

112
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,130
If you master it,

113
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,510
you will be able to harness the Flower...

189
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,300
My Lady!

190
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,390
My Lady!

191
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,040
My Lady!

192
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,330
What's the matter?

193
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
My Lady.

194
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,320
The Black-jointed Grass...

195
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,330
What's wrong with the Black-jointed Grass?

196
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,240
The Black-jointed Grass's

197
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,910

Its broken branch is sprouting.

199
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,910
Its broken branch is sprouting?

200
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
We did it?

201
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,540
Let's hurry and go see it!

202
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,450
Where's Little Black?

203
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,870
Quick, let's go!

204
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,000
My Lady! Your shoes!

205
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,550
You haven't put on your shoes yet!

206
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,000
My Lady, please slow down.

207
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,890
Little Black.

208
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,480
Slow down.

209
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,600
Watch your feet.

210
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,590
Little Black. It has really sprouted!

211
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,290
Yes, My Lady, you really brought it back to life.

212
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,200
I'll go share this great news

213
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,390
with the Lord and Madam.

214
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,850
Remember to put on your shoes.

215
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,280
Little Black.

216
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,120
Master.

217
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,750
Master.

218
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,870
Master.

219
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
I brought it back to life.

220
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,360
Master.

221
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,480
I saw it.

222
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,510
Now put on your shoes.

223
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,560

[Black-jointed Grass]

225
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
You've finally sprouted.

226
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,080
Let me prepare some more nutrient solution for you.

227
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,550
What is Master doing?

228
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,000
Why are you staring at me?

229
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,630
Master, why did you suddenly appear?

230
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,080
I...

231
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,600
I didn't...

232
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,140
What's wrong?

233
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,130
You summoned me here.

234
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,920
It must have been you.

235
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,310
Tell me.

236
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,270
What method did you use to summon me?

237
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
I didn't do anything.

238
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,210
It wasn't me.

239
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,910
Could it have been a coincidence?

240
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,790
Master,

241
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
can you do me a favor?

242
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,470
Say it.

243
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,840
I want to go outside.

244
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,660
Right now, you are still under punishment.

245
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,410
The Sun's Mansion is heavily guarded.

246
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
How do you plan to leave?

247
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,440
That's why I need your help, Master.

248
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,200
Master, please wait for me a moment.

249
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm all prepared.

250
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,400
Let me carry my pack basket.

251
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,640
And with this,

252
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,380
no one will be able to see me.

253
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,070
Master,

254
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm ready.

255
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,640
Let's go.

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,480
Let's go.

257
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,510
Fine.

258
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,920
Let's see

259
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,250
what exactly you're up to.

260
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,180
As expected of you, Master.

261
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,070
♫The swallows bring a misty March rain♫

262
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,050

♫The drifting fish vanish beneath the waves♫

266
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,910
dislike cold and damp conditions,

267
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,720
and thrive in warm, humid climates.

268
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,440
♫As your touch stirs ripples in my heart♫

♫The bees and butterflies are lost in your fragrance♫

Orchids thrive in the morning sun

271

but dislike the afternoon sun.

272
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,030
If the environment is too shady,

273
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,210
♫And I pluck a jasmine branch to place in your hair♫

274
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,200
they will grow too leafy

275
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,590
and won't bloom well.

276
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,590
So this so-called Floral Thief

277
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,630
♫The moon sneaks into your eyes♫

278
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,350
isn't actually stealing flowers

279
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,590
but protecting them.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,880
♫And I just want to sketch the silhouette of your profile♫

281
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,750
Master, please wait for me a little longer.

282
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,830
There's one more pot up there.

283
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,260
♫This unintentional encounter is a written deed to unveil the destiny♫

284
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,120
♫I am waiting for the wind at the dike, also waiting for you♫

285
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,030
Why are you so eager to return these flowers?

286
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,010
♫I play the zither only for you, my heart like the lingering sound on the strings♫

287
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,110
When the Black-jointed Grass was stolen,

288
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,000
the entire Pingcheng fell into panic.

♫I am also reluctant to leave you♫

290
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,720

♫You effortlessly shatter the world's beauty♫

292
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,200
they would feel anxious too.

293
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,350
Before, I was only focused on saving dying plants

294
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,310
and forgot to consider others' feelings.

295
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,220
♫Your eyes hold endless tenderness♫

296
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,350
This experience

297
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,750

♫I write only for you, thoughts folded into a letter♫

299
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,590
A noble person

300
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,000
should save flowers with honor and integrity.

301
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,570
♫The prologue begins with love at first sight♫

302
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,900
Your growth

303
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,720
has taken a toll on me, both mentally and physically.

304
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,910
Shouldn't you repay me somehow?

305
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,850
Master,

306
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,070
what kind of repayment do you want?

307
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,790
Come take a look!

308
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,440
Finest treasures!

309
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
Rare and precious treasures!

310
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,030
All kinds of jade, right over here!

311
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,640
Of course, I want

312
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,680
the most expensive treasure in your entire city.

313
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,350
Master,

314
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,890
let's pick another one.

315
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,310
This is too expensive.

316
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,500
As the saying goes, fine gold and beautiful jade are treasures worth a city.

317
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,070
With the aid of top-quality jade,

318
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,440
transferring my spiritual energy to you

319
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,590
will be much easier.

320
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,000
Can you pick something else, please?

321
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,790
If you keep refusing,

322
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,590
I'll reveal your identity

323
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,310
as the Floral Thief.

324
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,240
Go pay the bill.

325
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,640
Sir,

326
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,750
how much is it?

327
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,920
Go pay the bill.

328
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,310
Zisu.

329
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,120
My Lady.

330
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,750
Zisu.

331
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,000
My Lady.

332
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,270
Here, take it.

333
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,960
My Lady, you're back.

334
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,780
D-Don't drop it.

335
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,310
Oh, my arms,

336
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,200
my legs,

337
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,070
and my money!

338
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,720
Feeling tired, aren't you?

339
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,160
My master from the Immortal Realm

340
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,200
truly comes and goes without a trace.

341
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,520
My master is actually a flower

342
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,240
that burns through money.

343
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,680
Look, look at this.

344
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,160
He spent way too much.

345
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,010
My purse took a serious hit.

346
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,890
Oh, my money...

347
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,160
Hurry!

348
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,720
Gu Qingcheng!

349
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,960
Ma'am.

350
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,270
Look at what you've done!

351
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,750
I...

352
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
What are you hiding?

353
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,140
Nothing.

354
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,470
I was so bored

355
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,090
that I...

356
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,920
I ended up storing some...

357
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,140
Just... just some useless things.

358
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,110
This is a jade pendant from Gemstone Pavilion,

359
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,400
and you call it useless?

360
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,920
Well, Gu Qingcheng.

361
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
You dared to sneak out of the mansion without permission.

362
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,640
No wonder the Black-jointed Grass died!

363
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,680
What?

364
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,190
Gu Qingcheng,

365
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,650
look what you've done.

366
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,960
Didn't you say you could bring it back to life?

367
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,160
How did it end up like this?

368
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,960
I have no idea.

369
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,510
Dear,

370
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,110
Madam,

371
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,200
look at this.

372
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,760
It's all your fault for spoiling her.

373
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,640
She really acts like

374
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,980
she's the young lady of this household.

375
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,440
She only cares about spending money and enjoying herself,

376
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,790
not about the survival of the Sun Family.

377
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,540
Qingcheng,

378
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,900
what exactly happened?

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,650
Father,

380
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,510
I did revive

381
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,000
this Black-jointed Grass yesterday.

382
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,720
I don't know

383
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,270
how it ended up like this today.

384
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,160
Dear.

385
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,830
Dear.

386
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,510
Well...

387
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,860
Fortunately, Pingkang hasn't married her yet.

388
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,170
Strictly speaking,

389
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,750
she isn't even a member of the Sun Family.

390
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,510
She's just someone you took in

391
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,780
out of goodwill.

392
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,750
Why don't we plead with the Princess

393
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,830
to punish only her

394
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
and spare the rest of our household?

395
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,050
Dear.

396
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,760
That's right.

397
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,320
My Lord, please plead with the Princess for mercy.

398
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
Let Miss Gu bear the consequences alone.

399
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,750
I don't want to die,

400
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,270
My Lord.

401
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,240
I don't want to die,

402
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,000
Dear.

403
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,440
My Lord,

404
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
My Lady.

405
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,030
I still have an eighty-year-old mother at home.

406
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,560
I can't die!

407
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,270
Dear, you must think this through carefully.

408
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,110
Enough, stop making a fuss.

409
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,420
Please, don't be like this.

410
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,380
Please, don't be like this.

411
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,660
I didn't steal the Black-jointed Grass either.

412
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,210
I really don't know why this happened.

413
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,400
Dear, you must think about this very carefully.

414
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,670
Silence!

415
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,870
This concerns the entire Sun Family.

416
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,030
It's all your fault. You bring misfortune to your parents.

417
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,050
The Sun Family taking you in is already

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,520
a great act of kindness from the Lord.

419
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,830
Lyu Gengyun.

420
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,360
You have half-demon lineage.

421
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,730
Being granted the chance to attend the Immortal Assembly

422
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,650
was already a mercy from the Heavenly Emperor.

423
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
To advance your immortal cultivation,

424
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,920
you stole the Black-jointed Grass.

425
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,620
It wasn't me.

426
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,480
The Young Lady didn't do that.

427
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,480
To win the Immortal Assembly,

428
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,660
Lyu Gengyun resorted to demonic arts,

429
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,690
ravaged the Flower Goddess Realm,

430
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,680
and harmed his fellow disciples.

431
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,900
You were the ones who started the trouble first.

432
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,490
[Envoy of the Heavenly Realm, Immortal Qingluan]

433
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,440
Lyu Gengyun only fought back in self-defense.

434
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,960
Don't think that just because you're close to Lyu Gengyun,

435
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,780
you can cover up his crimes.

436
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,570
Enough!

437
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,440
Against the likes of you,

438
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,550
I don't even need to use my demonic power.

439
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
I appeal to Your Majesty for justice.

440
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,310
Please revoke Lyu Gengyun's qualification for the Immortal Assembly.

441
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,890
I appeal to Your Majesty for justice.

442
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,000
Please revoke Lyu Gengyun's qualification for the Immortal Assembly.

443
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,780
I appeal to Your Majesty for justice.

444
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,570
Please revoke Lyu Gengyun's qualification for the Immortal Assembly.

445
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,590
Lyu Gengyun,

446
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,200
do you have anything to say?

447
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,010
You so-called immortals of the Heavenly Realm

448
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,000
are nothing but deceivers,

449
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,240
scheming in the shadows.

450
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,910
Do not stand out.

451
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,590
As the Heavenly Emperor,

452
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
not only do you fail to uphold justice,

453
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,740
but you also aid the wicked

454
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,940
and shield the corrupt.

455
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,840
Lyu Gengyun.

456
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,110
If it weren't for Immortal Yuxiao,

457
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,920
who granted you another chance

458
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,630
out of respect for your mother,

459
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,440
[Immortal Yuxiao]

460
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,790
you wouldn't even have the opportunity to stand here.

461
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,500
Don't mention my mother.

462
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,180
Instead of restraining your demonic power,

463
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,070
you dare to act out in front of the Heavenly Emperor?

464
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,200
Guards!

465
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,360
Seize him!

466
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,570
Lyu Gengyun, how dare you

467
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,480
defy the Heavenly Realm?

468
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,360
[Heavenly Emperor]

469
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,270
Aren't you afraid I'll sever your immortal root

470
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,510
and banish you from the Heavenly Realm?

471
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
This immortal root?

472
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,070
I don't need it anyway!

473
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
It really wasn't me.

474
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,790
Dear.

475
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,310
Please, make a decision for us, Dear.

476
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,760
Why are you all making such a racket?

477
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,640
Dear.

478
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,920
Dear.

479
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,750
Sir.

480
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,650
Ha!

481
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,110
So you did lie to me.

482
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,650
Take them to the courthouse.

483
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,830
Sir.

484
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,910
Please have mercy, sir.

485
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,410
Sir.

486
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,200
Qingcheng.

487
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,570
This all started because of me.

488
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,420
This has nothing to do with anyone else in the Sun household.

489
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,140
If you must arrest someone, take me alone.

490
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,880
Since you, young lady,

491
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,790
are so willing to take responsibility,

492
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,110
we'll arrest you first.

493
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

494
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,440
Dear!

495
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,550
My Lady!

496
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,690
Release the Young Lady!

497
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,260
Gu Qingcheng.

498
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,750
Let go of the Young Lady!

499
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,190
Sir, please show mercy!

500
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,000
Wait a moment.

501
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,610
What more do you have to say?

502
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,830
Sir,

503
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,770
the Black-jointed Grass has only temporarily withered.

504
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,800
It can be brought back from the brink of death.

505
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,380
Please, just give me one more chance.

506
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,690
I swear I can revive it.

507
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,350
Alright.

508
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Let's see what other tricks you have.

509
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,480
I'll be right back.

510
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,510
Qingcheng.

511
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,550
What is she doing?

512
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,000
Qingcheng, this...

513
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
Does she really have a solution?

514
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,200
The Young Lady surely has a way.

515
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
Dear, this...

516
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,680
Master.

517
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,060
It clearly revived yesterday.

518
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,090
The Black-jointed Grass became ill again

519
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,780
because the power you used wasn't strong

520
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,570
or stable enough.

521
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,300
What should I do?

522
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,690
Try again using the mind technique I taught you.

523
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,330
It's still not working.

524
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,500
Don't panic.

525
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,930
I'll guide you through it.

526
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,610
What is Qingcheng doing?

527
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
Dear, look.

528
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,790
What should we do?

529
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,760
Dear.

530
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,010
Has she gone mad?

531
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,810
Shut up.

532
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,310
The Young Lady has her own way of doing things.

533
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,160
You don't understand.

534
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,530
Focus your mind and take your time.

535
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,500
Try it on your own.

536
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,830
Alright.

537
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,770
I offer the power of my heart chakra...

538
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,680
Little Black,

539
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,780
you need to work hard, okay?

540
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
To nourish its roots and leaves...

541
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,730
Little Black, you must absorb the spiritual energy well.

542
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,590
And awaken its

543
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,040
vitality.

544
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,660
Little Black,

545
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,650
keep it up.

546
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,920
Master.

547
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,630
I brought it back to life.

548
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,820
Dear.

549
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,980
The heart chakra requires an extremely strong will to activate.

550
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,040
She managed to activate her heart chakra so quickly.

551
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
It seems her deep connection to plants

552
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,140
has honed her spiritual power.

553
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,430
No wonder she was able to receive the Flower Spirit.

554
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,030
Master.

555
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,490
My little flower has come back to life.

556
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,890
Take it down.

557
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,100
Thank you, Master.

558
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,110
Thank you, Master.

559
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,530
Dear, look at that.

560
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,400
It's really been revived.

561
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,510
It truly came back to life.

562
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,870
Look.

563
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,680
Sir.

564
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,910
Please take a look.

565
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,440
Thank goodness.

566
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,070
It's alright now.

567
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,470
That's great.

568
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,130
Thanks to Qingcheng.

569
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,310
Dear.

570
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,030
Sir Steward.

571
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,750
Sir Steward?

572
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,450
Why is the Princess suddenly summoning me?

573
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,400
Didn't the Black-jointed Grass already revive?

574
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,830
Does the Princess

575
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,670
have any particular taboos?

576
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,990
I fear

577
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,460
saying the wrong thing

578
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,450
or offending Her Highness by accident.

579
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,400
What customs and etiquette

580
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,230
should I be aware of

581
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,420
in the Prince's Mansion?

582
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,540
Sir Steward.

583
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,350
The people in the Prince's Mansion

584
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,160
can't even speak freely.

585
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,350
It seems the rules here are quite strict.

586
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,770
The Princess

587
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,850
must be difficult to deal with.

588
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,000
The Princess has arrived!

589
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,960
Commoner Gu Qingcheng

590
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,750
pays respects to Princess Ning.

591
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,590
No need for formalities.

592
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Please, sit down.

593
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,960
The tribute, Black-jointed Grass,

594
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,240
is actually a highly precious Dendrobium nobile Lindl.

595
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,110
It is sensitive to both cold and direct sunlight,

596
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,070
requiring strict control

597
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,350
over temperature and humidity.

598
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,980
Only the Chishui region in Qianzhou provides

599
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,320
the ideal climate for it to thrive.

600
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,550
How did you manage to

601
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,160
bring it back to life in Pingcheng?

602
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,720
In response to Your Highness,

603
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,620
I made barriers from leaves and tree trunks

604
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,780
to shield it from the harsh sun.

605
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,960
At night, I would remove them.

606
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,350
I repeated this process daily.

607
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,400
Fortunately, the controlled temperature was ideal.

608
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
The fertilizer I chose was also of the highest quality,

609
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,960
yielding twice the results with half the effort.

610
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,740
You are indeed a thoughtful person.

611
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,200
When the Black-jointed Grass incident happened,

612
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,480
I had someone look into you thoroughly.

613
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,830
The infamous Floral Thief who shook the entire city

614
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,480
turned out to be a young woman

615
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,950
in her prime.

616
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,750
Your Highness,

617
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,480
I have something to say.

618
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,270
Go ahead and tell me.

619
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,510
Ever since I was little, whenever I saw an injured plant,

620
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I couldn't help but take it home and try to heal it.

621
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,360
Somehow,

622
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,000
that habit led to a few misunderstandings.

623
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,400
I'm really not that scary.

624
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,310
It's just that these two vines are sensitive to light,

625
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,980
so I had to keep them wrapped up.

626
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,070
And that footprint was as big as a bear's paw.

627
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,630
Mother, I'm scared.

628
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,680
They

629
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,270
were growing Purple Moon Orchids here,

630
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,070
which only thrive in pine needle mulch.

631
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,510
But this type of mulch is too loose,

632
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,480
making it hard to stand firmly in regular shoes.

633
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,200
I had to wear these special shoes.

634
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,920
That's all there is to it.

635
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,750
Since you picked the flowers out of care,

636
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,550
it's understandable.

637
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,720
I've explained it to the Prince.

638
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,750
The Floral Thief case

639
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,690
will remain undisclosed.

640
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,550
Thank you, Your Highness.

641
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,110
I've heard that

642
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,510
you aspire to cultivate immortality

643
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,120
but have been swindled out of your money multiple times.

644
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,400
Your Highness,

645
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,270
do you also think I'm just daydreaming?

646
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,590
For a mortal to become an immortal,

647
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,000
they must progress through the Pure Spirit Root Stage,

648
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,830
Vital Sprout Stage, Mystic Branch Stage, and Exquisite Bloom Stage.

649
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,120
If you win the Floral Competition,

650
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,680
you can advance directly to the Mystic Branch Stage.

651
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,200
Floral Competition?

652
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,920
Pure Spirit Root Stage,

653
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,960
Vital Sprout Stage,

654
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,070
Mystic Branch Stage

655
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,150
and Exquisite Bloom Stage.

656
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,230
What new trouble have you gotten into now?

657
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,219
Master,

658
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,130
I've encountered a huge dilemma.

659
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,820
The Princess suggested that

660
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,150
I participate in the Floral Competition.

661
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,520
If I take first place,

662
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,150
I will have the opportunity to cultivate into an immortal.

663
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
But,

664
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,880
I feel like I should still

665
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,320
follow you, put in the hard work,

666
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,739
and take things

667
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,150
step by step.

668
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,280
Do you really want to become an immortal that badly?

669
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,690
What's so great about being an immortal?

670
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,070
Because

671
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,630
the person I wish to see

672
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,510
is in the heavens.
