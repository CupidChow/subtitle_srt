[Love of Petals]

2
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,140
[Episode 9]

3
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,070
Miss Gu.

4
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,240
Lan An.

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,079
What are you doing?

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,079
Miss Gu.

7
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
Thank you for your righteous assistance.

8
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,540
But the only solution now

9
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,540
is to remove my thousands of years of cultivation.

10
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,410
You want to remove your thousands of years of cultivation?

11
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,240
Why?

12
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,490
Only by dissolving my essence into the rootless water

13
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,510
can we save all the flowers and plants in the city.

14
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,470
Then...

15
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,000
Will you die?

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
Your cultivation is still not deep enough.

17
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,150
After removing your cultivation,

18
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,040
you'll definitely die.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,990
Aren't you afraid?

20
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
I am afraid.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's not a fear of death.

22
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,800
I just fear that

23
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,600
Lan An will be too lonely when she's alone in this world.

24
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,780
Shi Huai and I

25
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,400
are both outcasts which are not accepted by the world.

26
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,830
Actually, having met each other

27
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,680
is already our greatest happiness.

28
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,220
I beg you, Master. Please leave a piece of my living soul

29
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,590
so that I can stay by Lan An's side.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,280
I'll be deeply grateful.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
Miss Gu, please fulfill my wish.

32
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,520
You were originally an ancient divine beast.

33
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,600
I can't believe that you're willing to sacrifice so much

34
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,400
for your beloved woman.

35
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,710
Master.

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,520
Being able to make a sacrifice for the one you love

37
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,290
is the greatest happiness.

38
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,960
If you have someone whom you fancy,

39
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,120
you will surely understand how I feel now.

40
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,800
If you have someone whom you fancy,

41
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,010
you will surely understand how I feel now.

42
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,500
Someone whom I fancy?

43
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,100
What are you thinking about?

44
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Lan An

45
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,570
came to see me.

46
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,450
Shi Huai also came to see me.

47
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,820
Lan An said that

48
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
she was willing to remove her thousands of years of cultivation

49
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,800
even at the cost of her life,

50
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,190
and she would rather not implicate Shi Huai.

51
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,600
Shi Huai is also willing to die.

52
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,250
His only wish is to stay by Lan An's side.

53
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,680
Do you think

54
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
love always means sacrifice and selflessness?

55
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,950
Just like Lan An and Shi Huai,

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,720
even if they can never be together in this life,

57
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,640
they're still willing to make sacrifices.

58
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,200
♫I'll wait to meet you again in the thousands of times of reincarnation♫

59
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,690
♫Don't forget the previous life when petals are falling like rain♫

60
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,580
♫We've met again after a long separation and you sound the same as before♫

61
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,580
♫I long to look back so that my life can be complete♫

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,100
♫I travelled across the River of Forgetfulness and it was like a dream♫

63
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,000
♫The memories of the past almost drowned me♫

64
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,920
♫I've been missing you and I thought we could stay together forever♫

65
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,780
The doctor Shi Huai mentioned

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,050
lives in this herbal hut.

67
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,430
What a strong demonic aura.

68
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
This scale...

69
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,490
Is that

70
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,430
him?

71
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,830
Lyu Gengyun!

72
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,220
Lyu Gengyun!

73
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,810
Immortal Qin Shan.

74
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Qin Shan.

75
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,270
Lyu Gengyun.

76
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,190
I've heard that the demons in your place

77
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,880
have caused all the flowers and plants in the city to wither.

78
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,920
Is that true?

79
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,840
Why is he here?

80
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,920
You've arrived quite quickly.

81
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,000
I am the Judicial Lord.

82
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,440
Any wrongdoing within the three realms

83
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,780
cannot escape my discerning eyes.

84
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,930
Even with your myriad capabilities,

85
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,820
there are things that you cannot see.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,650
For example, something that doesn't exist in the Heavenly Realm,

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,750
that is, love.

88
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,450
Matters of love

89
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,910
are actually under the jurisdiction of the God of Marriage.

90
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,560
I, as the Judicial Lord, only focus on evidence.

91
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Your subordinates, Demon Shi Huai

92
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,310
and Tree Demon Lan An

93
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,080
have brought a disaster to the mortal world. The evidence is irrefutable.

94
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,750
Do you still want to deny it?

95
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,590
Your Excellency!

96
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,970
This matter arose because of me.

97
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,909
Please hold me alone accountable

98
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,320
and do not punish others.

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Your Excellency, please be merciful.

100
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,440
As long as you can spare Lan An,

101
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm willing to remove all of my cultivation

102
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,080
to save the flowers and plants in Pingcheng.

103
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:52,670
No!

104
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,790
Your Excellency, my cultivation is stronger.

105
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,870
I should be responsible for this matter.

106
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,390
No!

107
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,630
How can I let you be responsible for this matter alone?

108
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,840
Your Excellency,

109
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I beg for your mercy!

110
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,870
All the flowers and plants in the city have withered.

111
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,150
You two must come to the Heavenly Realm with me today

112
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,910
to face trial.

113
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,670
Your Excellency.

114
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Shi Huai and Lan An

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
didn't truly intend to harm anyone.

116
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,550
They were merely used by someone else.

117
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,610
Now they sincerely want to make amends.

118
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,200
May I plead with you

119
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,260
to give them a chance to repent?

120
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,440
It's you again.

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
If love outweighs the law,

122
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,030
wouldn't it mean that

123
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,690
anyone might dare to cross the line?

124
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,660
Isn't that so?

125
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,040
Does love always mean sacrifice and selflessness?

126
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Even if this couple can't be together in this lifetime?

127
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,920
Loving someone

128
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,860
isn't about sacrifice and selflessness.

129
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,380
It's for

130
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,050
staying together forever.

131
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,430
If I can remedy all of this,

132
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,200
then please forgive them.

133
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,510
What do you think?

134
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,810
You're saying that you can remedy all of this?

135
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,610
Give me a quarter of an hour.

136
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,270
Then I'll

137
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,090
just give you a quarter of an hour.

138
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,030
When the rootless water is mixed with the sap of the Lan An tree,

139
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,480
it can indeed be used to remove the Plants Killer Poison.

140
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,630
However, to revive

141
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,390
the flowers and plants poisoned by the sap of the Lan An tree,

142
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,160
we need to use the peony, the King of Flowers, as a catalyst.

143
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,240
That's not okay.

144
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,630
Using yourself as medicine

145
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,750
will harm your essence, Master.

146
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,080
As I'm your master

147
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,150
and you have made mistakes,

148
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,190
I should take responsibility, too.

149
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,930
Each of you should use half of your spiritual power to help me

150
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
and make amends.

151
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,150
Shi Huai and Lan An love each other so deeply.

152
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,760
They're supposed to stay together.

153
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
The word "love"

154
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,030
touches people's hearts

155
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,750
because

156
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,960
it's about an uncontrollable supreme joy.

157
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,240
No one needs to die.

158
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,480
And no one should die.

159
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,540
-It's raining!
-It's raining!
-It's raining!

160
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,900
-They're alive!
-They're alive!
-They're alive!

161
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,440
-It's raining!
-It's raining!
-It's raining!

162
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,270
My flowers are alive!

163
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,160
They're alive!

164
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,790
They're all alive!

165
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,930
God, please save my flowers!

166
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,030
Please save my flowers!

167
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,670
They're alive! They're all alive!

168
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
They're alive! They're alive!

169
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,150
Thank you, God!

170
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,480
Shi Huai and Lan An

171
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,950
used their cultivation to infuse the rootless water.

172
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,910
Now all the flowers and plants in the city have been revived.

173
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,750
It can be considered as making amends for their mistakes.

174
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,750
Lyu Gengyun.

175
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,930
You've consumed your spiritual power

176
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,130
just to save their lives.

177
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm really surprised.

178
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,730
Perhaps it's because I've come to this mortal world

179
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,670
that I now understand how precious love is.

180
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,960
Fine.

181
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,670
Since they have already been punished

182
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,150
and have made amends for their mistakes,

183
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,440
then I'll allow them to stay in the mortal world.

184
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank you, Your Excellency!

185
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,960
You're really an immortal who is tough on the outside

186
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,390
with a soft and warm heart inside.

187
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,590
That's great!

188
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,410
Stand up now!

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,410
Thank you, Master.

190
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,060
Thank you.

191
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,230
Thank you, Mr. Lyu.

192
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,360
Thank you, Miss Gu.

193
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,670
Stinky monkey!

194
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,040
Stinky monkey!

195
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,080
Are you sneakily eating the food again?

196
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,770
Luckily, we got your help today.

197
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
Because of you, Lan An's and Shi Huai's

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,150
problem was solved successfully.

199
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,390
Actually, they saved each other themselves.

200
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,910
Water it more.

201
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,370
Don't be stingy with the water.

202
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,610
He told you to water it more.

203
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
That's wonderful.

204
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,360
So love isn't about sacrifice,

205
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,000
but about staying with each other.

206
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,840
The prejudice against the Lan An tree

207
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,790
made everyone forget that

208
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,200
it's actually a medicinal herb.

209
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,060
The prejudice against the Shi Huai Bird

210
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,670
made everyone stay away from it.

211
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,440
But in fact, he's lively by nature

212
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,780
and loves to play with everyone.

213
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,320
When we mentioned demons before,

214
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,550
we thought they were cold-blooded, heartless

215
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,760
and cruel.

216
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,150
Isn't that also a kind of prejudice?

217
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,630
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

218
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,050
I've owed you an apology all this time.

219
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,100
I should have told you earlier that

220
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm not the Flowers Immortal Lord.

221
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,970
Actually, I should apologize to you.

222
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,670
Previously,

223
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,150
I always spoke rudely to you

224
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,840
because you were a demon.

225
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,150
But I wasn't really angry with you.

226
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,980
I was just a bit disappointed in myself.

227
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
Ever since I was a kid,

228
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,440
I've always had a dream.

229
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,080
I hope that one day,

230
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,720
by breeding flowers and plants,

231
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,950
I can ask the Flowers Immortal Lord to take me to Heaven

232
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,630
to meet my parents.

233
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,430
Maybe

234
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,240
I don't have the luck to see that immortal.

235
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,210
Nor do I have the gift for it.

236
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,390
Gu Qingcheng,

237
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,230
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,300
So,

239
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,830
are we reconciled now?

240
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,370
Yes.

241
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,690
What are you doing?

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,270
Put it on now

243
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,600
so that you won't secretly summon me again

244
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,810
while I'm bathing.

245
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,480
When did I do that while you were...

246
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,660
When... did I...

247
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,440
Nothing. I'm saying that since I'm your master,

248
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,840
you should listen to me.

249
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,790
Put it on now.

250
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,400
You even have the nerve to call yourself my master?

251
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,860
What have you even taught me?

252
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,300
I've taught you so much.

253
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,630
It's all genuine knowledge.

254
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,120
Making me stand under the blazing sun with a flowerpot on my head

255
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
also counts as genuine knowledge?

256
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Come on. This way.

257
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,670
Speaking of this,

258
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
if they're idle all day,

259
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm afraid it might lead to problems.

260
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,180
I want them to do a job

261
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,690
to make a living here,

262
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
but I don't know what job they should do.

263
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,200
Well, look at this place of yours.

264
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,440
There are mountains and rivers here.

265
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,960
Why not start a business?

266
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,310
They can plant flowers

267
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
and taste wine.

268
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,830
Planting flowers sounds good.

269
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,000
Then...

270
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,580
Let's call it Qingcheng Flower Nursery.

271
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,640
That's...

272
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,510
not quite appropriate, is it?

273
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,480
Why is it not appropriate?

274
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,640
When I, Lyu Gengyun, plant flowers,

275
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,270
I'm alluring, that is "qingcheng."

276
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,090
Qingcheng Flower Nursery is an appropriate name.

277
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,760
It sounds good.

278
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,640
You're the best at planting flowers.

279
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,550
How about

280
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,880
doing the business with me?

281
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,580
Will I get paid?

282
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,330
No.

283
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,680
Wait.

284
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,350
What if there will be profit-sharing

285
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,190
and you'll have half of the ownership?

286
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,200
Since you're begging me like that,

287
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,640
I suppose I'll reluctantly

288
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,220
help you.

289
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,130
[Sun's Mansion]

290
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,510
Pingkang!

291
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,510
I'd like to ask

292
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,110
how Wushuang's recovery has been

293
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,030
these days.

294
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,650
The flowers and plants are as lush as before.

295
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,920
I've mostly recovered.

296
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,210
I can return to my master's side now.

297
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,320
That's great!

298
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,430
I'm going to start a business with my master.

299
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,620
Qingcheng Flower Nursery's greenhouse is larger with more flowers.

300
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,990
Would you like to come and help?

301
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,220
We're short-handed right now.

302
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,770
Well...

303
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,050
"Mostly recovered" means that

304
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,760
she hasn't fully recovered yet.

305
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,830
Besides, in the early stages of your business,

306
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,270
don't you need to make preparations?

307
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,350
I think it's better for Wushuang

308
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,740
to stay here until

309
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,970
she fully recovers. It's safer in that way.

310
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,030
It's alright.

311
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,920
I'll go help my master.

312
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,480
Wushuang.

313
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,070
I think

314
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,420
what Pingkang said is quite right.

315
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,440
You haven't fully recovered yet.

316
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,220
Your condition might relapse.

317
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,570
If you go there now,

318
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,550
you might not only be unable to help my master

319
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,730
but also make him get distracted.

320
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,370
The opening ceremony is approaching, so there's a lot to do,

321
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,230
and he's very busy.

322
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,930
How about...

323
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,880
this?

324
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,220
I'll go there first

325
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,060
to tidy up the Qingcheng Flower Nursery.

326
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,160
You can come later. Don't worry.

327
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,380
I'm really skilled at flower-planting.

328
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,280
I can also plant flowers quite quickly.

329
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,270
Alright.

330
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,680
Then I'll stay here

331
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,100
to absorb more spiritual energy of flowers and plants

332
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
so that I can recover soon.

333
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,830
Pingkang.

334
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm going to stay in the Qingcheng Flower Nursery for some days.

335
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,870
I won't be living at home during this period.

336
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,440
My Lady!

337
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,720
My Lady.

338
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,070
You're not coming back to live here?

339
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,270
Then I'll go with you, too.

340
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,570
Who will take care of my flowers if you go?

341
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,160
And I also need you to take care of my parents.

342
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,440
My Lady.

343
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,590
Alright. It's not like I'll never come back.

344
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,380
Smile now.

345
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,130
Don't worry about our parents.

346
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,070
I'll explain everything to them properly.

347
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,270
Well,

348
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,520
you need to work hard, Pingkang.

349
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,590
I'll entrust Sun's Mansion to you guys.

350
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,440
I need to get back to work.

351
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,030
My Lady, let me see you off!

352
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,830
My Lady!

353
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,940
Step aside.

354
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,420
You annoying fat guy!

355
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,030
You know what?

356
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,130
There are so many flowers.

357
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,400
But that girl has actually managed to plant them all.

358
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,000
Some of these flowers

359
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,330
were even transplanted by her from the garden of her home.

360
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,510
Sun's Mansion happened to

361
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,090
be running out of space anyway.

362
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,750
Are you really going to do business with her?

363
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,590
Something's wrong.

364
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,830
You want to find a chance

365
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,000
to make her stay with you and retrieve the Flower Spirit, right?

366
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Luring the enemy deep into the trap.

367
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,200
Brilliant!

368
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,250
At first, you settled your conflicts with her.

369
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,920
Then you did things that she liked

370
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,340
to make her let her guard down.

371
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,830
Finally, you plotted to retrieve the Flower Spirit gradually.

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,310
What are you thinking about?

373
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,310
If you have any plans, tell me.

374
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,320
I'll help you.

375
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,670
Do you think this garden is a bit too small?

376
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,750
It might limit Gu Qingcheng's potential.

the first promotion event of the Qingcheng Flower Nursery.

380

Come on, come on, come on.

Little demons, it's time to go to the street and give out leaflets.

Okay.

I'm the boss.

398
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,370
As the boss, you also need to give them out.

This is your shop after all.

It's your duty.

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,270
Let me make this clear.

402
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,270
I won't give out leaflets to people on the street.

403
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,790
I'm not asking you to

Our Qingcheng Flower Nursery has just opened.

We have everything you need.

409
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,000
This flower I made by myself

410
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,350
is indeed very effective.

411
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,070
Master, you just need to stand here.

412
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,400
If there is a curious passersby,

413
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,480
just give him a leaflet

414
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,510
and ask him to go inside.

415
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,000
This flower is so ugly.

416
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,320
How can it match me?

417
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,120
It doesn't matter whether the flower is ugly or not.

418
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,860
You're handsome, and that's the key.

No way.

do such a tasteless thing?

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,150

Can you see that ugly peony at the entrance?

436
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,190
She actually put you at the entrance

437
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,140
to attract customers and give out leaflets.

438
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200

00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,690
actually, she has ulterior motives.

Please come in.

466
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,270
One hundred pieces?

467
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,360
Is there a problem?

468
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,900
No problem, no problem.

469
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,740
It's just that...

470
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,900
the color of purple balloon flowers is very rare,

471
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,310
so the price is a bit higher.

472
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,750
Well...

473
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,560
How do we calculate the deposit?

474
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,730
At least 50%.

475
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,170
50%?

476
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,300
-30%.
-30%.

477
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,400
30%, 30%.

478
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,880
Is it okay for you to pay 30% as a deposit?

479
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,200
The price is not an issue.

480
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,700
But I came out in a hurry today

481
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,160
and didn't bring any money with me.

482
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,840
Can I pay the full amount when I collect the flowers tomorrow?

483
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,130
Well...

484
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,110
This has been our first big deal

485
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,370
since the opening of our shop.

486
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,590
We can't miss it.

487
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,880
The risk is too high.

488
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,750
There's no deposit.

489
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,680
We can't miss it.

490
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,030
Sir,

491
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,320
we can sense the integrity in your eyes,

492
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,550
and you look sincere and polite.

493
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,350
As we're having a promotion on our opening day today,

494
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,640
why don't we exempt you from the deposit?

495
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,310
What's your name, sir?

496
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
My surname is Bai.

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,270
Alright.

505
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,030
Let's stop giving out leaflets.

506
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,200
Come on! Follow me to the back garden.

507
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,240
Let's go select the flowers. Hurry!

508
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,720
Let's go!

509
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll go to the kitchen to cook for you guys.

510
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,070
Just go ahead with your work.

511
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,590
Okay.

512
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,400
Thank you, Grandpa.

513
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,130
I want to eat braised pork today.

514
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,250
You're such a gourmet!

515
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,640
Everyone, look.

516
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,920
We have to choose

517
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,200
these half-bloomed ones.

518
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,880
In this way, when we deliver them to the customer tomorrow,

519
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,110
they'll look the best.

520
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,550
As for the ones with incomplete petals like these,

521
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,510
don't choose them.

522
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,550
This is our first order.

523
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,270
We have to establish a good reputation.

524
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,320
Okay.

525
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,820
But if we only choose half-bloomed ones,

526
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,110
I'm afraid we won't have enough for 100 pieces.

527
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,480
It's okay.

528
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,920
There are still some in Sun's Mansion.

529
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,420
I'll go fetch them tomorrow.

530
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,590
At 2 p.m. tomorrow,

531
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,750
remember to

532
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,070
pick these ones with which I've tied red strings.

533
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,160
Alright.

534
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,710
You're making such a big fuss

535
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,600
for this one order?

536
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,420
That's right.

537
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,230
Someone hasn't even made a single sale yet,

538
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,010
but he's making sarcastic remarks here.

539
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,070
Immortality cultivation is just like doing business.

540
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,550
Haste makes waste.

541
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,720
You don't understand.

542
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,830
That makes sense.

543
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
You understand.

544
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,270
Then why don't you make a sale

545
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,480
and show it to everyone?

546
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,600
Good things come to those who wait.

547
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,310
Just wait and see.

548
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,270
He's right.

549
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,200
You're not doing your job well, and your temper is even getting worse.

550
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,550
I'd like to see

551
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,590
how you're going to sell anything.

552
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,400
Look.

553
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,110
Hurry up! Pick that one now!

554
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,480
Stop flirting and get back to work.

555
