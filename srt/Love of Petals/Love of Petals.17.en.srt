[Episode 17]

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,770
[Flower Goddess' Celestial Mansion]

4
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,680
Where am I?

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
This is your celestial mansion.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,650
Celestial mansion?

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,310
Yes,

8
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,070
Flower Goddess.

9
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,710
You have just ascended to one of the Twelve Main Gods.

10
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,590
So, naturally, this is your celestial mansion.

11
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,870
Who am I?

12
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,750
You are the Flower Goddess, Fairy Liuli.

13
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,750
Fairy Liuli?

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Flower Goddess?

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,910
Yes.

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,110
How could I have forgotten?

17
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm now the Flower Goddess Liuli,

18
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,710
the head of the Twelve Main Gods,

19
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,079
supreme over

20
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,120
both heaven and earth.

21
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,980
Oh, Flower Goddess,

22
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,680
all the other immortals are waiting outside

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
to congratulate you.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,190
Let me help you dress.

25
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,520
But...

26
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
why do I feel like

27
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,770
something is missing in my heart?

28
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,510
Congratulations to Fairy Liuli, the Flower Goddess, on your ascension to the Twelve Main Gods.

29
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,240
Fellow immortals,

30
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,430
please rise.

31
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,800
Flower Goddess,

32
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,870
this is a Cold Jade Cup that I've spent hundreds of years refining.

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,240
Congratulations on your ascension to the Twelve Main Gods.

34
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,310
I humbly await your esteemed presence.

35
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,310
Qin Shan,

36
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,470
how thoughtful of you.

37
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,070
Congratulations, Flower Goddess.

38
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,160
Congratulations, Flower Goddess.

39
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,350
Since you've all come to my Flower Goddess Realm,

40
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,730
there's no need for formalities.

41
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Please enjoy the food

42
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,030
and drinks.

43
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,560
Flower Goddess Liuli,

44
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,600
the head of the Twelve Main Gods,

45
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
who commands the highest reverence in all realms

46
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,040
and has forsaken all worldly attachments...

47
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,240
Yet why do I keep having

48
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,320
this unforgettable and melancholic feeling

49
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,530
in my heart?

50
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,190
Flower Goddess,

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
a man claiming to be your old acquaintance

52
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,530
has rushed in without permission

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,710
and demanded to see you.

54
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,050
An old acquaintance?

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,190
I'm afraid someone

56
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,920
is intentionally trying to disrupt this celestial banquet.

57
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,700
Bring him to me.

58
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,960
Yes.

59
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,950
Flower Goddess,

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
that person has been brought here.

61
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,070
Who are you?

62
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,070
How dare you falsely claim

63
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,520
to be an old acquaintance of mine?

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,510
Flower Goddess,

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,159
do you really not recognize me?

66
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,570
Do you know the punishment for trespassing at a celestial banquet?

67
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,159
Guards!

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,159
Take him to the celestial prison!

69
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,730
That won't be necessary.

70
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,680
Flower Goddess, if you want to take me,

71
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,310
I'll surrender without a fight.

72
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,190
There's no need to send others.

73
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
Flower Goddess.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
I found a pouch

75
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,390
with this inside.

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,160
Do you recognize it?

77
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,950
Flower Goddess!

78
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Flower Goddess.

79
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,870
This person is deranged,

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,270
injuring our celestial soldiers all along the way.

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,600
I shall

82
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,720
execute him here for you.

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,720
Stop!

84
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,110
This bracelet

85
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,580
can protect your hands from harm.

86
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,430
Forgetting is more terrifying than separation by death.

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,950
As long as there's someone you like in your heart,

88
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,310
you're happy, after all.

89
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,510
Do you really think so?

90
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
Perhaps it's because I've come to this mortal world

91
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,430
that I've truly understood the preciousness of love.

92
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,490
Master...

93
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,600
Come with me.

94
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,790
I'll get you out of here.

95
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Fairy!

96
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Here, you are one of the Twelve Main Gods,

97
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,830
the Flower Goddess Liuli.

98
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,360
Once you leave this place,

99
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,450
all of this will cease to exist.

100
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,720
Everything you have

101
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,650
will be gone.

102
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
In a world without Master...

103
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,440
I truly have nothing.

104
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,670
Fortunately,

105
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,390
we both made it out.

106
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,680
Master.

107
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,440
So, the person I saw in the illusion just now

108
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,150
was really you.

109
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,510
I lost you again in the Misty Forest,

110
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,440
but luckily I found the pouch you dropped.

111
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Following this direction,

112
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,100
I arrived at the Moon-Gazing Well.

113
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,390
I knew you were determined to become a flower fairy,

114
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,160
so I thought

115
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,790
I should enter your illusion to find you.

116
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,590
I see.

117
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,560
I see.

118
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,970
Your Excellency, why do you

119
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,400
look a bit upset?

120
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,510
Yuxiao.

121
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,120
Behind this door lies your heart's desire.

122
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,910
Master.

123
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,910
Open it.

124
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,960
Is that you, Master?

125
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Face your inner self.

126
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,600
Master, where are you? Master!

127
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,000
Master.

128
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
The Luowei Flower Seed...

129
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,790
should have been mine all along.

130
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,320
You shouldn't have passed it on to someone else.

131
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,080
Why is he here?

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,360
Why is it him?

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,540
And now he has the nerve to come here.

134
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,840
The previous Flower Goddess, Jiang Li, had gone under suspicious circumstances.

135
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,230
He's just a temporary replacement.

136
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,910
He never received the hereditary Luowei Flower Seed

137
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,840
of the Flower God.

138
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,480
Indeed.

139
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,740
He doesn't even have the Luowei Flower Seed.

140
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,960
What kind of Flower God is he?

141
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,390
-At best, he's a joke.
-Shut up.

142
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,270
Look at him,

143
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,000
still acting all noble.

144
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,840
He only got the position of Flower God

145
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,700
because of Jiang Li.

146
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,270
Shut up.

147
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,960
Isn't that right?

148
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,630
Shut up.

149
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,080
Some King of Flowers, huh?

150
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,250
Shut up. Shut up.

151
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,690
Shut up! All of you, shut up!

152
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,150
Junior,

153
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,080
this is the Luowei Flower Seed you've been looking for.

154
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
The flower seed...

155
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,030
The flower seed...

156
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,750
But it was never meant to be yours...

157
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,120
Junior,

158
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,170
this is the Luowei Flower Seed you wanted.

159
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
This is the Luowei Flower Seed you've been looking for.

160
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,270
Junior,

161
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,270
this is the Luowei Flower Seed you've been looking for.

162
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,640
But it was never meant to be yours.

163
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,320
It was never meant to be yours.

164
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,860
But it was never meant to be yours.

165
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,980
The Luowei Flower Seed...

166
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,030
Immortal Yuxiao,

167
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,190
is this what you want?

168
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,790
Your Excellency, did you

169
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,770
just now also enter

170
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
my illusion?

171
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,550
I am already the Flower God.

172
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,510
I have long since abandoned all emotions and desires.

173
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Even though I entered the Moon-Gazing Well,

174
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,910
it couldn't trap me.

175
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
How could there be an illusion?

176
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,320
Immortals are really dull.

177
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,910
Theoretically,

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,770
we've all escaped the illusion

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,630
and reached the other shore.

180
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,960
But where is the Red Spider Lily?

181
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,910
Look.

182
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,240
Master,

183
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,600
Your Excellency,

184
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,600
does this mean we've passed the test?

185
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,750
Master.

186
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
Red Spider Lily.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,840
I can finally save you.

188
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,610
Why?

189
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,200
Why did she appear in my illusion?

190
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,160
Why do I always feel...

191
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,510
You smell it too.

192
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,270
Master,

193
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,150
it smells like deer blood.

194
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,840
Wushuang couldn't be here, could she?

195
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,310
How could Wushuang come here?

196
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,670
Come quickly and take a look.

197
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,200
Wushuang?

198
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,000
Wushuang?

199
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Wushuang?

200
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,030
Wushuang?

201
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,270
Wushuang!

202
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,900
[Qingcheng Flower Nursery]

203
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,870
How is she?

204
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
Her pulse is erratic.

205
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,200
Beyond her visible wounds,

206
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm afraid she has internal injuries as well.

207
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,970
We must immediately infuse her with spiritual power.

208
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,410
Otherwise, her life is in danger.

209
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,320
Wushuang.

210
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,910
She's just experienced the stagnation of spiritual energy within her body.

211
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,980
She's out of danger now.

212
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,240
Thank you, Your Excellency.

213
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,630
-Master.
-Wushuang.

214
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,480
Why did you go to the Misty Forest?

215
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,960
I...

216
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,200
I was worried about you.

217
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,960
How foolish.

218
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,030
If anything happened to you,

219
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
how could I ever be at ease?

220
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,080
How did you get hurt?

221
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,430
I...

222
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,360
I only remember

223
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,630
going to pick the rosary pea.

224
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,780
Everything after that is a blank.

225
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,600
Wushuang! Wushuang!

226
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,840
You're hurt?

227
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,390
How serious are your injuries?

228
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,120
Who hurt you?

229
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,440
I'll go make them pay right now!

230
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,080
I was in a hurry,

232
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,080
so I forgot to knock.

233
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,510
I saw the door was open,

234
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,910
so I just came in.

235
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,120
It's alright.

236
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,920
So, are your injuries...

237
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,210
serious or not?

238
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,480
I've forgotten so many things.

239
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,670
I can't remember.

240
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,030
Go make them pay?

241
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
With your combat skills, you protect me?

242
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,270
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,640
It's all my fault.

244
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,790
I'm so useless.

245
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Not at all.

246
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,630
Look at me now.

247
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,870
I'm still in one piece, aren't I?

248
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,870
I'll be better after a few days of rest.

249
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,670
Wushuang.

250
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,670
I know you're strong and brave,

251
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,600
but

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,270
I hope that in the future,

253
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,270
you could... you could be more careful, please?

254
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
Please don't let yourself get hurt again.

255
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,930
The poem says

256
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,870
red beans symbolize deep longing.

257
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,300
It must be a precious gift.

258
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,130
I picked this in the Misty Forest.

259
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,190
For you.

260
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:47,750
This is...

261
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,660
for me?

262
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,440
You don't like it?

263
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,620
I like it! I like it!

264
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,080
I like it.

265
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,870
Wushuang.

266
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,600
Do you...

267
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,240
know the meaning of the rosary pea?

268
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,720
No.

269
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,440
Then...

270
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,880
when you were in the Misty Forest...

271
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,380
did you miss me?

272
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,230
No.

273
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,000
I only remember

274
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,680
things before picking

275
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,000
the rosary pea,

276
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,430
and everything after that is forgotten.

277
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
Then why did you

278
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,360
pick the rosary pea for me?

279
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,550
You gave me bellflowers,

280
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,750
so I gave you the rosary pea.

281
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,160
Regardless of the reason,

282
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,110
this...

283
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,160
is the most precious gift

284
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,200
I have ever received.

285
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,480
It's just reciprocation.

286
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,200
As long as you like it.

287
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,070
I like it.

288
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,160
I really do.

289
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,930
According to legend,

290
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,080
Red Spider Lilies grow on

291
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,030
the opposite shores of the River of Forgetfulness.

292
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,020
The flower and its leaves never meet

293
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,340
for all eternity.

294
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,480
After you enter the Red Spider Lily Barrier,

295
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,930
time will freeze.

296
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,350
You'll be able to see everything outside from within,

297
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,130
but we

298
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,150
won't be able to hear

299
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,230
or see you.

300
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,790
However, as long as you stay within the Red Spider Lily Barrier

301
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,860
and maintain your current state,

302
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,730
you can preserve your condition

303
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,510
and won't die for now.

304
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,110
Meanwhile, Qingcheng and I

305
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,310
will find a way to save you as soon as possible.

306
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,830
Your Excellency, I wouldn't dare trouble you

307
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,550
to go to such lengths for me.

308
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,450
Master,

309
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,470
I will do everything in my power

310
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,550
to find a way to save you.

311
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,110
Lyu Gengyun,

312
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,480
I know you don't trust me now,

313
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,920
because while entering the barrier is easy,

314
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,070
leaving is difficult.

315
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,680
It requires the aid of immortal magic.

316
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,270
So,

317
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
you must trust me now,

318
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,000
as this is currently the only way.

319
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,240
Whether I enter the Red Spider Lily or not

320
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,330
has nothing to do with others.

321
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,000
It only matters what my heart wants.

322
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,270
Both in this mortal world and in the heavenly realm,

323
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,940
there are still many things I can't let go of.

324
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,640
Qingcheng.

325
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,550
Promise me that,

326
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,310
no matter the outcome,

327
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,680
you must not harm yourself,

328
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,110
nor force things,

329
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,440
and most importantly, don't

330
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,070
abandon your pursuit of immortality for my sake.

331
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,550
If you become an immortal,

332
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,640
you'll become the second immortal...

333
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,510
I've ever come to like.

334
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,590
The first one

335
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,210
is the Immortal Qingluan?

336
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,420
Oh, right,

337
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,830
and Ye You.

338
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,200
You must promise me

339
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,750
that, no matter what happens,

340
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,350
you can't run away,

341
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,520
and you definitely can't give up.

342
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,160
Okay.

343
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,310

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,920
I'll help block it all out.

379
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,440
Now you're not exposed to the sun anymore, right?

380
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,830
Master,

381
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,720
can you hear me?

382
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,830
Do you see the little umbrella I made for you?

383
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,550
I can't let Qingcheng struggle alone.

384
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,120
There's no one to disturb me within the barrier.

385
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,860
It's most conducive to cultivation.

386
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,000
If I can repair myself a bit,

387
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,640
it might give her more peace of mind.

388
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,700
Come take a look.

389
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,440
Come and have your fortune told.

390
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
Wushuang,

391
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,750
don't worry.

392
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,160
The Flowers Immortal Lord

393
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,000
has already helped Mr. Lyu enter the Red Spider Lily.

394
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,240
I believe Mr. Lyu will be fine soon.

395
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,550
But I still have a bad feeling about this.

396
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,310
You

397
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,070
just worry too much.

398
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,480
You should take some time to relax a bit.

399
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,030
There are only a few days left before the Floral Competition ends!

400
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,030
Hurry up if you want to place your bets!

401
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
The final round of the Floral Competition is about to begin.

402
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,590
Everyone wants to seize this chance

403
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,880
to do more business.

404
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,270
Buy a string of rosary pea seeds from me

405
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,000
and find your soulmate at the Floral Competition!

406
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,550
Gentlemen,

407
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,350
buy a string, won't you?

408
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,960
The more you wager, the more you'll earn!

409
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,720
Didn't you tell me

410
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,030
that what I gave you was the most precious gift?

411
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
But they're selling them all over the streets.

412
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,160
So it's clearly not that precious after all.

413
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,880
I truly know little of the mortal world's ways.

414
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,380
You don't need to laugh at me.

415
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,350
Just give it back to me.

416
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,170
Look,

417
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,540
I've already made a bracelet with it.

418
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,570
Now I can't return it to you.

419
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,920
Wushuang.

420
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,310
Its preciousness...

421
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,270
is not in its value,

422
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,640
but in the fact that...

423
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,000
you gave it to me.

424
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,550
T-There's only one in the world.

425
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,440
Rosary peas!

426
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,790
Come and buy some rosary peas!

427
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Miss!

428
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,270
I'm hungry.

429
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,160
Would you like to buy a string of rosary pea seeds?

430
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,070
Let's go eat.

431
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,310
Give it to your beloved.

432
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,550
Rosary peas!

433
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,110
What would you like to eat?

434
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,770
-Take a look.
-Choose whatever you like.

435
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,100
[Qingcheng Flower Nursery]

436
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,790
Are these enough?

437
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,590
Three...

438
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,350
Is this about right?

439
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Four...

440
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,790
Good morning.

441
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,960
Good morning.

442
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,790
Good morning.

443
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,510
During this time,

444
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,510
thank you for taking care of the flower nursery.

445
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,920
It's no trouble at all.

446
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,960
We

447
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,550
are also a part of this flower nursery.

448
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,270
-This is all part of our duty.
-Yeah.

449
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,480
At this time,

450
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,270
you've been

451
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,830
worrying so much about the Moonlight Peony

452
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,150
and Master

453
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,270
that you haven't gotten proper rest.

454
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,000
We

455
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,110
also want to share your burden as much as we can.

456
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,090
Thank you.

457
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,200
Let's go.

458
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,520
♫The dimming lamp still yearns for the moon by the door♫

459
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,520
♫The tea has cooled, yet I still recall that night♫

460
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,730
♫A lifetime of love, carried by one heart alone♫

461
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,830
♫Gone in the blink of an eye♫

462
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,690
♫No escape from illusion's end♫

463
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,030
Master,

464
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,910
♫Vermilion marks, silver bells, and a flowing robe—lost to sight♫

465
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,030
I will quickly find a way to cure you.

466
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,070
Then you can come back.

467
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,970
♫A crimson-stained sword holds a single thought♫

468
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,920
Master,

469
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,700
I really want to see you soon.

470
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,470
♫With one thought, I am lost to the dark♫

471
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,830
If only...

472
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,650
♫From that moment, my soul drifts astray♫

473
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,860
I could see you.

474
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,330
♫Leaving me alone to wander this vast world♫

475
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,260
♫Beneath the Stone of Three Lives, we vowed never to meet again♫

476
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,080
♫The vows of youth have long faded from memory♫

477
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,910
♫Three lifetimes, three fates—forgotten once reborn♫

478
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,750
♫Only the memory of that final glance remains♫

479
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,790
♫Who is playing that profound zither tune, the melody is too faint to hear clearly♫

480
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
The Red Spider Lily

481
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,040
is the flower of longing,

482
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,480
♫Who sighs softly as my drunken dreams fade?♫

483
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
standing guard alone by the river of time

484
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,270
to guide lovers.

485
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,380
♫What does life rely on?♫

486
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,550
When it meets lovers cruelly separated,

487
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
♫And death, too, stretches on without end♫

488
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,510
it tells them

489
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,790
that love, like water, can erode even the hardest stone.

490
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,940
♫Thousands of cups, all poured in tribute to the departed♫

491
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,920
As long as you firmly believe,

492
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,440
you will eventually reunite on the far shore.

493
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:12,200
♫Beneath the Stone of Three Lives, we vowed never to meet again♫

494
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,510
Even without the Red Spider Lily to guide us,

495
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,020
♫The vows of youth have long faded from memory♫

496
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,030
we will

497
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
find our way back to each other in this life.

498
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,460
I hope

499
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,850
♫Three lifetimes, three fates—forgotten once reborn♫

500
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,830
that in this life,

501
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,310
I will never be separated from you again, Master.

502
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,690
♫All I ask for is one last glance of love♫

503
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,650
♫Beneath the Stone of Three Lives, we vowed never to meet again♫

504
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,070
♫The vows of youth have long faded from memory♫

505
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,330
♫Three lifetimes, three fates—forgotten once reborn♫

506
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,900
♫What haunts me is the curve of your face♫

507
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:05,830
♫A love severed in this life, yet bound for three more♫

508
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,190
[What can one do before the Bridge of Helplessness? Before the Stone of Three Lives, three lives are ordained.]

509
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,190
[The red spider lilies bloom on both shores as the vine of sorrow entwines the breaking heart.]
