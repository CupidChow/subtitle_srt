It's truly a blessing from our Sun Family's ancestors.

You really know how to take credit for yourself.

154
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Pingkang's achievements today

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,680
are all due to his own diligent studies in harsh conditions

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
through his own efforts.

157
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,720
Alright, alright, alright.

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Everyone, please sit down.

Please sit down.

Come on. Let's sit down. Hurry up.

161
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Now that Pingkang has become a scholar,

162
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,040
I think these two children's marriage

163
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,430
can be put on the agenda.

164
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,940
Dear,

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,070
it's okay to let Qingcheng

166
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,390
marry him.

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,750
However, in the future,

168
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,870
if Pingkang

169
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,120
becomes the Number One Scholar,

170
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
then his marriage

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
will be decided by the emperor.

172
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,070
Guess what?

173
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,680
I won't guess.

174
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,870
Then I'll just tell you directly.

175
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm not interested in knowing it.

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm going to tell you anyway.

177
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,670
Your easily-obtained disciple

178
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,310
is really like a punching bag in Sun's Mansion.

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
We thought that since Sun Pingkang became a scholar

180
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
and returned home in glory,

181
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,070
their marriage would be settled.

182
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,600
Then she would live a good life, wouldn't she?

183
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,630
But in the end,

184
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,830
the Sun Family

185
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,750
thinks that Sun Pingkang will have a bright future,

186
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,950
so they no longer think that Miss Gu is good enough.

187
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,690
They won't let her be his principal wife.

188
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,950
They want to make her a concubine instead.

189
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,120
Don't you think this is...

190
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,270
Hey.

191
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,510
I'm telling you

192
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,360
your disciple is going to be someone's concubine!

193
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,179
You

194
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,640
have no sympathy at all.

195
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,870
After the marriage,

196
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,450
will the Flower Spirit become theirs?

197
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,650
When Qingcheng marries into the Sun Family,

198
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,820
it has to be a proper and formal marriage.

199
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,630
Only Qingcheng can be

200
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Pingkang's sole principal wife.

201
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,390
Back then,

202
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,200
when Gu entrusted Qingcheng to me,

203
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,320
I promised him that

204
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,460
I would never mistreat Qingcheng.

205
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
You and Pingkang grew up together,

206
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,630
and you know each other well.

207
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,510
The daughter-in-law of the Sun Family

208
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,270
will be you only.

209
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,270
Father.

210
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,890
Dear.

211
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,240
In the future,

212
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,850
it's Qingcheng and Pingkang who will live together.

213
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,230
Why don't we ask

214
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,100
about Pingkang's thoughts?

215
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,040
Pingkang,

216
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,350
what do you think?

217
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
Pingkang,

218
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,400
please speak your mind.

219
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,400
What's wrong?

220
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,190
Father.

221
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,610
Mother.

222
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,100
I'm sorry, but I cannot obey your wishes.

223
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,310
Whether I had passed the imperial examination or not,

224
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,550
I will not marry Qingcheng.

225
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,420
Sun Pingkang.

226
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,570
Do you realize what you're saying?

227
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,540
I think becoming a scholar

228
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,170
has made you so insolent.

229
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,830
How dare you be so disobedient!

230
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,750
If he doesn't want to marry her,

231
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,670
then it means he doesn't like her.

232
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,840
Dear,

233
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,190
please don't be angry.

234
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,870
Pingkang is an adult now.

235
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,670
Perhaps

236
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,270
he has a girl whom he fancies.

237
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Tell me

238
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,170
whether there's someone outside

239
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,970
whom you have a crush on.

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,270
Not yet.

241
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,250
If there isn't,

242
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,870
then why can't you marry Qingcheng?

243
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,570
I think

244
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,040
marriage is different from studies.

245
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
It shouldn't be facilitated by parental orders

246
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,350
or matchmakers' words.

247
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,780
Qingcheng and I

248
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,700
are like siblings.

249
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,610
But she is not the one I want to spend my life with.

250
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,680
Shut up!

251
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,540
I think you've lost your mind.

252
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,960
Go kneel in the Buddha hall now!

253
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,790
Dear.

254
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,790
You're not allowed to get up

255
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
until you think it through.

256
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,560
Pingkang.

257
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,870
Yes, Father.

258
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,750
Don't be angry.

259
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
The dew collected by this little disciple

260
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,950
is actually quite good.

261
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,380
Let's continue to talk about the story.

262
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
The Sun Family wanted to take Gu Qingcheng as a concubine.

263
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,840
However, Sun Pingkang publicly refused the marriage.

264
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,360
Now this handsome audience member might want to ask...

265
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,000
Sun Pingkang and Gu Qingcheng

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,030
have been close since childhood.

267
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,090
Why did he publicly refuse to marry her?

268
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,080
Has he

269
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,440
fallen in love with someone else,

270
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,640
or is there more to the story?

271
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,670
To find out what happened next,

272
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,910
I'll go gather more information.

273
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:00,960
I'm leaving!

274
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,160
I still need to retrieve the Flower Spirit as soon as possible.

275
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,140
Pingkang.

276
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,880
You've been kneeling for a day and a night

277
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,140
without eating anything.

278
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,750
I've brought some snacks that our mother made.

279
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,860
Taste one of them now.

280
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Eat.

281
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,740
Is it delicious?

282
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,960
Qingcheng.

283
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,200
In front of so many people,

285
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,710
I embarrassed you.

286
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,630
I'm not an outsider, so you don't have to say sorry.

287
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,920
Aren't we family?

288
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,990
Pingkang,

289
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,920
you know I don't mind at all.

290
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,710
As for our father,

291
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,560
he seems tough while talking, but he has a soft heart.

292
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,730
I've already talked it over with our mother.

293
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,690
From tomorrow onwards, you won't have to kneel as punishment anymore.

294
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,230
I know that

295
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,160
you've always

296
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,830
longed for freedom the most.

297
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,280
However,

298
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,320
you can't let go of our parents' expectations

299
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,510
and the constraints of this arranged marriage.

300
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,560
Using this debt of gratitude

301
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,440
to trap you in the Sun Family for the rest of your life

302
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,510
is too unfair to you.

303
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,750
So you did all these things today

304
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
for my sake?

305
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,540
You silly girl,

306
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,200
why are you looking at me like that?

307
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,100
It's just kneeling as punishment.

308
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,340
I thought

309
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,650
I'd be flogged as punishment.

310
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,570
It hurts.

311
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,830
Have another bite.

312
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,590
You should eat more.

313
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,870
It was not easy for our mother to cook this time.

314
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,590
Is it delicious?

315
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,460
Yes, it is.

316
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,330
By knowing both your enemy and yourself well,

317
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,560
you can always win in battles.

318
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,160
To retrieve the Flower Spirit,

319
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
I still need to figure out who she really is.

320
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,870
Master.

321
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
What brings you here?

322
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,800
It's windy outside.

323
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,590
I'm here to seek shelter from the cold.

324
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,280
I understand.

325
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,230
What does she understand?

326
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,630
Master.

327
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,990
Wrap this around you.

328
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,050
Don't catch a cold.

329
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,160
You don't feel cold now, huh?

330
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,930
Sit down.

331
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,420
Okay.

332
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,740
Chat with me for a while.

333
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,680
What would you like to talk about, Master?

334
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,410
Let's talk about you.

335
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,920
Me?

336
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,710
When you were a kid,

337
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,380
did you have any special experiences?

338
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,750
Special experiences?

339
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,610
I mean those unusual experiences,

340
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,050
which you think might be related to the practice of immortal magic.

341
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,390
If she is just an ordinary mortal,

342
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,830
why was my Flower Spirit absorbed into her body?

343
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,750
I remember it now!

344
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,290
I've seen an Immortal Lord before.

345
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,710
An Immortal Lord?

346
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,470
Where?

347
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,750
It was on a

348
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,630
very high mountain.

349
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,440
On that day,

350
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,470
my father taught me to identify flowers and herbs.

351
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,800
At the top of the mountain,

352
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,440
amidst the clouds and mist,

353
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,850
there seemed to be a strange phenomenon.

354
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,930
What kind of phenomenon?

355
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
The floating clouds and mist

356
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,180
suddenly turned into seven colors.

357
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,650
At this moment,

358
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,590
an immortal in a white outfit

359
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,960
appeared

360
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,560
among the flowers.

361
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,270
When he arrived, the flowers bloomed,

362
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,660
and a strong fragrance filled the air.

363
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,440
On which mountain did you encounter him?

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,830
On...

365
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,260
the mountain in my dream.

366
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,040
The Flowers Immortal Lord in my dream said that

367
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,560
I had great potential for wisdom

368
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,530
and the temperament of an immortal,

369
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,080
so I could definitely become an immortal through cultivation.

370
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,100
I couldn't see his face clearly in my dream,

371
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,040
but Master,

372
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,520
when you first appeared,

373
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,590
I knew it was...

374
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,980
you.

375
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:51,150
[Tianxiang House]

376
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,070
Waiter, we're out of wine!

Coming, coming!

382
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Master,

383
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,640

384
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,600

385
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,330
He gets along so well with Miss Gu.

386
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,670

387
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,990
He has even

388
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
taken her as his disciple.

389

[Jade-Eyed Fox, Millennia-Old Fox Demon]

390
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,640
He's actually not playing by the rules.

391
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,790
In my opinion,

392
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,640
he has no fighting spirit now.

393
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,070
And he's all alone.

394
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,230
Why don't we attack him

395
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
while he's unprepared?

396
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,580
He is the son of the Demon King.

397
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,550
Even that person fears him to some extent.

398
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,680
What should we do then?

399
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,980
Keep an eye on him.

400
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,450
If anything happens,

401

but he's keeping such a low profile.

406
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,280
While he's staying in Sun's Mansion,

407
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,750
I wonder what he's up to.

408
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,050
But I'm afraid Sun's Mansion

409
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,590
is about to face some turbulence.

My Lord, this...

416
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,800
Why have you all come to Sun's Mansion

420
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,710
and causing the death of his servant, Lai.

421
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,120
We are here under orders to arrest the suspect.

422
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,380
There must be some mistakes.

423
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,420
My son is just a fragile scholar.

424
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,710
He couldn't possibly commit murder.

425
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,550
Here's the arrest warrant.

426
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,480
That's impossible.

427
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,990
You must have misunderstood.

My son

429

has never even stepped on an ant since he was a kid.

430
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,230
How could he possibly kill someone?

431
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,750
You must have made a mistake.

I think you can recognize this object, huh?

434

Sun Pingkang's jade pendant was found on the victim.

Whether he's innocent or not,

00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,790
It was all about Sun Pingkang.

566
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,230
But he was being whipped hard.

567
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,710
Aren't you able to create dreams?

568
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,710
Then just create a dream that has nothing to do with Sun Pingkang.

569
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,720
Well, I could create dreams 500 years ago.

570
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,830
But during these 500 years,

571
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,290
I've been infusing you with spiritual power every day.

572
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,090
And when I woke up, I got beaten by you again.

573
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,050
Now I can only

574
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,030
peek into dreams.

575
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,360
Come back, come back, come back.

576
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,100
I haven't finished speaking yet.

577
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:39,480
Speak.

578
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,050
At night, a person tends to dream about

579
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,070
what he thinks during the day.

580
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,640
Now in her dreams, it's all about Sun Pingkang,

581
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,510
because Sun Pingkang is in trouble.

582
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,430
If you solve this problem for her

583
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,620
and then guide her

584
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,120
to recall the past,

585
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,310
then I'll have a chance to do it, won't I?

586
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,600
Pingkang.

587
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,520
What exactly happened?

588
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,190
You need to tell me everything in detail.

589
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,640
Only in this way can I figure out how to help you.

590
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,840
Pingkang.

591
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,020
After kneeling in the Buddha hall that day,

592
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,200
my legs were sore,

593
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,360
so I bought some herbal plasters at the street.

594
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,910
I accidentally bumped into Si Shulun's servant,

595
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,790
Lai.

596
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,600
I'm sorry.

597
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,420
I...

598
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,040
You think a simple apology is enough?

599
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,230
As Young Master Si, how can I endure

600
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,140
such a disgrace just like that?

601
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,230
What do you want then?

602
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,420
You passed the exam and became a scholar.

603
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,960
Don't touch me!

604
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,920
Why can't I touch you?

605
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,230
Let go of me!

606
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,120
Let go of me now!

607
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,170
Let go of me now!

608
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,330
Look what you've done.

609
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,220
You've ruined all my top-quality medicinal herbs!

610
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,920
Obviously, you...

611
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,730
What do you mean by "obviously?"

612
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,440
These are top-quality firefly mushrooms.

613
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,070
My father specially brought them for me from the capital.

614
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,590
Ordinary people don't even have the chance to see them.

615
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,490
Tell me.

616
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,630
Compensate me!

617
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,480
You...

618
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,270
Fine.

619
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,470
I'll compensate you.

620
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,750
I knew very well that Si Shulun was difficult to deal with,

621
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,880
and I didn't want to get entangled with him,

622
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,940
so I secretly took the firefly mushroom from home

623
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,150
to settle this matter.

624
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,450
From now on,

625
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,500
your young master and I are even.

626
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,340
I found and got this firefly mushroom by chance.

627
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,960
It's just a tonic.

628
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,310
It's not a poison.

629
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,530
Si Shulun and I have had a grudge for a long time.

630
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,170
This time,

631
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,880
he definitely won't let me off easily.

632
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,120
Qingcheng.

633
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,550
Go back now.

634
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,990
Don't get implicated in this trouble.

635
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,990
Pingkang, what are you talking about? We're a family.

636
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,510
What do you mean by getting implicated in this trouble?

637
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,360
What's wrong?

638
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,800
Nothing, Pingkang. Nothing.

639
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,150
Don't worry too much.

640
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,540
What's Gu Qingcheng up to?

641
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,660
This time,

642
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm afraid my fate is settled.

643
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:00,890
Pingkang.

644
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,070
Pingkang, don't say such things anymore.

645
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,780
I absolutely won't let you suffer an unjust accusation.

646
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,840
Gu Qingcheng.

647
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,510
Gu Qingcheng.

648
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,070
Why are you ignoring me?

649
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,680
Pingkang,

650
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,070
while you're in prison,

651
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,400
be nice to the chief jailer and other jailers.

652
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,510
Eat well and sleep well.

653
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,680
If you need more of those things,

654
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll bring them for you next time.

655
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,750
You have to take good care of yourself.

656
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,360
Got it?

657
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,310
There's still time for a heart-to-heart conversation?

658
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,120
Go home now.

659
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,330
It's almost dawn.

660
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,230
What are you looking at?

661
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,310
Nothing.

662
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,160
It's nothing.

663
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,510
Just make sure to take good care of yourself.

664
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,880
Gu Qingcheng.

665
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,960
Gu Qingcheng!

666
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,580
Are you still going to investigate this case or not?

667
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,660
Master,

668
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,880
do you mean that you'll help me?

669
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,550
Sun Pingkang's life or death is none of my business.

670
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,440
But since you are my disciple,

671
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,120
I surely don't want to see that

672
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,920
you're always distracted by this matter.

673
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,990
It'll hinder your cultivation of immortal magic.

674
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,410
I knew that

675
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,360
you wouldn't just stand by without saving him.

676
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,550
After all,

677
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,100
you're the virtuous Flowers Immortal Lord.

678
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,640
Master,

679
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,990
this situation is a bit tricky now.

680
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,600
According to them,

681
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,040
the servant, Lai, died from eating a firefly mushroom.

682
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,360
But this firefly mushroom

683
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,270
was indeed given by Pingkang.

684
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
If Si Shulun keeps harping on this point,

685
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,130
it'll be very difficult to handle this matter.

686
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,440
We haven't even investigated it yet,

687
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,470
and you're already giving up?

688
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm not giving up.

689
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,200
Officer.

690
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,440
This small gift is just a token of my respect.

691
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,710
I hope you'll accept it.

692
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,750
Please accept it.

693
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,230
Master Sun, please don't make me get into trouble.

694
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,840
Master Sun, please go back home.

695
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,990
Our Lord has already given instructions on this matter.

696
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,360
We'll definitely investigate it thoroughly.

697
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,560
Officer.

698
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,260
Here you are.

699
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,060
Please

700
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,580
be a bit more accommodating.

701
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,210
Thank you, thank you.

702
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,880
Master Sun.

703
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,310
Please just go back home.

704
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,970
You...

705
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,400
Since you're so concerned,

706
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,040
why don't you go comfort him?

707
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,880
My father has always been proud

708
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,170
and has been respected by people all his life.

709
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,740
Now because of Pingkang's matter,

710
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,310
he has to humbly beg others.

711
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,690
He certainly wouldn't want his juniors to see this.

712
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,600
Alright.

713
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,710
Let's go check on Lai.

714
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,970
Sir, why are you in such high spirits today?

715
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,550
I've finally dealt with Sun Pingkang.

716
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,700
Oh, what a pleasant thing!

717
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,700
Is it delicious?

718
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,640
Come on.

719
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,790
You're going to drain me soon.

720
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,600
Do you know that?

721
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,790
[Morgue]

722
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,310
Why did you hit me?

723
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,550
What?

724
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,960
You're still denying it, huh?

725
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
I didn't hit...

726
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,580
You'll be the stand sentry.

727
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,290
I'll sleep.

728
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,400
I caught you, didn't I?

729
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,590
My hands are right here.

730
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,690
Why is there a scent of a fox demon?

731
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,850
How come there is frost?

732
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,740
Firefly mushrooms are extremely Yang substances.

733
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,900
Even if he had been poisoned with it,

734
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,330
there shouldn't be any frost.

735
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,900
Perhaps it's because of

736
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,580
food incompatibility.

737
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,170
I remember that when I was a kid,

738
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,990
I once read about it in my father's ancient books.

739
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,510
For such extremely Yang substances as firefly mushrooms,

740
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,360
they can never be combined with a certain herb.

741
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,070
It would produce an extremely cold and deadly poison.

742
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,550
This herb is...

743
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,290
Water hemlock!

744
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,070
So,

745
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,670
Lai's death wasn't caused by

746
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,910
firefly mushrooms.

747
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,250
It was the person who gave him water hemlock.

748
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,600
It was...
