00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,640
In my life, I, Sun Pingkang,

4
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,640
have no regrets toward the heavens,

5
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,450
nor toward the earth,

6
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,990
yet I carry guilt toward my parents,

7
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,979
toward my beloved.

8
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,310

10
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,140
I have no more attachments.

11
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,579

13

15

What have you been painting?

16
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,860
Since you are so enamored with the mundane world,

17

I sentence you to descend

18
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,580
and endure 5 tribulations.

19
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,830
The first tribulation

20
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,070
was when I wandered destitute

21
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,230
and eventually froze to death on the streets.

22
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,100
The second tribulation

23
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,310
was when I rose to glory in my youth

24
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,380
and waged wars across the land,

25
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,380
only to meet an early end

26
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,350
with an arrow through my heart.

27
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,030
The third tribulation

28
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,190
was when I was blinded by greed

29
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,260
and pursued wealth above all else,

30
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,980
only to reap the consequences

31
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,030
and perish by swallowing gold.

32
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
The fourth tribulation

33
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,630
was when I was ravaged by illness

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,700
and abandoned by all, with no one to turn to

35
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,400
as I withered away in solitude.

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,380
Yet none of these four tribulations

37
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,790
could compare to the unbearable torment

38
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,140

54
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,260

Only now have I regained my rightful place.

85

So, are you returning to the Heavenly Realm soon?

86

91
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,630
before we reunite in the Heavenly Realm.

92
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,950
After everything I've been through lately,

93
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,760

95

saving Mr. Lyu,

102
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,310
then perhaps you should go to Shouyang Mountain.

Shouyang Mountain?

104

105

107

108

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,310

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,860
♫Don't forget the previous life when petals are falling like rain♫

193
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,460
Surprised?

194
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,610
Let me tell you,

195
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,110
I'm really doomed to a life of toil.

196
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,740
♫We've met again after a long separation and you sound the same as before♫

197
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,260
Back then, Immortal Qingluan told me to watch over Lyu Gengyun,

198
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,950
and I guarded him for 500 years.

199
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,740
♫I long to look back so that my life can be complete♫

200
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,460
That ungrateful Lyu Gengyun dismissed me

201
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,740
with just one word!

202
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,260
♫I travelled across the River of Forgetfulness and it was like a dream♫

203
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,620

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,550
You can't just dismiss me, okay?

210
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,070
Okay.

211
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,800
♫A leap forward♫

212

♫Fearless of reincarnation♫

214
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,860

[Leisure House, Shouyang Mountain]

230
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,340
We're here.

231
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,190
It's right here?

232
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,030
Yes.

233
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,740
Come on.

234
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,460
It's here.

235
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,750
Well...

236
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,060
There's a mechanism.

237
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,170
It's this one.

238
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,740
This one.

239
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,600
Come in!

240
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,310
We're finally here.

241
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,740
This place is so elegant.

242
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,220
Of course.

243
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,860
Senior Jiang Li has exquisite taste.

244
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,250
Is this place always cleaned and maintained?

245
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,220
I don't know about that.

246
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,980
I've only been here once before with Immortal Qingluan.

247
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,070
Maybe he

248
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,500
had someone clean it.

249
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,860
That's great.

250
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm exhausted.

251
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,820
"Three Scrolls of Flora"?

252
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,030
Is that useful?

253
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,960
Can I take a look?

254
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,900
Go ahead.

255
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,430
There's the annotation of the herb

256
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,070
I wanted to look up last time.

257
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,340
Where is it?

258
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,500
How dare you!

259
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,580
Who are you?

260
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,550
How dare you trespass into Leisure House!

261
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,390
We...

262
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,190
And who are you?

263
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,860
How dare you trespass into Leisure House?

264
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,940
I'm Longque, the Mountain God of Shouyang Mountain,

265
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,590
[Mountain God, Longque]

266
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,270
and once the immortal maid of Flower Goddess Jiang Li.

267
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,580
If you don't tell me who you are,

268
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,790
don't blame me for being impolite.

269
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,580
How come the Mountain God of Shouyang Mountain

270
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,850
a little girl?

271
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,380
You...

272
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,820
Little Sparrow, listen carefully.

273
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,270
Do you know who this is?

274
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,270
Gu Qingcheng,

275
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,100
the beloved of Lyu Gengyun,

276
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,430
son of the Flower Goddess Jiang Li and the Demon King Bai Yu.

277
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm sorry

278
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,190
for the sudden intrusion.

279
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,740
We did not pay our respects in advance;

280
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,070
please forgive us,

281
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,910
Mountain God.

282
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
Lyu Gengyun's flower spirit

283
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,580
is within you?

284
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,670
Yes.

285
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,550
You can sense it?

286
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,430
Of course.

287
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,910
When Jiang Li was pregnant,

288
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,740
I was by her side the whole time.

289
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,340
I watched the Flower Spirit grow little by little.

290
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,460
I see.

291
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,980
It's just that

292
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,580
while I was in seclusion cultivating later,

293
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,500
I knew that Jiang Li and the Great Crane had met with misfortune.

294
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,740
Lyu Gengyun also disappeared.

295
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,950
Later, I learned that his immortal root had been severed and its whereabouts remained unknown.

296
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,300
How is he now?

297
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,580
He

298
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,220
turned into flower dew

299
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,860
to save someone.

300
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,640
Now, only scattered peony petals letf.

301
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,500
We came to Shouyang Mountain this time

302
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,910
to see if there are any records

303
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,220
left by the Flower Goddess Jiang Li,

304
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,740
anything that might help save him.

305
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,580
Since you have Lyu Gengyun's flower spirit,

306
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,270
I'll trust you this once.

307
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,500
However,

308
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,950
you won't find any useful records

309
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,670
in the Leisure House.

310
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,270
All of Jiang's important manuscripts

311
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,740
are stored in the Fairy Cave.

312
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,550
But Jiang set up a barrier around the cave;

313
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,820
only those she acknowledges as fated can enter.

314
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,670
May I ask where this Fairy Cave is?

315
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,670
It's just east of the Leisure House.

316
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,150
Turn the corner,

317
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,700
and you'll see a stone gate.

318
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,100
Since you might be Jiang's daughter-in-law,

319
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,440
perhaps you can open it.

320
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,430
Thank you.

321
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,220
[Longque, a divine bird. As the chief of the Dongting Mountains, it spans 2800 li. Its divine form has the body of a bird and the head of a dragon.]

322
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,320
[Fairy Cave]

323
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,810
It

324
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,670
should be the place Longque mentioned.

325
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,740
Open sesame!

326
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,460
How are we supposed to get in?

327
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,310
There doesn't seem to be any kind of mechanism

328
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,550
or barrier.

329
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,770
Wait,

330
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,500
did she lie to us?

331
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,430
Maybe we should go back and ask Longque first.

332
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,030
Let's go back.

333
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,150
Little Sparrow…

334
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,150
How dare she tricked me?

335
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,130
Just wait.

336
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,060
Little Sparrow,

337
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,869
we went to the Fairy Cave.

338
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,060
There was no response at all.

339
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,220
Are you playing tricks on us?

340
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,589
Who are you calling "Little Sparrow?"

341
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,940
I'm Longque—

342
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,359
a phoenix!

343
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,020
Then if she can't break the seal on the Fairy Cave,

344
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,060
it just means she isn't that closely

345
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,110
connected to Lyu Gengyun.

346
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,310
Naturally, she's not that closely connected to Jiang either.

347
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,300
She...

348
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,500
Or maybe…

349
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,060
She has fate, but no destiny.

350
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,470
What are you doing?

351
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,210
Shut up!

352
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,300
Don't be sad.

353
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
I can't stand seeing others upset.

354
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,630
I'll take you to another place.

355
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,830
Where?

356
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,430
Right here.

357
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,830
The Great Crane gained his spiritual consciousness here.

358
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,590
Back then, he was just an ordinary celestial crane.

359
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,950
He was recovering from his injuries here

360
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,390
when he unexpectedly awakened his spiritual consciousness.

361
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,670
He said

362
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,780
it might be related to the murals in this chamber.

363
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,110
So,

364
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,390
I turned this cave into

365
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,440
a secret chamber.

366
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,260
There are so many caves in Shouyang Mountain.

367
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,560
That day, Master transformed into dew,

368
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,670
leaving behind only this withered branch.

369
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,830
This must be Little Gengyun.

370
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,060
Nice to meet you.

371
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,870
Hello, hello.

372
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,670
Be gentle.

373
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,670
Be gentle.

374
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,700
Why don't you plant it right here?

375
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,830
Perhaps,

376
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,400
it could help him regain his spiritual consciousness.

377
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,150
That's right.

378
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,700
Since Senior Bai Yu

379
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,020
was able to gain spiritual consciousness here,

380
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,460
Lyu Gengyun must be able to as well.

381
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,780
What you're saying makes sense.

382
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,350
Actually, I've always had a feeling that

383
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,430
Master will definitely come back to life.

384
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,780
So,

385
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,760
I can't give up any opportunity.

386
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,430
Then why are you giving up the chance to become an immortal?

387
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,390
Only by becoming one can you help him even more.

388
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,060
Actually,

389
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,220
I don't want to give up immortal cultivation.

390
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,740
I'm just afraid of

391
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,630
being bound by the strict Heavenly laws.

392
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,750
If that happens,

393
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,350
I won't have the time

394
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,700
or energy

395
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,110
to save him properly.

396
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,300
That won't happen.

397
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,310
Lyu Gengyun's severed immortal root

398
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,090
might still exist in the Immortal Realm.

399
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,220
If you become an immortal,

400
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,540
you might be able to retrieve it.

401
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,980
But when it comes to cultivation,

402
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,280
I just can't find the right method;

403
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,660
I always miss the key points.

404
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,060
That's not difficult.

405
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,150
This "Hundred Flowers Manual"

406
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,700
may seem like a book about flowers,

407
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,870
but in reality,

408
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,670
it contains all the cultivation techniques

409
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,150
that Jiang refined and compiled.

410
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,870
It's perfect for those who cultivate the path of flowers.

411
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,300
You can use it to practice.

412
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,390
This is the secret manual of Flower Goddess Jiang Li?

413
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,970
Little Sparrow,

414
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,630
you're quite generous.

415
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,850
That's right.

416
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,500
Jiang said this should be given to someone destined for it,

417
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,870
but after all these centuries,

418
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,630
no such person has appeared.

419
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,950
Since you are

420
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,070
the beloved of Jiang's son

421
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,660
Lyu Gengyun,

422
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,080
I'll lend it to you to take a look.

423
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,430
Thank you, Longque.

424
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,190
I will study it carefully.

But it's my first time using it,

and I haven't quite grasped the pattern yet.

00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,460
Some techniques were thoroughly studied

471
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,480
by Jiang and Great Crane back then.

Next time, I'll help you guide your breath.

475
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,220
are you guiding breath now?

476
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,670
Eat some.

477
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,020
Of course.

478
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,850
Ya Zi of Shouyang Mountain

479
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,540
was taught by me.

480
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,780
Ya Zi?

481
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,020
Longque,

482
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,260
you know Ya Zi?

483
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,250
Of course.

484
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,460
Back then, when I had just left seclusion,

485
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
there wasn't a single fun person on all of Shouyang Mountain—

486
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,950
until I met him.

487
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,950
We got along pretty well,

488
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,540
often drinking and eating together.

489
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
I knew

490
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,630
he resented Great Crane for killing his parents,

491
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,040
but I heard that

492
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,500
after his enemy died in a lovers' suicide,

493
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,700
his thirst for revenge gradually faded.

494
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,350
It's a pity, though.

495
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,150
Later, his personality changed dramatically.

496
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,590
What exactly did Ya Zi

497
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,780
go through?

498
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,870
I don't know.

499
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,590
I only remember that when the Blood Moon first appeared,

500
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,220
Ya Zi looked up at the Blood Moon,

501
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,430
and his demonic nature erupted.

502
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,190
After that, his thirst for revenge

503
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,490
reignited.

504
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,630
He became obsessed with cultivation

505
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,140
and even took over all of Shouyang Mountain.

506
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,950
He didn't even show me any respect.

507
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,590
You made that up, didn't you?

508
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,630
But you'd be quite good at storytelling.

509
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,350
What did I make up?

510
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,870
You've never read my storybook;

511
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,190
it's even more exaggerated.

512
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,500
Longque,

513
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,830
can I borrow your storybook?

514
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,070
Of course you can.

515
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:12,950
Here.

516
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,610
Take it.

517
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,540
Thank you.

518
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,060
When you're done reading, maybe you can give me some inspiration.

519
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
I think

520
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,040
your story with Lyu Gengyun

521
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,300
is very intriguing.

522
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,190
I also hope that

523
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,500
one day you will keep writing our story.

524
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,890
our story.

525
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,020
Where did you write about Ya Zi?

526
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,110
Master.

527
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Longque said

528
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,740
this water nourishes the entire Shouyang Mountain

529
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,880
and is filled with spiritual power.

530
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:56,900
You should drink more.

531
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,390
Master,

532
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,220
I've taken the pill now

533
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,350
and reached the Mystic Branch Stage,

534
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,430
but

535
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,170
my training lacks structure,

536
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,940
and my control over spiritual power is still unrefined.

537
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,970
I can't seem to form the exquisite blossom.

538
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,300
If only you were here—

539
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,510
you would surely be able to enlighten me.

540
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,970

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,590
I may never ascend to immortality,

552
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,870

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,830
you must continue your cultivation.

559
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,430
Turn your obsession

560
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
into inner mind;

561
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,780
that way, I can rest easy.

562
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,780
Master,

563
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,950
I'm doing very well every day.

564
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,740
I eat well

565
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,770
and sleep well.

566
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,260
Longque and Ye You

567
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,980
are bickering with each other every day.

568
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,060
By the way,

569
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,020
Longque even wrote your parents' story

570
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,150
into a storybook.

571
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,780
This is quite interesting, Master.

572
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,150
But how could I be at ease?

573
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,390
What Longque wrote

574
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,460
might not be the whole story.

575
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,590
What do you mean?

576
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,630
Longque said that

577
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,780
on the night of the Blood Moon,

578
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,460
Ya Zi's temperament changed drastically.

579
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,670
I suspect someone

580
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,430
used

581
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,420
a powerful mind technique

582
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,500
to control him.

583
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,110
Because on that day,

584
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,690
just before he died,

585
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,300
I discovered

586
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,620
a trace of inner demon in his body.

587
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,830
I can't believe this.

588
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,780
I originally thought Ya Zi

589
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,950
had personal grudges,

590
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,110
but from what Longque said,

591
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,500
this matter is likely

592
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,300
closely tied to Shouyang Mountain.

593
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,950
On the seventh day of the third lunar month that year,

594
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,740
my father suddenly went mad

595
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,710
and killed his parents.

596
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,870
That day, the sky looked as if it had been stained with blood.

597
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,830
I believe

598
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,350
an immortal must have descended upon Shouyang Mountain that day.

599
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,630
How many secrets are still hidden

600
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,810
within this mountain?

601
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
These secrets

602
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,260
will likely

603
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,260
need my little garderner

604
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,620
to unravel them one by one.

605
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Master.

606
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,830
Master.

607
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,110
Master!

608
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,320
So it was just a dream...

609
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,720
But why did it feel so real?

610
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,750
Blood Moon?

611
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,350
Inner demon.

612
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,740
The seventh day of the third month.
